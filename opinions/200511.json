Charlie      Webb   was\n\nconvicted by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm and\n\nsentenced to a term of 288 months.                 His appeal presents three\n\nissues relating to the district court’s discretionary questioning\n\nof the venire and instruction of the jury.                 Finding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion, we affirm.\n\n            Responding to a call about a disturbance at the Orchard\n\nPark   housing    project     in     Boston,    Officers   Lewis   and    McCarthy\n\nobserved a man and a woman, whom they later discovered were\n\nDefendant     Webb    and    Eugenia     Gillenwater,      standing      near   the\n\nintersection of Zeigler Street and Wheatly Way.                The couple seemed\n\nto be arguing, so Officer McCarthy turned the police vehicle around\n\nand stopped, pointing the headlights directly on Webb and Ms.\n\nGillenwater.\n\n            Officer McCarthy got out of the vehicle and walked toward\n\nDefendant.     As he neared, Officer McCarthy noticed Webb holding a\n\nlarge,   shiny,      silver-colored      metallic    object.       Continuing    to\n\napproach, McCarthy saw Webb look at him, turn towards Gillenwater,\n\nand drop the object into the front of her pants.               Although Officer\n\nLewis’ view was somewhat obscured, he also saw Webb turn to\n\nGillenwater and motion with both his hands toward her waist.\n\n             Even though the events occurred after dark, the scene was\n\nwell-lighted by an overhead street lamp as well as other ambient\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\flight from the complex.       Most of the illumination, however, was\n\nprovided by the headlights of the officers’ vehicle.\n\n            Officer     McCarthy    seized    Webb,     and   Officer    Lewis\n\napproached     Gillenwater and removed a loaded 9mm semi-automatic\n\npistol from her waistband.         Both were then placed under arrest.\n\n            At trial, Ms. Gillenwater, telling a more robust story,\n\ntestified she felt Webb place a heavy object in the front of her\n\npants after she noticed McCarthy heading toward her and Webb.                She\n\nalso stated that when she tried to warn Webb before the officers’\n\nvehicle stopped, he said, “f*** them polices.[sic]              If they come\n\nover here I’ll shoot them bitches.”\n\n             The defense vigorously cross-examined the officers over\n\na suggested discrepancy between their testimony and their written\n\nreport.    The officers testified the encounter was under the street\n\nlamp at 117 Zeigler, but the report stated it occurred in front of\n\n111 Zeigler.        Defendant suggested the change occurred when the\n\nofficers discovered the street lamp was at 117.               They explained,\n\nhowever, they took no contemporaneous notes at the scene, and\n\nOfficer McCarthy was unable to account for why he wrote 111 and not\n\n117.    The only testimony on Defendant’s behalf came from two women\n\nwhose     evident   purpose   was    to    impeach    the   veracity    of   Ms.\n\nGillenwater.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            I.   VOIR DIRE ON ATTITUDES TOWARD BLACKS\n\n          Defendant argues the district court refused to ask the\n\nvenire a question about possible bias.   Counsel requested that the\n\ncourt inquire:\n\n          The defendant in this case is black/African\n          American.\n\n          Does the fact that he is black make you think\n          it is more likely that he is guilty of the\n          crime he is charged with here today?\n\nThe court declined, relying instead upon less specific questions\n\ncrafted to solicit responses indicating wider potential bias.   For\n\nexample, the court asked,\n\n          Are any of you sensible of any bias or\n          prejudice whatsoever with respect to the case\n          to be tried? Do any of you know any reason why\n          you do not stand indifferent to this case?\n\n          Do any of you know any reason why you ought not\n          be called to sit as jurors in this case?\n\n          Although the court directed all the parties to stand at\n\nthe outset of voir dire and the prospective jurors were aware\n\nDefendant is black, he contends these measures were insufficient.\n\nBecause two of the three government witnesses were white, counsel\n\nargues the court’s refusal to ask the specific question about racial\n\nbias resulted in Defendant’s inability to determine whether racial\n\nprejudice would affect the jury.   Thus, Defendant was left without\n\nan adequate basis upon which to exercise his peremptories and\n\nchallenges for cause.\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f          Defendant    first    relies    upon   Rosales-Lopez   v.   United\n\nStates, 451 U.S. 182, 190-91 (1981), in which the Court instructed,\n\n          In the federal court system, we have indicated\n          that under our supervisory authority over the\n          federal courts, we would require questions\n          directed to the discovery of racial prejudice\n          be asked in certain circumstances in which such\n          an inquiry is not constitutionally mandated.\n\n(citation omitted).    He cites other cases relating to the proper\n\nrole of voir dire in removing prospective jurors who will not be\n\nable to be impartial and the necessity to uncover biases that would\n\njustify their exclusion.       He adds, in this case, questioning about\n\nracial bias was necessary to accomplish the task. Indeed, there was\n\na potential for white against black bias in Gillenwater’s testimony\n\nindicating “a threat of violent conduct by a black man directed\n\nagainst white police officers.”\n\n          The government responds the court did not err because its\n\n“inquiry probed potential racial and other prejudice in a manner at\n\nleast as likely to reveal such bias or prejudice as would the\n\nquestion about race that Webb had requested to be asked at voir\n\ndire.”   The prosecution maintains that the venire, which had been\n\nintroduced to Webb at the outset, could see he is black.          Thus, the\n\ngovernment   urges,   the   court’s   questions    about   any   prejudice,\n\n“coupled with its instruction that members of the venire should\n\nanswer in the affirmative even if they ‘may’ or ‘might’ harbor such\n\nprejudice, were more than sufficient to probe the racial animus of\n\npotential jurors,” citing United States v. Brown, 938 F.2d 1482,\n\n                                    -5-\n\f1485-86 (1st Cir. 1991)(the mere fact a defendant is black does not\n\ntrigger a need for a special question).             The court’s repeated\n\ngeneral questions about possible bias and its instruction to respond\n\nif there was a possibility of bias in a potential juror’s mind were\n\nsufficient, the government argues.          After all, it notes, as the\n\nCourt observed in Rosales-Lopez, there is “little reason to believe”\n\na potential juror who did not respond to a general question on\n\npossible bias “would have answered affirmatively a question directed\n\nnarrowly at racial prejudice.”       451 U.S. at 193 n.8.\n\n            This issue must be judged under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard in which trial courts are given wide latitude.           Brown, 938\n\nF.2d at 1485. “The trial judge’s function at this point in the trial\n\nis . . . to reach conclusions as to impartiality and credibility by\n\nrelying on their own evaluations of demeanor, evidence and responses\n\nto questions.”     Rosales-Lopez, 451 U.S. at 188 (citations omitted).\n\nTherefore, a reviewing court, in recognition of this role, confers\n\ngreat   latitude    upon   the   trial    judge’s   choice   of   questions.\n\nMoreover,\n\n            “[a]buse of discretion” is a phrase which\n            sounds worse than it really is. All it need\n            mean is that, when judicial action is taken in\n            a discretionary matter, such action cannot be\n            set aside by a reviewing court unless it has a\n            definite and firm conviction that the court\n            below committed a clear error of judgment in\n            the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of\n            the relevant factors.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fSchubert      v.   Nissan   Motor   Corp,      148    F.3d    25,    30    (1st   Cir.\n\n1998)(quoting In re Josephson, 218 F.2d 174, 182 (1st Cir. 1954)).\n\nJudged in this light, we are hard pressed to find any abuse of\n\ndiscretion here.      As the Supreme Court has instructed:\n\n              In our judgment, it is usually best to allow\n              the defendant to resolve this conflict by\n              making the determination of whether or not he\n              would prefer to have the inquiry into racial\n              or ethnic prejudice pursued. Failure to honor\n              his request, however, will be reversible error\n              only where the circumstances of the case\n              indicate   that   there    is   a   reasonable\n              possibility that racial or ethnic prejudice\n              might have influenced the jury.\n\nRosales-Lopez, 451 U.S. at 191 (footnote omitted).\n\n              Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of Mr. Webb’s\n\nconcern.       Doubtless, it was the district court’s motivation to\n\nprotect Defendant against possible racial contamination of the\n\njury’s      deliberations   by   suggestion.          Yet    it   was,    after    all,\n\nDefendant’s obvious choice.          He must have assumed the potential\n\nreward was worth the risk his question posed.                       The inquiry he\n\noffered was appropriate and without an inflammatory purpose.                       Even\n\nthough it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to ask that\n\nquestion, the court could have asked it without harm.                      Brown, 938\n\nF.2d   at    1485.    “[T]he     wiser    course     generally      is    to   propound\n\nappropriate questions designed to identify racial prejudice if\n\nrequested by the defendant.”             Id. (quoting Ristaino v. Ross, 424\n\nU.S. 589, 597 n.9 (1976)).\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f                   II.   VOIR DIRE ON OFFICER CREDIBILITY\n\n             Defendant postulates the district court erred by not\n\nasking the venire this question:\n\n             Police   officers   will  be  testifying   as\n             witnesses in this case.   People who are not\n             police officers will also be testifying in\n             this case.     Would you be more likely to\n             believe the testimony of a police officer\n             simply because he or she is a police officer?\n\nDefendant relies upon United States v. Victoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d 77\n\n(1st Cir. 1990), to support his argument that the First Circuit,\n\nlike others, holds it is error for the trial judge to refuse to\n\nquestion the venire about whether it would give extra credence to\n\nlaw enforcement witnesses.         To make the determination of whether the\n\nfailure to inquire is reversible error, Defendant adds that courts\n\nconsider: (1) the importance of the law enforcement                    officer’s\n\ntestimony to the case as a whole; (2) the extent to which a venire\n\nperson’s     attitude    toward    law   enforcement    is   covered   in   other\n\nquestions on voir dire and the general charge; (3) the extent to\n\nwhich the officer’s credibility is put to issue; and (4) the extent\n\nto   which   the    officer   is    corroborated   by    other   non-officer’s\n\ntestimony.    In support, he cites United States v. Anagnos, 853 F.2d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1988)(citing United States v. Baldwin, 607 F.2d 1295,\n\n1297-98 (9th Cir. 1979)).\n\n             Defendant contends the testimony of the arresting officers\n\nwas critical; indeed, he points out, the government argued to the\n\njury it could convict on that testimony alone.           Defendant asserts he\n\n                                         -8-\n\fvigorously sought to impeach the officers.             Specifically, he urges,\n\nhe   questioned   Officer    McCarthy’s      ability    to   see   an   object   in\n\nDefendant’s hands which he claimed ended up in Ms. Gillenwater’s\n\nclothing.   Defendant further focused his credibility attack on the\n\nchange in the address recorded from 111, where there was no street\n\nlamp, to 117 Zeigler Street, where there was a street light.\n\nDefendant exacuates the importance of Officer McCarthy’s testimony\n\nby reminding that jurors sent a note asking whether the couple was\n\nactually located under the lamppost.           Hence, he argues, “the court\n\ndid not specifically instruct the jury to treat the testimony of\n\npolice officers in the same way they would treat the testimony of\n\nany other witness, nor did it caution them not to give extra\n\ncredence to their testimony. Indeed, the court’s final instructions\n\ndid not single out the testimony of the police officers for any\n\nspecial mention at all.”\n\n            The government responds the district court determined\n\nwhether any venire person had any connection with law enforcement.\n\nFor those who did, the court examined them at side-bar about their\n\npotential for bias.         The government argues at least five circuit\n\ncourts have determined that this process sufficiently ferrets out\n\npro-law enforcement bias.           Moreover, this approach comports with\n\nthis   court’s    holding    that    when    law   enforcement     testimony     is\n\nimportant to the government’s case, the district court “should\n\nordinarily inquire into whether prospective jurors are more likely\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fto credit [police officers’] testimony.”       United States      v. Pappas,\n\n639 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n            The government adds whether the failure to ask specific\n\nquestions is reversible error depends in part upon the extent to\n\nwhich the credibility of the government agent’s testimony is put\n\ninto issue.    Id. at 5.    Here, the discrepancy between the officers’\n\ntestimony     and   the   written   report   was   irrelevant.       It   was\n\nunquestioned that the encounter took place at the intersections of\n\nZeigler and Wheatly Way; but, more importantly, all agreed that the\n\nlights from the police vehicle were shining directly on Defendant\n\nand Ms. Gillenwater as the officers emerged.          Thus, the attempted\n\nimpeachment was based upon an insignificant discrepancy — whether\n\nthe parties were under the street light did not affect whether the\n\nofficers could observe Mr. Webb.       Finally, we are reminded, in its\n\ngeneral charge, the court instructed the jury to treat all witnesses\n\nalike.\n\n            The government’s position is well taken.             Once again,\n\njudging this issue under the abuse of discretion standard, we find\n\nno abuse.     Although the officers’ testimony was important, it was\n\ncorroborated by Ms. Gillenwater.       Moreover, the attempt to impeach\n\nthem fell short of a critical evidentiary issue.       Judged in light of\n\nthe entire record, the variance between the address stated in the\n\ntestimony and that included in the written report did not suggest\n\nthe officers were not credible.       Finally, the jury was told in the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fgeneral charge that the testimony of one witness was not entitled to\n\ngreater credibility than that of any other.\n\n             The lack of abuse of discretion notwithstanding, we remain\n\ncurious why the court did not eliminate the issue at the outset.\n\nThe   court’s    method   of     probing    the   issue    was   certainly   more\n\ncomplicated than simply asking the question proposed by the defense.\n\nTrue enough, the court was able to discover persons who might have\n\nharbored police bias.          After that discovery, the court pursued\n\nquestioning     which   probed    the   essence    of     disclosures   Defendant\n\nsought. The court’s general charge was also sufficient to emphasize\n\nthe jury could not give the officers more credibility than it gave\n\nto the remaining witnesses.         But, any doubt and an appellate issue\n\ncould have been eliminated by simply asking the question the defense\n\nsolicited.      A salutary result could also have been achieved.\n\n             By asking the question, Defendant’s major concern could\n\nhave been alleviated.      He posits that a potential juror might have\n\nbeen reared to respect police authority.            If so, that person might\n\nbelieve because of their position, officers are entitled to greater\n\ncredibility than others.         If the proposed question had been asked,\n\nDefendant maintains, such a person could have been alerted to\n\nexplore   his     conscience     for    a   previously      unrecognized     bias.\n\nUnfortunately, this sort of self-examination was not suggested by\n\nany of the questions posed by the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f       III.     INSTRUCTION ON DEFENDANT’S RIGHT NOT TO TESTIFY\n\n              Relying upon Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288 (1981),\n\nDefendant argues the district court erred by not instructing the\n\njury it should draw “no adverse inferences” against him because he\n\ndid not testify.      He declares counsel “requested that the jury be\n\ncharged   regarding    the   defendant’s    constitutional       right   not   to\n\ntestify.”     Admitting counsel did not use the language “no adverse\n\ninference”     in   her   request   for     the    instruction,     Defendant,\n\nnonetheless, insists he “adequately invoked his substantive right to\n\njury guidance.”\n\n              The government puts it another way: “Webb never requested\n\nthe   ‘adverse      inference’   language     at    trial   in     any   form.”\n\nFurthermore, even if the court’s failure to grant the instruction\n\nDefendant desired was error, “the error was not plain, as it is\n\nreflected in the fact that defense counsel was unable to articulate\n\nthe problem with the instructions when the court had completed\n\ngiving them.”\n\n              In varying ways, the court instructed several times that\n\nDefendant had no duty to take the stand and did not have to testify.\n\nFor example, part of the charge was:\n\n              Mr. Webb started this case innocent . . .\n\n              He has no obligation to explain anything or\n              say anything or do anything.   He doesn’t have\n              to take the stand.       He doesn’t have to\n              testify.   And you cannot hold against him\n              anything that wasn’t done.    That would turn\n              the whole process on its head. The government\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           made this charge.    The government’s got to\n           prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                                * * *\n\n           First of all, there’s that great principle,\n           and it is a great principle, that Mr. Webb\n           started out the trial innocent. Just remember\n           he didn’t have to do a single thing in this\n           case. He can’t be brought in here and made to\n           explain things he doesn’t have to . . . . you\n           cannot ever hold it against him that he’s here\n           in court.\n\n           The government argues although the court did not use the\n\nspecific words, “no adverse inference,” the charge contained their\n\n“functional equivalent.” More importantly, Defendant did not object\n\nto the instructions as given, nor did counsel request a specific\n\ninstruction, suggesting only: “I think it’s appropriate that the\n\njury be instructed it’s the defendant’s right not to testify.”\n\n           We believe this issue is foreclosed to Defendant by Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30.   Defendant’s failure to object to the instructions\n\ngiven, stating “distinctly the matter to which that party objects\n\nand the grounds of the objection,” precludes the assignment of\n\nerror. United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 447-48 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Were this not so, we would still be constrained to conclude\n\nthe failure to respond directly to Defendant’s request was not\n\nerroneous because the instructions as a whole certainly informed the\n\njury of Defendant’s right not to testify and that no inferences\n\ncould be drawn by the jury from his not doing so.   United States v.\n\nWoodward, 149 F.3d 46, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1999).   Moreover, in light of\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe   overwhelming   evidence   of   guilt,   Mr.   Webb   cannot   show   the\n\ninstructions given “seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of the judicial proceedings.”            United States v.\n\nBrand, 80 F.3d 560, 567 (1st Cir. 1996)(quoting United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993)).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f",

Charlie      Webb   was\n\nconvicted by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm and\n\nsentenced to a term of 288 months.                 His appeal presents three\n\nissues relating to the district court’s discretionary questioning\n\nof the venire and instruction of the jury.                 Finding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion, we affirm.\n\n            Responding to a call about a disturbance at the Orchard\n\nPark   housing    project     in     Boston,    Officers   Lewis   and    McCarthy\n\nobserved a man and a woman, whom they later discovered were\n\nDefendant     Webb    and    Eugenia     Gillenwater,      standing      near   the\n\nintersection of Zeigler Street and Wheatly Way.                The couple seemed\n\nto be arguing, so Officer McCarthy turned the police vehicle around\n\nand stopped, pointing the headlights directly on Webb and Ms.\n\nGillenwater.\n\n            Officer McCarthy got out of the vehicle and walked toward\n\nDefendant.     As he neared, Officer McCarthy noticed Webb holding a\n\nlarge,   shiny,      silver-colored      metallic    object.       Continuing    to\n\napproach, McCarthy saw Webb look at him, turn towards Gillenwater,\n\nand drop the object into the front of her pants.               Although Officer\n\nLewis’ view was somewhat obscured, he also saw Webb turn to\n\nGillenwater and motion with both his hands toward her waist.\n\n             Even though the events occurred after dark, the scene was\n\nwell-lighted by an overhead street lamp as well as other ambient\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\flight from the complex.       Most of the illumination, however, was\n\nprovided by the headlights of the officers’ vehicle.\n\n            Officer     McCarthy    seized    Webb,     and   Officer    Lewis\n\napproached     Gillenwater and removed a loaded 9mm semi-automatic\n\npistol from her waistband.         Both were then placed under arrest.\n\n            At trial, Ms. Gillenwater, telling a more robust story,\n\ntestified she felt Webb place a heavy object in the front of her\n\npants after she noticed McCarthy heading toward her and Webb.                She\n\nalso stated that when she tried to warn Webb before the officers’\n\nvehicle stopped, he said, “f*** them polices.[sic]              If they come\n\nover here I’ll shoot them bitches.”\n\n             The defense vigorously cross-examined the officers over\n\na suggested discrepancy between their testimony and their written\n\nreport.    The officers testified the encounter was under the street\n\nlamp at 117 Zeigler, but the report stated it occurred in front of\n\n111 Zeigler.        Defendant suggested the change occurred when the\n\nofficers discovered the street lamp was at 117.               They explained,\n\nhowever, they took no contemporaneous notes at the scene, and\n\nOfficer McCarthy was unable to account for why he wrote 111 and not\n\n117.    The only testimony on Defendant’s behalf came from two women\n\nwhose     evident   purpose   was    to    impeach    the   veracity    of   Ms.\n\nGillenwater.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            I.   VOIR DIRE ON ATTITUDES TOWARD BLACKS\n\n          Defendant argues the district court refused to ask the\n\nvenire a question about possible bias.   Counsel requested that the\n\ncourt inquire:\n\n          The defendant in this case is black/African\n          American.\n\n          Does the fact that he is black make you think\n          it is more likely that he is guilty of the\n          crime he is charged with here today?\n\nThe court declined, relying instead upon less specific questions\n\ncrafted to solicit responses indicating wider potential bias.   For\n\nexample, the court asked,\n\n          Are any of you sensible of any bias or\n          prejudice whatsoever with respect to the case\n          to be tried? Do any of you know any reason why\n          you do not stand indifferent to this case?\n\n          Do any of you know any reason why you ought not\n          be called to sit as jurors in this case?\n\n          Although the court directed all the parties to stand at\n\nthe outset of voir dire and the prospective jurors were aware\n\nDefendant is black, he contends these measures were insufficient.\n\nBecause two of the three government witnesses were white, counsel\n\nargues the court’s refusal to ask the specific question about racial\n\nbias resulted in Defendant’s inability to determine whether racial\n\nprejudice would affect the jury.   Thus, Defendant was left without\n\nan adequate basis upon which to exercise his peremptories and\n\nchallenges for cause.\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f          Defendant    first    relies    upon   Rosales-Lopez   v.

He cites other cases relating to the proper\n\nrole of voir dire in removing prospective jurors who will not be\n\nable to be impartial and the necessity to uncover biases that would\n\njustify their exclusion.       He adds, in this case, questioning about\n\nracial bias was necessary to accomplish the task. Indeed, there was\n\na potential for white against black bias in Gillenwater’s testimony\n\nindicating “a threat of violent conduct by a black man directed\n\nagainst white police officers.”\n\n          The government responds the court did not err because its\n\n“inquiry probed potential racial and other prejudice in a manner at\n\nleast as likely to reveal such bias or prejudice as would the\n\nquestion about race that Webb had requested to be asked at voir\n\ndire.”   The prosecution maintains that the venire, which had been\n\nintroduced to Webb at the outset, could see he is black.          Thus, the\n\ngovernment   urges,   the   court’s   questions    about   any   prejudice,\n\n“coupled with its instruction that members of the venire should\n\nanswer in the affirmative even if they ‘may’ or ‘might’ harbor such\n\nprejudice, were more than sufficient to probe the racial animus of\n\npotential jurors,” citing United States v.

The court’s repeated\n\ngeneral questions about possible bias and its instruction to respond\n\nif there was a possibility of bias in a potential juror’s mind were\n\nsufficient, the government argues.          After all, it notes, as the\n\nCourt observed in Rosales-Lopez, there is “little reason to believe”\n\na potential juror who did not respond to a general question on\n\npossible bias “would have answered affirmatively a question directed\n\nnarrowly at racial prejudice.”       451 U.S. at 193 n.8.\n\n            This issue must be judged under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard in which trial courts are given wide latitude.           Brown, 938\n\nF.2d at 1485. “The trial judge’s function at this point in the trial\n\nis . . . to reach conclusions as to impartiality and credibility by\n\nrelying on their own evaluations of demeanor, evidence and responses\n\nto questions.”     Rosales-Lopez, 451 U.S. at 188 (citations omitted).\n\nTherefore, a reviewing court, in recognition of this role, confers\n\ngreat   latitude    upon   the   trial    judge’s   choice   of   questions.\n\nMoreover,\n\n            “[a]buse of discretion” is a phrase which\n            sounds worse than it really is. All it need\n            mean is that, when judicial action is taken in\n            a discretionary matter, such action cannot be\n            set aside by a reviewing court unless it has a\n            definite and firm conviction that the court\n            below committed a clear error of judgment in\n            the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of\n            the relevant factors.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fSchubert      v.

As the Supreme Court has instructed:\n\n              In our judgment, it is usually best to allow\n              the defendant to resolve this conflict by\n              making the determination of whether or not he\n              would prefer to have the inquiry into racial\n              or ethnic prejudice pursued. Failure to honor\n              his request, however, will be reversible error\n              only where the circumstances of the case\n              indicate   that   there    is   a   reasonable\n              possibility that racial or ethnic prejudice\n              might have influenced the jury.\n\nRosales-Lopez, 451 U.S. at 191 (footnote omitted).\n\n              Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of Mr. Webb’s\n\nconcern.       Doubtless, it was the district court’s motivation to\n\nprotect Defendant against possible racial contamination of the\n\njury’s      deliberations   by   suggestion.          Yet    it   was,    after    all,\n\nDefendant’s obvious choice.          He must have assumed the potential\n\nreward was worth the risk his question posed.                       The inquiry he\n\noffered was appropriate and without an inflammatory purpose.                       Even\n\nthough it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to ask that\n\nquestion, the court could have asked it without harm.

To make the determination of whether the\n\nfailure to inquire is reversible error, Defendant adds that courts\n\nconsider: (1) the importance of the law enforcement                    officer’s\n\ntestimony to the case as a whole; (2) the extent to which a venire\n\nperson’s     attitude    toward    law   enforcement    is   covered   in   other\n\nquestions on voir dire and the general charge; (3) the extent to\n\nwhich the officer’s credibility is put to issue; and (4) the extent\n\nto   which   the    officer   is    corroborated   by    other   non-officer’s\n\ntestimony.    In support, he cites United States v.

Defendant asserts he\n\n                                         -8-\n\fvigorously sought to impeach the officers.             Specifically, he urges,\n\nhe   questioned   Officer    McCarthy’s      ability    to   see   an   object   in\n\nDefendant’s hands which he claimed ended up in Ms. Gillenwater’s\n\nclothing.   Defendant further focused his credibility attack on the\n\nchange in the address recorded from 111, where there was no street\n\nlamp, to 117 Zeigler Street, where there was a street light.\n\nDefendant exacuates the importance of Officer McCarthy’s testimony\n\nby reminding that jurors sent a note asking whether the couple was\n\nactually located under the lamppost.           Hence, he argues, “the court\n\ndid not specifically instruct the jury to treat the testimony of\n\npolice officers in the same way they would treat the testimony of\n\nany other witness, nor did it caution them not to give extra\n\ncredence to their testimony. Indeed, the court’s final instructions\n\ndid not single out the testimony of the police officers for any\n\nspecial mention at all.”\n\n            The government responds the district court determined\n\nwhether any venire person had any connection with law enforcement.\n\nFor those who did, the court examined them at side-bar about their\n\npotential for bias.         The government argues at least five circuit\n\ncourts have determined that this process sufficiently ferrets out\n\npro-law enforcement bias.           Moreover, this approach comports with\n\nthis   court’s    holding    that    when    law   enforcement     testimony     is\n\nimportant to the government’s case, the district court “should\n\nordinarily inquire into whether prospective jurors are more likely\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fto credit [police officers’] testimony.”       United States      v. Pappas,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n            The government adds whether the failure to ask specific\n\nquestions is reversible error depends in part upon the extent to\n\nwhich the credibility of the government agent’s testimony is put\n\ninto issue.    Id. at 5.    Here, the discrepancy between the officers’\n\ntestimony     and   the   written   report   was   irrelevant.       It   was\n\nunquestioned that the encounter took place at the intersections of\n\nZeigler and Wheatly Way; but, more importantly, all agreed that the\n\nlights from the police vehicle were shining directly on Defendant\n\nand Ms. Gillenwater as the officers emerged.          Thus, the attempted\n\nimpeachment was based upon an insignificant discrepancy — whether\n\nthe parties were under the street light did not affect whether the\n\nofficers could observe Mr. Webb.       Finally, we are reminded, in its\n\ngeneral charge, the court instructed the jury to treat all witnesses\n\nalike.\n\n            The government’s position is well taken.             Once again,\n\njudging this issue under the abuse of discretion standard, we find\n\nno abuse.     Although the officers’ testimony was important, it was\n\ncorroborated by Ms. Gillenwater.       Moreover, the attempt to impeach\n\nthem fell short of a critical evidentiary issue.       Judged in light of\n\nthe entire record, the variance between the address stated in the\n\ntestimony and that included in the written report did not suggest\n\nthe officers were not credible.       Finally, the jury was told in the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fgeneral charge that the testimony of one witness was not entitled to\n\ngreater credibility than that of any other.\n\n             The lack of abuse of discretion notwithstanding, we remain\n\ncurious why the court did not eliminate the issue at the outset.\n\nThe   court’s    method   of     probing    the   issue    was   certainly   more\n\ncomplicated than simply asking the question proposed by the defense.\n\nTrue enough, the court was able to discover persons who might have\n\nharbored police bias.          After that discovery, the court pursued\n\nquestioning     which   probed    the   essence    of     disclosures   Defendant\n\nsought. The court’s general charge was also sufficient to emphasize\n\nthe jury could not give the officers more credibility than it gave\n\nto the remaining witnesses.         But, any doubt and an appellate issue\n\ncould have been eliminated by simply asking the question the defense\n\nsolicited.      A salutary result could also have been achieved.\n\n             By asking the question, Defendant’s major concern could\n\nhave been alleviated.      He posits that a potential juror might have\n\nbeen reared to respect police authority.            If so, that person might\n\nbelieve because of their position, officers are entitled to greater\n\ncredibility than others.         If the proposed question had been asked,\n\nDefendant maintains, such a person could have been alerted to\n\nexplore   his     conscience     for    a   previously      unrecognized     bias.\n\nUnfortunately, this sort of self-examination was not suggested by\n\nany of the questions posed by the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f       III.     INSTRUCTION ON DEFENDANT’S RIGHT NOT TO TESTIFY\n\n              Relying upon Carter v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110426\"><a href=\"/opinion/110426/carter-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981),\n\nDefendant argues the district court erred by not instructing the\n\njury it should draw “no adverse inferences” against him because he\n\ndid not testify.      He declares counsel “requested that the jury be\n\ncharged   regarding    the   defendant’s    constitutional       right   not   to\n\ntestify.”     Admitting counsel did not use the language “no adverse\n\ninference”     in   her   request   for     the    instruction,     Defendant,\n\nnonetheless, insists he “adequately invoked his substantive right to\n\njury guidance.”\n\n              The government puts it another way: “Webb never requested\n\nthe   ‘adverse      inference’   language     at    trial   in     any   form.”\n\nFurthermore, even if the court’s failure to grant the instruction\n\nDefendant desired was error, “the error was not plain, as it is\n\nreflected in the fact that defense counsel was unable to articulate\n\nthe problem with the instructions when the court had completed\n\ngiving them.”\n\n              In varying ways, the court instructed several times that\n\nDefendant had no duty to take the stand and did not have to testify.\n\nFor example, part of the charge was:\n\n              Mr. Webb started this case innocent . . .\n\n              He has no obligation to explain anything or\n              say anything or do anything.   He doesn’t have\n              to take the stand.       He doesn’t have to\n              testify.   And you cannot hold against him\n              anything that wasn’t done.    That would turn\n              the whole process on its head. The government\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           made this charge.    The government’s got to\n           prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                                * * *\n\n           First of all, there’s that great principle,\n           and it is a great principle, that Mr. Webb\n           started out the trial innocent. Just remember\n           he didn’t have to do a single thing in this\n           case. He can’t be brought in here and made to\n           explain things he doesn’t have to . . . . you\n           cannot ever hold it against him that he’s here\n           in court.\n\n           The government argues although the court did not use the\n\nspecific words, “no adverse inference,” the charge contained their\n\n“functional equivalent.” More importantly, Defendant did not object\n\nto the instructions as given, nor did counsel request a specific\n\ninstruction, suggesting only: “I think it’s appropriate that the\n\njury be instructed it’s the defendant’s right not to testify.”\n\n           We believe this issue is foreclosed to Defendant by Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 30.   Defendant’s failure to object to the instructions\n\ngiven, stating “distinctly the matter to which that party objects\n\nand the grounds of the objection,” precludes the assignment of\n\nerror. United States v. Arthurs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196518\"><a href=\"/opinion/196518/united-states-v-arthurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447-48 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   Were this not so, we would still be constrained to conclude\n\nthe failure to respond directly to Defendant’s request was not\n\nerroneous because the instructions as a whole certainly informed the\n\njury of Defendant’s right not to testify and that no inferences\n\ncould be drawn by the jury from his not doing so.
