KERSEY,\n\n                          Petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n          [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    George E. Kersey on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                         July 29, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam.   Attorney George E. Kersey appeals from\n\na district court order suspending him from the practice of law\n\nfor three months and requiring that he purge himself of an out-\n\nof-state contempt citation before seeking reinstatement.     The\n\ndistrict court's sanction, coming in a reciprocal-discipline\n\ncase in New Hampshire, mirrors that imposed first by the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), see In re Kersey,\n\n432 Mass. 1020 (2000) (rescript), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1127\n\n(2001), and more recently by several other tribunals including\n\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court, see In re Kersey, No. LD-2001-\n\n006 (2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1206 (2002); cf. In re\n\nKersey, 797 A.2d 864 (N.H. 2002). We review a district court's\n\nchoice of sanction for abuse of discretion.     See, e.g., In re\n\nCordova-Gonzalez, 996 F.2d 1334, 1335 (1st Cir. 1993) (per\n\ncuriam).   None being apparent, we affirm.\n\n           Kersey's principal assignment of error consists of an\n\nassault upon the SJC's decision.     He acknowledges both that he\n\nviolated a 1993 order of the Vermont Family Court and that he\n\nnever purged himself of the ensuing contempt citation.     Yet he\n\ncontends (without supporting documentation) that he had fully\n\ncomplied with that order within a year of its issuance.      For\n\nthis reason, Kersey asserts that the most appropriate sanction\n\nwas not a three-month suspension, as the SJC determined, but\n\nrather a reprimand.   As he notes, two other courts have deemed\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fthe    latter    sanction   to    be    suitable    punishment      for   his\n\nmisconduct.       See In re Kersey, 170 N.J. 409 (2002); In re\n\nKersey, 729 N.Y.S.2d 780, 783 (N.Y. App. Div. 2001) (per\n\ncuriam).        Yet as a matter of Massachusetts law, Kersey's\n\nargument overlooks the SJC's conclusion that \"the appropriate\n\ndiscipline for <knowing violations of court orders, violations\n\nwhich caused injury to a party to the litigation or interfered\n\nwith a legal proceeding, is a suspension.'\"            In re Kersey, 432\n\nMass. at 1020-21 (quoting In re Ring, 427 Mass. 186, 192\n\n(1998)).        Even on the arguendo assumption that Kersey did\n\nultimately satisfy the Vermont order, therefore, the SJC's\n\nsanction was fully supportable.              His related complaint--that\n\nfollowing the SJC's approach would entail a grave injustice or\n\nwould     be     grossly    disproportionate--thus          falls     short.\n\nAccordingly, the district court was justified in concluding\n\nthat the four exceptions enumerated in its Disciplinary Rule\n\n3(d), as appearing in that court's Local Rule 83.5, were\n\ninapplicable.\n\n               Kersey's remaining arguments require scant comment.\n\nHe    invokes    the   doctrine    of   laches,    noting   that    the   New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court allegedly learned of the contempt\n\ncitation in 1994 but waited until 2001 to initiate disciplinary\n\nproceedings.       It was the SJC's 2000 decision, however, that\n\ntriggered that process.          Nor is there any indication that the\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdistrict court knew of Kersey's status until the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court acted.      Kersey also points to a model rule\n\ndeclaring   that   reinstatement   should   be   automatic   for   any\n\nsuspension of six months or less.           That rule, however, is\n\nwithout binding effect here.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
