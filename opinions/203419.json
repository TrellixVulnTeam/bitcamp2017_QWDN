S. Attorney, and Mariana E. Bauzá-Almonte,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             August 4, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.     On remand from this court for resentencing\n\nunder United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), see United\n\nStates v. Díaz-Correa, No. 04-2187, 186 F. App'x 12 (1st Cir. June\n\n28, 2006) (per curiam) (unpublished), defendant Jesús Manuel Díaz-\n\nCorrea (\"Díaz\") was resentenced to the same sentence previously\n\nimposed, 57 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised\n\nrelease.    This is Díaz's appeal from that sentence.\n\n            Díaz   raises   the   following   issues:     (1)    whether     the\n\ndistrict court erred in imposing an enhancement for \"theft from the\n\nperson of another\" under USSG § 2B1.1.(b)(3) where the offense\n\nconduct--identity theft--involved no physical taking of property;\n\n(2)   whether   the   district    court   erred   in   failing   to   make    an\n\nindividualized determination of the loss amount and the number of\n\nvictims for which Díaz was accountable for sentencing purposes; (3)\n\nwhether the district court erred in imposing an enhancement for\n\n\"sophisticated means\" under USSG § 2B1.1(b)(8)(c); and (4) whether\n\nthe sentence imposed was unreasonable under Gall v. United States,\n\n128 S. Ct. 586 (2007).        We will consider each of them in that\n\norder.\n\n1.    Enhancement for \"theft from the person of another.\"\n\n            This issue raises two threshold questions:           (a) Whether\n\nappellate consideration of this issue is barred by the law-of-the-\n\ncase doctrine since it was not raised in Díaz's first appeal, see\n\nUnited States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1999); and\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\f(b) if not, whether appellate correction of this alleged error is\n\nnevertheless      barred   by   Díaz's    failure    to     raise   it    at    his\n\nresentencing, United States v. Mangone, 105 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   Both of these potential bars to appellate review have\n\nexceptions where the alleged error is sufficiently blatant and\n\nprejudicial.      United States v. Vigneau, 337 F.3d 62, 67-68 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (stating exceptions to law-of-the-case doctrine); United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993) (stating standards for\n\nappellate correction of forfeited error).            First we will consider\n\nthe plainness of the error and then whether it was sufficiently\n\nprejudicial to warrant appellate review despite Díaz's double\n\nforfeiture.\n\n             At   his   original    sentencing,      Díaz    argued      that     no\n\nenhancement for \"theft from the person of another\" should be\n\nimposed because the relevant conduct--electronically recording\n\naccount information from credit cards without the card holders'\n\nknowledge--did not involve a physical taking \"'of property that was\n\nbeing held by another person or was within arms' reach.'\"                       The\n\ndistrict court rejected that argument, finding that the offense\n\nconduct amounted to \"theft\" of a credit card within the meaning of\n\nUSSG § 2B1.1(b)(3). That conclusion was error, as clarified by our\n\nsubsequent decision in United States v. Pizarro-Berríos, 448 F.3d\n\n1,   10-11   (1st   Cir.   2006).        In   that   case,    involving        other\n\nparticipants in the same scheme at issue here, we held that \"the\n\n\n                                    - 3 -\n\fguideline is intended to apply to physical takings, not to abstract\n\nforms of theft that take place far from the victim, like credit\n\ncard fraud.\"         Id. at 11.      At least after Pizzaro-Berríos, that\n\nerror is sufficiently plain to satisfy the first two prongs of the\n\nOlano plain-error standard.\n\n            Where correction of such a guidelines calculation error\n\nwould   lead    to      a   lower   sentence,    remand     for   resentencing   is\n\nordinarily warranted under the third and fourth prongs of that\n\nstandard.      United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 81 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).       Here, correction of the error would reduce Díaz's\n\noffense level by two levels and reduce his guidelines sentencing\n\nrange from 57-71 months to 46-57 months. However, because Díaz has\n\nalready served his prison sentence, reducing his guidelines range\n\nfor imprisonment would not, by itself, be of any consequence on\n\nremand.     But, as discussed next, there may have been a more\n\nconsequential error.\n\n2.          Individualized determination of amount of loss and number\n            of victims.\n\n            This issue was mentioned--albeit obliquely--in Díaz's\n\nfirst     appeal.           Therefore,   the     law-of-the-case     doctrine    is\n\ninapplicable to this issue.              Nor is this court's review of this\n\nissue limited by the plain-error doctrine since, unlike the issue\n\ndiscussed above, this one was renewed at resentencing.\n\n            Díaz argues that, despite his stipulation in his plea\n\nagreement    to     a   14-level    enhancement     based    on   losses   of   over\n\n                                         - 4 -\n\f$400,000 that resulted from the conspiracy as a whole, he should be\n\nheld accountable only for the approximately $2,500 in purchases\n\nthat he personally made and that were alleged as overt acts in the\n\nindictment and in the government's version of facts, to which he\n\nstipulated at his change-of-plea hearing. He makes essentially the\n\nsame objection to the enhancement for 10 to 50 victims, arguing\n\nthat,   despite   his   agreement   to   that   enhancement   in   his   plea\n\nagreement, he should be held accountable only for the two victims\n\nof his two purchases that were alleged as overt acts in the\n\nindictment and described in the stipulated version of the facts.\n\n           Ordinarily, defendants are bound by their stipulations to\n\nguideline calculations in their plea agreements, United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), but not where those\n\nstipulations are based on errors of law, id.         Also, the court can\n\nrelieve parties from stipulations of fact or of the application of\n\nguidelines to facts \"on terms that are just.\"          Id.    Here, Díaz's\n\nstipulation to \"[l]osses over $400k\" for purposes of application of\n\na 14-level enhancement, is muddied by his stipulation, in the same\n\ndocument, to serving as a purchaser \"for an organization involved\n\nin a scheme to defraud federally-insured financial institutions, in\n\nexcess of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00)\" (emphasis\n\nadded) and by his counsel's repeated protestations that Díaz was\n\nresponsible only for the much smaller amounts of his own purchases.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\f                 The record is susceptible of two different readings. One\n\nreading is that Díaz stipulated and the court found, as a factual\n\nmatter, that the $400,000 loss amount and the 10-50 victims were\n\nforeseeable by Díaz, in which case, that amount and number of\n\nvictims were properly attributed to him. Pizzaro-Berríos, 448 F.3d\n\nat 7.       However, an equally plausible reading is that the court\n\nmistakenly believed that Díaz's stipulation to the overall loss\n\namount          and   number   of   victims     relieved    the    court   of     its\n\nresponsibility to \"make an individualized determination regarding\n\nthe amount of loss [and number of victims] attributable to, or\n\nreasonably foreseeable by [Díaz],\" id., in which case the district\n\ncourt erred.\n\n                 To eliminate the latter possibility (particularly in\n\nlight      of     the   potential   effect    of   this    error   on   defendant's\n\nsupervised release term),1 we will remand this case to the district\n\ncourt with instructions to make such individualized determinations\n\nand,       if     warranted,   to   recalculate      Díaz's    guidelines       range\n\naccordingly.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      If Díaz were held accountable for only the $2,500 in\npurchases he personally made rather than for the $400,000 loss\nresulting from the conspiracy as a whole and for only 2 rather than\n10 to 50 victims, his offense level would drop 16 levels, USSG\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1), (2), and his resulting guidelines sentencing range\nwould be 4 to 10 months. For a sentence within that range, the\nguidelines do not recommend any supervised release time.       USSG\n§ 5D1.1(a).\n\n                                        - 6 -\n\f3.   Enhancement for sophisticated means.\n\n           Díaz acknowledges that this issue was not raised in his\n\nfirst appeal or at his resentencing but makes only the conclusory\n\nstatement that the error was sufficiently \"plain\" to warrant\n\ncorrection in any event.         He makes no attempt to get around his\n\nstipulation     to   this   enhancement    in   his   plea   agreement.      His\n\ndiscussion of the merits of that issue is equally perfunctory.\n\nAccordingly, we decline to address the issue.                United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n4.   Unreasonableness of the sentence under Gall.\n\n           To    the   extent    that     the   district     court   erred    in\n\ninterpreting the guidelines or applying them to the facts of this\n\ncase, such errors render its sentence procedurally unreasonable.\n\nGall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.        Apart from those purported errors, which\n\nhave already been discussed, Díaz argues only that the district\n\ncourt failed to consider his \"very limited role in the conspiracy.\"\n\nThe short answer to that contention is that the district court took\n\nDíaz's minor role into account by applying a two-level downward\n\nadjustment to his offense level on that basis.                The court also\n\nheard but rejected defendant's other arguments for leniency under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).        No more was required, Gall, 128 S. Ct. at\n\n596, particularly where, as here, the ultimate sentence fell within\n\nthe guidelines range, Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2468\n\n(2007).\n\n\n                                    - 7 -\n\f           In sum, because the district court plainly erred in\n\napplying an enhancement for \"theft from the person of another\" and\n\nmay have erred in failing to make individualized determinations of\n\nthe loss amount and the number of victims for which Díaz was\n\naccountable, we vacate the sentence and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for resentencing.          On remand, the district court\n\nshould eliminate the two-level enhancement for theft from the\n\nperson of another; should make individualized determinations of the\n\namount of loss and number of victims for which Diaz was accountable\n\neither on the existing record or, if the court deems necessary,\n\nafter   taking   additional    evidence;     and   should   recalculate     the\n\nguidelines sentencing range if its individualized determinations\n\nrequire it.      If the top of the resulting range falls below one\n\nyear,   then   the   court   should   also   reconsider     Díaz's   term    of\n\nsupervised release in light of the guidelines (which permit but do\n\nnot recommend any supervised release where the prison sentence\n\nimposed is less than one year, USSG § 5D1.1) and the other factors\n\nreferenced in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\f",

Nor is this court's review of this\n\nissue limited by the plain-error doctrine since, unlike the issue\n\ndiscussed above, this one was renewed at resentencing.\n\n            Díaz argues that, despite his stipulation in his plea\n\nagreement    to     a   14-level    enhancement     based    on   losses   of   over\n\n                                         - 4 -\n\f$400,000 that resulted from the conspiracy as a whole, he should be\n\nheld accountable only for the approximately $2,500 in purchases\n\nthat he personally made and that were alleged as overt acts in the\n\nindictment and in the government's version of facts, to which he\n\nstipulated at his change-of-plea hearing. He makes essentially the\n\nsame objection to the enhancement for 10 to 50 victims, arguing\n\nthat,   despite   his   agreement   to   that   enhancement   in   his   plea\n\nagreement, he should be held accountable only for the two victims\n\nof his two purchases that were alleged as overt acts in the\n\nindictment and described in the stipulated version of the facts.\n\n           Ordinarily, defendants are bound by their stipulations to\n\nguideline calculations in their plea agreements, United States v.\n\nTeeter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), but not where those\n\nstipulations are based on errors of law, id.         Also, the court can\n\nrelieve parties from stipulations of fact or of the application of\n\nguidelines to facts \"on terms that are just.\"          Id.    Here, Díaz's\n\nstipulation to \"[l]osses over $400k\" for purposes of application of\n\na 14-level enhancement, is muddied by his stipulation, in the same\n\ndocument, to serving as a purchaser \"for an organization involved\n\nin a scheme to defraud federally-insured financial institutions, in\n\nexcess of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00)\" (emphasis\n\nadded) and by his counsel's repeated protestations that Díaz was\n\nresponsible only for the much smaller amounts of his own purchases.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\f                 The record is susceptible of two different readings. One\n\nreading is that Díaz stipulated and the court found, as a factual\n\nmatter, that the $400,000 loss amount and the 10-50 victims were\n\nforeseeable by Díaz, in which case, that amount and number of\n\nvictims were properly attributed to him. Pizzaro-Berríos, 448 F.3d\n\nat 7.       However, an equally plausible reading is that the court\n\nmistakenly believed that Díaz's stipulation to the overall loss\n\namount          and   number   of   victims     relieved    the    court   of     its\n\nresponsibility to \"make an individualized determination regarding\n\nthe amount of loss [and number of victims] attributable to, or\n\nreasonably foreseeable by [Díaz],\" id., in which case the district\n\ncourt erred.\n\n                 To eliminate the latter possibility (particularly in\n\nlight      of     the   potential   effect    of   this    error   on   defendant's\n\nsupervised release term),1 we will remand this case to the district\n\ncourt with instructions to make such individualized determinations\n\nand,       if     warranted,   to   recalculate      Díaz's    guidelines       range\n\naccordingly.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      If Díaz were held accountable for only the $2,500 in\npurchases he personally made rather than for the $400,000 loss\nresulting from the conspiracy as a whole and for only 2 rather than\n10 to 50 victims, his offense level would drop 16 levels, USSG\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1), (2), and his resulting guidelines sentencing range\nwould be 4 to 10 months. For a sentence within that range, the\nguidelines do not recommend any supervised release time.       USSG\n§ 5D1.1(a).\n\n                                        - 6 -\n\f3.   Enhancement for sophisticated means.\n\n           Díaz acknowledges that this issue was not raised in his\n\nfirst appeal or at his resentencing but makes only the conclusory\n\nstatement that the error was sufficiently \"plain\" to warrant\n\ncorrection in any event.         He makes no attempt to get around his\n\nstipulation     to   this   enhancement    in   his   plea   agreement.      His\n\ndiscussion of the merits of that issue is equally perfunctory.\n\nAccordingly, we decline to address the issue.

Unreasonableness of the sentence under Gall.\n\n           To    the   extent    that     the   district     court   erred    in\n\ninterpreting the guidelines or applying them to the facts of this\n\ncase, such errors render its sentence procedurally unreasonable.\n\nGall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.        Apart from those purported errors, which\n\nhave already been discussed, Díaz argues only that the district\n\ncourt failed to consider his \"very limited role in the conspiracy.\"\n\nThe short answer to that contention is that the district court took\n\nDíaz's minor role into account by applying a two-level downward\n\nadjustment to his offense level on that basis.                The court also\n\nheard but rejected defendant's other arguments for leniency under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).        No more was required, Gall, 128 S.

On remand, the district court\n\nshould eliminate the two-level enhancement for theft from the\n\nperson of another; should make individualized determinations of the\n\namount of loss and number of victims for which Diaz was accountable\n\neither on the existing record or, if the court deems necessary,\n\nafter   taking   additional    evidence;     and   should   recalculate     the\n\nguidelines sentencing range if its individualized determinations\n\nrequire it.      If the top of the resulting range falls below one\n\nyear,   then   the   court   should   also   reconsider     Díaz's   term    of\n\nsupervised release in light of the guidelines (which permit but do\n\nnot recommend any supervised release where the prison sentence\n\nimposed is less than one year, USSG § 5D1.1) and the other factors\n\nreferenced in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 8 -\n\f</pre>",
