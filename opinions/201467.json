Gonzales for appellant Felix Vega.\n     Laura Maldonado Rodríguez for appellant Manuel Fernández\nCarrera.\n\n\n                        February 24, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.             Felix Vega and Manuel (\"Jesús\")\n\nFernández Carrera, were convicted after trial, along with two other\n\nco-defendants, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine in excess of\n\nfive kilograms, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.                            Vega was\n\nsentenced to 120 months' imprisonment and a five year supervised\n\nrelease term.      Fernández Carrera was sentenced to seventy-eight\n\nmonths' imprisonment and a five year supervised release term.                       In\n\nthese consolidated appeals, Vega challenges his sentence while\n\nFernández Carrera challenges both his conviction and a portion of\n\nhis sentence.     We consider each challenge in turn.\n\nVega's Sentencing Appeal\n\n           Vega mounts two challenges to his sentence.                    First, he\n\nargues that neither the jury nor the district court made an\n\nindividualized finding that more than five kilograms of cocaine\n\nwere   attributable      to    or     foreseeable   by     him   as    part   of   his\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy, and therefore the application of the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum of 120 months that attaches to such a\n\nfinding was error.        Second, he argues that it was error for the\n\ndistrict   court    to        adopt    the     findings    of    the    Presentence\n\nInvestigation   Report        (PSR)     assigning    him    a    Criminal     History\n\nCategory of II.\n\n           The trial for all four co-defendants lasted twelve days.\n\nAt the close of evidence, on September 26, 2002, the court gave\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fextensive instructions to the jury.   The instructions relevant to\n\nVega's appeal were:\n\n          Now, it is alleged that the defendants and\n          others    conspired     to    knowingly    and\n          intentionally    distribute    a    controlled\n          substance.    If you find beyond reasonable\n          doubt that the defendants conspired to\n          knowingly distribute the controlled substance\n          –- in this case the controlled substance\n          alleged is cocaine –- you shall then determine\n          whether the government has proven beyond\n          reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved\n          more than five kilograms of cocaine as charged\n          in Count 1.\n          Please note that a defendant who knowingly and\n          willingly participates in a drug conspiracy is\n          accountable not only for his own acts, but he\n          or she may also be held responsible for the\n          acts of others, if those acts or actions of\n          others were reasonably foreseeable by the\n          individual defendant and those acts or actions\n          were   committed   in   furtherance   of   the\n          conspiracy.\n\nVega has not challenged the correctness of the instructions.\n\n          The jurors were then given both a general verdict form\n\nand special verdict form for each defendant.   The general verdict\n\nform asked the jury to state whether it found each defendant guilty\n\nor not guilty of Count I of the indictment: conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute a controlled substance.   Vega's special\n\nverdict form asked:\n\n          If you find the defendant Felix Vega guilty of\n          the conspiracy charged in Count I, please\n          answer the following question:\n          1) Do you unanimously agree, by proof beyond a\n          reasonable doubt, that the quantity of cocaine\n          which was distributed and/or intended to be\n          distributed as part of the conspiracy was more\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f          than five (5) kilograms as charged in the\n          indictment?\n\nThis instruction was consistent with the law of this circuit at the\n\ntime, which allowed for the jury to make a finding as to the\n\nquantity of drugs attributable to the conspiracy as a whole, and\n\nallowed   the   district   court   to    make   individualized   quantity\n\ndeterminations for each co-conspirator for sentencing purposes.\n\nSee Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The following morning, September 27, 2002, during jury\n\ndeliberation the jury submitted a note to the court asking for\n\nclarification:\n\n           If the evidence shows that an individual is\n           part of a conspiracy and the conspiracy\n           network has distributed in excess of 5 kilos\n           of cocaine does it automatically make every\n           single individual guilty of distributing in\n           excess of 5 kilos of cocaine?\n\nThat question may well have been intended to explore the gap\n\nbetween the instructions and the special verdict form.              After\n\nreceiving the note, the district judge met in chambers with the\n\nattorneys for the defendants and the government.         The judge said\n\nthat she thought the jurors were confused as to whether they must\n\nconsider the evidence against each defendant individually, and\n\nproposed an instruction in response that would clarify that issue.\n\nShe asked the attorneys for the defendants if they objected to this\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fclarifying instruction, and they did not object.1           The court then\n\nresponded to the jury in writing that the answer to their question\n\nwas no, and that it would instruct the jury on \"giving separate\n\nconsideration   to    each    individual      defendant.\"     The   court's\n\ninstruction stated:\n\n          Members of the jury, the case of each\n          defendant and the evidence pertaining to that\n          defendant should be considered separately and\n          individually. The fact that you may find one\n          of the defendants guilty or not guilty should\n          not control your verdict as to any other\n          defendant.\n\nThe jury then continued with its deliberation.          That afternoon the\n\njury reached a verdict of guilty for Vega, as well as all three co-\n\ndefendants, on Count I, and answered yes to Vega's special verdict\n\nquestion that more than five kilograms of cocaine was attributable\n\nto the conspiracy.    There was no request from defense counsel for\n\nclarification of the verdict.\n\n          Several    months   later,     at   Vega's   sentencing   hearing,\n\nVega's counsel said that he discussed with Vega fully the findings\n\nof Vega's PSR, and that there were no objections to the PSR.             The\n\n\n     1\n          Only counsel for the government raised to the district\ncourt during this conference the possibility that the jurors may\nhave already decided the question of guilt and were confused about\nthe special    verdict   question   and   individualized   quantity\ndeterminations. The court then restated its understanding of the\njury's concern, and explained to counsel that \"[i]f there is a\ndifferent concern in their mind, they can come back to the Court to\nstate that, if I have not answered completely or correctly.\" No\ndefense counsel spoke up to share the government's possible\nconcern, and none objected to the district court's response to the\njury's question.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fPSR stated that Vega's offense involved more than five kilograms\n\nbut less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine, which triggers the\n\nmandatory minimum of 120 months under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n\nVega said that he understood his counsel's explanation of the PSR.\n\nNeither Vega nor his counsel argued that more than 5 kilograms of\n\ncocaine could not be attributed to him. Vega's counsel then argued\n\nthat nothing in the PSR required the court to sentence Vega above\n\nthe statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months, and that Vega should\n\nreceive that minimum.      The government also requested a sentence of\n\nthe mandatory minimum.        The court then sentenced Vega to the\n\nmandatory minimum of 120 months' imprisonment.\n\n          For   the   first   time    on   appeal,   Vega   challenges   the\n\napplication of the mandatory minimum sentence. Vega does not argue\n\nthe jury was required to make this finding of drug quantity.             See\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004); c.f.\n\nUnited States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 634 (2002).            He argues that\n\nneither the jury nor the district court made an individualized\n\ndetermination   as    to   drug   quantity,    but   rather    applied   the\n\nconspiracy-wide drug quantity to him automatically, as did the\n\nprobation office in his PSR.      Relying on a subsequent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Colon-Solis, 354 F.3d 101 (1st Cir. 2004), he\n\nargues that the district court committed error by automatically\n\napplying the conspiracy-wide drug quantity to him, and therefore\n\nerred in applying the mandatory minimum sentence.               He does not\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fexplain why the judge, who properly instructed on the law as to the\n\nneed       for    personalized   findings   of     drug   quantity,   would    have\n\nsuddenly shifted to adopt a per se rule.\n\n                 Vega's belated challenge gets him nowhere.           First, Vega\n\nhas arguably waived the issue of drug quantity by affirmatively\n\nagreeing         to   the   120-month   mandatory    minimum   sentence   at    his\n\nsentencing hearing.            United States v. Ruiz-Garcia, 886 F.2d 474,\n\n476 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that defendant waives objection to\n\nexistence of a sentencing factor raised for first time on appeal\n\nwhere defendant conceded that factor below).               In any event, by not\n\nraising an objection below, Vega has at least forfeited the issue,\n\nand he cannot demonstrate that the district court committed plain\n\nerror.       See United States v. Barbour,           393 F.3d 82, 89 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).           Whether or not the instruction is ideal under later\n\ndeveloped law, there is no indication that the jury would probably\n\nhave reached a different result under a perfect instruction, or\n\nthat an injustice has resulted.                 See United States v. Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 2333, 2340 (2004); United States\n\nv. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993).2\n\n                 Accordingly, we affirm Vega's sentence.\n\n\n\n       2\n          Vega further claims that the district court improperly\ncalculated his Criminal History Category by improperly counting a\nprior conviction for a minor offense. Given that Vega's sentence\nis a result of a statutory mandatory minimum, which we have upheld,\nthis second claim is moot.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fFernández Carrera\n\n           Fernández   Carrera   challenges   the   sufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence to support his conviction for conspiracy to distribute\n\ncocaine.   In order to overturn his conviction, this court must\n\nfind, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, that no rational jury could have found Fernández\n\nCarrera joined the conspiracy.      United States v. Reyes, 352 F.3d\n\n511, 517 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Fernández Carrera was known to his friends as \"Jesús.\"\n\nFernández Carrera argues that the evidence suggests there was a\n\nperson named \"Jesús\" involved in the conspiracy, but that it was\n\nsomeone else, another \"Jesús.\"      He points primarily to the fact\n\nthat some of the principal members of the conspiracy were taped\n\nstating that they were going to see what \"Jesús says\" on December\n\n4, 1999.   This was two days after the defendant was arrested for\n\npossession of cocaine and while he was still in custody at the MDC-\n\nGuaynabo facility.     From this, he argues, he could not have talked\n\nwith them and that the conspirators had to have known that he was\n\nin jail and so they could not see him.    And that, he argues, means\n\nhe should have been acquitted, because it had to have been a\n\ndifferent \"Jesús\" to whom the co-conspirators referred.\n\n           His argument fails on several fronts. There was adequate\n\nother evidence of his participation in the conspiracy.            And the\n\nfact that he was imprisoned on December 4 proves nothing, much less\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthat he is not guilty.           Special Agent Juan de Jesus identified\n\nFernández Carrera as the speaker in, or subject of, multiple\n\nconversations having a direct bearing on his knowledge of and\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy.            In the first, occurring on\n\nDecember 2, 1999, the date of Fernández Carrera's arrest, Juan\n\nEspiritu Santo, one of the principal members of the conspiracy,\n\ntold Fernández Carrera about an incident that had occurred on\n\nNovember 28, 1999, during which some conspirators had dumped drugs\n\ninto the ocean when their boat was intercepted by the Coast Guard.\n\nDuring    this    conversation    Juan   also   agreed   to   meet   Fernández\n\nCarrera.    As further evidence that the \"Jesús\" on this call was in\n\nfact Fernández Carrera, the government introduced evidence from\n\nFernández Carrera's arrest report where he revealed that the number\n\nwhich Juan had called on December 2, 1999 was his home phone\n\nnumber.\n\n            Later that day, December 2, 1999, police officers came to\n\nFernández Carrera's house, following a 911 call about a domestic\n\nviolence dispute, and received permission to enter and search the\n\npremises.        They found four brick-shaped packages of cocaine,\n\nweighing approximately      four     kilograms,   and    arrested    Fernández\n\nCarrera.    The following day he was taken into federal custody and\n\nbrought to the federal jail at MDC-Guaynabo, where he remained in\n\ncustody until December 9, 1999.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            Two days later, on December 4, 1999, Juan Espiritu Santo\n\nspoke with Cristobal Garcia, the ringleader of the conspiracy, and\n\nstated that he had given four \"shoe boxes\" to Jesús, which Agent\n\nJuan de Jesus testified referred to his giving four kilograms of\n\ncocaine to Fernández Carrera.           The government then submitted\n\ntranscripts of subsequent calls, all occurring on the same day,\n\nbetween Juan and Cristobal in which first they are trying to\n\nascertain what happened to Jesús.           Cristobal tells Juan to go and\n\n\"see what Jesús says,\" and finally they learn that he had an\n\n\"accident,\" which the Special Agent interpreted to mean he had been\n\narrested.    In a later call that day, introduced by the defense,\n\nCristobal again tells Juan to go and see Jesús.\n\n            Fernández Carrera attempts to use the fact that he was in\n\njail at the time Juan and Cristobal talked on December 4 about\n\ngoing to see \"Jesús\" as evidence that there must have been another\n\nJesús they were trying to see, as they knew Fernández Carrera was\n\nin jail and could not have possibly gone to see him.           This argument\n\nmisrepresents the record.        The Agent testified that while on\n\nDecember 4, 1999, Juan and Cristobal discovered that Jesús (clearly\n\nFernández Carrera) had been arrested at some point, the phone\n\nconversations did not indicate that Juan and Cristobal knew that\n\nFernández Carrera was still in jail.\n\n            The   evidence   shows   that     Juan   stated   in   coded   drug\n\nlanguage that he had given four kilograms of drugs to \"Jesús,\" that\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fFernández Carrera was arrested in his home with four kilograms of\n\ndrugs, and that Juan and Fernández Carrera spoke with one another\n\nabout a shipment of drugs that had gone bad just a week earlier;\n\nthere was more than adequate evidence for a rational jury to find\n\nthat Fernández Carrera knew of and joined the conspiracy.\n\nSupervised Release\n\n          Fernández Carrera also raises for the first time on\n\nappeal the argument that the district court impermissibly delegated\n\nto the probation officer the authority to decide whether the\n\ndefendant should undergo drug treatment if he tests positive for\n\ndrugs during his term of supervised release.   See United States v.\n\nMelendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir. 2003). The government\n\nconcedes that the delegation constituted plain error, id. at 106,\n\nand agrees that this court should remand for resentencing both on\n\nthis issue, and the related issue of the number of drug tests\n\nFernández Carrera should be forced to undergo.   As we are bound by\n\nthe decision of the earlier panel in Melendez-Santana on this\n\nissue, we accept the government's position and remand for limited\n\nadjustment of the drug treatment portion of the sentence.\n\n          Accordingly, we vacate Fernández Carrera's sentence only\n\nto the extent it delegates the terms of his drug testing and\n\ntreatment during the period of his supervised release, and remand\n\nfor resentencing on this sole issue.      In all other respects,\n\nFernández Carrera's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 42-43 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following morning, September 27, 2002, during jury deliberation the jury submitted a note to the court asking for clarification:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the evidence shows that an individual is part of a conspiracy and the conspiracy network has distributed in excess of 5 kilos of cocaine does it automatically make every single individual guilty of distributing in excess of 5 kilos of cocaine?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That question may well have been intended to explore the gap between the instructions and the special verdict form. After receiving the note, the district judge met in chambers with the attorneys for the defendants and the government. The judge said that she thought the jurors were confused as to whether they must consider the evidence against each defendant individually, and proposed an instruction in response that would clarify that issue. She asked the attorneys for the defendants if they objected to this clarifying instruction, and they did not object.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court then responded to the jury in writing that the answer to their question was no, and that it would instruct the jury on \"giving separate consideration to each individual defendant.\" The court's instruction stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Members of the jury, the case of each defendant and the evidence pertaining to that defendant should be considered separately and individually. The fact that you may find one of the defendants guilty or not guilty should not control your verdict as to any other defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury then continued with its deliberation. That afternoon the jury reached a verdict of guilty for Vega, as well as all three co-defendants, on Count I, and answered yes to Vega's special verdict question that more than five kilograms of cocaine was attributable to the conspiracy. There was no request from defense counsel for clarification of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, at Vega's sentencing hearing, Vega's counsel said that he discussed with Vega fully the findings of Vega's PSR, and that there were no objections to the PSR. The PSR stated that Vega's offense involved more than five kilograms but less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine, which triggers the mandatory minimum of 120 months under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii). Vega said that he understood his counsel's explanation of the PSR. Neither Vega nor his counsel argued that more than 5 kilograms of cocaine could not be attributed to him. Vega's counsel then argued that nothing in the PSR required the court to sentence Vega <i>above</i> the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months, and that Vega should receive that minimum. The government also requested a sentence of the mandatory minimum. The court then sentenced Vega to the mandatory minimum of 120 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, Vega challenges the application of the mandatory minimum sentence. Vega does not argue the jury was required to make this finding of drug quantity. <i>See Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); <i>cf. United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 634, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). He argues that neither the jury nor the district court made an individualized determination as to drug quantity, but rather applied the conspiracy-wide drug quantity to him automatically, as did the probation office in his PSR. Relying on a subsequent decision in <i>United States v. Colon-Solis,</i> 354 F.3d 101 (1st Cir.2004), he argues that the district court committed error by automatically applying the conspiracy-wide drug quantity to him, and therefore erred in applying the mandatory minimum sentence. He does not explain why the judge, who properly instructed on the law as to the need for personalized findings of drug quantity, would have suddenly shifted to adopt a per se rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega's belated challenge gets him nowhere. First, Vega has arguably waived the issue of drug quantity by affirmatively agreeing to the 120-month mandatory minimum sentence at his sentencing hearing. <i>United States v. Ruiz-Garcia,</i> 886 F.2d 474, 476 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that defendant waives objection to existence of a sentencing factor raised for first time on appeal where defendant conceded that factor below). In any event, by not raising an objection below, Vega has at least forfeited the issue, and he cannot demonstrate that the district court committed plain error. <i>See United States v. Barbour,</i> 393 F.3d 82, 89 (1st Cir.2004). Whether or not the instruction is ideal under later developed law, there is no indication that the jury would probably have reached a different result under a perfect instruction, or that an injustice has resulted. <i>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> Vega's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Fern&#225;ndez Carrera</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. In order to overturn his conviction, this court must find, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that no rational jury could have found Fern&#225;ndez Carrera joined the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Reyes,</i> 352 F.3d 511, 517 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was known to his friends as \"Jes&#250;s.\" Fern&#225;ndez Carrera argues that the evidence suggests there was a person named \"Jes&#250;s\" involved in the conspiracy, but that it was someone else, another \"Jes&#250;s.\" He points primarily to the fact that some of the principal members of the conspiracy were taped stating that they were going to see what \"Jes&#250;s says\" on December 4, 1999. This was two days after the defendant was arrested for possession of cocaine and while he was still in custody at the MDC-Guaynabo facility. From this, he argues, he could not have talked with them and that the conspirators had to have known that he was in jail and so they could not see him. And that, he argues, means he should have been acquitted, because it had to have been a different \"Jes&#250;s\" to whom the co-conspirators referred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His argument fails on several fronts. There was adequate other evidence of his participation in the conspiracy. And the fact that he was imprisoned on December 4 proves nothing, much less that he is not guilty. Special Agent Juan de Jesus identified Fern&#225;ndez Carrera as the speaker in, or subject of, multiple conversations having a direct bearing on his knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy. In the first, occurring on December 2, 1999, the date of Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's arrest, Juan Espiritu Santo, one of the principal members of the conspiracy, told Fern&#225;ndez Carrera about an incident that had occurred on November 28, 1999, during which some conspirators had dumped drugs into the ocean when their boat was intercepted by the Coast Guard. During this conversation Juan also agreed to meet Fern&#225;ndez Carrera. As further evidence that the \"Jes&#250;s\" on this call was in fact Fern&#225;ndez Carrera, the government introduced evidence from Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's arrest report where he revealed that the number which Juan had called on December 2, 1999 was his home phone number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, December 2, 1999, police officers came to Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's house, following a 911 call about a domestic violence dispute, and received permission to enter and search the premises. They found four brick-shaped packages of cocaine, weighing approximately four kilograms, and arrested Fern&#225;ndez Carrera. The following day he was taken into federal custody and brought to the federal jail at MDC-Guaynabo, where he remained in custody until December 9, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, on December 4, 1999, Juan Espiritu Santo spoke with Cristobal Garcia, the ringleader of the conspiracy, and stated that he had given four \"shoe boxes\" to Jes&#250;s, which Agent Juan de Jesus testified referred to his giving four kilograms of cocaine to Fern&#225;ndez Carrera. The government then submitted transcripts of subsequent calls, all occurring on the same day, between Juan and Cristobal in which first they are trying to ascertain what happened to Jes&#250;s. Cristobal tells Juan to go and \"see what Jes&#250;s says,\" and finally they learn that he had an \"accident,\" which the Special Agent interpreted to mean he had been arrested. In a later call that day, introduced by the defense, Cristobal again tells Juan to go and see Jes&#250;s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Page 154-156</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera attempts to use the fact that he was in jail at the time Juan and Cristobal talked on December 4 about going to see \"Jes&#250;s\" as evidence that there must have been another Jes&#250;s they were trying to see, as they knew Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was in jail and could not have possibly gone to see him. This argument misrepresents the record. The Agent testified that while on December 4, 1999, Juan and Cristobal discovered that Jes&#250;s (clearly Fern&#225;ndez Carrera) had been arrested at some point, the phone conversations did not indicate that Juan and Cristobal knew that Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was still in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence shows that Juan stated in coded drug language that he had given four kilograms of drugs to \"Jes&#250;s,\" that Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was arrested in his home with four kilograms of drugs, and that Juan and Fern&#225;ndez Carrera spoke with one another about a shipment of drugs that had gone bad just a week earlier; there was more than adequate evidence for a rational jury to find that Fern&#225;ndez Carrera knew of and joined the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Supervised Release</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera also raises for the first time on appeal the argument that the district court impermissibly delegated to the probation officer the authority to decide whether the defendant should undergo drug treatment if he tests positive for drugs during his term of supervised release. <i>See United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir.2003). The government concedes that the delegation constituted plain error, <i>id.</i> at 106, and agrees that this court should remand for resentencing both on this issue, and the related issue of the number of drug tests Fern&#225;ndez Carrera should be forced to undergo. As we are bound by the decision of the earlier panel in <i>Melendez-Santana</i> on this issue, we accept the government's position and remand for limited adjustment of the drug treatment portion of the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>vacate</i> Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's sentence only to the extent it delegates the terms of his drug testing and treatment during the period of his supervised release, and remand for resentencing on this sole issue. In all other respects, Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Only counsel for the government raised to the district court during this conference the possibility that the jurors may have already decided the question of guilt and were confused about the special verdict question and individualized quantity determinations. The court then restated its understanding of the jury's concern, and explained to counsel that \"[i]f there is a different concern in their mind, they can come back to the Court to state that, if I have not answered completely or correctly.\" No defense counsel spoke up to share the government's possible concern, and none objected to the district court's response to the jury's question</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Vega further claims that the district court improperly calculated his Criminal History Category by improperly counting a prior conviction for a minor offense.

Vega was sentenced to 120 months' imprisonment and a five year supervised release term. Fernandez Carrera was sentenced to seventy-eight months' imprisonment and a five year supervised release term.

First, he argues that neither the jury nor the district court made an individualized finding that more than five kilograms of cocaine were attributable to or foreseeable by him as part of his involvement in the conspiracy, and therefore the application of the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months that attaches to such a finding was error. Second, he argues that it was error for the district court to adopt the findings of the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) assigning him a Criminal History Category of II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial for all four co-defendants lasted twelve days. At the close of evidence, on September 26, 2002, the court gave extensive instructions to the jury.

The general verdict form asked the jury to state whether it found each defendant guilty or not guilty of Count I of the indictment: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Vega's special verdict form asked:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find the defendant Felix Vega guilty of the conspiracy charged in Count I, please answer the following question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Do you unanimously agree, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the quantity of cocaine which was distributed and/or intended to be distributed as part of the conspiracy was more than five (5) kilograms as charged in the indictment?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction was consistent with the law of this circuit at the time, which allowed for the jury to make a finding as to the quantity of drugs attributable to the conspiracy as a whole, and allowed the district court to make individualized quantity determinations for each co-conspirator for sentencing purposes. <i>See Derman v.

Colon-Solis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200804\"><a href=\"/opinion/200804/united-states-v-colon-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), he argues that the district court committed error by automatically applying the conspiracy-wide drug quantity to him, and therefore erred in applying the mandatory minimum sentence. He does not explain why the judge, who properly instructed on the law as to the need for personalized findings of drug quantity, would have suddenly shifted to adopt a per se rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vega's belated challenge gets him nowhere. First, Vega has arguably waived the issue of drug quantity by affirmatively agreeing to the 120-month mandatory minimum sentence at his sentencing hearing. <i>United States v. Ruiz-Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529939\"><a href=\"/opinion/529939/united-states-v-alfred-ruiz-garcia-aka-wilfredo-cintron-delgado-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 476 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that defendant waives objection to existence of a sentencing factor raised for first time on appeal where defendant conceded that factor below). In any event, by not raising an objection below, Vega has at least forfeited the issue, and he cannot demonstrate that the district court committed plain error. <i>See United States v. Barbour,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201393\"><a href=\"/opinion/201393/united-states-v-barbour/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2004). Whether or not the instruction is ideal under later developed law, there is no indication that the jury would probably have reached a different result under a perfect instruction, or that an injustice has resulted. <i>See United States v.

In order to overturn his conviction, this court must find, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that no rational jury could have found Fern&#225;ndez Carrera joined the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200778\"><a href=\"/opinion/200778/united-states-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 517 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was known to his friends as \"Jes&#250;s.\" Fern&#225;ndez Carrera argues that the evidence suggests there was a person named \"Jes&#250;s\" involved in the conspiracy, but that it was someone else, another \"Jes&#250;s.\" He points primarily to the fact that some of the principal members of the conspiracy were taped stating that they were going to see what \"Jes&#250;s says\" on December 4, 1999. This was two days after the defendant was arrested for possession of cocaine and while he was still in custody at the MDC-Guaynabo facility. From this, he argues, he could not have talked with them and that the conspirators had to have known that he was in jail and so they could not see him. And that, he argues, means he should have been acquitted, because it had to have been a different \"Jes&#250;s\" to whom the co-conspirators referred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His argument fails on several fronts. There was adequate other evidence of his participation in the conspiracy. And the fact that he was imprisoned on December 4 proves nothing, much less that he is not guilty. Special Agent Juan de Jesus identified Fern&#225;ndez Carrera as the speaker in, or subject of, multiple conversations having a direct bearing on his knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy. In the first, occurring on December 2, 1999, the date of Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's arrest, Juan Espiritu Santo, one of the principal members of the conspiracy, told Fern&#225;ndez Carrera about an incident that had occurred on November 28, 1999, during which some conspirators had dumped drugs into the ocean when their boat was intercepted by the Coast Guard. During this conversation Juan also agreed to meet Fern&#225;ndez Carrera. As further evidence that the \"Jes&#250;s\" on this call was in fact Fern&#225;ndez Carrera, the government introduced evidence from Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's arrest report where he revealed that the number which Juan had called on December 2, 1999 was his home phone number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, December 2, 1999, police officers came to Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's house, following a 911 call about a domestic violence dispute, and received permission to enter and search the premises. They found four brick-shaped packages of cocaine, weighing approximately four kilograms, and arrested Fern&#225;ndez Carrera. The following day he was taken into federal custody and brought to the federal jail at MDC-Guaynabo, where he remained in custody until December 9, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days later, on December 4, 1999, Juan Espiritu Santo spoke with Cristobal Garcia, the ringleader of the conspiracy, and stated that he had given four \"shoe boxes\" to Jes&#250;s, which Agent Juan de Jesus testified referred to his giving four kilograms of cocaine to Fern&#225;ndez Carrera. The government then submitted transcripts of subsequent calls, all occurring on the same day, between Juan and Cristobal in which first they are trying to ascertain what happened to Jes&#250;s. Cristobal tells Juan to go and \"see what Jes&#250;s says,\" and finally they learn that he had an \"accident,\" which the Special Agent interpreted to mean he had been arrested. In a later call that day, introduced by the defense, Cristobal again tells Juan to go and see Jes&#250;s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Page 154-156</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera attempts to use the fact that he was in jail at the time Juan and Cristobal talked on December 4 about going to see \"Jes&#250;s\" as evidence that there must have been another Jes&#250;s they were trying to see, as they knew Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was in jail and could not have possibly gone to see him. This argument misrepresents the record. The Agent testified that while on December 4, 1999, Juan and Cristobal discovered that Jes&#250;s (clearly Fern&#225;ndez Carrera) had been arrested at some point, the phone conversations did not indicate that Juan and Cristobal knew that Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was still in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence shows that Juan stated in coded drug language that he had given four kilograms of drugs to \"Jes&#250;s,\" that Fern&#225;ndez Carrera was arrested in his home with four kilograms of drugs, and that Juan and Fern&#225;ndez Carrera spoke with one another about a shipment of drugs that had gone bad just a week earlier; there was more than adequate evidence for a rational jury to find that Fern&#225;ndez Carrera knew of and joined the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Supervised Release</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fern&#225;ndez Carrera also raises for the first time on appeal the argument that the district court impermissibly delegated to the probation officer the authority to decide whether the defendant should undergo drug treatment if he tests positive for drugs during his term of supervised release. <i>See United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.2003). The government concedes that the delegation constituted plain error, <i>id.</i> at 106, and agrees that this court should remand for resentencing both on this issue, and the related issue of the number of drug tests Fern&#225;ndez Carrera should be forced to undergo. As we are bound by the decision of the earlier panel in <i>Melendez-Santana</i> on this issue, we accept the government's position and remand for limited adjustment of the drug treatment portion of the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>vacate</i> Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's sentence only to the extent it delegates the terms of his drug testing and treatment during the period of his supervised release, and remand for resentencing on this sole issue. In all other respects, Fern&#225;ndez Carrera's conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Only counsel for the government raised to the district court during this conference the possibility that the jurors may have already decided the question of guilt and were confused about the special verdict question and individualized quantity determinations. The court then restated its understanding of the jury's concern, and explained to counsel that \"[i]f there is a different concern in their mind, they can come back to the Court to state that, if I have not answered completely or correctly.\" No defense counsel spoke up to share the government's possible concern, and none objected to the district court's response to the jury's question</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Vega further claims that the district court improperly calculated his Criminal History Category by improperly counting a prior conviction for a minor offense. Given that Vega's sentence is a result of a statutory mandatory minimum, which we have upheld, this second claim is moot</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
