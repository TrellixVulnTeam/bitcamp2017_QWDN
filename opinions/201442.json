Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Donald S. Graham, Memorandum in Support of a Certificate of\nAppealability pro se.\n\n\n\n                             February 8, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam. Donald S. Graham, who was convicted after a\n\njury trial in Massachusetts state court of murder in the first\n\ndegree on the theory of extreme atrocity and cruelty,        seeks a\n\ncertificate of appealability (COA) to appeal from the district\n\ncourt's denial of his petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.      He\n\nseeks a COA to pursue the four claims raised in his habeas\n\npetition:\n\n            1) ineffective assistance of counsel for\n            failure to move to dismiss his indictment on\n            the ground that his due process rights were\n            violated by the presentation of false evidence\n            to the grand jury;\n\n            2) ineffective assistance of counsel for\n            failure to preserve an objection to the\n            exclusion of evidence of the victim's criminal\n            record;\n\n            3) due process violation by the district\n            court's providing the jury with a tape-\n            recording   of   supplemental  instructions,\n            without including a recording of the entire\n            instructions; and\n\n            4) due process violation by the district\n            court's admission into evidence of four cross-\n            bows seized from defendant's home which were\n            unrelated to the crime charged.\n\n            The district court denied the first two claims on the\n\nmerits and the other two on procedural grounds.    As to the claims\n\nwhich the district court denied on the merits, \"petitioner must\n\ndemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's\n\nassessment of the constitutional claim debatable or wrong.\" Slack\n\nv. McDaniel, 529 US. 473, 484 (2000).    As to the claims which the\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdistrict court denied on procedural grounds, without reaching the\n\nmerits of the underlying constitutional claims,\n\n          a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at\n          least, that jurists of reason would find it\n          debatable whether the petition states a valid\n          claim of the denial of a constitutional right\n          and that jurists of reason would find it\n          debatable whether the district court was wrong\n          in its procedural ruling.\n\nId.    Because petitioner has not satisfied the applicable COA\n\nstandard as to any of the four claims, we deny his request for a\n\nCOA.\n\n           I. Ineffective Assistance Claims\n\n          Because    this    was   a   capital      case,   the   Massachusetts\n\nSupreme   Judicial   Court    applied        the   \"miscarriage    of    justice\n\nstandard\" set forth in G.L.c. 278 ยง 33E to Graham's ineffective\n\nassistance claims. See Commonwealth v. Graham, 431 Mass. 282, 289\n\n(2000).    The SJC has held that the \"miscarriage of justice\"\n\nstandard under ยง 33E is more favorable to defendant than                     the\n\nfederal standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n\n668, 688 (1984). See Commonwealth v. Wright, 411 Mass. 678, 682\n\n(1992).   Therefore, the SJC's determinations that Graham had not\n\nmet the \"miscarriage of justice\" standard included within them\n\ndeterminations   that   he   had   not       met   the   Strickland     standard.\n\nSee McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 35 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Graham's first ineffective assistance claim was based on\n\nhis attorney's failure to file a motion to dismiss the indictment\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fon the ground that perjured testimony was presented to the grand\n\njury.   He relied upon allegations that there were inconsistencies\n\nbetween statements by a single witness which were presented and\n\nthose not presented to the grand jury.       The SJC rejected the claim\n\non the reasoning that a motion to dismiss the indictment on such\n\nbasis would not have succeeded. Specifically, it found that \"there\n\nis   nothing   from   which   we   could   properly   conclude   that   the\n\nstatements were false and deceptive and knowingly introduced to the\n\ngrand jury.\" Graham, 431 Mass. at 290. Graham's essential argument\n\nin support of his COA request as to this claim is that the SJC's\n\nfinding in that regard was contrary to the evidence.             The state\n\ncourt's factual finding is subject to considerable deference,\n\nhowever.   On this record, reasonable jurists could not disagree\n\nwith the district court's determination that Graham did not meet\n\nhis burden of \"rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear\n\nand convincing evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.\n\n           In his second ineffective assistance claim, Graham faults\n\nhis trial attorney for failing to lay a foundation for admission of\n\nthe evidence of the victim's criminal record, as he was invited to\n\ndo by the trial judge.    The SJC ruled that there was no ineffective\n\nassistance because the motion would not have succeeded, and the\n\ndistrict court found that the SJC's reasoning and conclusion was\n\nnot contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Strickland.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f             In   support    of    his    COA     request      as    to    this   claim,\n\npetitioner appears to contend that a motion to admit the evidence\n\nwould have succeeded if his attorney had argued that such evidence\n\nwas admissible to impeach allegedly perjured testimony presented to\n\nthe grand jury (a statement by the victim's passenger that the\n\nvictim had no criminal record of violence).                     In support of that\n\nargument, Graham relies upon United States v. Augurs, 427 U.S. 97\n\n(1976) and Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103 (1935).\n\n             Reasonable jurists could not find debatable the district\n\ncourt's     conclusion     that    the    SJC    did    not    unreasonably       apply\n\nStrickland in light of the argument presented in this COA petition.\n\nAs discussed above, reasonable jurists could not find that Graham\n\nmet his burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the grand jury testimony was knowingly false and deceptive.\n\nMoreover, petitioner has not claimed that the allegedly perjured\n\ntestimony    presented      to    the    grand   jury   was     offered      at   trial.\n\nTherefore, it could not have affected the jury's verdict, or\n\nresulted in a due process violation under Agurs.\n\n             II. Claims Dismissed on Procedural Grounds\n\n             The district court ruled that Graham's claim regarding\n\nthe tape-recorded jury instructions was procedurally defaulted and\n\nthat   he   had   failed     to    satisfy       the   cause    and       prejudice   or\n\n\"fundamental miscarriage of justice\" standard.                      In support of his\n\nrequest for a COA, Graham contests the finding by the SJC that the\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fobjection which counsel made to the tape-recorded jury instructions\n\n\"was not adequate to alert [the trial judge] to the requirement\n\nthat the tape recordings of jury instructions contain the whole\n\ninstructions.\" Graham, 431 Mass. at 287 n.10.                     Based upon our\n\nreview of the portion of the trial transcript on which Graham\n\nrelies, reasonable jurists could not find it debatable whether\n\ncounsel failed to raise in a contemporary objection the issue he\n\nraised in his habeas petition. Nor could reasonable jurists debate\n\nthe district court's determination that the cause and prejudice and\n\nmiscarriage of justice standards were not satisfied and that,\n\ntherefore, Graham had failed to overcome the bar to habeas review\n\nthat was created by his procedural default.\n\n              Graham's final habeas claim (of a due process violation\n\nresulting     from   the      admission    of    cross    bows   seized     from   his\n\napartment but unrelated to the charged crime) was denied by the\n\ndistrict court on the ground that it was an unexhausted claim.                      \"A\n\nclaim   of     non-exhaustion       presents      a    purely    legal     question,\n\nengendering de novo review.\" RaShad, 300 F.3d at 41.                      Petitioner\n\nbears   the    burden    of    proving    that    he     exhausted   the    remedies\n\navailable     to   him   in    state   court     by    presenting    this    federal\n\nconstitutional claim in his appeal to the SJC. See Barresi v.\n\nMaloney, 296 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              Having reviewed Graham's SJC brief, we conclude that\n\nreasonable jurists could not find debatable the district court's\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fconclusion that petitioner did not meet his burden of demonstrating\n\nthat he had exhausted state remedies with respect to this claim.\n\nThat the brief cited only Massachusetts precedent to support his\n\nclaim regarding the cross-bows is not necessarily fatal to his\n\nattempt to establish exhaustion. See id. at 54. However, the state\n\ncases cited by Graham do not address the federal due process issue\n\nthat he has raised in his habeas petition.   Therefore, reasonable\n\njurists could not find it debatable that the citations to state\n\ncases were insufficient to establish the requisite probability that\n\na reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the\n\nfederal due process claim.\n\n          Graham's request for a COA is denied and the appeal is\n\nterminated.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Nor could reasonable jurists debate\n\nthe district court's determination that the cause and prejudice and\n\nmiscarriage of justice standards were not satisfied and that,\n\ntherefore, Graham had failed to overcome the bar to habeas review\n\nthat was created by his procedural default.\n\n              Graham's final habeas claim (of a due process violation\n\nresulting     from   the      admission    of    cross    bows   seized     from   his\n\napartment but unrelated to the charged crime) was denied by the\n\ndistrict court on the ground that it was an unexhausted claim.                      \"A\n\nclaim   of     non-exhaustion       presents      a    purely    legal     question,\n\nengendering de novo review.\" RaShad, 300 F.3d at 41.                      Petitioner\n\nbears   the    burden    of    proving    that    he     exhausted   the    remedies\n\navailable     to   him   in    state   court     by    presenting    this    federal\n\nconstitutional claim in his appeal to the SJC. See Barresi v.\n\nMaloney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200038\"><a href=\"/opinion/200038/barresi-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              Having reviewed Graham's SJC brief, we conclude that\n\nreasonable jurists could not find debatable the district court's\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fconclusion that petitioner did not meet his burden of demonstrating\n\nthat he had exhausted state remedies with respect to this claim.\n\nThat the brief cited only Massachusetts precedent to support his\n\nclaim regarding the cross-bows is not necessarily fatal to his\n\nattempt to establish exhaustion. See id. at 54. However, the state\n\ncases cited by Graham do not address the federal due process issue\n\nthat he has raised in his habeas petition.   Therefore, reasonable\n\njurists could not find it debatable that the citations to state\n\ncases were insufficient to establish the requisite probability that\n\na reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the\n\nfederal due process claim.\n\n          Graham's request for a COA is denied and the appeal is\n\nterminated.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f</pre>",
