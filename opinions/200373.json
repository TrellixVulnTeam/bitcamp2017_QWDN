Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Edward F. Haber with whom Todd S.

This is an appeal from a decision\n\ndecertifying a class action brought by and on behalf of wireless\n\nphone    customers       of   Cellular     One,     the   doing-business     name   of\n\nSouthwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc.                 The putative class members\n\nare Massachusetts and New Hampshire residents who were charged for\n\nincoming calls despite having signed a standard form contract, used\n\nmainly     between       August    1994      and    February    1996,   purportedly\n\nguaranteeing free incoming call service.\n\n        Class representative Jill Ann Smilow brought suit in 1997 for\n\nbreach of contract and violations of Massachusetts General Laws\n\nchapter 93A, §§ 2(a), 9, 11 (West 1997), and the Telecommunications\n\nAct (TCA) of 1996, 47 U.S.C. § 201(b) (2000).                   The district court\n\nfirst certified and then decertified the contract, ch. 93A, and TCA\n\nclasses.         This    court     vacated    the     decertification      order    and\n\nremanded;     the       district     court         subsequently    reinstated       its\n\ndecertification order, Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., No.\n\n97-10307-REK (D. Mass. Apr. 10, 2002) (memorandum and order).                       We\n\nreverse.\n\n                                           I.\n\n       Smilow and proposed class representative Margaret L. Bibeau\n\neach    signed    a     standard    form     contract     for   cellular   telephone\n\nservices with Cellular One in 1995.                       The form contract says,\n\n\"Chargeable time for calls originated by a Mobile Subscriber Unit\n\nstarts when the Mobile Subscriber Unit signals call initiation to\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fC1's facilities and ends when the Mobile Subscriber Unit signals\n\ncall disconnect to C1's facilities and the call disconnect signal\n\nhas   been   confirmed.\"        The    parties     contest      the       meaning    of\n\n\"originated.\" Smilow alleges that this language precludes Cellular\n\nOne from charging for incoming calls.               It is undisputed that a\n\nlarge group of Cellular One customers signed the same contract and\n\nwere subject to charges for incoming calls.              The contract contains\n\nan integration clause providing that changes must be in writing and\n\nsigned by both parties.\n\n      Smilow    and    Bibeau    purport      to    represent         a    class      of\n\nMassachusetts    and   New   Hampshire       residents    who    subscribed         for\n\nCellular One services under this contract.                The potential class\n\nmembers all signed the standard form contract, which was in broad\n\nuse from August 1994 to February 1996.             They did have a variety of\n\nrate plans and usage patterns.         Some Cellular One customers paid a\n\nflat fee for a fixed number of minutes each month and an additional\n\nper-minute charge if they exceeded this fixed amount of air time\n\n(for example, $40/month for the first 300 minutes/month and 10\n\ncents/minute    thereafter).          Many   Cellular     One    customers          paid\n\ndifferent rates for day- and night-time calls.\n\n      Cellular One charged Smilow, Bibeau and the potential class\n\nmembers for incoming as well as outgoing calls.                 Smilow received\n\njust one incoming call; Bibeau received many incoming calls.\n\nCellular One invoices clearly indicate that customers are charged\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffor incoming calls.        The user guide mailed to new Cellular One\n\ncustomers also states that the company charges for both incoming\n\nand outgoing calls. Bibeau paid her invoices knowing she was being\n\ncharged for incoming calls.\n\n                                       II.\n\n     On     February   11,    1997,       Smilow,   as   a   purported     class\n\nrepresentative,    filed     suit    in   federal   district    court     against\n\nCellular One for breach of contract and violations of ch. 93A and\n\nthe TCA.     The district court had jurisdiction over the federal\n\nclaims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2000) and over the state law claims\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1367.        The district court originally certified\n\nthe ch. 93A, breach of contract, and TCA classes on October 9,\n\n1998.1    The district court rejected an initial attempt to decertify\n\nthe classes for Smilow's incoming-calls claims.                The court, with\n\nthe approval of both parties, then filed a scheduling order on\n\nNovember 23, 1999 bifurcating the liability and damages issues on\n\nthe incoming calls claims and providing that liability would be\n\nlitigated    to   conclusion        before   further     discovery   or     other\n\nactivities concerning damages took place.\n\n     On September 15, 2000, the district court held an \"evidentiary\n\nhearing\" on plaintiffs' motion to substitute Bibeau as a new class\n\nrepresentative. Cellular One had opposed this motion partly on the\n\n\n\n     1\n       It later dismissed one of Smilow's claims, the \"rounding-up\"\nbreach of contract claim. That claim is not appealed.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fgrounds that, because common issues of fact did not predominate\n\namong the class members, neither Bibeau nor any other individual\n\ncould properly represent the class.   Both parties stated that they\n\nregarded the evidentiary record as adequate to allow the court to\n\nrule on plaintiffs' motion and did not wish to make additional\n\nsubmissions on this issue.   Nonetheless, the district court issued\n\na memorandum and order on December 1, 2000 extending the time\n\nperiod to submit evidence on the designation of Bibeau as a new\n\nclass representative.\n\n     On March 22, 2001, the district court granted defendants'\n\npending motion to decertify the \"incoming call\" class, on the\n\ngrounds that common issues of fact do not predominate.2   Smilow v.\n\nS.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 200 F.R.D. 5, 9 (D. Mass. 2001).   The\n\ncourt explained its conclusion that individual issues predominated\n\nas follows:\n\n          Proof that many persons (even if not as many as 275,000)\n     were billed for and paid charges for incoming calls in many\n     months is not enough to show that any specific amount of\n     damages could properly be found by a finder of facts at trial,\n     or that any aggregate amount could properly be found. Proof\n     of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an amount\n\n\n     2\n        Plaintiffs had opposed decertification, saying that\nindividualized determinations would be unnecessary to establish\ndamages.   They argued that the detailed billing history of Ms.\nBibeau produced by Cellular One, and submitted with plaintiffs'\nmemoranda, supported their contention that damages, causation, and\nliability could be established using a mechanical process.       If\nthere were a question regarding the need for individualized damages\nhearings, plaintiffs argued, then they were entitled to discovery\non this issue. Plaintiffs contended that, in any event, common\nissues predominated on the claim for ch. 93A statutory damages.\n\n                                -5-\n\f     of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded in the\n     face of (i) a strong likelihood that services were received in\n     return for the billed payments and (ii) lack of admissible\n     evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.\n\n          Plaintiffs' assertions that causation will turn out to be\n     \"a common issue,\" and that the amount of damages calculable\n     from defendant's records will \"not be reasonably disputable,\"\n     are not likely to be consistent with the record in this case\n     after further discovery, regardless of how much longer the\n     court allows for further discovery. To be a \"common issue\" in\n     the relevant sense, the issue must be one that does not\n     require separate dispute resolution processes for different\n     individuals who are said to have claims in \"common.\"\n\nId. at 8.     The court held that additional discovery would not\n\nenable plaintiffs to show that common issues predominate for\n\ncausation and damages.    The court opined that separate damages\n\nhearings would be required for individual plaintiffs because (1)\n\n\"services were received in return for the billed payments\" and (2)\n\nparticular class members had different plans and usage patterns.\n\nAlthough the opinion and order purported to decertify all incoming-\n\ncall class claims, it contained no reasoning about the ch. 93A or\n\nTCA claims.\n\n     In its March 22 opinion, the court also denied Bibeau's motion\n\nto become a designated class representative.        Id. at 6.   The\n\ndistrict court provided little explanation of its decision to\n\ndeny the motion to designate Bibeau as a class representative.\n\nIt merely observed that the motion was \"inadequately supported\n\non the record before the court and thus also not effective to\n\ndefeat the defense motion to decertify.\"      Id.\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f      Plaintiffs      sought    discretionary        appellate       review   of   the\n\ndecertification order, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).                     On July\n\n12,   2001,    this    court     vacated      the    entire      March    22,      2001\n\ndecertification order, noting that the district court had not\n\naddressed the ch. 93A claim.            Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys.,\n\nInc., No. 01-8001, slip op. at 1-2 (1st Cir. July 12, 2001).\n\n      After remand and additional written submissions and oral\n\nargument on the issue, the district court decertified the class for\n\nthe contract, ch. 93A, and TCA claims.               Smilow, No. 97-10307-REK,\n\nslip op. at 9 (D. Mass. Apr. 10, 2002).3                     The district court\n\nreinstated its March 22, 2001 decertification order, quoting the\n\norder at length and stating that its earlier reasoning was correct.\n\nThe court then dismissed the ch. 93A claim class action on two\n\ngrounds.    First, the court held that the class members would fall\n\ninto two groups: those who waived actual damages in favor of\n\nstatutory damages of $25 and those who claimed actual damages. The\n\ncourt fell back on its original reasoning as to why the fact that\n\nactual    damages     could    be    easily   calculated        by    computer     was\n\nirrelevant.      Second,       the   court    held    that    individual        issues\n\npredominated    on    causation.        Here,   it     relied    on    its    earlier\n\nrationale that, whatever the common contractual language, \"services\n\n\n\n      3\n       The district court had allowed limited discovery, which\nincluded permitting plaintiffs a circumscribed deposition of Susan\nQuintiliani, a Cellular One business analyst responsible for\nhelping oversee the firm's billing system.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fwere received in return for the billed payments.\"       Although the\n\ndistrict court purported to be addressing issues of causation, it\n\nagain referred to supposed individual differences in the damages\n\ncalculations to show why causation had no common issues.\n\n      The district judge also denied plaintiffs' renewed motion to\n\ndesignate Bibeau as a class representative on the grounds that she\n\nhad not \"suffered the same injury as the class.\"     Id. at 9.\n\n     Plaintiffs again appealed.        This court granted plaintiffs\n\npermission to appeal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).4\n\n                                III.\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n     Orders certifying or decertifying a class are reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.      Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 703\n\n(1979).   A district court abuses its discretion when it relies\n\nsignificantly on an improper factor, omits a significant factor, or\n\nmakes a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\n\n\n     4\n       Rule 23(f) provides this court with discretion to hear an\ninterlocutory appeal of a district court order certifying or\ndecertifying a class. This court will normally grant Rule 23(f)\nreview when a class decertification ruling, apparently premised on\nan abuse of discretion by the district court, would have the\npractical effect of compelling a party to abandon a potentially\nmeritorious claim. Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d\n288, 293-94 (1st Cir. 2000); accord Blair v. Equifax Check Servs.,\nInc., 181 F.3d 832, 834-35 (7th Cir. 1999); see 16 C.A. Wright,\nA.R. Miller & E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3931, at\n75 (2d ed. Supp. 2002); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 advisory\ncommittee's note (\"Permission is most likely to be granted . . .\nwhen, as a practical matter, the decision on certification is\nlikely dispositive of the litigation.\"). That is the situation\nhere.\n\n                                -8-\n\fSee Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp., 148 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    An abuse of discretion also occurs if the court adopts an\n\nincorrect legal rule.    Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208\n\nF.3d 288, 295 (1st Cir. 2000).   Here the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in decertifying the contract class and the ch. 93A\n\nclass.5\n\nB.   Class certification\n\n1.   General Standards\n\n      A district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the\n\nprerequisites established by Rule 23 before certifying a class.\n\nGen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).    To obtain class\n\ncertification, the plaintiff must establish the four elements of\n\nRule 23(a) and one of several elements of Rule 23(b).          Amchem\n\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997).     The Rule 23(a)\n\nelements are (1) numerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and\n\n(4) adequacy of representation.        Id. at 613.   From its earlier\n\ncertification order the district court necessarily concluded that\n\n\n\n\n      5\n       We quickly dispose of Cellular One's initial contention that\nthe only issue before us is the district court's holding that\ncommon issues would not predominate in a ch. 93A claim for\nstatutory damages. The district court's March 22, 2001 opinion\ndecertified the contract, TCA, and ch. 93A classes. This court's\nJuly 12, 2001 judgment vacated the first decertification order in\nits entirety; it did not affirm on (or address) the breach of\ncontract or TCA classes or the ch. 93A actual damages class theory.\nThe April 10, 2002 order, which reinstated the March 22, 2001\norder, again decertified the contract, TCA, and ch. 93A classes.\nAll issues from the April 10, 2002 order are now before us.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthe Rule 23(a) elements had been met.6\n\n      The district court decertified on the basis of its analysis of\n\nRule 23(b)(3), which requires, in pertinent part:\n\n            that the questions of law or fact common to the members\n            of the class predominate over any questions affecting\n            only individual members, and that a class action is\n            superior to other available methods for the fair and\n            efficient adjudication of the controversy.\nThe   district     court    examined        the   predominance,    but    not   the\n\nsuperiority, requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).\n\n2.    The Predominance Requirement\n\n      The district court's decertification of the classes for the\n\ncontract, ch. 93A, and TCA claims, as well as its denial of the\n\nmotion to substitute a new class representative, all rested on\n\nfundamental   errors       of   law   and    fact.    Once   these     errors   are\n\ncorrected, it becomes clear that common issues as to both liability\n\nand damages predominate on the elements of the breach of contract\n\nand ch. 93A claims.        We first consider the contract claim.\n\na.    Breach of Contract Claim\n\n      The first error was initially contained in the following\n\nstatement   from    the     district    court's      March   22,   2001   opinion\n\ndecertifying the class:\n\n      Proof of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an\n      amount of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded\n      in the face of (i) a strong likelihood that services were\n      received in return for billed payments and (ii) lack of\n\n\n      6\n       Southwestern Bell does               not   argue   that   any   Rule   23(a)\nrequirements were not met.\n\n                                       -10-\n\f     admissible evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.\n\nSmilow, 200 F.R.D. at 8.     In its April 10, 2002 memorandum and\n\norder after remand, the district court repeated this language and\n\nstated that it thought this analysis correct.\n\n     From this statement we understand the district court to have\n\nbelieved that the defendant would be entitled to payment for\n\nincoming calls on a theory of quantum meruit even if plaintiffs\n\nwere to prevail on their breach of contract claim.        Under the\n\ndoctrine of quantum meruit, one who renders goods or services in\n\nthe absence of an enforceable contract may be entitled to payment\n\nfor those services to the extent the recipient benefitted from\n\nthem.   See, e.g., Meng v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 693 N.E.2d 183, 187\n\nn.4 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998).      \"If the plaintiff is entitled to\n\nrecover on a contract, he cannot recover in quantum meruit.\"\n\nMarshall v. Stratus Pharms., Inc., 749 N.E.2d 698, 703 n.6 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2001).    Though we do not decide the question here, it\n\nwould similarly seem that where a defendant is clearly not due\n\npayment under the terms of an enforceable contract, such defendant\n\ncannot claim a right to payment under quantum meruit.    \"Where . .\n\n. there is an enforceable express or implied in fact contract that\n\nregulates the relations of the parties or that part of their\n\nrelations about which issues have arisen, there is no room for\n\nquasi contract.\"    A.L. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 1.20 (J.M.\n\nPerillo ed., rev'd ed. 1993).\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f     The district court's reliance on the doctrine of quantum\n\nmeruit led it to overlook questions of law and fact common to all\n\nclass members.   As plaintiffs' brief says, \"The plaintiffs' claims\n\nare based entirely on a standard form contract which the defendant\n\nused with every member of the class.\"        The common factual basis is\n\nfound in the terms of the contract, which are identical for all\n\nclass members.   The common question of law is whether those terms\n\nprecluded defendant from charging for incoming calls.\n\n     Cellular One's waiver defense is also common to the class.\n\n\"[A]ffirmative   defenses   should    be   considered   in   making     class\n\ncertification decisions.\"     Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 295.         Again, both\n\nthe factual basis for and the legal defense of waiver present\n\ncommon issues for all class members.7        All class members received\n\na user guide and monthly invoices showing that defendant charged\n\nthe class members for the incoming calls.\n\n     Even   in   the     unlikely    event    that   individual        waiver\n\ndeterminations   prove   necessary,    the   proposed   class    may    still\n\nsatisfy the predominance requirement.          See id. at 296.         Courts\n\ntraditionally have been reluctant to deny class action status under\n\nRule 23(b)(3) simply because affirmative defenses may be available\n\nagainst individual members.    E.g., 6A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 12:248,\n\n\n     7\n       At oral argument defendant first advanced and then wisely\nwithdrew the argument that oral representations made by sales\nrepresentatives to potential customers would vary the contract\nterms by customer and so defeat commonality.

See\n\ngenerally    Mowbray,   208   F.3d   at     295   (identifying   statute   of\n\nlimitations as an affirmative defense).\n\n     Instead, where common issues otherwise predominated, courts\n\nhave usually certified Rule 23(b)(3) classes even though individual\n\nissues were present in one or more affirmative defenses.               See,\n\ne.g., In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124,\n\n138-40 (2d Cir. 2001); Hoxworth, 980 F.2d at 924; Cameron, 547 F.2d\n\nat 477-78.    After all, Rule 23(b)(3) requires merely that common\n\nissues predominate, not that all issues be common to the class.             In\n\nre Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig., 148 F.3d 283,\n\n315 (3rd Cir. 1998); see 5 J.W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice §\n\n23.46[.1], at 23-206 to 23-207 (3d ed. 1997 & Supp. 2002).                 If,\n\nmoreover, evidence later shows that an affirmative defense is\n\nlikely to bar claims against at least some class members, then a\n\ncourt has available adequate procedural mechanisms.              In re Visa\n\nCheck/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d at 141 (describing\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fprocedural options and collecting authorities); 1 H. Newberg & A.\n\nConte, Newberg on Class Actions § 4.26, at 4-91 to 4-97 (3d ed.\n\n1992) (same).        For example, it can place class members with\n\npotentially barred claims in a separate subclass, 29A Fed. Proc.,\n\nL. Ed. 70:411 & n.69, Predominance of Common Issues (2002) (citing\n\ncases); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4)(B), or exclude them from the\n\nclass altogether, In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,\n\n280 F.3d at 141; 6A Fed. Proc., supra, § 12:248 & n.6 (citing\n\ncases).\n\n       Cellular One argues that even if there are common questions of\n\nlaw and fact, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndecertifying the class because individual issues predominate on\n\ndamages.      This is largely an issue of whether plaintiffs could use\n\na computer program to extract from Cellular One's computer records\n\ninformation about individual damages.          The district court viewed\n\nthis question as mostly beside the point and its decertification\n\norders rested mainly on other grounds.\n\n       The individuation of damages in consumer class actions is\n\nrarely determinative under Rule 23(b)(3).         Where, as here, common\n\nquestions predominate regarding liability,         then courts generally\n\nfind    the    predominance   requirement    to   be   satisfied   even   if\n\nindividual damages issues remain.

Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 905\n\n(9th Cir. 1975) (\"The amount of damages is invariably an individual\n\nquestion and does not defeat class action treatment.\").8\n\n     There is even less reason to decertify a class where the\n\npossible existence of individual damages issues is a matter of\n\nconjecture.     See Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 298-99.                  Common issues\n\npredominate     where    individual     factual     determinations      can    be\n\naccomplished    using    computer     records,    clerical    assistance,      and\n\nobjective criteria -- thus rendering unnecessary an evidentiary\n\nhearing on each claim.      See Roper v. Consurve, Inc., 578 F.2d 1106,\n\n1112 (5th Cir. 1978), aff'd on other grounds sub nom., Deposit\n\nGuar. Nat'l Bank v.

Cellular One argues that Smilow has not shown that she\n\ncould use defendant's computer records either to distinguish the\n\n\n\n     8\n        Courts have denied class certification where these\nindividual damages issues are especially complex or burdensome.\nSee 5 Moore, supra, § 23.46[2][b], at 23-209 & n.17. That does not\nappear to be the case here.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fsubset of incoming call recipients who exceeded their monthly\n\nallotment of \"free\" minutes or to calculate how much extra each\n\nclass member was charged as a result of receiving incoming calls.\n\n     The    plaintiffs'       expert,   Erik      Buchakian,     says he could\n\nfashion a computer program that would extract from Cellular One's\n\nrecords (1) a list of customers who received incoming calls during\n\nthe class period; (2) a list of customers who paid extra during the\n\nclass period because they were billed for incoming calls; and (3)\n\nactual damages for each class member during the class period.\n\nBuchakian    had    access     to   more    than    adequate        materials   --\n\nincluding    a     sample   computer       tape    and   the    deposition      of\n\ndefendant's expert -- and has more than adequate expertise --\n\ndegrees in business and computer science and thirteen years of\n\nrelevant    work    experience.         The    affidavits      of    defendant's\n\nexpert, Susan Quintiliani, are consistent with Buchakian's\n\nconclusions.\n\n     If    later   evidence    disproves      Buchakian's      proposition,     the\n\ndistrict court can at that stage modify or decertify the class, see\n\nGen. Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 160 (\"Even after a certification order\n\nis entered, the judge remains free to modify it in light of\n\nsubsequent developments in the litigation.\"), or use a variety of\n\nmanagement devices, In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,\n\n280 F.3d at 141; 1 Newberg & Conte, supra, § 4.26, at 4-91 to 4-97.\n\nIndeed, even if individualized determinations were necessary to\n\n                                     -16-\n\fcalculate damages, Rule (23)(c)(4)(A) would still allow the court\n\nto maintain the class action with respect to other issues.

Rule 23(b)(3) is intended to be a\n\nless stringent requirement than Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2).                     See\n\nAmchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 615 (\"Framed for situations in\n\nwhich class-action treatment is not as clearly called for as it is\n\nin Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) situations, Rule 23(b)(3) permits\n\ncertification where class suit may nevertheless be convenient and\n\ndesirable.\") (internal quotations omitted).                 The core purpose of\n\nRule 23(b)(3) is to vindicate the claims of consumers and other\n\ngroups of people whose individual claims would be too small to\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fwarrant litigation.9             See id. at 617 (\"While the text of Rule\n\n23(b)(3)       does   not   exclude      from        certification      cases   in   which\n\nindividual damages run high, the Advisory Committee had dominantly\n\nin   mind     vindication        of    the    rights     of    groups   of   people    who\n\nindividually would be without effective strength to bring their\n\nopponents into court at all.\") (internal quotations omitted); Mace,\n\n109 F.3d at 344 (\"The policy at the very core of the class action\n\nmechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not\n\nprovide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action\n\nprosecuting his or her rights.                A class action solves this problem\n\nby aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into\n\nsomething worth someone's (usually an attorney's) labor.\"); see\n\nalso       Roper,   445   U.S.    at    338    n.9     (\"A    significant    benefit   to\n\nclaimants who choose to litigate their individual claims in a\n\nclass-action context is the prospect of reducing their costs of\n\nlitigation, particularly attorney's fees, by allocating such costs\n\namong all members of the class who benefit from any recovery.\").\n\n       In this case, the claims of most if not all class members are\n\ntoo small to vindicate individually. Smilow, for example, received\n\n\n       9\n       Classes such as this one that are made up of consumers are\nespecially likely to satisfy the predominance requirement.      See\nAmchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 625 (observing that the\npredominance requirement is especially likely to be satisfied in\nconsumer fraud and antitrust actions); see also P. Venugopal, Note,\nThe Class Certification of Medical Monitoring Claims, 102 Colum.

The case turns on interpretation of the form\n\ncontract, executed by all class members and defendant.                    See W.D.\n\nHenderson,   Reconciling      the    Juridical   Links    Doctrine        with    the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure and Article III, 67 U. Chi. L.\n\nRev. 1347, 1373-74 (2000) (the fact that prospective class members\n\nsigned   nearly   identical    consumer      contracts    might,     in    itself,\n\nsatisfy the predominance requirement).\n\nb.   The Ch. 93A Class\n\n     The decertification of the ch. 93A class is similarly flawed:\n\nit also rests on the premise that individual inquiries would be\n\nrequired because \"services were received\" for the charges on\n\nincoming calls.\n\n     As plaintiffs' brief says, \"the Ch. 93A claim is not an oral\n\nmisrepresentation claim, but [is] based on the same standard form\n\ncontract which was signed by all class members.\"               See generally\n\nAnthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assoc., 583 N.E.2d 806, 821 (Mass.\n\n1991) (\"[C]onduct in disregard of known contractual arrangements\n\nand intended to secure benefits for the breaching party constitutes\n\nan unfair act or practice for ch. 93A purposes.\").                 Cellular One\n\npoints to law to the effect that a mere breach of contract is not\n\na ch. 93A violation.     See Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, 390\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fN.E.2d 243, 251 (Mass. 1979).       That defense, though, argues for,\n\nnot against, the commonality of liability issues.               Plaintiffs\n\ndisclaim any intent to rely on oral misrepresentations, and must\n\nadhere to that position or risk losing class status.10\n\n     Our prior discussion is adequate to dispose of any argument\n\nthat decertification would be required because of a need for\n\nindividual damages determinations. Since Smilow can compute actual\n\ndamages using a computer program, we need not address plaintiffs'\n\nargument that common issues would predominate only on a claim for\n\nstatutory damages, and not on a claim for individual damages.11            As\n\nto statutory damages, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that\n\nplaintiffs   who   cannot   show   actual   damages   under   ch.   93A   may\n\nnonetheless obtain statutory damages if liability is established.\n\nLeardi v. Brown, 474 N.E.2d 1094, 1101-02 (Mass. 1985) (awarding\n\nstatutory damages under ch. 93A § 9(3)).        This too supports class\n\n\n\n     10\n       We doubt that defendants will rely on oral representations.\nIf its sales representatives, familiar with the terms of the\ncontract, represented that there would be a charge for incoming\ncalls without notifying the consumers that the contract language\ncould be read differently, that could be viewed as evidence in\nplaintiffs' favor of an unfair or deceptive act.     If the sales\nrepresentatives represented that there would be no charge for\nincoming calls and the customer was charged, then that is also\nevidence in plaintiffs' favor.\n     11\n       Section 9 allows plaintiffs to recover the greater of actual\ndamages or twenty-five dollars; Section 11 allows plaintiffs to\nrecover actual damages. Both sections allow plaintiffs to recover\ndouble or treble damages if the violations were willful or knowing\nor if the refusal to grant relief upon demand was made in bad\nfaith. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §§ 9(3), 11.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fcertification.\n\n     We are left with the district court's concern that any ch. 93A\n\nclass would be composed of two groups:             a statutory damages group\n\nand an actual damages group.            But plaintiffs' position is that\n\nshould any conflict develop between the two groups, the action\n\nwould seek only statutory damages, class members would be given\n\nnotice to that effect, and those who wish to pursue individual\n\nclaims for actual damages could opt-out.               We agree this is an\n\noption and, in this context, the hypothetical conflict provides no\n\nbasis for decertification.\n\nc.   The Telecommunications Act Claim\n\n     Though the district court decertified the class for all\n\nclaims, Smilow's appellate briefs and oral argument completely\n\nignore its TCA claim.          Issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory\n\nmanner (or not at all) are waived.             Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co., 916\n\nF.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990).             Smilow has therefore waived her\n\nargument that the district court improperly decertified the class\n\nin the TCA claim.        See Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, 112\n\nF.3d 538, 563 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                        IV.\n\n     We    reverse     the    orders   decertifying   the    class   under    the\n\ncontract   and   ch.    93A    theories.      On   remand,   there   should    be\n\nreconsideration of the denial of class representative status to\n\nBibeau.    To the extent the denial rested on the decertification of\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fthe class, this opinion disposes of that ground. Costs are awarded\n\nto plaintiffs.

The putative class members are Massachusetts and New Hampshire residents who were charged for incoming calls despite having signed a standard form contract, used mainly between August 1994 and February 1996, purportedly guaranteeing free incoming call service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Class representative Jill Ann Smilow brought suit in 1997 for breach of contract and violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, &#167;&#167; 2(a), 9, 11 (West 1997), and the Telecommunications Act (TCA) of 1996, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 201(b) (2000). The district court first certified and then decertified the contract, ch. 93A, and TCA classes. This court vacated the decertification order and remanded; the district court subsequently reinstated its decertification order, <i>Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> No. 97-10307-REK (D.Mass. Apr.10, 2002) (memorandum and order). We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smilow and proposed class representative Margaret L. Bibeau each signed a standard form contract for cellular telephone services with Cellular One in 1995. The form contract says, \"Chargeable time for calls originated by a Mobile Subscriber Unit starts when the Mobile Subscriber Unit signals call initiation to C1's facilities and ends when the Mobile Subscriber Unit signals call disconnect to C1's facilities and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.\" The parties contest the meaning of \"originated.\" Smilow alleges that this language precludes Cellular One from charging for incoming calls. It is undisputed that a large group of Cellular One customers signed the same contract and were subject to charges for incoming calls. The contract contains an integration clause providing that changes must be in writing and signed by both parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smilow and Bibeau purport to represent a class of Massachusetts and New Hampshire residents who subscribed for Cellular One services under this contract. The potential class members all signed the standard form contract, which was in broad use from August 1994 to February 1996. They did have a variety of rate plans and usage patterns. Some Cellular One customers paid a flat fee for a fixed number of minutes each month and an additional per-minute charge if they exceeded this fixed amount of air time (for example, $40/ month for the first 300 minutes/month and 10 cents/minute thereafter). Many Cellular One customers paid different rates for day and night-time calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cellular One charged Smilow, Bibeau and the potential class members for incoming as well as outgoing calls. Smilow received just one incoming call; Bibeau received many incoming calls. Cellular One invoices clearly indicate that customers are charged for incoming calls. The user guide mailed to new Cellular One customers also states that the company charges for both incoming and outgoing calls. Bibeau paid her invoices knowing she was being charged for incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1997, Smilow, as a purported class representative, filed suit in federal district court against Cellular One for breach of contract and violations of ch. 93A and the TCA. The district court had jurisdiction over the federal claims under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 (2000) and over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367. The district court originally certified the ch. 93A, breach of contract, and TCA classes on October 9, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court rejected an initial attempt to decertify the classes for Smilow's incoming-calls claims. The court, with the approval of both parties, then filed a scheduling order on November 23, 1999 bifurcating the liability and damages issues on the incoming calls claims and providing that liability would be litigated to conclusion before further discovery or other activities concerning damages took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 15, 2000, the district court held an \"evidentiary hearing\" on plaintiffs' motion to substitute Bibeau as a new class representative. Cellular One had opposed this motion partly on the grounds that, because common issues of fact did not predominate among the class members, neither Bibeau nor any other individual could properly represent the class. Both parties stated that they regarded the evidentiary record as adequate to allow the court to rule on plaintiffs' motion and did not wish to make additional submissions on this issue. Nonetheless, the district court issued a memorandum and order on December 1, 2000 extending the time period to submit evidence on the designation of Bibeau as a new class representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2001, the district court granted defendants' pending motion to decertify the \"incoming call\" class, on the grounds that common issues of fact do not predominate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 200 F.R.D. 5, 9 (D.Mass.2001).

Proof of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an amount of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded in the face of (i) a strong likelihood that services were received in return for the billed payments and (ii) lack of admissible evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' assertions that causation will turn out to be \"a common issue,\" and that the amount of damages calculable from defendant's records will \"not be reasonably disputable,\" are not likely to be consistent with the record in this case after further discovery, regardless of how much longer the court allows for further discovery. To be a \"common issue\" in the relevant sense, the issue must be one that does not require separate dispute resolution processes for different individuals who are said to have claims in \"common.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 8. The court held that additional discovery would not enable plaintiffs to show that common issues predominate for causation and damages. The court opined that separate damages hearings would be required for individual plaintiffs because (1) \"services were received in return for the billed payments\" and (2) particular class members had different plans and usage patterns. Although the opinion and order purported to decertify all incoming-call class claims, it contained no reasoning about the ch. 93A or TCA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its March 22 opinion, the court also denied Bibeau's motion to become a designated class representative. <i>Id.</i> at 6. The district court provided little explanation of its decision to deny the motion to designate Bibeau as a class representative.

The court then dismissed the ch. 93A claim class action on two grounds. First, the court held that the class members would fall into two groups: those who waived actual damages in favor of statutory damages of $25 and those who claimed actual damages. The court fell back on its original reasoning as to why the fact that actual damages could be easily calculated by computer was irrelevant. Second, the court held that individual issues predominated on causation. Here, it relied on its earlier rationale that, whatever the common contractual language, \"services were received in return for the billed payments.\" Although the district court purported to be addressing issues of causation, it again referred to supposed individual differences in the damages calculations to show why causation had no common issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge also denied plaintiffs' renewed motion to designate Bibeau as a class representative on the grounds that she had not \"suffered the same injury as the class.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs again appealed.

A district court abuses its discretion when it relies significantly on an improper factor, omits a significant factor, or makes a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <i>See Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp.,</i> 148 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 1998). An abuse of discretion also occurs if the court adopts an incorrect legal rule. <i>Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v.

To obtain class certification, the plaintiff must establish the four elements of Rule 23(a) and one of several elements of Rule 23(b). <i>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor,</i> 521 U.S. 591, 614, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997). The Rule 23(a) elements are (1) numerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) adequacy of representation. <i>Id.</i> at 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231.

Once these errors are corrected, it becomes clear that common issues as to both liability and damages predominate on the elements of the breach of contract and ch. 93A claims. We first consider the contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Breach of Contract Claim</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first error was initially contained in the following statement from the district court's March 22, 2001 opinion decertifying the class:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an amount of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded in the face of (i) a strong likelihood that services were received in return for billed payments and (ii) lack of admissible evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Smilow,</i> 200 F.R.D. at 8. In its April 10, 2002 memorandum and order after remand, the district court repeated this language and stated that it thought this analysis correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this statement we understand the district court to have believed that the defendant would be entitled to payment for incoming calls on a theory of quantum meruit even if plaintiffs were to prevail on their breach of contract claim. Under the doctrine of quantum meruit, one who renders goods or services in the absence of an enforceable contract may be entitled to payment for those services to the extent the recipient benefitted from them. <i>See, e.g., Meng v. Trs. of Boston Univ.,</i> 44 Mass.App.Ct. 650, 693 N.E.2d 183, 187 n. 4 (1998). \"If the plaintiff is entitled to recover on a contract, he cannot recover in quantum meruit.\" <i>Marshall v.</i> <i>Stratus Pharms., Inc.,</i> 51 Mass.App.Ct. 667, 749 N.E.2d 698, 703 n. 6 (2001). Though we do not decide the question here, it would similarly seem that where a defendant is clearly not due payment under the terms of an enforceable contract, such defendant cannot claim a right to payment under quantum meruit. \"Where... there is an enforceable express or implied in fact contract that regulates the relations of the parties or that part of their relations about which issues have arisen, there is no room for quasi contract.\" A.L. Corbin, <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> &#167; 1.20 (J.M. Perillo ed., rev'd ed.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reliance on the doctrine of quantum meruit led it to overlook questions of law and fact common to all class members. As plaintiffs' brief says, \"The plaintiffs' claims are based entirely on a standard form contract which the defendant used with every member of the class.\" The common factual basis is found in the terms of the contract, which are identical for all class members. The common question of law is whether those terms precluded defendant from charging for incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cellular One's waiver defense is also common to the class. \"[A]ffirmative defenses should be considered in making class certification decisions.\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 295. Again, both the factual basis for and the legal defense of waiver present common issues for all class members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> All class members received a user guide and monthly invoices showing that defendant charged the class members for the incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in the unlikely event that individual waiver determinations prove necessary, the proposed class may still satisfy the predominance requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 296. Courts traditionally have been reluctant to deny class action status under Rule 23(b)(3) simply because affirmative defenses may be available against individual members. <i>E.g.,</i> 6A Fed. Proc., L.Ed. &#167; 12:248, <i>Defenses to Individual Members' Claims</i> (2002) (citing cases); 32B Am. Jur.2d <i>Federal Courts</i> &#167; 2018 &amp; n. 1 (2002) (citing cases); <i>see, e.g., Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co.,</i> 980 F.2d 912, 924 (3d Cir.1992) (\"Given a sufficient nucleus of common questions, the presence of the individual issue of compliance with the statute of limitations has not prevented certification of class actions in securities cases.\") (internal quotation omitted); <i>Cameron v. E.M. Adams &amp; Co.,</i> 547 F.2d 473, 478 (9th Cir.1976) (same). <i>See generally Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 295 (identifying statute of limitations as an affirmative defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, where common issues otherwise predominated, courts have usually certified Rule 23(b)(3) classes even though individual issues were present in one or more affirmative defenses. <i>See, e.g., In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,</i> 280 F.3d 124, 138-40 (2d Cir. 2001); <i>Hoxworth,</i> 980 F.2d at 924; <i>Cameron,</i> 547 F.2d at 477-78. After all, Rule 23(b)(3) requires merely that common issues predominate, not that all issues be common to the class. <i>In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig.,</i> 148 F.3d 283, 315 (3rd Cir.1998); <i>see</i> 5 J.W. Moore, <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 23.46[.1], at 23-206 to 23-207 (3d ed. 1997 &amp; Supp.2002). If, moreover, evidence later shows that an affirmative defense is likely to bar claims against at least some class members, then a court has available adequate procedural mechanisms. <i>In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,</i> 280 F.3d at 141 (describing procedural options and collecting authorities); 1 H. Newberg &amp; A. Conte, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> &#167; 4.26, at 4-91 to 4-97 (3d ed.1992) (same). For example, it can place class members with potentially barred claims in a separate subclass, 29A Fed. Proc., L.Ed. 70:411 &amp; n. 69, <i>Predominance of Common Issues</i> (2002) (citing cases); <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4)(B), or exclude them from the class altogether, <i>In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,</i> 280 F.3d at 141; 6A Fed.

This is largely an issue of whether plaintiffs could use a computer program to extract from Cellular One's computer records information about individual damages. The district court viewed this question as mostly beside the point and its decertification orders rested mainly on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individuation of damages in consumer class actions is rarely determinative under Rule 23(b)(3). Where, as here, common questions predominate regarding liability, then courts generally find the predominance requirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain. <i>In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,</i> 280 F.3d at 139; <i>Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp.,</i> 561 F.2d 434, 456 (3d Cir.1977); <i>Gold Strike Stamp Co. v.

Common issues predominate where individual factual determinations can be accomplished using computer records, clerical assistance, and objective criteria &#8212; thus rendering unnecessary an evidentiary hearing on each claim. <i>See Roper v.

Cellular One argues that Smilow has not shown that she could use defendant's computer records either to distinguish the subset of incoming call recipients who exceeded their monthly allotment of \"free\" minutes or to calculate how much extra each class member was charged as a result of receiving incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' expert, Erik Buchakian, says he could fashion a computer program that would extract from Cellular One's records (1) a list of customers who received incoming calls during the class period; (2) a list of customers who paid extra during the class period because they were billed for incoming calls; and (3) actual damages for each class member during the class period. Buchakian had access to more than adequate materials &#8212; including a sample computer tape and the deposition of defendant's expert &#8212; and has more than adequate expertise &#8212; degrees in business and computer science and thirteen years of relevant work experience. The affidavits of defendant's expert, Susan Quintiliani, are consistent with Buchakian's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If later evidence disproves Buchakian's proposition, the district court can at that stage modify or decertify the class, <i>see Gen. Tel.

Indeed, even if individualized determinations were necessary to calculate damages, Rule (23)(c)(4)(A) would still allow the court to maintain the class action with respect to other issues. <i>See, e.g., In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,</i> 280 F.3d at 141; <i>Sterling v. Velsicol Chem. Corp.,</i> 855 F.2d 1188, 1197 (6th Cir.1988); <i>Jenkins v.

The class certification prerequisites should be construed in light of the underlying objectives of class actions. S.S. Partridge &amp; K.J.

That defense, though, argues for, not against, the commonality of liability issues.

Since Smilow can compute actual damages using a computer program, we need not address plaintiffs' argument that common issues would predominate only on a claim for statutory damages, and not on a claim for individual damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> As to statutory damages, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that plaintiffs who cannot show actual damages under ch. 93A may nonetheless obtain statutory damages if liability is established. <i>Leardi v. Brown,</i> 394 Mass. 151, 474 N.E.2d 1094, 1101-02 (1985) (awarding statutory damages under ch. 93A &#167; 9(3)).

But plaintiffs' position is that should any conflict develop between the two groups, the action would seek only statutory damages, class members would be given notice to that effect, and those who wish to pursue individual claims for actual damages could opt-out. We agree this is an option and, in this context, the hypothetical conflict provides no basis for decertification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>The Telecommunications Act Claim</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court decertified the class for all claims, Smilow's appellate briefs and oral argument completely ignore its TCA claim.

The putative class members are Massachusetts and New Hampshire residents who were charged for incoming calls despite having signed a standard form contract, used mainly between August 1994 and February 1996, purportedly guaranteeing free incoming call service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Class representative Jill Ann Smilow brought suit in 1997 for breach of contract and violations of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, &#167;&#167; 2(a), 9, 11 (West 1997), and the Telecommunications Act (TCA) of 1996, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 201(b) (2000). The district court first certified and then decertified the contract, ch. 93A, and TCA classes. This court vacated the decertification order and remanded; the district court subsequently reinstated its decertification order, <i>Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> No. 97-10307-REK (D.Mass. Apr.10, 2002) (memorandum and order). We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smilow and proposed class representative Margaret L. Bibeau each signed a standard form contract for cellular telephone services with Cellular One in 1995. The form contract says, \"Chargeable time for calls originated by a Mobile Subscriber Unit starts when the Mobile Subscriber Unit signals call initiation to C1's facilities and ends when the Mobile Subscriber Unit signals call disconnect to C1's facilities and the call disconnect signal has been confirmed.\" The parties contest the meaning of \"originated.\" Smilow alleges that this language precludes Cellular One from charging for incoming calls. It is undisputed that a large group of Cellular One customers signed the same contract and were subject to charges for incoming calls. The contract contains an integration clause providing that changes must be in writing and signed by both parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smilow and Bibeau purport to represent a class of Massachusetts and New Hampshire residents who subscribed for Cellular One services under this contract. The potential class members all signed the standard form contract, which was in broad use from August 1994 to February 1996. They did have a variety of rate plans and usage patterns. Some Cellular One customers paid a flat fee for a fixed number of minutes each month and an additional per-minute charge if they exceeded this fixed amount of air time (for example, $40/ month for the first 300 minutes/month and 10 cents/minute thereafter). Many Cellular One customers paid different rates for day and night-time calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cellular One charged Smilow, Bibeau and the potential class members for incoming as well as outgoing calls. Smilow received just one incoming call; Bibeau received many incoming calls. Cellular One invoices clearly indicate that customers are charged for incoming calls. The user guide mailed to new Cellular One customers also states that the company charges for both incoming and outgoing calls. Bibeau paid her invoices knowing she was being charged for incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 11, 1997, Smilow, as a purported class representative, filed suit in federal district court against Cellular One for breach of contract and violations of ch. 93A and the TCA. The district court had jurisdiction over the federal claims under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 (2000) and over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367. The district court originally certified the ch. 93A, breach of contract, and TCA classes on October 9, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court rejected an initial attempt to decertify the classes for Smilow's incoming-calls claims. The court, with the approval of both parties, then filed a scheduling order on November 23, 1999 bifurcating the liability and damages issues on the incoming calls claims and providing that liability would be litigated to conclusion before further discovery or other activities concerning damages took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 15, 2000, the district court held an \"evidentiary hearing\" on plaintiffs' motion to substitute Bibeau as a new class representative. Cellular One had opposed this motion partly on the grounds that, because common issues of fact did not predominate among the class members, neither Bibeau nor any other individual could properly represent the class. Both parties stated that they regarded the evidentiary record as adequate to allow the court to rule on plaintiffs' motion and did not wish to make additional submissions on this issue. Nonetheless, the district court issued a memorandum and order on December 1, 2000 extending the time period to submit evidence on the designation of Bibeau as a new class representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 2001, the district court granted defendants' pending motion to decertify the \"incoming call\" class, on the grounds that common issues of fact do not predominate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 9 (D.Mass.2001). The court explained its conclusion that individual issues predominated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof that many persons (even if not as many as 275,000) were billed for and paid charges for incoming calls in many months is not enough to show that any specific amount of damages could properly be found by a finder of facts at trial, or that any aggregate amount could properly be found. Proof of charges and payments is not evidence of harm or an amount of harm on the basis of which damages could be awarded in the face of (i) a strong likelihood that services were received in return for the billed payments and (ii) lack of admissible evidence to rebut that strong likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' assertions that causation will turn out to be \"a common issue,\" and that the amount of damages calculable from defendant's records will \"not be reasonably disputable,\" are not likely to be consistent with the record in this case after further discovery, regardless of how much longer the court allows for further discovery. To be a \"common issue\" in the relevant sense, the issue must be one that does not require separate dispute resolution processes for different individuals who are said to have claims in \"common.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 8. The court held that additional discovery would not enable plaintiffs to show that common issues predominate for causation and damages. The court opined that separate damages hearings would be required for individual plaintiffs because (1) \"services were received in return for the billed payments\" and (2) particular class members had different plans and usage patterns. Although the opinion and order purported to decertify all incoming-call class claims, it contained no reasoning about the ch. 93A or TCA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its March 22 opinion, the court also denied Bibeau's motion to become a designated class representative. <i>Id.</i> at 6. The district court provided little explanation of its decision to deny the motion to designate Bibeau as a class representative. It merely observed that the motion was \"inadequately supported on the record before the court and thus also not effective to defeat the defense motion to decertify.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs sought discretionary appellate review of the decertification order, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(f). On July 12, 2001, this court vacated the entire March 22, 2001 decertification order, noting that the district court had not addressed the ch. 93A claim. <i>Smilow v. S.W.

Apr.10, 2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district court reinstated its March 22, 2001 decertification order, quoting the order at length and stating that its earlier reasoning was correct. The court then dismissed the ch. 93A claim class action on two grounds. First, the court held that the class members would fall into two groups: those who waived actual damages in favor of statutory damages of $25 and those who claimed actual damages. The court fell back on its original reasoning as to why the fact that actual damages could be easily calculated by computer was irrelevant. Second, the court held that individual issues predominated on causation. Here, it relied on its earlier rationale that, whatever the common contractual language, \"services were received in return for the billed payments.\" Although the district court purported to be addressing issues of causation, it again referred to supposed individual differences in the damages calculations to show why causation had no common issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge also denied plaintiffs' renewed motion to designate Bibeau as a class representative on the grounds that she had not \"suffered the same injury as the class.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs again appealed.

Under the doctrine of quantum meruit, one who renders goods or services in the absence of an enforceable contract may be entitled to payment for those services to the extent the recipient benefitted from them. <i>See, e.g., Meng v.

Though we do not decide the question here, it would similarly seem that where a defendant is clearly not due payment under the terms of an enforceable contract, such defendant cannot claim a right to payment under quantum meruit. \"Where... there is an enforceable express or implied in fact contract that regulates the relations of the parties or that part of their relations about which issues have arisen, there is no room for quasi contract.\" A.L.

As plaintiffs' brief says, \"The plaintiffs' claims are based entirely on a standard form contract which the defendant used with every member of the class.\" The common factual basis is found in the terms of the contract, which are identical for all class members. The common question of law is whether those terms precluded defendant from charging for incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cellular One's waiver defense is also common to the class. \"[A]ffirmative defenses should be considered in making class certification decisions.\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 295. Again, both the factual basis for and the legal defense of waiver present common issues for all class members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> All class members received a user guide and monthly invoices showing that defendant charged the class members for the incoming calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in the unlikely event that individual waiver determinations prove necessary, the proposed class may still satisfy the predominance requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 296.

We agree this is an option and, in this context, the hypothetical conflict provides no basis for decertification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>The Telecommunications Act Claim</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court decertified the class for all claims, Smilow's appellate briefs and oral argument completely ignore its TCA claim.

This court's July 12, 2001 judgment vacated the first decertification order in its entirety; it did not affirm on (or address) the breach of contract or TCA classes or the ch. 93A actual damages class theory. The April 10, 2002 order, which reinstated the March 22, 2001 order, again decertified the contract, TCA, and ch. 93A classes.
