F. Dennis Saylor IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                  Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n                    and DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     John P. Donohue with whom Fuller, Rosenberg, Palmer &\nBeliveau, LLP was on brief for appellant.\n     Robert A. Bertsche, with whom Amy E. Serino and Prince, Lobel,\nGlovsky & Tye LLP, were on brief for the appellee.\n\n\n\n                           February 23, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           DiClerico, District Judge.         Stacy Stanton has appealed\n\nthe dismissal of her state-law defamation action against Metro\n\nCorp., which arises out of the publication of her photograph\n\nalongside an article entitled “The Mating Habits of the Suburban\n\nHigh School Teenager.”        The district court dismissed Stanton’s\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be\n\ngranted based on the conclusion that the publication was not\n\ndefamatory as a matter of law.       Because we believe this conclusion\n\nwas   erroneous,   and    because   Metro’s   alternative   arguments   for\n\naffirmance are not well-founded, we reverse the decision of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                     I.\n\n           Metro Corporation publishes Boston magazine, a monthly\n\ngeneral interest publication that ran the article in question in\n\nits May 2003 issue.         The cover of the magazine refers to the\n\narticle with the phrase, “Fast Times at Silver Lake High:        Teen Sex\n\nin the Suburbs.”         Inside, Stanton is one of five young people\n\npictured in a photograph that occupies the entire first page of the\n\narticle and half of the facing page.          The photograph, taken at a\n\nhigh school dance, depicts its three male and two female subjects\n\nin formal attire, sitting and standing near an open exit door in\n\nthe background.     Stanton’s image occupies most of the left-hand\n\nside of the photograph, where she appears standing, with her face\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fand most of her body fully visible.      Although three of the subjects\n\nare smoking cigarettes, and another holds a plastic cup, Stanton\n\nsimply looks at the camera, smiling faintly.\n\n              The other half of the facing page consists of a column of\n\ntext of varying sizes, including the aforementioned headline, which\n\nappears in the largest font and takes up most of the column.         A\n\n“superhead,” appearing above the headline in a smaller font, reads:\n\n“They hook up online.     They hook up in real life.   With prom season\n\nlooming, meet your kids–-they might know more about sex than you\n\ndo.”       Below the headline, one and a half paragraphs of text from\n\nthe article are set forth in yet smaller type, ending with an arrow\n\nindicating that the story continues onto the following page.       The\n\nbyline and photography credit appear at the very bottom of the\n\ncolumn in lettering larger than that of the main text, but smaller\n\nthan that of the headline.\n\n              Just above the byline, and just below the main article\n\ntext, the following appears in italicized type:         “The photos on\n\nthese pages are from an award-winning five-year project on teen\n\nsexuality taken by photojournalist Dan Habib.          The individuals\n\npictured are unrelated to the people or events described in this\n\nstory.      The names of the teenagers interviewed for this story have\n\nbeen changed.”1      These words are rendered in the smallest font on\n\n\n       1\n      Because the parties and the district court refer to this\nstatement as “the disclaimer,” we adopt the same shorthand for\npurposes of our discussion here.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthe page, which is otherwise devoid of text that explains the\n\nphotograph or identifies its subjects.2                    Stanton alleges that she\n\ndid not participate in any such “project on teen sexuality.”\n\n              The      first    few    paragraphs     of     the    article   relate    a\n\nconversation among four teenagers from a suburban Boston high\n\nschool, including “Nicole,” described as a “pretty Keri Russell-\n\nlook-alike . . .” and “Christine, a curly-haired pixie in the\n\nunder-90 weight range . . . .”                Nicole is quoted as saying, “All\n\nwe ever do is go hang out and get drunk, like, all the time, and\n\nyou   know,      hook    up,”   not    generally      with    steady    boyfriends     or\n\ngirlfriends, but “with whoever [sic]” after drinking at small\n\ngatherings.         The article goes on to explain that the euphemism\n\n“hook     up,”    as    teens    use   it,    “can    mean    anything    from      sexual\n\nintercourse to oral sex to serious touching or just kissing.”\n\n              As these introductory paragraphs suggest, the thrust of\n\nthe story is that teenagers in the greater Boston area have become\n\nmore sexually promiscuous over the span of the last decade.                            The\n\narticle draws support for this thesis from both statistical and\n\nanecdotal evidence, including interviews with a number of local\n\nhigh school students.           As to the possible causes for the trend, the\n\narticle    considers       a    “hypersexual”        popular       culture,   the   ready\n\n\n\n      2\n      The article, which in its entirety occupies all or part of\nseven pages, includes four additional photographs of young people,\nnone of which is accompanied by a caption or other explanatory\ntext.\n\n                                             -4-\n\favailability    of     sexual    encounters      and    pornography    over   the\n\nInternet, ineffective sex education programs, and peer pressure.\n\n           The story also declares that high school has replaced\n\ncollege   as   the    time   for   sexual     experimentation,       describes   a\n\nprofound ignorance among teens about sexually transmitted diseases,\n\nand notes a related trend of increased sexual aggression among high\n\nschool boys.         Parents, for their part, remain “overwhelmingly\n\nclueless,” according to the article.                   Nevertheless, the story\n\ncloses with the observation that some teens are “holding out hope”\n\nfor   emotionally       rewarding       sexual    relationships,       including\n\n“Jessica,” one of the teenagers from the group described at the\n\nbeginning of the article.\n\n           Stanton,      who    lives    in    Manchester,     New    Hampshire,\n\nresponded to the appearance of her photograph with the article by\n\nfiling suit against Metro in Massachusetts state court.                 Metro, a\n\nPennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business also\n\nin that state, duly removed the action to the district court.\n\n           Stanton’s amended complaint asserts two counts: invasion\n\nof privacy in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B, and\n\ncommon-law defamation.          Stanton alleges that the publication was\n\ndefamatory in that “[t]he juxtaposition of [her] photograph and the\n\ntext describing suburban teenage promiscuity . . . insinuated that\n\n[she] was engaged in the activity described in the article . . . .”\n\nShe also alleged that the disclaimer was itself defamatory in\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\ffalsely identifying her as a subject of the photographer’s “project\n\non teen sexuality.”          The district court granted Metro’s motion to\n\ndismiss on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a\n\nclaim on which relief could be granted.                  This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n           We review the district court’s grant of the motion to\n\ndismiss de novo.       SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodriguez, 415 F.3d 135, 138\n\n(1st Cir.) (citing Greene v. Rhode Island, 398 F.3d 45, 48 (1st\n\nCir. 2005)), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 829 (2005).                        This task\n\nrequires   that    we     accept       as    true      the   well-pleaded    factual\n\nallegations of the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of the non-moving party.               Id. at 138-39.        As the district\n\ncourt did, we also consider the allegedly defamatory article\n\nitself, which Metro submitted as an attachment to its motion to\n\ndismiss.   See Fudge v. Penthouse Int’l, Ltd., 840 F.2d 1012, 1015\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).       “‘A complaint should not be dismissed unless it\n\nis apparent beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of\n\nfacts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.’”\n\nGreene, 398 F.3d at 48 (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-\n\n46 (1957)).\n\n           Stanton has appealed only the dismissal of her defamation\n\nclaim.   Furthermore, she has appealed the dismissal of that claim\n\nonly   insofar    as    it    arises    out       of   the   juxtaposition   of   her\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fphotograph with the article; she does not contest the district\n\ncourt’s determination that the disclaimer was not independently\n\ndefamatory in misidentifying her as a participant in the teen\n\nsexuality study.         We limit our review accordingly.           See, e.g.,\n\nExec. Leasing Corp. v. Banco Popular de P.R., 48 F.3d 66, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n\n\n                                     III.\n\n              To succeed on a defamation claim under Massachusetts law,\n\na plaintiff must show that the defendant was at fault for the\n\npublication of a false statement of and concerning the plaintiff\n\nwhich   was    capable    of   damaging    his   or   her   reputation   in   the\n\ncommunity and which either caused economic loss or is actionable\n\nwithout proof of economic loss.           White v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield\n\nof Mass., Inc., 442 Mass. 64, 66, 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036 (Mass.\n\n2004); see also Yohe v. Nugent, 321 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(applying Massachusetts law); Ravnikar v. Bogojavlensky, 438 Mass.\n\n627, 629-30, 782 N.E.2d 508, 510-511 (Mass. 2003).              Metro moved to\n\ndismiss Stanton’s complaint on the grounds that (1) the publication\n\nwas not defamatory, i.e., capable of damaging her reputation, as a\n\nmatter of law, (2) any defamatory statement was not “of and\n\nconcerning” her, (3) Metro could not have acted negligently in\n\npublishing the article, and (4) Stanton failed to allege that the\n\narticle contained any false statement of fact.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          The district court accepted two of these arguments,\n\nruling that “the defamatory statements at issue are not ‘of and\n\nconcerning’   [Stanton],   and   are    not   reasonably   capable   of   a\n\ndefamatory meaning.”   357 F. Supp. 2d 369, 382 (D. Mass. 2005).          In\n\nreaching these conclusions, the district court relied heavily on\n\nthe disclaimer appearing at the bottom of the first column of the\n\narticle, i.e., “[t]he individuals pictured are unrelated to the\n\npeople or events described in this story.”          In fact, the district\n\ncourt stated that it would “first consider the juxtaposition of the\n\nphotograph and the text without the disclaimer, and then turn to\n\nthe impact of the disclaimer” in considering whether the article\n\nmade a defamatory statement about Stanton.          Id. at 378.\n\n          Bifurcating the article in this fashion, the district\n\ncourt determined that, absent the disclaimer, “a reasonable reader\n\ncould conclude that the teenage girl depicted in the photograph is\n\nsexually active and engages in at least some form of sexual\n\nmisconduct.” Id. at 381. Nevertheless, the district court went on\n\nto explain that it was “forced to conclude that the disclaimer\n\nadequately negates the negative connotations about [the] plaintiff\n\notherwise arising from the article and the photograph, at least in\n\nthe mind of the reasonable reader.”           Id.    We believe that the\n\ndistrict court’s calculus placed undue weight on the disclaimer in\n\ncontravention of Massachusetts law.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            We begin by focusing on the appropriate inquiry.          We are\n\nnot called upon to determine the ultimate issue of whether the\n\narticle is defamatory, but to answer the “threshold question” of\n\n“‘whether    [the]   communication    is   reasonably   susceptible    of    a\n\ndefamatory meaning . . . .’”         Amrak Prods., Inc. v. Morton, 410\n\nF.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Phelan v. May Dep’t Stores\n\nCo., 443 Mass. 52, 56-57, 819 N.E.2d 550, 554 (Mass. 2004)).                If\n\nthe answer to this question is “yes,” then the ultimate issue of\n\nwhether the article is defamatory is not the court’s to decide:\n\n“‘[w]here the communication is susceptible of both a defamatory and\n\nnondefamatory meaning, a question of fact exists for the jury.’”\n\nPhelan, 443 Mass. at 56-57, 819 N.E.2d at 554 (quoting Jones v.\n\nTaibbi, 400 Mass. 786, 791-92, 512 N.E.2d 260, 264 (Mass. 1987));\n\nsee also Draghetti v. Chmielewski, 416 Mass. 808, 811, 626 N.E.2d\n\n862, 866 (Mass. 1994); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 614 (1977).\n\nIf the answer is “no,” however, the defamation claim should be\n\ndismissed.    See Amrak, 410 F.3d at 72 (citing Brauer v. Globe\n\nNewspaper Co., 351 Mass. 53, 55, 217 N.E.2d 736, 738 (Mass. 1966)).\n\n            “A communication is susceptible to defamatory meaning if\n\nit ‘would tend to hold the plaintiff up to scorn, hatred, ridicule\n\nor contempt, in the minds of any considerable and respectable\n\nsegment in the community.’” Amrak, 410 F.3d at 72 (quoting Phelan,\n\n443 Mass. at 56, 819 N.E.2d at 553) (further internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see also Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am.\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fBar Ass’n, 142 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying Massachusetts\n\nlaw); Milgroom v. News Group Boston, Inc., 412 Mass. 9, 12, 586\n\nN.E.2d 985, 988 (Mass. 1992); Smith v. Suburban Rests., Inc., 374\n\nMass. 528, 529, 373 N.E.2d 215, 217 (Mass. 1978); Stone v. Essex\n\nCounty Newspapers, 367 Mass. 849, 853, 330 N.E.2d 161, 165 (Mass.\n\n1975).    In making this assessment, however, “[t]he communication\n\nmust be interpreted reasonably,” and can be ruled defamatory only\n\nif it would lead “a reasonable reader to conclude that it conveyed\n\na defamatory meaning.”       Amrak, 410 F.3d at 72 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see also Foley v. Lowell Sun Publ’g Co., 404 Mass.\n\n9, 11, 533 N.E.2d 196, 197 (Mass. 1989); Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts § 563 cmt. c (1977).\n\n             Although the district court correctly articulated these\n\nprinciples in its decision, it strayed from them in analyzing the\n\npublication at issue. The district court reasoned that, since “the\n\ndisclaimer directly contradicts the otherwise-defamatory connection\n\nbetween   the   photograph    and   the    text,”   the   article   could   be\n\nsusceptible to a defamatory meaning only if “a reasonable reader\n\nwould overlook the disclaimer, misunderstand it, or fail to give it\n\ncredence.”      357 F. Supp. 2d at 381.        According to the district\n\ncourt, no reasonable reader could do so because the disclaimer\n\nappears on the first page of the article and “[c]ertainly, the\n\nreasonable (or average) reader can be expected to read at least the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\ffirst page of a six-page article.”     Id.   It was here that the\n\ndistrict court erred.\n\n          While we acknowledge that the position of an item in a\n\nnewspaper or magazine can bear on the question of defamatory\n\nimport, see Robert D. Sack, Sack on Defamation:    Libel, Slander,\n\nand Related Problems § 2.4.2, at 2-19 (2004), we cannot assume, as\n\nthe district court did, that placing a disclaimer on the first page\n\nof an article itself ensures that a reasonable reader will see it.\n\nInstead, we must examine the article “‘in its totality in the\n\ncontext in which it was uttered or published’” and “‘consider all\n\nthe words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence.’”\n\nAmrak, 410 F.3d at 73 (quoting Foley, 404 Mass. at 11, 533 N.E.2d\n\nat 197) (further internal quotation marks omitted); see also Salvo\n\nv. Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., 57 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 260, 782 N.E.2d\n\n535, 540 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 563\n\ncmt. d (1977). Likewise, though we must “give weight to cautionary\n\nterms used by the person publishing the statement,” Myers v. Boston\n\nMagazine Co., 380 Mass. 336, 341-42, 403 N.E.2d 376, 379 (Mass.\n\n1980), the non-defamatory character of a statement will rarely\n\ndepend solely on the presence of qualifying language.   See, e.g.,\n\nCole v. Westinghouse Broad. Co., 386 Mass. 303, 309-12, 435 N.E.2d\n\n1021, 1025-27 (Mass. 1982) (considering speaker’s characterization\n\nof statement about plaintiff’s firing as “unofficial” as one factor\n\nin whether statement defamatory); Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f§ 563 cmt. c (1977) (“A conditional or alternative statement may be\n\ndefamatory if, notwithstanding its conditional or alternative form\n\nit is reasonably understood in a defamatory sense.”).\n\n           Here, the disclaimer occupies the field between the body\n\nof the story and the byline, making it easy enough to overlook\n\nbetween   the   larger   fonts   of    both.3   The   disclaimer   is   also\n\nseparated from the column of text by a horizontal line, accompanied\n\nby an arrow directing the reader to turn to the next page, where\n\nthe story continues. We cannot say that no reasonable reader would\n\nfollow this visual signal and simply flip to the next page after\n\nreading the entirety of the text on the first page, but before\n\nreaching the disclaimer.\n\n           Nor can we say that any reasonable reader who notices the\n\ndisclaimer would necessarily read the crucial second sentence,\n\ni.e., “[t]he individuals pictured are unrelated to the people or\n\nevents described in this story.”         It is at least conceivable that\n\na reader might take the first sentence of the disclaimer, which\n\nstates that “[t]he photos on these pages are from an award-winning\n\nfive-year project on teen sexuality by photojournalist Dan Habib,”\n\nas a satisfactory explanation of the photographs and therefore stop\n\nreading the disclaimer before the second sentence.          Such a reader\n\n\n\n     3\n      When the first page of the article is reproduced on standard\n8½-by-11-inch paper, the three sentences of the disclaimer together\ntake up only one-half of a column inch, contrasted with the five\nand one-half column inches consumed by the headline and superhead.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fwould thus remain under the impression that the teenagers depicted\n\nin the photograph have some connection to the accompanying story.\n\n          Beyond the text and layout of the article itself, we must\n\nalso consider “‘the medium by which the statement is disseminated\n\nand the audience to which it is published’” in assessing its\n\namenability to a defamatory meaning.

We note in\n\nthis regard that the story appeared in Boston magazine, which Metro\n\ndescribes as “a general interest regional magazine . . . .”   As the\n\nRestatement notes with regard to similar periodicals, “the public\n\nfrequently reads only the headline of the article or reads the\n\narticle itself so hastily or imperfectly as not to realize its full\n\nsignificance.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 563, cmt. d (1977).\n\nIn light of this observation, we agree with the district court that\n\n“some percentage of readers who see the article, particularly\n\ncasual readers who only glance at it or skim it, will ignore the\n\ndisclaimer.”   357 F. Supp. 2d at 381.\n\n          We have difficulty, however, in reconciling this aspect\n\nof the district court’s analysis with its conclusion that no\n\nreasonable reader would disregard the disclaimer.     The district\n\ncourt appears to have reasoned that the “percentage” of “casual\n\n\n                               -13-\n\freaders” who would disregard the disclaimer was not sizeable enough\n\nto represent what it called “the reasonable (or average) reader\n\n. . . .”         357 F.

But “[w]ords may be actionable\n\neven if they do not tend to damage a plaintiff’s reputation or hold\n\nhim    up    to    ridicule     in   the   community     at   large    or   among   all\n\nreasonable people; it is enough to do so among a considerable and\n\nrespectable class of people.”               Smith, 374 Mass. at 530, 373 N.E.2d\n\nat    217.        Accordingly,       in   assessing    whether   a    publication    is\n\nsusceptible to a defamatory meaning, it is not dispositive that a\n\nnumerical majority of its audience would arrive at a non-defamatory\n\ninterpretation.           See King v. Globe Newspaper Co., 400 Mass. 705,\n\n717-19,          512   N.E.2d    241,      248-49     (Mass.     1987)      (reversing\n\ndetermination that article not susceptible to defamatory meaning\n\nbased       on    views    of   “average      reader”    where       reasonable     that\n\n“considerable and respectable segment of the community” would\n\nnevertheless read article as discrediting plaintiff); Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 559 cmt. e (1977) (“defamation is not a\n\nquestion of majority opinion”).\n\n                 Metro rejoins that, given the “express disclaimer,” any\n\nreading of the article as defamatory toward Stanton is necessarily\n\nincorrect, so “it does not matter whether a ‘considerable’ number\n\nof people might unreasonably misunderstand the publication in such\n\na way . . . .”            But determining whether an allegedly defamatory\n\nstatement can reasonably bear that construction as matter of law\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fshould not be confused with a search for its meaning in the\n\nobjective sense.      As the Supreme Judicial Court has explained,\n\n      Whether a publication is defamatory or not presents a\n      question as to the meaning of words which differs from\n      that presented when a written contract comes before the\n      court for construction. In the latter case, the question\n      is normally, what meaning a reasonable man, knowing all\n      the relevant circumstances, give [sic] to the words of\n      the document. But a writing is a libel if, in view of\n      all relevant circumstances, it discredits the plaintiff\n      in the minds, not of the court, nor of wise, thoughtful,\n      and tolerant men, nor of ordinary reasonable men, but of\n      any considerable and respectable class in the community.\n\nIngalls v.

Our recent decision in Amrak makes this clear.               There,\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthe plaintiff claimed that the defendants had “portrayed [him] as\n\na homosexual by miscaptioning a picture of a homosexual individual\n\nwith [the plaintiff’s] name” in their publications.    410 F.3d at\n\n71.   The caption described the plaintiff as the “secret lover and\n\none-time bodyguard” of pop star Madonna, but the accompanying\n\nphotograph showed her in the company of one of her backup dancers,\n\nJose Guitierez, who was not mentioned or described in the caption\n\nbut who the plaintiff alleged was an “outspoken homosexual.”   Id.\n\n           We concluded that the publication in Amrak was not\n\nreasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning because, to infer\n\nfrom the publication that the plaintiff was a homosexual, a reader\n\nwould have to “follow Madonna and her cohort closely enough to\n\nrecognize Guitierez as a gay man, but not closely enough to know\n\nGuitierez’s name or what [the plaintiff] looks like.   Few, if any,\n\nreaders would fall into this considerable and respectable segment\n\nin the community.”   Id. at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHere, in contrast, we cannot say as a matter of law that too few\n\nreaders would overlook the disclaimer to constitute a considerable\n\nand respectable segment of the community.     The article is thus\n\nreasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning.\n\n           In reaching this conclusion, we do not mean to suggest\n\nthat language in the nature of a disclaimer can never serve to\n\nrender a statement incapable of conveying a defamatory meaning.\n\nSee, e.g., Myers, 380 Mass. at 341-43, 403 N.E.2d at 379-80 (ruling\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fthat statement describing plaintiff as “only newscaster in town who\n\nis enrolled in a course for remedial speaking” could not reasonably\n\nbe understood as defamatory in light of conspicuous language and\n\naccompanying cartoons “suggest[ing] that the expressed opinions\n\nwill have an especially humorous inclination and fanciful tone”).\n\nWe simply recognize that, given the placement of the disclaimer in\n\nthe article and the nature of the publication in general, a\n\nreasonable reader could fail to notice it.                As we said in Amrak,\n\n“[c]ontext matters,”          410 F.3d at 72, and our examination of this\n\narticle   in    context       leads   us    to   conclude     it    is   reasonably\n\nsusceptible to a defamatory meaning.\n\n           We also recognize that, as Metro argues, the article\n\ndraws no literal connection between the subjects of the photograph\n\nand the subjects of its story.             Under Massachusetts law, however,\n\na   statement    need    not    explicitly       refer   to   the    plaintiff   to\n\nconstitute defamation.         See Eyal v. Helen Broad.

New England Tractor-Trailer, 395\n\nMass. at 478 n.5, 480 N.E.2d at 1010 n.5 (quoting Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 564 cmt. b (1977)).                Considering all the\n\ncircumstances of the article’s publication--save the disclaimer--\n\nthe district court concluded that based “on the juxtaposition of\n\nthe text and the photograph . . . , a reasonable reader could\n\nconclude that the teenage girl depicted in the photograph [i.e.,\n\nStanton] is sexually active and engages in at least some form of\n\nsexual misconduct.”    357 F.

Supp. 2d at 378-79, we agree with this determination.4\n\nWe go further, however, and say that the presence of the disclaimer\n\ndoes not permit the conclusion, as a matter of law, that the\n\narticle is not of and concerning Stanton. “A defamatory comment is\n\nmade       ‘of    and   concerning’   the   person   to   whom   the   reader   or\n\nrecipient, correctly or mistakenly but reasonably, understands it\n\nwas intended to refer.”           Reilly, 59 Mass. App. Ct. at 777, 797\n\nN.E.2d       at    1215   (emphasis   added).    As   we   have   explained,     a\n\nreasonable reader could ignore the disclaimer, leaving the article\n\nwith the impression–-incorrect, but not unreasonable--that Stanton\n\nis the subject of the unflattering statements set forth in its\n\ntext.5      Once again, we do not intimate that this interpretation is\n\n\n       4\n      We find the district court’s incredulousness at “why was this\nphotograph used to illustrate this article about sexual misconduct,\nif there is no connection between the two?,” 357 F. Supp. 2d at\n379, particularly incisive in this regard.\n       5\n      Metro questions the district court’s reliance on Mabardi,\nwhere the Supreme Judicial Court discerned a reasonable defamatory\nmeaning in the publication of the plaintiff’s photograph above a\ncaption identifying him only by name and under the headline,\n“Settlement Upped $2,000–-$400 Kickback Told.” 347 Mass. at 412,\n198 N.E.2d at 305. Metro seeks to distinguish Mabardi primarily on\nthe ground that the court there noted the absence of any “textual\nreference” clarifying the plaintiff’s lack of involvement in the\nmalfeasance described in the article, id., 198 N.E.2d at 306, while\nthe Boston magazine article bore a disclaimer to that effect.\nAgain, because a reasonable reader could miss the disclaimer, this\nargument cannot carry the day.    Metro also points out that its\narticle, unlike the publication in Mabardi, did not identify\nStanton by name. We view this as insignificant in light of the\nfact that Stanton is plainly recognizable in the large photograph\noccupying the first one and one-half pages of the article.\n\n                                        -19-\n\fthe only reasonable reading of the article.   We say only that “[a]t\n\nthis very preliminary stage, it does not appear beyond doubt that\n\n[Stanton] will be unable to prove a set of facts that would support\n\na finding that [Metro’s] statements were ‘of and concerning [her]’\n\nunder this standard.”   Eyal, 411 Mass. at 432, 583 N.E.2d at 231.\n\n          Metro also contends that Stanton’s theory that running\n\nher photograph with the article “insinuated that [she] was engaged\n\nin the activity described in the article” fails to state a claim\n\nfor defamation because “many of the activities described in the\n\narticle can in no way be deemed harmful to the reputation of a\n\nsuburban teen today . . . .”   Metro characterizes these innocent\n\nactivities as “attending a school prom, watching a Britney Spears\n\nvideo, abstaining from sex, vowing to avoid abusive relationships,\n\nor even lying about engaging in sex to defuse the pressure from\n\npeers who keep asking about it.”\n\n          We agree with the district court that this argument rests\n\non a tendentious reading of the article, “which is written in a\n\nsensational tone and overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, concerned\n\nwith teenage sexual misconduct.”6     357 F. Supp. 2d at 380.     In\n\nassessing whether a statement can bear a defamatory construction,\n\n“[m]eaning is to be derived as well from the expression used as\n\n\n     6\n      We also agree with the district court that “[e]ven the\nrelatively harmless conduct identified by [Metro in support of its\nargument] is presented [in the article] in such a way as to\nunderscore the principal theme of rampant and promiscuous sexuality\namong teenagers.” 357 F.

Townsend, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 697, 477 N.E.2d 178,\n\n181 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985) (considering “tone of the article as a\n\nwhole” in determining capacity for defamatory meaning).           Beginning\n\nwith the superhead proclaiming that “your kids . . . might know\n\nmore about sex than you,” the article repeatedly and broadly avers\n\nthat teenagers are sexually promiscuous.7 Furthermore, the article\n\nalso consciously attempts to disabuse its readers–-who, as the\n\nsuperhead indicates, are presumed to be the parents of teens–-of\n\nany suspicion that its claims might be exaggerated.        For example,\n\nafter describing alcohol- and drug-fueled sex parties among boys\n\nand girls as “much more common” than sex between a monogamous teen\n\ncouple, the article asks, “Don’t believe it?” and proceeds to offer\n\nthe supporting opinion of a college psychology professor.\n\n           Thus, were the article understood to refer to Stanton, as\n\nwe think it reasonably could be, “it would tend to hold [her] up to\n\nscorn,   hatred,   ridicule   or   contempt,   in   the   minds    of    [a]\n\nconsiderable and respectable segment in the community.” Amrak, 410\n\nF.3d at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted). A reasonable reader\n\n\n\n     7\n      These statements include that, among teenagers, “oral sex is\nthe new second base” and “sex . . . is the new kissing”; that “no\nstrings ‘hooking up’–-and Internet porn and online cybersex–-[have]\noften replac[ed] dating”; and that “today’s eastern Massachusetts\nteens are both sexually advanced . . . and sexually daring.” See\nalso Am. Compl. ¶ 12 (quoting additional like statements).\n\n                                   -21-\n\fcould believe that Stanton, who appears in the lead illustration\n\nfor the article, is in fact one of the teens whose promiscuous\n\nbehavior is described in its text.8     At the risk of repeating\n\nourselves, we allow that other reasonable readers may take a\n\ndifferent view.   We conclude only that the article is susceptible\n\nto the defamatory meaning Stanton alleges, i.e., that she engages\n\nin sexually promiscuous conduct.9\n\n          In a similar vein, Metro argues that the article makes no\n\n“articulably false statement” about Stanton and thus cannot support\n\na defamation claim. The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that\n\ncertain statements about a plaintiff, though pejorative, are “too\n\n\n     8\n      Metro concedes for purposes of this appeal that “a statement\nthat [Stanton] was ‘promiscuous’ might damage her reputation in the\ncommunity.”    Accordingly, we need not decide whether a false\naccusation of promiscuousness is defamatory.       Cf. Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 569 cmt. f (1977).\n     9\n      Tropeano v. Atl. Monthly Co., 379 Mass. 745, 400 N.E.2d 847\n(Mass. 1976), on which Metro relies, is not to the contrary.\nThere, the defendant used a photograph of the plaintiff and three\nother women conversing in a nightspot to illustrate an article\nentitled, “After the Sexual Revolution.” Id. at 746, 400 N.E.2d\nat 848. Based on the complaint, the court could discern nothing\nabout the article except that it “appear[ed] to deal with modern\nsexual and social mores.” Id. Given the unremarkable nature of\nthe photograph, and the plaintiff’s failure to plead “any\ndefamatory innuendo,” id. at 751, 400 N.E.2d at 851, the court\nruled that the publication was not defamatory. Here, however, as\nwe have already discussed, the article can reasonably be read to\nprovide a considerably less clinical view of its subjects’ sexual\nbehavior. Furthermore, Stanton has alleged that the publication in\nthis case made a defamatory insinuation about her. See Mihalik v.\nDuprey, 11 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 607, 417 N.E.2d 1238, 1241 (Mass.\nApp. Ct. 1981) (noting that Tropeano does not discuss theory of\n“false defamatory insinuation . . . to any significant extent”).\nTropeano therefore does not support Metro’s position.\n\n                               -22-\n\fvague to be cognizable as the subject of a defamation action.”\n\nNat’l Ass’n of Gov’t Employees, Inc. v.

That this juxtaposition might not permit a\n\nreader to definitively ascribe to Stanton any of the particular\n\nkinds of promiscuous conduct described in the article strikes us as\n\nunimportant. “It is not necessary that the charge of indiscretions\n\nor want of chastity be direct and explicit; but anything fairly\n\nimputing immorality is actionable.”        Thayer v. Worcester Post Co.,\n\n284 Mass. 160, 162, 187 N.E. 292, 293 (Mass. 1933); see also\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 574 cmt. b (1977) (noting that\n\n“general charges of unchaste conduct” suffice to support defamation\n\nclaim and that charges of “specific acts” are unnecessary).\n\n\n\n      10\n      Like the district court, 357 F. Supp. 2d at 373 n.5, we note\nthat Stanton has claimed defamation based on allegedly false\nstatement and therefore do not consider whether she could recover\non a lesser showing.

See\n\ngenerally Myers, 380 Mass. at 343, 403 N.E.2d at 380 (collecting\n\ncases rejecting defamation claims based on epithets).     Here, in\n\ncontrast, Stanton has alleged that Metro defamed her by making a\n\nstatement susceptible to the interpretation that she engages in\n\nsexually promiscuous behavior.    That statement is clear enough to\n\nsupport a defamation claim, particularly under the circumstances.\n\nSee Restatement (Second) of Torts § 566 cmt. e (1977) (“Words\n\nuttered face to face during an altercation may well be understood\n\nmerely as abuse or insult, while words written after time for\n\nthought or published in a newspaper may be taken to express the\n\ndefamatory charge and to be intended to be taken seriously.”)11\n\n          Finally, Metro argues that Stanton’s amended complaint\n\nshould have been dismissed because she failed to “allege any facts\n\n\n\n     11\n      We note in this regard that, in contrast to the circumstances\nhere, the statement considered in Nat’l Ass’n of Gov’t Employees\nwas “used in the midst of a public debate” over a labor contract,\n“an occasion on which voices could be expected to be raised in\nsloganeering invective,” 379 Mass. at 228-29, 396 N.E.2d at 1001,\nwhile those at issue in Fleming were spoken as part of a radio talk\nshow host’s on-air diatribe over his treatment at the hands of the\ndefendant, which the host simultaneously acknowledged had made him\n“angry, likely to be biased, and that his listeners should take\naccount of these facts.” 390 Mass. at 179, 454 N.E.2d at 99.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fthat, if true, would demonstrate that Metro acted with negligent\n\ndisregard for the truth by juxtaposing the photograph and the\n\narticle.”    We disagree.       “[P]rivate persons . . . may recover\n\ncompensation (assuming proof of all other elements of a claim for\n\ndefamation) on proof that the defendant was negligent in publishing\n\ndefamatory words which reasonably could be interpreted to refer to\n\nthe plaintiff.” New England Tractor-Trailer, 395 Mass. at 477, 480\n\nN.E.2d at 1009 (footnote omitted); see also Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts §§ 564 cmt. f & 580B cmt. b(5) (1977).        Furthermore, “‘[i]f\n\nthe recipient reasonably understood the communication to be made\n\nconcerning the plaintiff, it may be inferred that the defamer was\n\nnegligent in failing to realize that the communication would be so\n\nunderstood,’” provided the plaintiff can “‘prove that a reasonable\n\nunderstanding on the part of the recipient that the communication\n\nreferred to the plaintiff was one that the defamer was negligent in\n\nfailing to anticipate.’” New England Tractor-Trailer, 395 Mass. at\n\n478 n.5, 480 N.E.2d at 1010 n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts § 564 cmt. f (1977)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n            Stanton   alleges   that   “[t]he   juxtaposition   of   [her]\n\nphotograph with the text describing suburban teenage sexuality\n\n. . . has a reasonable tendency to injure [her] reputation and did\n\nso injure [her] reputation” in that it “insinuated that [she] was\n\na person engaged in the activity described in the article . . . .”\n\nThese allegations sufficiently state a defamation claim based on\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fthe theory that Metro negligently used Stanton’s photograph to\n\nillustrate a story describing teenagers as sexually promiscuous\n\nwithout   realizing    that    the    publication      might   therefore    be\n\nreasonably understood to mean that she was sexually promiscuous.\n\n\n\n                                     IV.\n\n          We   close   our    analysis,     as   we   opened   it,   with   the\n\nobservation that “‘[a] complaint should not be dismissed unless it\n\nis apparent beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of\n\nfacts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.’”\n\nGreene, 398 F.3d at 48 (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46).             Based\n\non our review of the amended complaint and the article in question,\n\nwe conclude that this standard has not been met.               We REVERSE the\n\norder of the district court insofar as it dismissed Stanton’s\n\ndefamation claim arising out of the juxtaposition of her photograph\n\nand the text of the article and REMAND the case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f",

Because we believe this conclusion was erroneous, and because Metro's alternative arguments for affirmance are not well-founded, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metro Corporation publishes <i>Boston</i> magazine, a monthly general interest publication that ran the article in question in its May 2003 issue. The cover of the magazine refers to the article with the phrase, \"Fast Times at Silver Lake High: Teen Sex in the Suburbs.\" Inside, Stanton is one of five young people pictured in a photograph that occupies the entire first page of the article and half of the facing page. The photograph, taken at a high school dance, depicts its three male and two female subjects in formal attire, sitting and standing near an open exit door in the background. Stanton's image occupies most of the left-hand side of the photograph, where she appears standing, with her face and most of her body fully visible. Although three of the subjects are smoking cigarettes, and another holds a plastic cup, Stanton simply looks at the camera, smiling faintly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other half of the facing page consists of a column of text of varying sizes, including the aforementioned headline, which appears in the largest font and takes up most of the column. A \"superhead,\" appearing above the headline in a smaller font, reads: \"They hook up online. They hook up in real life. With prom season looming, meet your kids&#8212;they might know more about sex than you do.\" Below the headline, one and a half paragraphs of text from the article are set forth in yet smaller type, ending with an arrow indicating that the story continues onto the following page. The byline and photography credit appear at the very bottom of the column in lettering larger than that of the main text, but smaller than that of the headline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just above the byline, and just below the main article text, the following appears in italicized type: \"The photos on these pages are from an award-winning five-year project on teen sexuality taken by photojournalist Dan Habib. The individuals pictured are unrelated to the people or events described in this story. The names of the teenagers interviewed for this story have been changed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These words are rendered in the smallest font on the page, which is otherwise devoid of text that explains the photograph or identifies its subjects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Stanton alleges that she did not participate in any such \"project on teen sexuality.\" The first few paragraphs of the article relate a conversation among four teenagers from a suburban Boston high school, including \"Nicole,\" described as a \"pretty Keri Russell-look-alike . . .\" and \"Christine, a curly-haired pixie in the under-90 weight range . . . .\" Nicole is quoted as saying, \"All we ever do is go hang out and get drunk, like, <i>all</i> the time, and you know, hook up,\" not generally with steady boyfriends or girlfriends, but \"with whoever [<i>sic</i>]\" after drinking at small gatherings. The article goes on to explain that the euphemism \"hook up,\" as teens use it, \"can mean anything from sexual intercourse to oral sex to serious touching or just kissing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As these introductory paragraphs suggest, the thrust of the story is that teenagers in the greater Boston area have become more sexually promiscuous over the span of the last decade. The article draws support for this thesis from both statistical and anecdotal evidence, including interviews with a number of local high school students. As to the possible causes for the trend, the article considers a \"hypersexual\" popular culture, the ready availability of sexual encounters and pornography over the Internet, ineffective sex education programs, and peer pressure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story also declares that high school has replaced college as the time for sexual experimentation, describes a profound ignorance among teens about sexually transmitted diseases, and notes a related trend of increased sexual aggression among high school boys. Parents, for their part, remain \"overwhelmingly clueless,\" according to the article. Nevertheless, the story closes with the observation that some teens are \"holding out hope\" for emotionally rewarding sexual relationships, including \"Jessica,\" one of the teenagers from the group described at the beginning of the article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanton, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, responded to the appearance of her photograph with the article by filing suit against Metro in Massachusetts state court. Metro, a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business also in that state, duly removed the action to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanton's amended complaint asserts two counts: invasion of privacy in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, and common-law defamation. Stanton alleges that the publication was defamatory in that \"[t]he juxtaposition of [her] photograph and the text describing suburban teenage promiscuity . . . insinuated that [she] was engaged in the activity described in the article . . . .\" She also alleged that the disclaimer was itself defamatory in falsely identifying her as a subject of the photographer's \"project on teen sexuality.\" The district court granted Metro's motion to dismiss on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of the motion to dismiss de novo. <i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodriguez,</i> 415 F.3d 135, 138 (1st Cir.) (citing <i>Greene v. Rhode Island,</i> 398 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir.2005)), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 829, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005). This task requires that we accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Id.</i> at 138-39. As the district court did, we also consider the allegedly defamatory article itself, which Metro submitted as an attachment to its motion to dismiss. <i>See Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd.,</i> 840 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1988). \"`A complaint should not be dismissed unless it is apparent beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.'\" <i>Greene,</i> 398 F.3d at 48 (quoting <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanton has appealed only the dismissal of her defamation claim. Furthermore, she has appealed the dismissal of that claim only insofar as it arises out of the juxtaposition of her photograph with the article; she does not contest the district court's determination that the disclaimer was not independently defamatory in misidentifying her as a participant in the teen sexuality study. We limit our review accordingly. <i>See, e.g., Exec. Leasing Corp. v. Banco Popular De P.R.,</i> 48 F.3d 66, 67 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on a defamation claim under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must show that the defendant was at fault for the publication of a false statement of and concerning the plaintiff which was capable of damaging his or her reputation in the community and which either caused economic loss or is actionable without proof of economic loss. <i>White v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> 442 Mass. 64, 66, 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036 (Mass.2004); <i>see also Yohe v. Nugent,</i> 321 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.2003) (applying Massachusetts law); <i>Ravnikar v. Bogojavlensky,</i> 438 Mass. 627, 629-30, 782 N.E.2d 508, 510-511 (Mass. 2003). Metro moved to dismiss Stanton's complaint on the grounds that (1) the publication was not defamatory, <i>i.e.,</i> capable of damaging her reputation, as a matter of law, (2) any defamatory statement was not \"of and concerning\" her, (3) Metro could not have acted negligently in publishing the article, and (4) Stanton failed to allege that the article contained any false statement of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted two of these arguments, ruling that \"the defamatory statements at issue are not `of and concerning' [Stanton], and are not reasonably capable of a defamatory meaning.\" 357 F.Supp.2d 369, 382 (D.Mass.2005). In reaching these conclusions, the district court relied heavily on the disclaimer appearing at the bottom of the first column of the article, <i>i.e.,</i> \"[t]he individuals pictured are unrelated to the people or events described in this story.\" In fact, the district court stated that it would \"first consider the juxtaposition of the photograph and the text without the disclaimer, and then turn to the impact of the disclaimer\" in considering whether the article made a defamatory statement about Stanton. <i>Id.</i> at 378.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bifurcating the article in this fashion, the district court determined that, absent the disclaimer, \"a reasonable reader could conclude that the teenage girl depicted in the photograph is sexually active and engages in at least some form of sexual misconduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 381. Nevertheless, the district court went on to explain that it was \"forced to conclude that the disclaimer adequately negates the negative connotations about [the] plaintiff otherwise arising from the article and the photograph, at least in the mind of the reasonable reader.\" <i>Id.</i> We believe that the district court's calculus placed undue weight on the disclaimer in contravention of Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by focusing on the appropriate inquiry. We are not called upon to determine the ultimate issue of whether the article is defamatory, but to answer the \"threshold question\" of \"`whether [the] communication is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning . . . .'\" <i>Amrak Prods., Inc. v. Morton,</i> 410 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Phelan v. May Dep't Stores Co.,</i> 443 Mass. 52, 56-57, 819 N.E.2d 550, 554 (Mass.2004)). If the answer to this question is \"yes,\" then the ultimate issue of whether the article is defamatory is not the court's to decide: \"`[w]here the communication is susceptible of both a defamatory and nondefamatory meaning, a question of fact exists for the jury.'\" <i>Phelan,</i> 443 Mass. at 56-57, 819 N.E.2d at 554 (quoting <i>Jones v. Taibbi,</i> 400 Mass. 786, 791-92, 512 N.E.2d 260, 264 (Mass.1987)); <i>see also Draghetti v. Chmielewski,</i> 416 Mass. 808, 811, 626 N.E.2d 862, 866 (Mass.1994); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 614 (1977). If the answer is \"no,\" however, the defamation claim should be dismissed. <i>See Amrak,</i> 410 F.3d at 72 (citing <i>Brauer v. Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 351 Mass. 53, 55, 217 N.E.2d 736, 738 (Mass. 1966)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A communication is susceptible to defamatory meaning if it `would tend to hold the plaintiff up to scorn, hatred, ridicule or contempt, in the minds of any considerable and respectable segment in the community.'\" <i>Amrak,</i> 410 F.3d at 72 (quoting <i>Phelan,</i> 443 Mass. at 56, 819 N.E.2d at 553) (further internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir.1998) (applying Massachusetts law); <i>Milgroom v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> 412 Mass. 9, 12, 586 N.E.2d 985, 988 (Mass.1992); <i>Smith v. Suburban Rests., Inc.,</i> 374 Mass. 528, 529, 373 N.E.2d 215, 217 (1978); <i>Stone v. Essex County Newspapers,</i> 367 Mass. 849, 853, 330 N.E.2d 161, 165 (Mass.1975). In making this assessment, however, \"[t]he communication must be interpreted reasonably,\" and can be ruled defamatory only if it would lead \"a reasonable reader to conclude that it conveyed a defamatory meaning.\" <i>Amrak,</i> 410 F.3d at 72 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Foley v. Lowell Sun Publ'g Co.,</i> 404 Mass. 9, 11, 533 N.E.2d 196, 197 (1989); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 563 cmt. c (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court correctly articulated these principles in its decision, it strayed from them in analyzing the publication at issue. The district court reasoned that, since \"the disclaimer <i>directly</i> contradicts the otherwise-defamatory connection between the photograph and the text,\" the article could be susceptible to a defamatory meaning only if \"a reasonable reader would overlook the disclaimer, misunderstand it, or fail to give it credence.\" 357 F.Supp.2d at 381. According to the district court, no reasonable reader could do so because the disclaimer appears on the first page of the article and \"[c]ertainly, the <i>reasonable</i> (or average) reader can be expected to read at least the first page of a six-page article.\" <i>Id.</i> It was here that the district court erred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we acknowledge that the position of an item in a newspaper or magazine can bear on the question of defamatory import, <i>see</i> Robert D. Sack, <i>Sack on Defamation: Libel, Slander, and Related Problems</i> &#167; 2.4.2, at 2-19 (2004), we cannot assume, as the district court did, that placing a disclaimer on the first page of an article itself ensures that a reasonable reader will see it. Instead, we must examine the article \"`in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published'\" and \"`consider all the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence.'\" <i>Amrak,</i> 410 F.3d at 73 (quoting <i>Foley,</i> 404 Mass. at 11, 533 N.E.2d at 197) (further internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Salvo v. Ottaway Newspapers, Inc.,</i> 57 Mass.App.Ct. 255, 260, 782 N.E.2d 535, 540 (2003); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 563 cmt. d (1977). Likewise, though we must \"give weight to cautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement,\" <i>Myers v. Boston Magazine Co.,</i> 380 Mass. 336, 341-42, 403 N.E.2d 376, 379 (1980), the non-defamatory character of a statement will rarely depend solely on the presence of qualifying language. <i>See, e.g., Cole v. Westinghouse Broad. Co.,</i> 386 Mass. 303, 309-12, 435 N.E.2d 1021, 1025-27 (1982) (considering speaker's characterization of statement about plaintiff's firing as \"unofficial\" as one factor in whether statement defamatory); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 563 cmt. c (1977) (\"A conditional or alternative statement may be defamatory if, notwithstanding its conditional or alternative form it is reasonably understood in a defamatory sense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the disclaimer occupies the field between the body of the story and the byline, making it easy enough to overlook between the larger fonts of both.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The disclaimer is also separated from the column of text by a horizontal line, accompanied by an arrow directing the reader to turn to the next page, where the story continues. We cannot say that no reasonable reader would follow this visual signal and simply flip to the next page after reading the entirety of the text on the first page, but before reaching the disclaimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we say that any reasonable reader who notices the disclaimer would necessarily read the crucial second sentence, <i>i.e.,</i> \"[t]he individuals pictured are unrelated to the people or events described in this story.\" It is at least conceivable that a reader might take the first sentence of the disclaimer, which states that \"[t]he photos on these pages are from an award-winning five-year project on teen sexuality by photojournalist Dan Habib,\" as a satisfactory explanation of the photographs and therefore stop reading the disclaimer before the second sentence. Such a reader would thus remain under the impression that the teenagers depicted in the photograph have some connection to the accompanying story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the text and layout of the article itself, we must also consider \"`the medium by which the statement is disseminated and the audience to which it is published'\" in assessing its amenability to a defamatory meaning. <i>Lyons v. Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 415 Mass. 258, 263, 612 N.E.2d 1158, 1162 (1993) (quoting <i>Fleming v. Benzaquin,</i> 390 Mass. 175, 180-81, 454 N.E.2d 95, 100 (1983) (further internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 563, cmt. d (1977). We note in this regard that the story appeared in <i>Boston</i> magazine, which Metro describes as \"a general interest regional magazine. . . .\" As the <i>Restatement</i> notes with regard to similar periodicals, \"the public frequently reads only the headline of the article or reads the article itself so hastily or imperfectly as not to realize its full significance.\" <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 563, cmt. d (1977). In light of this observation, we agree with the district court that \"some percentage of readers who see the article, particularly casual readers who only glance at it or skim it, will ignore the disclaimer.\" 357 F.Supp.2d at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have difficulty, however, in reconciling this aspect of the district court's analysis with its conclusion that no reasonable reader would disregard the disclaimer. The district court appears to have reasoned that the \"percentage\" of \"casual readers\" who would disregard the disclaimer was not sizeable enough to represent what it called \"the <i>reasonable</i> (or average) reader. . . .\" 357 F.Supp.2d at 381. But \"[w]ords may be actionable even if they do not tend to damage a plaintiff's reputation or hold him up to ridicule in the community at large or among all reasonable people; it is enough to do so among a considerable and respectable class of people.\" <i>Smith,</i> 374 Mass. at 530, 373 N.E.2d at 217. Accordingly, in assessing whether a publication is susceptible to a defamatory meaning, it is not dispositive that a numerical majority of its audience would arrive at a non-defamatory interpretation. <i>See King v. Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 400 Mass. 705, 717-19, 512 N.E.2d 241, 248-49 (Mass. 1987) (reversing determination that article not susceptible to defamatory meaning based on views of \"average reader\" where reasonable that \"considerable and respectable segment of the community\" would nevertheless read article as discrediting plaintiff); <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 559 cmt. e (1977) (\"defamation is not a question of majority opinion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metro rejoins that, given the \"express disclaimer,\" any reading of the article as defamatory toward Stanton is necessarily incorrect, so \"it does not matter whether a `considerable' number of people might unreasonably <i>misunderstand</i> the publication in such a way. . . .\" But determining whether an allegedly defamatory statement can reasonably bear that construction as matter of law should not be confused with a search for its meaning in the objective sense.

But a writing is a libel if, in view of all relevant circumstances, it discredits the plaintiff in the minds, not of the court, nor of wise, thoughtful, and tolerant men, nor of ordinary reasonable men, but of any considerable and respectable class in the community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ingalls v.

Our recent decision in <i>Amrak</i> makes this clear. There, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants had \"portrayed [him] as a homosexual by miscaptioning a picture of a homosexual individual with [the plaintiff's] name\" in their publications. 410 F.3d at 71. The caption described the plaintiff as the \"secret lover and one-time bodyguard\" of pop star Madonna, but the accompanying photograph showed her in the company of one of her backup dancers, Jose Guitierez, who was not mentioned or described in the caption but who the plaintiff alleged was an \"outspoken homosexual.\" <i>Id.</i> We concluded that the publication in <i>Amrak</i> was not reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning because, to infer from the publication that the plaintiff was a homosexual, a reader would have to \"follow Madonna and her cohort closely enough to recognize Guitierez as a gay man, but not closely enough to know Guitierez's name or what [the plaintiff] looks like. Few, if any, readers would fall into this considerable and respectable segment in the community.\" <i>Id.</i> at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, in contrast, we cannot say as a matter of law that too few readers would overlook the disclaimer to constitute a considerable and respectable segment of the community. The article is thus reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we do not mean to suggest that language in the nature of a disclaimer can never serve to render a statement incapable of conveying a defamatory meaning. <i>See, e.g., Myers,</i> 380 Mass. at 341-43, 403 N.E.2d at 379-80 (ruling that statement describing plaintiff as \"only newscaster in town who is enrolled in a course for remedial speaking\" could not reasonably be understood as defamatory in light of conspicuous language and accompanying cartoons \"suggest[ing] that the expressed opinions will have an especially humorous inclination and fanciful tone\"). We simply recognize that, given the placement of the disclaimer in the article and the nature of the publication in general, a reasonable reader could fail to notice it. As we said in <i>Amrak,</i> \"[c]ontext matters,\" 410 F.3d at 72, and our examination of this article in context leads us to conclude it is reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also recognize that, as Metro argues, the article draws no literal connection between the subjects of the photograph and the subjects of its story. Under Massachusetts law, however, a statement need not explicitly refer to the plaintiff to constitute defamation. <i>See Eyal v. Helen Broad. Corp.,</i> 411 Mass. 426, 430-31, 583 N.E.2d 228, 230-31 (1991); <i>New England Tractor-Trailer Training of Conn., Inc. v.

Defamation can therefore arise from the publication of the plaintiff's photograph in conjunction with a defamatory statement, even in the absence of any express textual connection between the statement and the photograph. <i>Mabardi v.

Considering all the circumstances of the article's publication&#8212;save the disclaimer&#8212; the district court concluded that based \"on the juxtaposition of the text and the photograph . . . , a reasonable reader could conclude that the teenage girl depicted in the photograph [<i>i.e.,</i> Stanton] is sexually active and engages in at least some form of sexual misconduct.\" 357 F.Supp.2d at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, <i>see</i> 357 F.Supp.2d at 378-79, we agree with this determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We go further, however, and say that the presence of the disclaimer does not permit the conclusion, as a matter of law, that the article is not of and concerning Stanton. \"A defamatory comment is made `of and concerning' the person to whom the reader or recipient, <i>correctly or mistakenly but reasonably,</i> understands it was intended to refer.\" <i>Reilly,</i> 59 Mass.App.Ct. at 777, 797 N.E.2d at 1215 (emphasis added). As we have explained, a reasonable reader could ignore the disclaimer, leaving the article with the impression&#8212;incorrect, but not unreasonable&#8212;that Stanton is the subject of the unflattering statements set forth in its text.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Once again, we do not intimate that this interpretation is the only reasonable reading of the article. We say only that \"[a]t this very preliminary stage, it does not appear beyond doubt that [Stanton] will be unable to prove a set of facts that would support a finding that [Metro's] statements were `of and concerning [her]' under this standard.\" <i>Eyal,</i> 411 Mass. at 432, 583 N.E.2d at 231.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metro also contends that Stanton's theory that running her photograph with the article \"insinuated that [she] was engaged in the activity described in the article\" fails to state a claim for defamation because \"many of the activities described in the article can in no way be deemed harmful to the reputation of a suburban teen today. . . .\" Metro characterizes these innocent activities as \"attending a school prom, watching a Britney Spears video, abstaining from sex, vowing to avoid abusive relationships, or even lying about engaging in sex to defuse the pressure from peers who keep asking about it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that this argument rests on a tendentious reading of the article, \"which is written in a sensational tone and overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, concerned with teenage sexual misconduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> 357 F.Supp.2d at 380. In assessing whether a statement can bear a defamatory construction, \"[m]eaning is to be derived as well from the expression used as from the whole scope and the apparent object of the writer.\" Sack, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2.4.2, at 2-19 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord Tartaglia v.

Beginning with the superhead proclaiming that \"your kids . . . might know more about sex than you,\" the article repeatedly and broadly avers that teenagers are sexually promiscuous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Furthermore, the article also consciously attempts to disabuse its readers&#8212;who, as the superhead indicates, are presumed to be the parents of teens&#8212;of any suspicion that its claims might be exaggerated. For example, after describing alcohol&#8212; and drug-fueled sex parties among boys and girls as \"much more common\" than sex between a monogamous teen couple, the article asks, \"Don't believe it?\" and proceeds to offer the supporting opinion of a college psychology professor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, were the article understood to refer to Stanton, as we think it reasonably could be, \"it would tend to hold [her] up to scorn, hatred, ridicule or contempt, in the minds of [a] considerable and respectable segment in the community.\" <i>Amrak,</i> 410 F.3d at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted). A reasonable reader could believe that Stanton, who appears in the lead illustration for the article, is in fact one of the teens whose promiscuous behavior is described in its text.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> At the risk of repeating ourselves, we allow that other reasonable readers may take a different view. We conclude only that the article is susceptible to the defamatory meaning Stanton alleges, <i>i.e.,</i> that she engages in sexually promiscuous conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a similar vein, Metro argues that the article makes no \"articulably false statement\" about Stanton and thus cannot support a defamation claim. The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that certain statements about a plaintiff, though pejorative, are \"too vague to be cognizable as the subject of a defamation action.\" <i>Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Inc. v. Cent. Broad. Corp.,</i> 379 Mass. 220, 229, 396 N.E.2d 996, 1002 (1979). Because \"[t]he meaning of these statements is imprecise and open to speculation . . .

That this juxtaposition might not permit a reader to definitively ascribe to Stanton any of the particular kinds of promiscuous conduct described in the article strikes us as unimportant. \"It is not necessary that the charge of indiscretions or want of chastity be direct and explicit; but anything fairly imputing immorality is actionable.\" <i>Thayer v.

Here, in contrast, Stanton has alleged that Metro defamed her by making a statement susceptible to the interpretation that she engages in sexually promiscuous behavior. That statement is clear enough to support a defamation claim, particularly under the circumstances. <i>See Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 566 cmt. e (1977) (\"Words uttered face to face during an altercation may well be understood merely as abuse or insult, while words written after time for thought or published in a newspaper may be taken to express the defamatory charge and to be intended to be taken seriously.\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Metro argues that Stanton's amended complaint should have been dismissed because she failed to \"allege any facts that, if true, would demonstrate that Metro acted with negligent disregard for the truth by juxtaposing the photograph and the article.\" We disagree. \"[P]rivate persons . . . may recover compensation (assuming proof of all other elements of a claim for defamation) on proof that the defendant was negligent in publishing defamatory words which reasonably could be interpreted to refer to the plaintiff.\" <i>New England Tractor-Trailer,</i> 395 Mass. at 477, 480 N.E.2d at 1009 (footnote omitted); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167;&#167; 564 cmt. f &amp; 580B cmt. b(5) (1977).

Metro seeks to distinguish <i>Mabardi</i> primarily on the ground that the court there noted the absence of any \"textual reference\" clarifying the plaintiff's lack of involvement in the malfeasance described in the article, <i>id.,</i> 198 N.E.2d at 306, while the <i>Boston</i> magazine article bore a disclaimer to that effect. Again, because a reasonable reader could miss the disclaimer, this argument cannot carry the day. Metro also points out that its article, unlike the publication in <i>Mabardi,</i> did not identify Stanton by name.

Because we believe this conclusion was erroneous, and because Metro's alternative arguments for affirmance are not well-founded, we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metro Corporation publishes <i>Boston</i> magazine, a monthly general interest publication that ran the article in question in its May 2003 issue. The cover of the magazine refers to the article with the phrase, \"Fast Times at Silver Lake High: Teen Sex in the Suburbs.\" Inside, Stanton is one of five young people pictured in a photograph that occupies the entire first page of the article and half of the facing page. The photograph, taken at a high school dance, depicts its three male and two female subjects in formal attire, sitting and standing near an open exit door in the background. Stanton's image occupies most of the left-hand side of the photograph, where she appears standing, with her face and most of her body fully visible. Although three of the subjects are smoking cigarettes, and another holds a plastic cup, Stanton simply looks at the camera, smiling faintly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other half of the facing page consists of a column of text of varying sizes, including the aforementioned headline, which appears in the largest font and takes up most of the column. A \"superhead,\" appearing above the headline in a smaller font, reads: \"They hook up online. They hook up in real life. With prom season looming, meet your kids&#8212;they might know more about sex than you do.\" Below the headline, one and a half paragraphs of text from the article are set forth in yet smaller type, ending with an arrow indicating that the story continues onto the following page. The byline and photography credit appear at the very bottom of the column in lettering larger than that of the main text, but smaller than that of the headline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just above the byline, and just below the main article text, the following appears in italicized type: \"The photos on these pages are from an award-winning five-year project on teen sexuality taken by photojournalist Dan Habib. The individuals pictured are unrelated to the people or events described in this story. The names of the teenagers interviewed for this story have been changed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These words are rendered in the smallest font on the page, which is otherwise devoid of text that explains the photograph or identifies its subjects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Stanton alleges that she did not participate in any such \"project on teen sexuality.\" The first few paragraphs of the article relate a conversation among four teenagers from a suburban Boston high school, including \"Nicole,\" described as a \"pretty Keri Russell-look-alike . . .\" and \"Christine, a curly-haired pixie in the under-90 weight range . . . .\" Nicole is quoted as saying, \"All we ever do is go hang out and get drunk, like, <i>all</i> the time, and you know, hook up,\" not generally with steady boyfriends or girlfriends, but \"with whoever [<i>sic</i>]\" after drinking at small gatherings. The article goes on to explain that the euphemism \"hook up,\" as teens use it, \"can mean anything from sexual intercourse to oral sex to serious touching or just kissing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As these introductory paragraphs suggest, the thrust of the story is that teenagers in the greater Boston area have become more sexually promiscuous over the span of the last decade. The article draws support for this thesis from both statistical and anecdotal evidence, including interviews with a number of local high school students. As to the possible causes for the trend, the article considers a \"hypersexual\" popular culture, the ready availability of sexual encounters and pornography over the Internet, ineffective sex education programs, and peer pressure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story also declares that high school has replaced college as the time for sexual experimentation, describes a profound ignorance among teens about sexually transmitted diseases, and notes a related trend of increased sexual aggression among high school boys. Parents, for their part, remain \"overwhelmingly clueless,\" according to the article. Nevertheless, the story closes with the observation that some teens are \"holding out hope\" for emotionally rewarding sexual relationships, including \"Jessica,\" one of the teenagers from the group described at the beginning of the article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanton, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, responded to the appearance of her photograph with the article by filing suit against Metro in Massachusetts state court. Metro, a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business also in that state, duly removed the action to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanton's amended complaint asserts two counts: invasion of privacy in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, and common-law defamation. Stanton alleges that the publication was defamatory in that \"[t]he juxtaposition of [her] photograph and the text describing suburban teenage promiscuity . . . insinuated that [she] was engaged in the activity described in the article . . . .\" She also alleged that the disclaimer was itself defamatory in falsely identifying her as a subject of the photographer's \"project on teen sexuality.\" The district court granted Metro's motion to dismiss on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of the motion to dismiss de novo. <i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v.

Metro moved to dismiss Stanton's complaint on the grounds that (1) the publication was not defamatory, <i>i.e.,</i> capable of damaging her reputation, as a matter of law, (2) any defamatory statement was not \"of and concerning\" her, (3) Metro could not have acted negligently in publishing the article, and (4) Stanton failed to allege that the article contained any false statement of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted two of these arguments, ruling that \"the defamatory statements at issue are not `of and concerning' [Stanton], and are not reasonably capable of a defamatory meaning.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2330299\"><a href=\"/opinion/2330299/stanton-v-metro-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In reaching these conclusions, the district court relied heavily on the disclaimer appearing at the bottom of the first column of the article, <i>i.e.,</i> \"[t]he individuals pictured are unrelated to the people or events described in this story.\" In fact, the district court stated that it would \"first consider the juxtaposition of the photograph and the text without the disclaimer, and then turn to the impact of the disclaimer\" in considering whether the article made a defamatory statement about Stanton. <i>Id.</i> at 378.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bifurcating the article in this fashion, the district court determined that, absent the disclaimer, \"a reasonable reader could conclude that the teenage girl depicted in the photograph is sexually active and engages in at least some form of sexual misconduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 381.

Our recent decision in <i>Amrak</i> makes this clear. There, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants had \"portrayed [him] as a homosexual by miscaptioning a picture of a homosexual individual with [the plaintiff's] name\" in their publications. 410 F.3d at 71. The caption described the plaintiff as the \"secret lover and one-time bodyguard\" of pop star Madonna, but the accompanying photograph showed her in the company of one of her backup dancers, Jose Guitierez, who was not mentioned or described in the caption but who the plaintiff alleged was an \"outspoken homosexual.\" <i>Id.</i> We concluded that the publication in <i>Amrak</i> was not reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning because, to infer from the publication that the plaintiff was a homosexual, a reader would have to \"follow Madonna and her cohort closely enough to recognize Guitierez as a gay man, but not closely enough to know Guitierez's name or what [the plaintiff] looks like. Few, if any, readers would fall into this considerable and respectable segment in the community.\" <i>Id.</i> at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, in contrast, we cannot say as a matter of law that too few readers would overlook the disclaimer to constitute a considerable and respectable segment of the community.

We simply recognize that, given the placement of the disclaimer in the article and the nature of the publication in general, a reasonable reader could fail to notice it. As we said in <i>Amrak,</i> \"[c]ontext matters,\" 410 F.3d at 72, and our examination of this article in context leads us to conclude it is reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also recognize that, as Metro argues, the article draws no literal connection between the subjects of the photograph and the subjects of its story.

For example, after describing alcohol&#8212; and drug-fueled sex parties among boys and girls as \"much more common\" than sex between a monogamous teen couple, the article asks, \"Don't believe it?\" and proceeds to offer the supporting opinion of a college psychology professor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, were the article understood to refer to Stanton, as we think it reasonably could be, \"it would tend to hold [her] up to scorn, hatred, ridicule or contempt, in the minds of [a] considerable and respectable segment in the community.\" <i>Amrak,</i> 410 F.3d at 73 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Metro seeks to distinguish <i>Mabardi</i> primarily on the ground that the court there noted the absence of any \"textual reference\" clarifying the plaintiff's lack of involvement in the malfeasance described in the article, <i>id.,</i> 198 N.E.2d at 306, while the <i>Boston</i> magazine article bore a disclaimer to that effect. Again, because a reasonable reader could miss the disclaimer, this argument cannot carry the day. Metro also points out that its article, unlike the publication in <i>Mabardi,</i> did not identify Stanton by name. We view this as insignificant in light of the fact that Stanton is plainly recognizable in the large photograph occupying the first one and one-half pages of the article.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We also agree with the district court that \"[e]ven the relatively harmless conduct identified by [Metro in support of its argument] is presented [in the article] in such a way as to underscore the principal theme of rampant and promiscuous sexuality among teenagers.\" 357 F.Supp.2d at 380 (footnote omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> These statements include that, among teenagers, \"oral sex is the new second base\" and \"sex . . . is the new kissing\"; that \"no strings `hooking up'&#8212;and Internet porn and online cybersex&#8212;[have] often replac[ed] dating\"; and that \"today's eastern Massachusetts teens are both sexually advanced . . . and sexually daring.\"<i>See also</i> Am.

There, the defendant used a photograph of the plaintiff and three other women conversing in a nightspot to illustrate an article entitled, \"After the Sexual Revolution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 746, 400 N.E.2d at 848. Based on the complaint, the court could discern nothing about the article except that it \"appear[ed] to deal with modern sexual and social mores.\" <i>Id.</i> Given the unremarkable nature of the photograph, and the plaintiff's failure to plead \"any defamatory innuendo,\" <i>id.</i> at 751, 400 N.E.2d at 851, the court ruled that the publication was not defamatory. Here, however, as we have already discussed, the article can reasonably be read to provide a considerably less clinical view of its subjects' sexual behavior. Furthermore, Stanton has alleged that the publication in this case made a defamatory insinuation about her. <i>See Mihalik v.
