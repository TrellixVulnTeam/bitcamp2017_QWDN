German   Guzman\n\n(\"Guzman\"), a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for\n\nreview of the denial by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") of\n\nhis application for asylum and for the withholding of removal, and\n\nhis motion to remand in order to apply for protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture.1   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1999).     We\n\naffirm the order of the BIA and deny the petition.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n          Guzman entered the United States illegally on January 5,\n\n1990, somewhere along the Mexican border.    On June 26, 1997, the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued a Notice to\n\nAppear, charging Guzman with being removable under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without\n\nbeing admitted or paroled. Guzman admitted the factual allegations\n\nin the notice and conceded removability, but sought relief in the\n\nform of asylum and withholding of removal.\n\n          On January 24, 1998, an immigration judge held a hearing\n\nregarding Guzman's application.   Guzman testified that he was a\n\nmember of the Guatemalan Army during the civil war and would be\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (2000)). Article 3\nprohibits states from returning individuals to other states where\nthere are substantial grounds for believing they will be subject to\ntorture.\n\n                                -2-\n\fkilled if he returned to Guatemala.   He based his apprehension, in\n\npart, on an incident that occurred shortly before he fled the\n\ncountry.   Guzman testified that, in 1989, while on patrol in\n\nuniform in the town of San Sebastian, he and three other soldiers\n\nwere kidnaped by an unknown number of unidentified individuals.\n\nGuzman reported that he and the others were blindfolded, taken into\n\nthe hills surrounding the town, and beaten.    Although Guzman did\n\nnot know why or by whom he was kidnaped, he surmised they were\n\nguerrilla fighters.   After three hours, Guzman was able to escape.\n\nAs a result of the encounter he sustained a broken finger.   After\n\nhis escape, Guzman reported the incident to his supervisor in the\n\narmy, a lieutenant colonel.   Guzman testified that his supervisor\n\nstated that \"we could be killed at anytime\" and that Guzman's\n\nsafety could not be guaranteed. Days later, Guzman left Guatemala,\n\neventually entering the United States.\n\n           Guzman's apprehension of death were he to be returned to\n\nGuatemala rested also on communications with members of his family\n\nstill in Guatemala.    Guzman testified that his wife told him to\n\nstay in the United States because if he returned to Guatemala\n\n\"probably they would kill [him].\" Guzman's wife also reported that\n\nin 1994, \"they came looking for him.\"    When asked to identify the\n\n\"they,\" Guzman surmised \"I think that those are the guerrillas.\"\n\nLikewise, Guzman reported that his mother advised him not to return\n\nto Guatemala because his first cousin was killed in 1996.    Guzman\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fwas unable to testify with certainty who had killed his cousin or\n\nwhy, but he speculated that it \"[c]ould be the guerrillas because\n\nmy cousin was a member of the army.\"           Guzman admitted that he also\n\nfears returning to Guatemala because he was never discharged from\n\nthe Guatemalan Army, thus, upon fleeing the country, he became a\n\ndeserter.\n\n            In   an   oral   decision   made    at   the   conclusion   of   the\n\nhearing, the immigration judge denied Guzman's application for\n\nasylum and for the withholding of removal.             While the immigration\n\njudge found Guzman credible, he concluded that Guzman's one-time\n\nabduction and beating during the civil war did not constitute the\n\n\"past persecution\" necessary to obtain asylum.                The immigration\n\njudge also concluded that Guzman failed to establish that he had a\n\n\"well-founded fear of future persecution\" in Guatemala.             The judge\n\nobserved that if Guzman were to return to Guatemala his situation\n\nwould be no different from that of any other citizen.              The judge,\n\nciting to the State Department's Profile of Asylum Claims and\n\nCountry Conditions, also noted that the civil war in Guatemala had\n\nended in 1996.\n\n            Guzman appealed from the immigration judge's ruling to\n\nthe BIA.    While his appeal was pending, Guzman filed a motion to\n\nremand the case to the immigration judge to apply for protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.           That motion, filed November\n\n4, 1999, stated that \"[t]his relief was previously unavailable at\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe time the Respondent had his hearing for Asylum/Withholding of\n\nDeportation.\"      Guzman appended no documentation supporting his\n\nclaim for relief.\n\n             On May 21, 2002, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge's\n\ndecision denying asylum and withholding of removal. In addition to\n\nthe reasons set forth by the immigration judge, the BIA noted that\n\nGuzman had failed to demonstrate that any mistreatment had occurred\n\non account of one of the five statutorily protected grounds -- his\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.        See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(2002).\n\nThe   BIA   also   denied   Guzman's    motion   to   remand   to   apply   for\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.           According to the\n\nBIA, Guzman's motion failed to include any evidence or statements\n\nof torture which he fears, thus he failed to offer evidence that\n\nestablished a prima facie case for protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.        See id. § 3.23(b)(3).\n\n            This petition for review followed.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\nA.          Denial of Asylum and Withholding of Removal\n\n            We review the Board's findings of fact and credibility\n\nunder a \"substantial evidence\" standard.          Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d\n\n5,    9   (1st   Cir.   2001).    Board      determinations    of   statutory\n\neligibility for relief from deportation, whether via asylum or\n\nwithholding of removal, are conclusive if \"supported by reasonable,\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"      INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (quoting\n\n8   U.S.C.    §    1105a(a)(4)).        This   standard   of   review      is   quite\n\ndeferential: we will not reverse unless \"the record evidence would\n\ncompel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              The BIA had ample evidence from which to reject Guzman's\n\nasylum claim and a fortiori his petition to withhold removal.\n\nVelasquez v. Ashcroft, 316 F.3d 31 n.2 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that\n\nbecause the standard for withholding deportation is more stringent\n\nthan that for asylum, \"a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum\n\nstandard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former\").                  To carry his\n\nburden of establishing eligibility for asylum, Guzman had to prove\n\neither    past      persecution    or    a     well-founded    fear     of      future\n\npersecution based on one of the enumerated statutory grounds; race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\n\npolitical opinion.        Id. at 65 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).              If\n\nan applicant can prove past persecution, a regulatory presumption\n\nthat the applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution is\n\ntriggered.        8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\n              To establish past persecution more than harassment or\n\nspasmodic mistreatment by a totalitarian regime must be shown.\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 570 (the persecution alleged must be\n\nmore   than       mere   harassment).        Guzman   bears    a   heavy     burden;\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\festablishing past persecution is a daunting task. See Ravindran v.\n\nINS, 976 F.2d 754, 756-60 (1st Cir. 1992) (persecution not found\n\nwhere member of minority ethnic group had been interrogated and\n\nbeaten for three days in prison and warned about pursuing political\n\nactivities); Kapcia v. INS, 944 F.2d 702, 704, 708 (10th Cir. 1991)\n\n(no finding of past persecution where one petitioner was \"arrested\n\nfour times, detained three times, and beaten once,\" and another\n\n\"was detained for a two-day period during which time he was\n\ninterrogated and beaten\" and warned not to continue his political\n\nactivities); Kubon v. INS, 913 F.2d 386, 388 (7th Cir. 1990)\n\n(\"brief confinement for political opposition to a totalitarian\n\nregime does not necessarily constitute persecution\").         Guzman must\n\nestablish, moreover, through direct or circumstantial evidence,\n\nthat   his   alleged   persecutors    were   motivated   by   one   of   the\n\nstatutorily enumerated grounds.        Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483.\n\n             Here, there is substantial support for the BIA's finding\n\nthat petitioner failed to show he was singled out for persecution.\n\nThe record shows only that, while in the Army, Guzman was kidnaped\n\nby unknown individuals who may have been guerrillas, thrown into\n\nthe back of a truck, beaten and held captive for approximately\n\nthree hours resulting in superficial physical harm. Even assuming,\n\nwithout deciding, that targeting by guerrillas because of army\n\naffiliation could be a statutorily protected ground, this one-time\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fkidnaping and beating falls well short of establishing \"past\n\npersecution.\"\n\n             Both a subjective and objective component must underlie\n\na claim of a \"well-founded fear of future persecution.\"                 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A); Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758.                The asserted fear\n\nmust be subjectively genuine, and objectively, the applicant must\n\nshow \"'by credible, direct, and specific evidence, . . . facts that\n\nwould   support      a    reasonable    fear    that   the   petitioner    faces\n\npersecution.'\"       Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 758 (quoting Alvarez-Flores\n\nv. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n          Here, the immigration judge accepted as genuine Guzman's\n\nsubjective    fear       of   persecution,    but   determined   that   Guzman's\n\nevidence fell short of establishing his fear was objectively\n\nreasonable.    The civil war was concluded in 1996, and there was no\n\nevidence that Guzman would now be singled out for harm because he\n\nhad once been an army member.          While Guzman testified that his wife\n\nreceived a threat about his well-being in 1994 and that his first\n\ncousin was killed, the origin of, and the reason for, the threats\n\nagainst him were unclear, as was the cause of his cousin's death.\n\nBoth of these events apparently occurred before the cease-fire in\n\n1996.   The record established that other relatives of Guzman have\n\nlived, undisturbed, in Guatemala for more than a decade.                     See\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fcontinue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the\n\nalien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\")\n\n            The BIA, therefore, supportably concluded that Guzman\n\nfailed to establish eligibility for asylum and for withholding of\n\nremoval.    Velasquez, 316 F.3d at 31 n.2; see also Alvarez-Flores,\n\n909 F.2d at 4 (noting that a petitioner who fails to satisfy the\n\nasylum standard automatically fails to satisfy the standard for\n\nwithholding of deportation).\n\nB.          Convention Against Torture\n\n            Guzman argues that the BIA abused its discretion when it\n\ndenied his motion to remand for consideration of his claim for\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.         The BIA treated\n\nGuzman's motion to remand as a motion to reopen because Guzman\n\nrequested     additional   proceedings   pursuant   to   newly   enacted\n\nlegislation    implementing   a   previously   unavailable   avenue   of\n\nprotection.     See Al Najar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262, 1301 (11th\n\nCir. 2001).     The BIA denied the motion because Guzman \"failed to\n\noffer evidence that establishes a prima facie case for protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture.\"\n\n            The burden of proof was on Guzman to establish that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he would be tortured if he were removed\n\nto Guatemala.     8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2).     Generally, a motion to\n\nreopen must be accompanied \"by the appropriate application for\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\frelief and all supporting documentation.\"       Id. § 3.23(b)(3).2   The\n\nsupporting documentation must present a \"prima facie case of\n\neligibility for relief.\"   INS v. Abdu, 485 U.S. 94, 105 (1988).     To\n\nestablish a prima facie showing of torture, a petitioner must offer\n\nspecific showings that he or she will be subject to \"severe pain or\n\nsuffering, whether physical or mental\" by or at \"the instigation of\n\nor with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other\n\nperson acting in an official capacity.\"     8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).\n\n          Guzman's request for relief under Article 3 of the\n\nConvention   Against   Torture      did   not     contain   supporting\n\ndocumentation, nor, indeed, did it describe the nature of Guzman's\n\nConvention Against Torture claim.    Guzman urges us to consider the\n\nevidence in support of his application for asylum as evidence in\n\nsupport of his Convention Against Torture claim. But even so, this\n\n\n     2\n      After the Convention Against Torture went into effect in this\ncountry, the INS issued regulations governing petitions to reopen\nbased on the convention, Regulations Concerning the Convention\nAgainst Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8478 (1999) (codified in scattered\nsections of 8 C.F.R.). For aliens who had requests pending with\nthe INS on March 22, 1999, for protection under Article 3 of the\nConvention Against Torture, a more lenient standard for reopening\nexists. 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(b)(3)(B)(ii). Under the more lenient\nstandard a motion to reopen is not subject to the strictures of 8\nU.S.C. § 3.23 and \"shall be granted if it is accompanied by the\nnotice described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or by other convincing\nevidence that the alien had a request pending with the Service for\nprotection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture on\nMarch 22, 1999.\" Id. Guzman did not have a request pending for\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture on March 22, 1999, he\ndid not file his motion for protection until November 4, 1999. As\na result, he must meet the requirements set forth in 8 U.S.C. §\n3.23.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fevidence does not make out a prima facie case of eligibility for\n\nrelief.3   The kidnaping and beating that Guzman described in his\n\nasylum application were not inflicted on behalf of the government.\n\nThere is thus no evidence from which to infer that any harm\n\nsuffered upon return would be by or at \"the instigation of or with\n\nthe consent or acquiescence of, a public officials or other person\n\nacting in an official capacity.\"      Guzman presented no evidence,\n\nmoreover, that any penalties imposed upon him for desertion from\n\nthe Army would involve torture or the like.\n\n           Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Guzman conceded at oral argument that he had no additional\nevidence to present to the BIA in support of his application for\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

The civil war was concluded in 1996, and there was no evidence that Guzman would now be singled out for harm because he had once been an army member. While Guzman testified that his wife received a threat about his well-being in 1994 and that his first cousin was killed, the origin of, and the reason for, the threats against him were unclear, as was the cause of his cousin's death. Both of these events apparently occurred before the cease-fire in 1996. The record established that other relatives of Guzman have lived, undisturbed, in Guatemala for more than a decade. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, therefore, supportably concluded that Guzman failed to establish eligibility for asylum and for withholding of removal. <i>Velasquez,</i> 316 F.3d at 31 n. 2; <i>see also Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 4 (noting that a petitioner who fails to satisfy the asylum standard automatically fails to satisfy the standard for withholding of deportation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Convention Against Torture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzman argues that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied his motion to remand for consideration of his claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The BIA treated Guzman's motion to remand as a motion to reopen because Guzman requested additional proceedings pursuant to newly enacted legislation implementing a previously unavailable avenue of protection. <i>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft,</i> 257 F.3d 1262, 1301 (11th Cir. 2001). The BIA denied the motion because Guzman \"failed to offer evidence that establishes a prima facie case for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proof was on Guzman to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he were removed to Guatemala. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c)(2). Generally, a motion to reopen must be accompanied \"by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3.23(b)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The supporting documentation must present a \"prima facie case of eligibility for relief.\" <i>INS v. Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. 94, 105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). To establish a prima facie showing of torture, a petitioner must offer specific showings that he or she will be subject to \"severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental\" by or at \"the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzman's request for relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture did not contain supporting documentation, nor, indeed, did it describe the nature of Guzman's Convention Against Torture claim.

But even so, this evidence does not make out a prima facie case of eligibility for relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The kidnaping and beating that Guzman described in his asylum application were not inflicted on behalf of the government. There is thus no evidence from which to infer that any harm suffered upon return would be by or at \"the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public officials or other person acting in an official capacity.\" Guzman presented no evidence, moreover, that any penalties imposed upon him for desertion from the Army would involve torture or the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, was implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L.

On June 26, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued a Notice to Appear, charging Guzman with being removable under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Guzman admitted the factual allegations in the notice and conceded removability, but sought relief in the form of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 1998, an immigration judge held a hearing regarding Guzman's application. Guzman testified that he was a member of the Guatemalan Army during the civil war and would be killed if he returned to Guatemala. He based his apprehension, in part, on an incident that occurred shortly before he fled the country. Guzman testified that, in 1989, while on patrol in uniform in the town of San Sebastian, he and three other soldiers were kidnaped by an unknown number of unidentified individuals. Guzman reported that he and the others were blindfolded, taken into the hills surrounding the town, and beaten. Although Guzman did not know why or by whom he was kidnaped, he surmised they were guerrilla fighters. After three hours, Guzman was able to escape. As a result of the encounter he sustained a broken finger. After his escape, Guzman reported the incident to his supervisor in the army, a lieutenant colonel. Guzman testified that his supervisor stated that \"we could be killed at anytime\" and that Guzman's safety could not be guaranteed. Days later, Guzman left Guatemala, eventually entering the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzman's apprehension of death were he to be returned to Guatemala rested also on communications with members of his family still in Guatemala. Guzman testified that his wife told him to stay in the United States because if he returned to Guatemala \"probably they would kill [him].\" Guzman's wife also reported that in 1994, \"they came looking for him.\" When asked to identify the \"they,\" Guzman surmised \"I think that those are the guerrillas.\" Likewise, Guzman reported that his mother advised him not to return to Guatemala because his first cousin was killed in 1996. Guzman was unable to testify with certainty who had killed his cousin or why, but he speculated that it \"[c]ould be the guerrillas because my cousin was a member of the army.\" Guzman admitted that he also fears returning to Guatemala because he was never discharged from the Guatemalan Army, thus, upon fleeing the country, he became a deserter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral decision made at the conclusion of the hearing, the immigration judge denied Guzman's application for asylum and for the withholding of removal. While the immigration judge found Guzman credible, he concluded that Guzman's one-time abduction and beating during the civil war did not constitute the \"past persecution\" necessary to obtain asylum. The immigration judge also concluded that Guzman failed to establish that he had a \"well-founded fear of future persecution\" in Guatemala. The judge observed that if Guzman were to return to Guatemala his situation would be no different from that of any other citizen. The judge, citing to the State Department's Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions, also noted that the civil war in Guatemala had ended in 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzman appealed from the immigration judge's ruling to the BIA. While his appeal was pending, Guzman filed a motion to remand the case to the immigration judge to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture. That motion, filed November 4, 1999, stated that \"[t]his relief was previously unavailable at the time the Respondent had his hearing for Asylum/Withholding of Deportation.\" Guzman appended no documentation supporting his claim for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 2002, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge's decision denying asylum and withholding of removal. In addition to the reasons set forth by the immigration judge, the BIA noted that Guzman had failed to demonstrate that any mistreatment had occurred on account of one of the five statutorily protected grounds &#8212; his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(2002). The BIA also denied Guzman's motion to remand to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture.

Even assuming, without deciding, that targeting by guerrillas because of army affiliation could be a statutorily protected ground, this one-time kidnaping and beating falls well short of establishing \"past persecution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both a subjective and objective component must underlie a claim of a \"well-founded fear of future persecution.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>Ravindran,</i> 976 F.2d at 758. The asserted fear must be subjectively genuine, and objectively, the applicant must show \"`by credible, direct, and specific evidence, ... facts that would support a reasonable fear that the petitioner faces persecution.'\" <i>Ravindran,</i> 976 F.2d at 758 (quoting <i>Alvarez-Flores v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545202\"><a href=\"/opinion/545202/william-alexander-alvarez-flores-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the immigration judge accepted as genuine Guzman's subjective fear of persecution, but determined that Guzman's evidence fell short of establishing his fear was objectively reasonable. The civil war was concluded in 1996, and there was no evidence that Guzman would now be singled out for harm because he had once been an army member. While Guzman testified that his wife received a threat about his well-being in 1994 and that his first cousin was killed, the origin of, and the reason for, the threats against him were unclear, as was the cause of his cousin's death. Both of these events apparently occurred before the cease-fire in 1996. The record established that other relatives of Guzman have lived, undisturbed, in Guatemala for more than a decade. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, therefore, supportably concluded that Guzman failed to establish eligibility for asylum and for withholding of removal. <i>Velasquez,</i> 316 F.3d at 31 n. 2; <i>see also Alvarez-Flores,</i> 909 F.2d at 4 (noting that a petitioner who fails to satisfy the asylum standard automatically fails to satisfy the standard for withholding of deportation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Convention Against Torture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzman argues that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied his motion to remand for consideration of his claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The BIA treated Guzman's motion to remand as a motion to reopen because Guzman requested additional proceedings pursuant to newly enacted legislation implementing a previously unavailable avenue of protection. <i>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></span>, 1301 (11th Cir. 2001). The BIA denied the motion because Guzman \"failed to offer evidence that establishes a prima facie case for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proof was on Guzman to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he were removed to Guatemala. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c)(2). Generally, a motion to reopen must be accompanied \"by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3.23(b)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The supporting documentation must present a \"prima facie case of eligibility for relief.\" <i>INS v.

To establish a prima facie showing of torture, a petitioner must offer specific showings that he or she will be subject to \"severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental\" by or at \"the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzman's request for relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture did not contain supporting documentation, nor, indeed, did it describe the nature of Guzman's Convention Against Torture claim. Guzman urges us to consider the evidence in support of his application for asylum as evidence in support of his Convention Against Torture claim. But even so, this evidence does not make out a prima facie case of eligibility for relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The kidnaping and beating that Guzman described in his asylum application were not inflicted on behalf of the government. There is thus no evidence from which to infer that any harm suffered upon return would be by or at \"the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public officials or other person acting in an official capacity.\" Guzman presented no evidence, moreover, that any penalties imposed upon him for desertion from the Army would involve torture or the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, was implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L.
