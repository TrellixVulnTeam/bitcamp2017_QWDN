This case calls upon us to decide\n\nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires Maine to extend\n\ntuition payments to private sectarian secondary schools on behalf\n\nof students who reside in a school district that makes such\n\npayments available on a limited basis to private nonsectarian\n\nsecondary schools.     We hold that the Equal Protection Clause does\n\nnot   impose   any   such   obligation.   Accordingly,   although   our\n\nreasoning differs from that of the district court, we affirm the\n\nentry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            By statute, Maine commits to providing all school-aged\n\npersons with \"an opportunity to receive the benefits of a free\n\npublic education,\" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 2(1) (West\n\n2004), and vests authority in local school districts to fulfill\n\nthat undertaking by maintaining and supporting elementary and\n\nsecondary education, id. §§ 2(2), 4501. School districts, known in\n\nMaine's bureaucratic argot as school administrative units, enjoy\n\nsome flexibility in administering this guarantee. They may satisfy\n\nthe state mandate in any of three ways:        by operating their own\n\npublic schools, see id. § 1258(1), by contracting with outside\n\npublic schools to accept their students, see id. §§ 1258(2), 2701;\n\nor by paying private schools to provide such an education, see id.\n\n§§ 2951, 5204(4).    State law bars a school district that exercises\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthe third option from paying tuition to any private sectarian\n\nschool.    Id. § 2951(2).\n\n            The town of Minot comprises a school administrative unit.\n\nIt has decided to operate its own grade school (kindergarten\n\nthrough eighth grade), but has chosen to outsource secondary\n\neducation.     To this end, Minot has contracted with a neighboring\n\nschool district — the town of Poland — to educate at least 90% of\n\nits eligible students at Poland Regional High School (PRHS).              The\n\ncontract gives Minot the right to send up to 10% of its high\n\nschoolers to other approved nonsectarian secondary schools (private\n\nor public) so long as those students can demonstrate that they have\n\neducational needs that PRHS cannot satisfy.           The superintendent of\n\nSchool Union #29, which consists of the school administrative units\n\nof Poland, Mechanic Falls, and Minot, reviews applications for such\n\nalternative placements on a case-by-case basis.            By operation of\n\nsection 2951(2), however, sectarian schools cannot win approval for\n\npublicly     funded     tuition   payments   (and,    thus,   Minot     cannot\n\nunderwrite tuition for youths seeking to attend such schools).\n\n             John and Belinda Eulitt and Kelly J. MacKinnon are\n\nparents residing in Minot who, on their own dime, send their\n\ndaughters    to   St.   Dominic's   Regional   High    School,    a   Catholic\n\nsecondary school that is indisputably sectarian.                 They believe\n\nthat, under Minot's education plan, the state and the town should\n\npay tuition directly to St. Dominic's on behalf of their daughters\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fbecause PRHS does not offer classes in Catholic doctrine or teach\n\nfrom a Catholic viewpoint (and, therefore, does not meet the full\n\nrange of their daughters' educational needs). The parents have not\n\nsubmitted formal applications for such funding because section\n\n2951(2), which forbids the payment of public dollars to sectarian\n\nschools, would prevent the superintendent from approving any such\n\napplications.      Instead, as parents and next friends of their\n\ndaughters, they brought suit in Maine's federal district court\n\nagainst various state educational authorities.             Pertinently, their\n\ncomplaint   alleged     that     section      2951(2)'s   restriction    on   the\n\napproval of sectarian schools for placements funded by public\n\ntuition payments violates the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment because that restriction discriminates on the\n\nbases of religion, religious speech, and viewpoint.               Additionally,\n\nthe complaint asserted a separate equal protection claim on behalf\n\nof St. Dominic's, in which the parents argued that section 2951(2)\n\nstrips the school of equal protection of the laws because it denies\n\nthe school the ability to receive public funds for providing\n\nsecondary    education    services       even    though   it   allows    private\n\nnonsectarian schools to receive such stipends.\n\n            In   due   course,    the   parties     cross-moved    for   summary\n\njudgment.   The district court referred the motions to a magistrate\n\njudge who recommended, inter alia, that summary judgment be granted\n\nin favor of the defendants on the equal protection claims.                Eulitt\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fv. Me. Dep't of Educ., No. 02-162, 2003 WL 21909790, at *4 (D. Me.\n\nAug.   8,   2003).      The   magistrate   judge   ruled   that    the   Equal\n\nProtection Clause does not compel the provision of public funds to\n\nprivate sectarian schools, even when a school district has chosen\n\nto subsidize the payment of tuition to private nonsectarian schools\n\non a limited basis.       Id. at *3-4.     On objection, see 28 U.S.C. §\n\n636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), the district court concurred with\n\nthe magistrate judge's recommended decision, but it did so solely\n\non the ground that this court's decision in Strout v. Albanese, 178\n\nF.3d 57 (1st Cir. 1999), had \"authoritatively answered exactly the\n\nsame questions Plaintiffs now urge this Court to decide,\" and,\n\ntherefore, pretermitted further inquiry under the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis.    Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 307 F. Supp. 2d 158, 161\n\n(D. Me. 2004).       This appeal ensued.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            The appellants hawk three propositions on appeal. First,\n\nthey urge that the doctrine of stare decisis does not foreclose\n\nconsideration of their substantive claims.           Second, they contend\n\nthat the Establishment Clause does not compel Maine to eschew\n\npublic funding of sectarian education (and, hence, does not prevent\n\nthe state from providing the redress that they seek).             Third, they\n\nasseverate that section 2951(2) violates the Equal Protection\n\nClause because it discriminates on the bases of religion, religious\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fspeech,    and    viewpoint.          We     consider      these   propositions\n\nsequentially.\n\n                           A.    Stare Decisis.\n\n           As a general matter, the doctrine of stare decisis\n\nprecludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously\n\nbeen heard and authoritatively determined.                   Stewart v. Dutra\n\nConstr. Co., 230 F.3d 461, 467 (1st Cir. 2000).                 In other words,\n\nstare decisis \"renders the ruling of law in a case binding in\n\nfuture cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience\n\nto the decision.\"     Gately v. Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (emphasis in original).                For present purposes, the\n\nquestion   reduces    to   whether     our    earlier      decision   in    Strout\n\nconstitutes such a bar.\n\n           Strout arose in a very similar posture. There, we upheld\n\nthe constitutionality of section 2951(2) against equal protection,\n\nestablishment, and free exercise challenges brought by parents (not\n\nthe   present    plaintiffs)    who   sought      public    funding   for    their\n\nchildren's matriculation at St. Dominic's. Strout, 178 F.3d at 64-\n\n65.    The Strout panel rejected the equal protection challenge\n\nbecause Maine had shown a compelling interest in avoiding an\n\nEstablishment Clause violation through the exclusion of sectarian\n\nschools from its secondary education tuition program.                 Id. at 64.\n\nTwo members of the panel further speculated, in dictum, that if\n\nMaine's proffered     interest    had      been   found    to   depend     upon   an\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ferroneous understanding of the Establishment Clause (that is, if it\n\nhad   been    determined       that    payments     to     sectarian       schools   were\n\npermissible under that clause), then the state's exclusion of\n\nsectarian schools from the tuition program would not withstand\n\nscrutiny.      Id. at 64 n.12.\n\n              Three years later, the Supreme Court decided Zelman v.\n\nSimmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002).                     That opinion altered the\n\nlandscape of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in the school\n\nfinance      context    by     upholding      a   program    that       allowed   income-\n\nqualified parents in Cleveland to elect to apply state-funded\n\nschool    vouchers       toward       their    children's        tuition    at    private\n\nsectarian schools. Id. at 644-46, 663. The Zelman Court announced\n\nthat indirect public aid to sectarian education is constitutionally\n\npermissible when the financial assistance program has a valid\n\nsecular      purpose,    provides       benefits      to    a    broad     spectrum    of\n\nindividuals who can exercise genuine private choice among religious\n\nand secular options, and is neutral toward religion.                        Id. at 662-\n\n63.\n\n              Last     term,    the    Supreme      Court       again    addressed    the\n\napplication of the First Amendment to educational funding issues.\n\nThe Court upheld a Washington state college scholarship program\n\nthat prohibited the application of scholarship funds toward the\n\npursuit of a devotional theology degree.                    Locke v. Davey, 124 S.\n\nCt. 1307, 1309 (2004).             In so doing, the Court reaffirmed that\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f\"'there is room for play in the joints'\" between the Religion\n\nClauses.     Id. at 1311 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664,\n\n669 (1970)).      By this, the Davey Court meant that \"there are some\n\nstate   actions    permitted      by   the    Establishment    Clause    but    not\n\nrequired by the Free Exercise Clause.\"             Id.\n\n           The Zelman opinion raises the distinct possibility that\n\nStrout's   view    of   Maine's    asserted      interest   depended     upon   an\n\nincorrect interpretation of the Establishment Clause's strictures.\n\nDavey also casts doubt on the reasoning of Strout because it\n\nclarifies, and subtly alters, the decisional framework to be\n\napplied to equal protection claims that are rooted in allegations\n\nof religious discrimination.             The district court nevertheless\n\ndeclined to consider the effects of Zelman and Davey on the\n\ncontinuing vitality of Strout.               We do not find fault with that\n\ncautious approach.        See Crowe v. Bolduc, 365 F.3d 86, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)   (noting    that    district    court    correctly     regarded   circuit\n\nprecedent as \"good law\" even though a subsequent Supreme Court\n\ndictum had \"presaged the demise\" of the rule stated therein).\n\nUntil a court of appeals revokes a binding precedent, a district\n\ncourt within the circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent\n\nunless it has unmistakably been cast into disrepute by supervening\n\nauthority.     See Sarzen v. Gaughan, 489 F.2d 1076, 1082 (1st Cir.\n\n1973) (explaining that stare decisis requires lower courts to take\n\nbinding pronouncements \"at face value until formally altered\"); cf.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fAgostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237-38 (1997) (reaffirming that\n\nthe Court has the prerogative to overrule its own decisions).\n\n            We are, of course, in a somewhat different position.\n\nEven though \"our precedent-based system of justice places a premium\n\non finality, stability, and certainty in the law,\" Stewart, 230\n\nF.3d at 467, \"stare decisis is neither a straightjacket nor an\n\nimmutable rule,\" Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar.\n\nCo., 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2000).       Thus, a panel of the court\n\nof appeals has some flexibility, modest though it may be, with\n\nrespect to its own precedents.\n\n             Ordinarily, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel\n\ncircuit should consider themselves bound by prior panel decisions.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nThis rule     is   a   specialized   application   of   the   stare   decisis\n\nprinciple.     It is, however, subject to at least two exceptions,\n\neither of which may warrant a departure from a prior holding.\n\n            The first exception comes into play when a preexisting\n\npanel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling\n\nauthority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court, a decision of\n\nthe en banc court, or a statutory overruling.           Williams v. Ashland\n\nEng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995).            That exception does\n\nnot apply here.        Although Zelman did confirm that the state may\n\nprovide funding for sectarian education in certain instances, see\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fZelman, 536 U.S. at 662-63, the decision depended upon the Court's\n\ncareful consideration of the facts underlying the Cleveland voucher\n\nprogram, see id. at 653-57.       Even after Zelman and Davey, it is\n\nfairly debatable whether or not the Maine tuition program could\n\nsurvive an Establishment Clause challenge if the state eliminated\n\nsection 2951(2) and allowed sectarian schools to receive tuition\n\nfunds.1   Thus, the newly emergent Supreme Court case law does not\n\nnecessarily undercut the Strout panel's premise, 178 F.3d at 64 &\n\nn.12, that Maine could not extend funding to sectarian schools\n\nunder its program without violating the Establishment Clause.\n\n           A second exception exists when recent Supreme Court\n\nprecedent calls into legitimate question a prior opinion of an\n\ninferior court.      Carpenters Local Union No. 26, 215 F.3d at 141;\n\nsee also Crowe, 365 F.3d at 89, 92.         In that context, a reviewing\n\ncourt must   pause    to   consider   the   likely   significance   of   the\n\nneoteric Supreme Court case law before automatically ceding the\n\nfield to an earlier decision.          See Williams, 45 F.3d at 592\n\n(explaining that stare decisis may yield in \"those relatively rare\n\ninstances in which authority that postdates the original decision,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Without belaboring the point, we note that the Maine program\nis substantially narrower than the \"broad[] undertaking by the\nState to enhance educational options\" that was under scrutiny in\nZelman, 536 U.S. at 647. Moreover, Maine's scheme provides for the\napproval of applications based on an individualized assessment of\neducational benefit, whereas the Cleveland program employed only\nobjective criteria of financial need and residency. See id. at\n662.\n\n                                  -11-\n\falthough not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound\n\nreason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh\n\ndevelopments, would change its collective mind\").\n\n            We think that this exception applies here.                In Strout,\n\nthe panel explicitly relied on \"the present state of jurisprudence\"\n\nin determining that Maine's interest in excluding sectarian schools\n\nfrom its tuition program would survive any level of scrutiny\n\nbecause the Establishment Clause likely required the state to\n\nmaintain such an exclusion.         Strout, 178 F.3d at 64.           In reaching\n\nthis conclusion, the panel candidly observed that \"the guidance\n\nprovided by the Supreme Court has been less than crystalline.\" Id.\n\nZelman and Davey obviously constitute significant developments in\n\nthe pertinent jurisprudence and shed new light on the case law upon\n\nwhich   the    Strout      decision      hinged.       If     these    decisions,\n\ncollectively, do not make the law crystalline, they at least\n\nprovide more focused direction than was available to the Strout\n\npanel. Consequently, we find it incumbent upon us to reject a rote\n\napplication    of    stare    decisis    here    and   to   undertake     a    fresh\n\nanalysis.     See Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270\n\nF.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                      B.     The Establishment Clause.\n\n            The     appellants'    second       proposition     invites       us   to\n\ndetermine whether the state's asserted interest in maintaining\n\nsection 2951(2)'s parochial school exclusion in order to avoid an\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fEstablishment Clause violation is a valid one. This proposition is\n\nasserted out of order:              because the response to it depends upon\n\nwhat   level    of   scrutiny        we     should    apply   in     this   case,    the\n\nproposition     itself    is    not       susceptible    to   consideration         at   a\n\npreliminary point in our analysis.                  We explain briefly.\n\n            It cannot be gainsaid that Establishment Clause defenses\n\nsometimes trigger consideration of hypothetical statutory schemes\n\nto determine whether entanglement concerns actually justify a\n\nparticular feature of a challenged law.                   However, such defenses\n\nshould not be addressed until a court has identified the right at\n\nissue and ascertained the level of scrutiny that attaches to it.\n\nSee, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 112-\n\n13 (2001) (weighing the validity of a school's Establishment Clause\n\ndefense after finding that the challenged restriction constituted\n\nviewpoint      discrimination         and    that    strict    scrutiny     therefore\n\napplied);      Widmar    v.     Vincent,       454    U.S.    263,    270-71   (1981)\n\n(determining first that religious group's exclusion from open forum\n\nwas discriminatory,           and    then    reviewing    school's     Establishment\n\nClause defense for retaining its existing forum access policy\n\ninstead of adopting a hypothetical policy that would be more\n\ninclusive).      That sequence is particularly significant in view of\n\nthe time-honored axiom that federal courts should withhold decision\n\non vexing constitutional questions until consideration of those\n\nquestions becomes necessary.                See Ala. State Fed'n of Labor v.\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fMcAdory, 325 U.S. 450, 461 (1945) (noting that \"[i]t has long been\n\n[the   Court's]    considered      practice   not    to     decide     abstract,\n\nhypothetical      or   contingent     questions,      or     to   decide      any\n\nconstitutional     question   in    advance   of    the    necessity    for   its\n\ndecision\") (citations omitted); El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon,\n\n963 F.2d 488, 494 (1st Cir. 1992) (similar).\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter.               Consideration of\n\nthe question that the appellants seek to pose — whether section\n\n2951(2) or some similar restriction is indispensable to Maine's\n\nobligation to keep its tuition program in compliance with the\n\nEstablishment Clause — is premature at this juncture.                Instead, we\n\nexplore the contours of the right at issue and ascertain what level\n\nof scrutiny an Establishment Clause defense would have to survive.\n\n                         C.   Equal Protection.\n\n          The heart of the appellants' claim is the proposition\n\nthat section 2951(2) violates both the equal protection rights of\n\nSt. Dominic's and the appellants' own equal protection rights (as\n\nparents and next friends of their children) because the statute\n\ndiscriminates on the bases of religion and religious speech.\n\nBefore untangling this argument, we first address the threshold\n\nquestion of standing.\n\n          1.      Standing.   We start with the question whether the\n\nappellants have standing to raise a constitutional claim on behalf\n\nof St. Dominic's.      An individual who asserts the constitutional\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\frights of a third party must, of course, satisfy the Article III\n\nrequirements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability with\n\nrespect to the third-party claim. See Valley Forge Christian Coll.\n\nv. Americans United for Sep. of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464,\n\n472 (1982). In addition, that party must satisfy the prerequisites\n\nthat arise from prudential limitations on the jurisdiction of the\n\nfederal courts, namely, that the litigant personally has suffered\n\nan injury in fact that gives rise to a sufficiently concrete\n\ninterest in the adjudication of the third party's rights; that the\n\nlitigant has a close relationship to the third party; and that some\n\nhindrance exists that prevents the third party from protecting its\n\nown interests.     Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 411 (1991); Playboy\n\nEnters. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 906 F.2d 25, 37 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           In the case at hand, the appellants contend that section\n\n2951(2)   causes   them   injury   in   fact   because   it   compels   the\n\nsuperintendent to reject all applications for the funding of a high\n\nschool education at St. Dominic's on the ground that the school is\n\nreligiously oriented (and, thus, ineligible to receive tuition\n\npayments).   Therefore, the statute's restriction on the school\n\ntranslates into the parents' inability to gain approval for the\n\npublic funding of their children's sectarian education.          This link\n\nbetween the appellants' interests and those of St. Dominic's may\n\nsuggest the type of special relationship that would support a\n\ndeparture from the general proscription on jus tertii claims. See,\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fe.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 195 (1976) (finding vendor\n\nsatisfied jus tertii requirement to advocate for rights of third-\n\nparty consumers who may wish to purchase its wares); Pierce v.\n\nSoc'y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925) (recognizing standing of\n\nreligious schools to assert the rights of potential pupils who\n\nmight seek access to their education services).\n\n          Assuming for argument's sake, but without deciding, that\n\nboth an injury and a sufficient relationship exist, the appellants\n\nnonetheless stumble on the third step of the jus tertii standing\n\nframework: they have wholly failed to show any obstacle preventing\n\nSt. Dominic's from bringing suit to protect itself against the\n\nimagined infringements.   The appellants have advanced no credible\n\nsuggestion either that St. Dominic's is generically unable to\n\nassert its rights or that the circumstances of this case create\n\nsome idiosyncratic barrier to such a suit.   Then, too, all of the\n\nenvironmental factors point the other way.   For one thing, section\n\n2951(2) does not impose or threaten to impose any criminal or civil\n\npenalty for any action that might be taken by sectarian schools.\n\nThus, this case does not fall into the isthmian category of cases\n\nin which courts have recognized jus tertii standing because a third\n\nparty is understandably reluctant to engage in the allegedly\n\nprotected activity for fear of prosecution or other penalty.2   See,\n\n\n     2\n      The appellants alleged for the first time in their appellate\nbriefs that St. Dominic's faced an obstacle to suit arising out of\nthe risk of \"reprisals\" by the appellees (e.g., the loss of\n\n                               -16-\n\fe.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973) (recognizing\n\nthird-party standing to bring First Amendment overbreadth claims).\n\nFor another thing, the appellants are not exposed to any criminal\n\nor civil penalty because of their interaction with the school;\n\naccordingly, cases in which the putative litigant faced such\n\npenalties by providing assistance or service to the holder of the\n\nthird-party right are inapposite.     See, e.g., Craig, 429 U.S. at\n\n193-94 (finding third-party standing where litigant, a beer vendor,\n\nfaced sanctions and loss of license for sales to men between\n\neighteen and twenty years of age).    And, finally, this case is not\n\none in which the right-holder has little or no financial incentive\n\nto pursue suit or, alternatively, would face great difficulty in\n\ndemonstrating that the alleged injury was likely to reoccur.   See,\n\ne.g., Powers, 499 U.S. at 414-15 (noting that the barriers to suit\n\nby a potential juror who believes he has been excluded because of\n\nrace are \"daunting\" because of the small financial stake involved\n\nas well as the difficulty of proving that such discrimination would\n\nrecur).\n\n          At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that\n\nthe underlying justifications for the prudential limitation on\n\nthird-party standing could be thwarted were the appellants allowed\n\n\n\napproved status for purposes of Maine's compulsory school laws).\nThis charge, in addition to being belated, is entirely without\nfoundation in the summary judgment record. We therefore reject it\nout of hand.\n\n                               -17-\n\fto serve as proxy-holders for St. Dominic's.   Those justifications\n\ninclude the venerable tenet that \"third parties themselves usually\n\nwill be the best proponents of their own rights.\"      Singleton v.\n\nWulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114 (1976).        They also include the wise\n\ncounsel that, sometimes, the holder of a right has reasons of its\n\nown for not pursuing potential claims.      See, e.g., Friedman v.\n\nHarold, 638 F.2d 262, 265-66 (1st Cir. 1981).       An exception to\n\nthese basic maxims sometimes is warranted because a congruence of\n\ninterests exists between a litigant and a third party. See Playboy\n\nEnters., 906 F.2d at 38.   Here, however, it is by no means apparent\n\nthat the appellants and St. Dominic's share a common interest; it\n\nis entirely possible that the school has refrained from litigation\n\nprecisely because it is not interested in participating in Maine's\n\ntuition program and thereby subjecting itself to any number of\n\nconcomitant state regulations.     Cf., e.g., Am. Library Ass'n v.\n\nOdom, 818 F.2d 81, 82 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (finding that researchers\n\nseeking access to certain library materials could not assert\n\nlibrary's property rights); Friedman, 638 F.2d at 266 (finding that\n\nbankruptcy trustee was an inappropriate party to assert certain\n\nrights of debtor).\n\n          For these reasons, we hold that the appellants lack\n\nthird-party standing to advance St. Dominic's equal protection\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f              This holding does not end our odyssey.            Although the\n\nappellants lack standing to pursue their jus tertii claim, they do\n\nhave standing in their own right to seek global relief in the form\n\nof an injunction against the enforcement of section 2951(2) and a\n\ndeclaration of the statute's unconstitutionality.              The appellants\n\nhave established standing directly based on their allegation that\n\nsection 2951(2) effectively deprives them of the opportunity to\n\nhave their children's tuition at St. Dominic's paid by public\n\nfunding.      Even though it is the educational institution, not the\n\nparent, that would receive the tuition payments for a student whose\n\n\"educational requirements\" application was approved, it is the\n\nparent who must submit such an application and who ultimately will\n\nbenefit    from    the   approval.    Because    section   2951(2)    imposes\n\nrestrictions on that approval, the parents' allegation of injury in\n\nfact to their interest in securing tuition funding provides a\n\nsatisfactory predicate for standing.            See Bennett v. Spear, 520\n\nU.S.   154,    168-69    (1997)   (explaining    that   harm    \"produced   by\n\ndeterminative or coercive effect\" upon a third party satisfies the\n\ninjury in fact requirement when the harm is \"fairly traceable\" to\n\nthat effect).\n\n              2.   The Merits.    We thus proceed to the merits of the\n\nappellants' equal protection claim and consider whether recent\n\nSupreme Court precedents, especially the Court's opinions in Zelman\n\nand Davey, provide a sound basis for overturning Strout.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f               In undertaking this examination, we review the district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment de novo, considering the record\n\nand all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable\n\nto the summary judgment losers (here, the appellants).                      Garside v.\n\nOsco       Drug,    Inc.,    895   F.2d     46,   48   (1st   Cir.    1990).        Our\n\nconsideration is not inextricably linked to the district court's\n\nstare decisis theory; rather, we may affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment on any independent ground fairly presented in the record.\n\nHoulton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n               The    appellants     first    contend    that   section       2951(2)\n\ndiscriminates against them on the basis of religion by forcing them\n\nto   choose        between   a   publicly    funded    education     and    what   they\n\ndescribe as \"their fundamental right[] of religion.\"                       Appellants'\n\nBr. at 22.         They attempt to position this harm under the rubric of\n\nequal protection,3 avoiding any detailed reference to the Free\n\n\n       3\n      In their briefs, the appellants alternately invoke the\nlanguage of fundamental rights and suspect classifications.      We\nfocus here on their claim of religion as a fundamental right. We\nnote, however, the hopelessness of any effort to suggest that those\nwho choose to send their children to religious schools comprise a\nsuspect class. The Supreme Court has taken a very limited approach\nin recognizing suspect classifications.     See, e.g., Johnson v.\nRobison, 415 U.S. 361, 375 n.14 (1974) (describing criteria for\nestablishing a suspect classification). The traditional indicia of\nsuspect   classification,   such   as   immutable   characteristics\ndetermined by birth or membership in a group that is politically\npowerless, are not present in this case. See id. (declining to\ncategorize group of religious conscientious objectors as a suspect\nclass); see also Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 325, 338-39\n\n                                          -20-\n\fExercise Clause even though that clause defines the scope of the\n\nfundamental   right   to     religion   incorporated    by    the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment's equal protection guarantee.            See Johnson v. Robison,\n\n415 U.S. 361, 375 n.14 (1974).\n\n            This crabbed approach will not wash.              In Davey, the\n\nSupreme Court clearly rejected this type of effort to erect a\n\nseparate and distinct framework for analyzing claims of religious\n\ndiscrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.             See Davey, 124\n\nS. Ct. at 1312 n.3 (confirming that the Free Exercise Clause\n\nprovides    the     primary     framework    for     assessing       religious\n\ndiscrimination claims).       Along these lines, the Court held that if\n\na challenged program comports with the Free Exercise Clause, that\n\nconclusion wraps up the religious discrimination analysis. See id.\n\nThus,    rational   basis    scrutiny   applies    to   any   further    equal\n\nprotection inquiry.4        See id.; see also Johnson, 415 U.S. at 375\n\n\n(1987) (explaining that although laws that draw distinctions among\nreligions can give rise to a suspect classification triggering\nstrict scrutiny, provisions that distinguish generally between\nsecular and religious entities engender rational basis scrutiny).\n     4\n      The majority in Strout found it unnecessary to articulate the\nparticular level of scrutiny it employed in rejecting the equal\nprotection challenge. Strout, 178 F.3d at 64. To the extent the\npanel may have suggested that a religious discrimination claim\nmight be twice subjected to an analysis aimed at determining the\nlevel of scrutiny to be applied — once under the Free Exercise\nClause and again as a freestanding claim under the Equal Protection\nClause — that implication must be abandoned. Davey unequivocally\nrejected such an approach on the ground that the free exercise\nanalysis definitively answers the question whether the challenged\nstate action impermissibly infringes upon the fundamental right to\nreligion.   See Davey, 124 S. Ct. at 1312 n.3.      Thus, an equal\n\n                                    -21-\n\fn.14 (explaining that once a law is found to be valid with respect\n\nto the free exercise right, there is \"no occasion to apply to the\n\nchallenged classification a standard of scrutiny stricter than the\n\ntraditional rational-basis test\" in addressing an equal protection\n\nclaim).      Accordingly, we inquire whether intervening Supreme Court\n\nprecedent alters the panel's conclusion in Strout that section\n\n2951(2) marks no free exercise violation.\n\n               In Strout, the panel held that section 2951(2) imposes no\n\nsubstantial      burden    on     religious   beliefs   or   practices    —   and\n\ntherefore does not implicate the Free Exercise Clause — because it\n\ndoes not prohibit attendance at a religious school or otherwise\n\nprevent      parents    from    choosing   religious    education   for    their\n\nchildren.5       Strout, 178 F.3d at 65.         Far from undermining that\n\nanalysis, Davey reinforces it.             Indeed, Davey confirms that the\n\nFree       Exercise    Clause's    protection   of   religious   beliefs      and\n\npractices from direct government encroachment does not translate\n\ninto an affirmative requirement that public entities fund religious\n\n\n\nprotection claim that challenges a law found not to violate the\nFree Exercise Clause gives rise only to rational basis review. See\nid.\n       5\n      We add that the statute does not exclude residents of Minot\nfrom participation in the tuition program on the basis of religion;\nall school-aged residents are equally eligible to apply for the\nbenefit that the program extends — a free secular education. Any\nshift in the decisional calculus for parents who must decide\nwhether to take advantage of that benefit or pay to send their\nchildren to a school that provides a religious education is a\nburden of the sort permitted in Davey, 124 S. Ct. at 1315.\n\n                                       -22-\n\factivity simply because they choose to fund the secular equivalents\n\nof such activity.    See Davey, 124 S. Ct. at 1313.      Consequently,\n\nthe appellants' effort to characterize Maine's decision not to\n\ndeploy limited tuition dollars toward the funding of religious\n\neducation as an impermissible burden on their prerogative to send\n\ntheir children to Catholic school is futile.        The fact that the\n\nstate cannot interfere with a parent's fundamental right to choose\n\nreligious education for his or her child does not mean that the\n\nstate must fund that choice.    Cf. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 475-\n\n77 (1977) (explaining that the fundamental right to abortion does\n\nnot entail a companion right to a state-financed abortion).\n\n            The appellants endeavor to cabin Davey and restrict its\n\nteachings to the context of funding instruction for those training\n\nto enter religious ministries.    Their attempt is unpersuasive.     We\n\nfind no authority that suggests that the \"room for play in the\n\njoints\" identified by the Davey Court, 124 S. Ct. at 1311, is\n\napplicable to certain education funding decisions but not others.\n\nWe read Davey more broadly:      the decision there recognized that\n\nstate entities, in choosing how to provide education, may act upon\n\ntheir   legitimate   concerns   about   excessive   entanglement   with\n\nreligion, even though the Establishment Clause may not require them\n\nto do so.\n\n            In addition to holding that section 2951(2) imposes no\n\nconstitutionally impermissible burden on religion, the Strout panel\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\ffound no indication that substantial animus against religion had\n\nmotivated the passage of that law.              See Strout, 178 F.3d at 65.\n\nDespite this finding, the appellants, relying on Church of the\n\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993),\n\nresurrect    the   claim     that    section      2951(2)     is    presumptively\n\nunconstitutional because it lacks religious neutrality on its face.\n\nAccording to this thesis, the fact that the statute expressly\n\nexcludes    sectarian      institutions      as    potential       recipients     of\n\neducation funds necessarily indicates an animus against religion.\n\n            The decision in Lukumi cannot bear the weight that the\n\nappellants pile upon it.            There, the Court invalidated a local\n\nordinance that made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal\n\nslaughter   because     it   found    overwhelming     evidence      that   animus\n\nagainst    the   Santeria    religion     had     motivated    the    ordinance's\n\npassage.    See id. at 535, 546.        There is not a shred of evidence\n\nthat any comparable animus fueled the enactment of the challenged\n\nMaine statute.\n\n            The Davey Court catalogued the principal factors to be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a particular law is motivated by\n\nreligious animus.     To determine whether any implication that might\n\nbe drawn from a state's decision not to fund a particular activity\n\nconstitutes impermissible animus, an inquiring court must examine\n\nwhether the state action in question imposes any civil or criminal\n\nsanction    on   religious    practice,      denies    participation        in   the\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fpolitical affairs of the community, or requires individuals to\n\nchoose between religious beliefs and government benefits.                      See\n\nDavey, 124 S. Ct. at 1312-13.            To the extent that these factors\n\narticulate a test for smoking out an anti-religious animus, the\n\nstatute here passes that test with flying colors. Maine's decision\n\nnot to    extend     tuition   funding      to   religious   schools    does   not\n\nthreaten any civil or criminal penalty.            By the same token, it does\n\nnot in any way inhibit political participation.               Finally, it does\n\nnot require residents to forgo religious convictions in order to\n\nreceive the benefit offered by the state — a secular education.\n\n             If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — Davey\n\nrecognized that states are not required to go to the brink of what\n\nthe Establishment Clause permits.             Id. at 1311-12.      As part of its\n\nformulation    of    this   doctrine,    the     Davey   Court     confirmed   the\n\nlegitimacy of extra-constitutional Establishment Clause concerns.\n\nSee id.     Given these acknowledgments, it would be illogical to\n\nimpose upon government entities a presumption of hostility whenever\n\nthey take into account plausible entanglement concerns in making\n\ndecisions in areas that fall within the figurative space between\n\nthe Religion Clauses.          Just as the Davey Court found that the\n\nscholarship program at issue there was not inherently suspect\n\nsimply    because    \"there    [was]   no     doubt   that   the    State   could,\n\nconsistent    with    the   Federal    Constitution,     permit     [scholarship\n\nrecipients] to pursue a degree in devotional theology,\" id., the\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fmere fact that a hypothetical program in which Maine extended\n\ntuition    funding   to   parochial    schools     might   comport    with   the\n\nEstablishment Clause would not support a presumption that religious\n\nhostility motivated its decision not to adopt such a scheme.\n\n            In sum, recent Supreme Court jurisprudence reinforces\n\nrather than undermines Strout's conclusion that section 2951(2)\n\nperpetrates no free exercise violation. That reinforced conclusion\n\nshortens the road that we must travel.            Having determined that the\n\nappellants' free exercise rights are not implicated by section\n\n2951(2),    we   have     no   occasion      to   ponder    whether    Maine's\n\nEstablishment Clause defense constitutes a compelling interest that\n\njustifies the challenged restriction.             This, in turn, renders it\n\nunnecessary to construct and construe a hypothetical tuition plan\n\nbased on the premise that Maine would repeal section 2951(2) but\n\nleave intact all other relevant provisions of the statutory scheme.\n\n            It follows inexorably that we must apply rational basis\n\nscrutiny to the lines that the Maine statute actually draws.                 See\n\nDavey, 124 S. Ct. at 1312 n.3.        That means that the appellants bear\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that there exists no fairly conceivable\n\nset of facts that could ground a rational relationship between the\n\nchallenged classification and the government's legitimate goals.\n\nKittery Motorcycle, Inc. v.

At oral argument in this court, they conceded that if the\n\nrational basis test applies, their equal protection claim fails.\n\nThis concession is understandable: the legislative history clearly\n\nindicates Maine's reasons for excluding religious schools from\n\neducation plans that extend public funding to private schools for\n\nthe provision of secular education to Maine students.                        These\n\nreasons include Maine's interests in concentrating limited state\n\nfunds    on   its   goal     of    providing   secular      education,   avoiding\n\nentanglement,       and    allaying    concerns     about   accountability   that\n\nundoubtedly would accompany state oversight of parochial schools'\n\ncurricula and policies (especially those pertaining to admission,\n\nreligious tolerance, and participation in religious activities).\n\nIn all events, we accept the appellants' concession at face value\n\nand hold that their equal protection challenge to section 2951(2)\n\nfails as a matter of law.\n\n              We need not tarry in addressing appellants' additional\n\ncontention that section 2951(2) violates the fundamental right to\n\nspeech    because     it    discriminates      on    the    basis   of   religious\n\nviewpoint.       The statute at issue here does not implicate the\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fappellants' speech rights at all.   As the Supreme Court made clear\n\nin Davey, state programs to fund general tuition costs are not fora\n\nfor speech.    Davey, 124 S. Ct. at 1312 n.3.    The Maine education\n\nplan deals with the provision of secular secondary educational\n\ninstruction to its residents; it does not commit to providing any\n\nopen forum to encourage diverse views from private speakers.\n\nConsequently, cases dealing with speech fora — such as Rosenberger\n\nv. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), relied\n\nupon by the appellants — are not relevant.      See Davey, 124 S. Ct.\n\n1312 n.3.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the district court did not err in granting the\n\nappellees' motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -28-\n\f",

We hold that the Equal Protection Clause does not impose any such obligation. Accordingly, although our reasoning differs from that of the district court, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By statute, Maine commits to providing all school-aged persons with \"an opportunity to receive the benefits of a free public education,\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 2(1) (West 2004), and vests authority in local school districts to fulfill that undertaking by maintaining and supporting elementary and secondary education, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2(2), 4501. School districts, known in Maine's bureaucratic argot as school administrative units, enjoy some flexibility in administering this guarantee. They may satisfy the state mandate in any of three ways: by operating their own public schools, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1258(1), by contracting with outside public schools to accept their students, <i>see id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1258(2), 2701; or by paying private schools to provide such an education, <i>see id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2951, 5204(4). State law bars a school district that exercises the third option from paying tuition to any private sectarian school. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2951(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The town of Minot comprises a school administrative unit. It has decided to operate its own grade school (kindergarten through eighth grade), but has chosen to outsource secondary education. To this end, Minot has contracted with a neighboring school district &#8212; the town of Poland &#8212; to educate at least 90% of its eligible students at Poland Regional High School (PRHS). The contract gives Minot the right to send up to 10% of its high schoolers to other approved nonsectarian secondary schools (private or public) so long as those students can demonstrate that they have educational needs that PRHS cannot satisfy. The superintendent of School Union # 29, which consists of the school administrative units of Poland, Mechanic Falls, and Minot, reviews applications for such alternative placements on a case-by-case basis. By operation of section 2951(2), however, sectarian schools cannot win approval for publicly funded tuition payments (and, thus, Minot cannot underwrite tuition for youths seeking to attend such schools).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John and Belinda Eulitt and Kelly J. MacKinnon are parents residing in Minot who, on their own dime, send their daughters to St. Dominic's Regional High School, a Catholic secondary school that is indisputably sectarian. They believe that, under Minot's education plan, the state and the town should pay tuition directly to St. Dominic's on behalf of their daughters because PRHS does not offer classes in Catholic doctrine or teach from a Catholic viewpoint (and, therefore, does not meet the full range of their daughters' educational needs). The parents have not submitted formal applications for such funding because section 2951(2), which forbids the payment of public dollars to sectarian schools, would prevent the superintendent from approving any such applications. Instead, as parents and next friends of their daughters, they brought suit in Maine's federal district court against various state educational authorities. Pertinently, their complaint alleged that section 2951(2)'s restriction on the approval of sectarian schools for placements funded by public tuition payments violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because that restriction discriminates on the bases of religion, religious speech, and viewpoint. Additionally, the complaint asserted a separate equal protection claim on behalf of St. Dominic's, in which the parents argued that section 2951(2) strips the school of equal protection of the laws because it denies the school the ability to receive public funds for providing secondary education services even though it allows private nonsectarian schools to receive such stipends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge who recommended, inter alia, that summary judgment be granted in favor of the defendants on the equal protection claims. <i>Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> No. 02-162, 2003 WL 21909790, at *4 (D.Me. Aug.8, 2003). The magistrate judge ruled that the Equal Protection Clause does not compel the provision of public funds to private sectarian schools, even when a school district has chosen to subsidize the payment of tuition to private nonsectarian schools on a limited basis. <i>Id.</i> at *3-4. On objection, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1); Fed. R.Civ.P. 72(b), the district court concurred with the magistrate judge's recommended decision, but it did so solely on the ground that this court's decision in <i>Strout v. Albanese,</i> 178 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.1999), had \"authoritatively answered exactly the same questions Plaintiffs now urge this Court to decide,\" and, therefore, pretermitted further inquiry under the doctrine of stare decisis. <i>Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d 158, 161 (D.Me.2004). This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants hawk three propositions on appeal. First, they urge that the doctrine of stare decisis does not foreclose consideration of their substantive claims. Second, they contend that the Establishment Clause does not compel Maine to eschew public funding of sectarian education (and, hence, does not prevent the state from providing the redress that they seek). Third, they asseverate that section 2951(2) violates the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates on the bases of religion, religious speech, and viewpoint. We consider these propositions sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Stare Decisis.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, the doctrine of stare decisis precludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously been heard and authoritatively determined. <i>Stewart v. Dutra Constr. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 461, 467 (1st Cir.2000). In other words, stare decisis \"renders the ruling of <i>law</i> in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision.\" <i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir.1993) (emphasis in original). For present purposes, the question reduces to whether our earlier decision in <i>Strout</i> constitutes such a bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Strout</i> arose in a very similar posture. There, we upheld the constitutionality of section 2951(2) against equal protection, establishment, and free exercise challenges brought by parents (not the present plaintiffs) who sought public funding for their children's matriculation at St. Dominic's. <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 64-65. The <i>Strout</i> panel rejected the equal protection challenge because Maine had shown a compelling interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation through the exclusion of sectarian schools from its secondary education tuition program. <i>Id.</i> at 64. Two members of the panel further speculated, in dictum, that if Maine's proffered interest had been found to depend upon an erroneous understanding of the Establishment Clause (that is, if it had been determined that payments to sectarian schools were permissible under that clause), then the state's exclusion of sectarian schools from the tuition program would not withstand scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> at 64 n. 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three years later, the Supreme Court decided <i>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,</i> 536 U.S. 639, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002). That opinion altered the landscape of Establishment Clause jurisprudence in the school finance context by upholding a program that allowed income-qualified parents in Cleveland to elect to apply state-funded school vouchers toward their children's tuition at private sectarian schools. <i>Id.</i> at 644-46, 663, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The <i>Zelman</i> Court announced that indirect public aid to sectarian education is constitutionally permissible when the financial assistance program has a valid secular purpose, provides benefits to a broad spectrum of individuals who can exercise genuine private choice among religious and secular options, and is neutral toward religion. <i>Id.</i> at 662-63., 122 S.Ct. 2460</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last term, the Supreme Court again addressed the application of the First Amendment to educational funding issues. The Court upheld a Washington state college scholarship program that prohibited the application of scholarship funds toward the pursuit of a devotional theology degree. <i>Locke v. Davey,</i> 540 U.S. 712, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 1309, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004). In so doing, the Court reaffirmed that \"`there is room for play in the joints'\" between the Religion Clauses. <i>Id.</i> at 1311 (quoting <i>Walz v. Tax Comm'n,</i> 397 U.S. 664, 669, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)). By this, the <i>Davey</i> Court meant that \"there are some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Zelman</i> opinion raises the distinct possibility that <i>Strout's</i> view of Maine's asserted interest depended upon an incorrect interpretation of the Establishment Clause's strictures. <i>Davey</i> also casts doubt on the reasoning of <i>Strout</i> because it clarifies, and subtly alters, the decisional framework to be applied to equal protection claims that are rooted in allegations of religious discrimination. The district court nevertheless declined to consider the effects of <i>Zelman</i> and <i>Davey</i> on the continuing vitality of <i>Strout.</i> We do not find fault with that cautious approach. <i>See Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> 365 F.3d 86, 94 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that district court correctly regarded circuit precedent as \"good law\" even though a subsequent Supreme Court dictum had \"presaged the demise\" of the rule stated therein). Until a court of appeals revokes a binding precedent, a district court within the circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent unless it has unmistakably been cast into disrepute by supervening authority. <i>See Sarzen v. Gaughan,</i> 489 F.2d 1076, 1082 (1st Cir. 1973) (explaining that stare decisis requires lower courts to take binding pronouncements \"at face value until formally altered\"); <i>cf. Agostini v. Felton,</i> 521 U.S. 203, 237-38, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997) (reaffirming that the Court has the prerogative to overrule its own decisions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are, of course, in a somewhat different position. Even though \"our precedent-based system of justice places a premium on finality, stability, and certainty in the law,\" <i>Stewart,</i> 230 F.3d at 467, \"<i>stare decisis</i> is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule,\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2000). Thus, a panel of the court of appeals has some flexibility, modest though it may be, with respect to its own precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit should consider themselves bound by prior panel decisions. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991). This rule is a specialized application of the stare decisis principle. It is, however, subject to at least two exceptions, either of which may warrant a departure from a prior holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first exception comes into play when a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court, a decision of the en banc court, or a statutory overruling. <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995). That exception does not apply here. Although <i>Zelman</i> did confirm that the state may provide funding for sectarian education in certain instances, <i>see Zelman,</i> 536 U.S. at 662-63, 122 S.Ct. 2460, the decision depended upon the Court's careful consideration of the facts underlying the Cleveland voucher program, <i>see id.</i> at 653-57, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Even after <i>Zelman</i> and <i>Davey,</i> it is fairly debatable whether or not the Maine tuition program could survive an Establishment Clause challenge if the state eliminated section 2951(2) and allowed sectarian schools to receive tuition funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thus, the newly emergent Supreme Court case law does not necessarily undercut the <i>Strout</i> panel's premise, 178 F.3d at 64 &amp; n. 12, that Maine could not extend funding to sectarian schools under its program without violating the Establishment Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second exception exists when recent Supreme Court precedent calls into legitimate question a prior opinion of an inferior court. <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 141; <i>see also Crowe,</i> 365 F.3d at 89, 92. In that context, a reviewing court must pause to consider the likely significance of the neoteric Supreme Court case law before automatically ceding the field to an earlier decision. <i>See Williams,</i> 45 F.3d at 592 (explaining that stare decisis may yield in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this exception applies here. In <i>Strout,</i> the panel explicitly relied on \"the present state of jurisprudence\" in determining that Maine's interest in excluding sectarian schools from its tuition program would survive any level of scrutiny because the Establishment Clause likely required the state to maintain such an exclusion. <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 64. In reaching this conclusion, the panel candidly observed that \"the guidance provided by the Supreme Court has been less than crystalline.\" <i>Id. Zelman</i> and <i>Davey</i> obviously constitute significant developments in the pertinent jurisprudence and shed new light on the case law upon which the <i>Strout</i> decision hinged. If these decisions, collectively, do not make the law crystalline, they at least provide more focused direction than was available to the <i>Strout</i> panel. Consequently, we find it incumbent upon us to reject a rote application of stare decisis here and to undertake a fresh analysis. <i>See Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico,</i> 270 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Establishment Clause.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second proposition invites us to determine whether the state's asserted interest in maintaining section 2951(2)'s parochial school exclusion in order to avoid an Establishment Clause violation is a valid one. This proposition is asserted out of order: because the response to it depends upon what level of scrutiny we should apply in this case, the proposition itself is not susceptible to consideration at a preliminary point in our analysis. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It cannot be gainsaid that Establishment Clause defenses sometimes trigger consideration of hypothetical statutory schemes to determine whether entanglement concerns actually justify a particular feature of a challenged law. However, such defenses should not be addressed until a court has identified the right at issue and ascertained the level of scrutiny that attaches to it. <i>See, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch.,</i> 533 U.S. 98, 112-13, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001) (weighing the validity of a school's Establishment Clause defense after finding that the challenged restriction constituted viewpoint discrimination and that strict scrutiny therefore applied); <i>Widmar v. Vincent,</i> 454 U.S. 263, 270-71, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (determining first that religious group's exclusion from open forum was discriminatory, and then reviewing school's Establishment Clause defense for retaining its existing forum access policy instead of adopting a hypothetical policy that would be more inclusive). That sequence is particularly significant in view of the time-honored axiom that federal courts should withhold decision on vexing constitutional questions until consideration of those questions becomes necessary. <i>See Ala. State Fed'n of Labor v. McAdory,</i> 325 U.S. 450, 461, 65 S.Ct. 1384, 89 L.Ed. 1725 (1945) (noting that \"[i]t has long been [the Court's] considered practice not to decide abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions, or to decide any constitutional question in advance of the necessity for its decision\") (citations omitted); <i>El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon,</i> 963 F.2d 488, 494 (1st Cir.1992) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Consideration of the question that the appellants seek to pose &#8212; whether section 2951(2) or some similar restriction is indispensable to Maine's obligation to keep its tuition program in compliance with the Establishment Clause &#8212; is premature at this juncture. Instead, we explore the contours of the right at issue and ascertain what level of scrutiny an Establishment Clause defense would have to survive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Equal Protection.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The heart of the appellants' claim is the proposition that section 2951(2) violates both the equal protection rights of St. Dominic's and the appellants' own equal protection rights (as parents and next friends of their children) because the statute discriminates on the bases of religion and religious speech. Before untangling this argument, we first address the threshold question of standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Standing.</i> We start with the question whether the appellants have standing to raise a constitutional claim on behalf of St. Dominic's. An individual who asserts the constitutional rights of a third party must, of course, satisfy the Article III requirements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability with respect to the third-party claim. <i>See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Sep. of Church &amp; State, Inc.,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982). In addition, that party must satisfy the prerequisites that arise from prudential limitations on the jurisdiction of the federal courts, namely, that the litigant personally has suffered an injury in fact that gives rise to a sufficiently concrete interest in the adjudication of the third party's rights; that the litigant has a close relationship to the third party; and that some hindrance exists that prevents the third party from protecting its own interests. <i>Powers v. Ohio,</i> 499 U.S. 400, 411, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991); <i>Playboy Enters. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 906 F.2d 25, 37 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the appellants contend that section 2951(2) causes them injury in fact because it compels the superintendent to reject all applications for the funding of a high school education at St. Dominic's on the ground that the school is religiously oriented (and, thus, ineligible to receive tuition payments). Therefore, the statute's restriction on the school translates into the parents' inability to gain approval for the public funding of their children's sectarian education. This link between the appellants' interests and those of St. Dominic's may suggest the type of special relationship that would support a departure from the general proscription on jus tertii claims. <i>See, e.g., Craig v. Boren,</i> 429 U.S. 190, 195, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976) (finding vendor satisfied jus tertii requirement to advocate for rights of third-party consumers who may wish to purchase its wares); <i>Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters,</i> 268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (recognizing standing of religious schools to assert the rights of potential pupils who might seek access to their education services).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming for argument's sake, but without deciding, that both an injury and a sufficient relationship exist, the appellants nonetheless stumble on the third step of the jus tertii standing framework: they have wholly failed to show any obstacle preventing St. Dominic's from bringing suit to protect itself against the imagined infringements. The appellants have advanced no credible suggestion either that St. Dominic's is generically unable to assert its rights or that the circumstances of this case create some idiosyncratic barrier to such a suit. Then, too, all of the environmental factors point the other way. For one thing, section 2951(2) does not impose or threaten to impose any criminal or civil penalty for any action that might be taken by sectarian schools. Thus, this case does not fall into the isthmian category of cases in which courts have recognized jus tertii standing because a third party is understandably reluctant to engage in the allegedly protected activity for fear of prosecution or other penalty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (recognizing third-party standing to bring First Amendment overbreadth claims). For another thing, the appellants are not exposed to any criminal or civil penalty because of their interaction with the school; accordingly, cases in which the putative litigant faced such penalties by providing assistance or service to the holder of the third-party right are inapposite. <i>See, e.g., Craig,</i> 429 U.S. at 193-94, 97 S.Ct. 451 (finding third-party standing where litigant, a beer vendor, faced sanctions and loss of license for sales to men between eighteen and twenty years of age). And, finally, this case is not one in which the right-holder has little or no financial incentive to pursue suit or, alternatively, would face great difficulty in demonstrating that the alleged injury was likely to reoccur. <i>See, e.g., Powers,</i> 499 U.S. at 414-15, 111 S.Ct. 1364 (noting that the barriers to suit by a potential juror who believes he has been excluded because of race are \"daunting\" because of the small financial stake involved as well as the difficulty of proving that such discrimination would recur).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that the underlying justifications for the prudential limitation on third-party standing could be thwarted were the appellants allowed to serve as proxy-holders for St. Dominic's. Those justifications include the venerable tenet that \"third parties themselves usually will be the best proponents of their own rights.\" <i>Singleton v. Wulff,</i> 428 U.S. 106, 114, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). They also include the wise counsel that, sometimes, the holder of a right has reasons of its own for not pursuing potential claims. <i>See, e.g., Friedman v. Harold,</i> 638 F.2d 262, 265-66 (1st Cir.1981). An exception to these basic maxims sometimes is warranted because a congruence of interests exists between a litigant and a third party. <i>See Playboy Enters.,</i> 906 F.2d at 38. Here, however, it is by no means apparent that the appellants and St. Dominic's share a common interest; it is entirely possible that the school has refrained from litigation precisely because it is not interested in participating in Maine's tuition program and thereby subjecting itself to any number of concomitant state regulations. <i>Cf., e.g., Am. Library Ass'n v. Odom,</i> 818 F.2d 81, 82 (D.C.Cir.1987) (finding that researchers seeking access to certain library materials could not assert library's property rights); <i>Friedman,</i> 638 F.2d at 266 (finding that bankruptcy trustee was an inappropriate party to assert certain rights of debtor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the appellants lack third-party standing to advance St. Dominic's equal protection claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding does not end our odyssey. Although the appellants lack standing to pursue their jus tertii claim, they do have standing in their own right to seek global relief in the form of an injunction against the enforcement of section 2951(2) and a declaration of the statute's unconstitutionality. The appellants have established standing directly based on their allegation that section 2951(2) effectively deprives them of the opportunity to have their children's tuition at St. Dominic's paid by public funding. Even though it is the educational institution, not the parent, that would receive the tuition payments for a student whose \"educational requirements\" application was approved, it is the parent who must submit such an application and who ultimately will benefit from the approval. Because section 2951(2) imposes restrictions on that approval, the parents' allegation of injury in fact to their interest in securing tuition funding provides a satisfactory predicate for standing. <i>See Bennett v. Spear,</i> 520 U.S. 154, 168-69, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997) (explaining that harm \"produced by determinative or coercive effect\" upon a third party satisfies the injury in fact requirement when the harm is \"fairly traceable\" to that effect).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Merits.</i> We thus proceed to the merits of the appellants' equal protection claim and consider whether recent Supreme Court precedents, especially the Court's opinions in <i>Zelman</i> and <i>Davey,</i> provide a sound basis for overturning <i>Strout.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In undertaking this examination, we review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, considering the record and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the summary judgment losers (here, the appellants). <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990). Our consideration is not inextricably linked to the district court's stare decisis theory; rather, we may affirm the entry of summary judgment on any independent ground fairly presented in the record. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants first contend that section 2951(2) discriminates against them on the basis of religion by forcing them to choose between a publicly funded education and what they describe as \"their fundamental right[ ] of religion.\" Appellants' Br. at 22. They attempt to position this harm under the rubric of equal protection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> avoiding any detailed reference to the Free Exercise Clause even though that clause defines the scope of the fundamental right to religion incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. <i>See Johnson v. Robison,</i> 415 U.S. 361, 375 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This crabbed approach will not wash. In <i>Davey,</i> the Supreme Court clearly rejected this type of effort to erect a separate and distinct framework for analyzing claims of religious discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3 (confirming that the Free Exercise Clause provides the primary framework for assessing religious discrimination claims). Along these lines, the Court held that if a challenged program comports with the Free Exercise Clause, that conclusion wraps up the religious discrimination analysis. <i>See id.</i> Thus, rational basis scrutiny applies to any further equal protection inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See id.; see also Johnson,</i> 415 U.S. at 375 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1160 (explaining that once a law is found to be valid with respect to the free exercise right, there is \"no occasion to apply to the challenged classification a standard of scrutiny stricter than the traditional rational-basis test\" in addressing an equal protection claim). Accordingly, we inquire whether intervening Supreme Court precedent alters the panel's conclusion in <i>Strout</i> that section 2951(2) marks no free exercise violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Strout,</i> the panel held that section 2951(2) imposes no substantial burden on religious beliefs or practices &#8212; and therefore does not implicate the Free Exercise Clause &#8212; because it does not prohibit attendance at a religious school or otherwise prevent parents from choosing religious education for their children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 65. Far from undermining that analysis, <i>Davey</i> reinforces it. Indeed, <i>Davey</i> confirms that the Free Exercise Clause's protection of religious beliefs and practices from direct government encroachment does not translate into an affirmative requirement that public entities fund religious activity simply because they choose to fund the secular equivalents of such activity. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1313. Consequently, the appellants' effort to characterize Maine's decision not to deploy limited tuition dollars toward the funding of religious education as an impermissible burden on their prerogative to send their children to Catholic school is futile. The fact that the state cannot interfere with a parent's fundamental right to choose religious education for his or her child does not mean that the state must fund that choice. <i>Cf. Maher v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464, 475-77, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977) (explaining that the fundamental right to abortion does not entail a companion right to a state-financed abortion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants endeavor to cabin <i>Davey</i> and restrict its teachings to the context of funding instruction for those training to enter religious ministries. Their attempt is unpersuasive. We find no authority that suggests that the \"room for play in the joints\" identified by the <i>Davey</i> Court, 124 S.Ct. at 1311, is applicable to certain education funding decisions but not others. We read <i>Davey</i> more broadly: the decision there recognized that state entities, in choosing how to provide education, may act upon their legitimate concerns about excessive entanglement with religion, even though the Establishment Clause may not require them to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to holding that section 2951(2) imposes no constitutionally impermissible burden on religion, the <i>Strout</i> panel found no indication that substantial animus against religion had motivated the passage of that law. <i>See Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 65. Despite this finding, the appellants, relying on <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993), resurrect the claim that section 2951(2) is presumptively unconstitutional because it lacks religious neutrality on its face. According to this thesis, the fact that the statute expressly excludes sectarian institutions as potential recipients of education funds necessarily indicates an animus against religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision in <i>Lukumi</i> cannot bear the weight that the appellants pile upon it. There, the Court invalidated a local ordinance that made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal slaughter because it found overwhelming evidence that animus against the Santeria religion had motivated the ordinance's passage. <i>See id.</i> at 535, 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217. There is not a shred of evidence that any comparable animus fueled the enactment of the challenged Maine statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Davey</i> Court catalogued the principal factors to be considered in determining whether a particular law is motivated by religious animus. To determine whether any implication that might be drawn from a state's decision not to fund a particular activity constitutes impermissible animus, an inquiring court must examine whether the state action in question imposes any civil or criminal sanction on religious practice, denies participation in the political affairs of the community, or requires individuals to choose between religious beliefs and government benefits. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312-13. To the extent that these factors articulate a test for smoking out an anti-religious animus, the statute here passes that test with flying colors. Maine's decision not to extend tuition funding to religious schools does not threaten any civil or criminal penalty. By the same token, it does not in any way inhibit political participation. Finally, it does not require residents to forgo religious convictions in order to receive the benefit offered by the state &#8212; a secular education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; <i>Davey</i> recognized that states are not required to go to the brink of what the Establishment Clause permits. <i>Id.</i> at 1311-12. As part of its formulation of this doctrine, the <i>Davey</i> Court confirmed the legitimacy of extra-constitutional Establishment Clause concerns. <i>See id.</i> Given these acknowledgments, it would be illogical to impose upon government entities a presumption of hostility whenever they take into account plausible entanglement concerns in making decisions in areas that fall within the figurative space between the Religion Clauses. Just as the <i>Davey</i> Court found that the scholarship program at issue there was not inherently suspect simply because \"there [was] no doubt that the State could, consistent with the Federal Constitution, permit [scholarship recipients] to pursue a degree in devotional theology,\" <i>id.,</i> the mere fact that a hypothetical program in which Maine extended tuition funding to parochial schools might comport with the Establishment Clause would not support a presumption that religious hostility motivated its decision not to adopt such a scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, recent Supreme Court jurisprudence reinforces rather than undermines <i>Strout's</i> conclusion that section 2951(2) perpetrates no free exercise violation. That reinforced conclusion shortens the road that we must travel. Having determined that the appellants' free exercise rights are not implicated by section 2951(2), we have no occasion to ponder whether Maine's Establishment Clause defense constitutes a compelling interest that justifies the challenged restriction. This, in turn, renders it unnecessary to construct and construe a hypothetical tuition plan based on the premise that Maine would repeal section 2951(2) but leave intact all other relevant provisions of the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows inexorably that we must apply rational basis scrutiny to the lines that the Maine statute actually draws. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3. That means that the appellants bear the burden of demonstrating that there exists no fairly conceivable set of facts that could ground a rational relationship between the challenged classification and the government's legitimate goals. <i>Kittery Motorcycle, Inc. v. Rowe,</i> 320 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Montalvo-Huertas, v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 885 F.2d 971, 978-79 (1st Cir.1989). Like any other challenger confronting rational basis review, they must rule out every plausible rationale that might support the law at issue. <i>Heller v. Doe,</i> 509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993); <i>Boivin v. Black,</i> 225 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the best of circumstances, this is a steep uphill climb for a plaintiff. The appellants have declined to engage in it. At oral argument in this court, they conceded that if the rational basis test applies, their equal protection claim fails. This concession is understandable: the legislative history clearly indicates Maine's reasons for excluding religious schools from education plans that extend public funding to private schools for the provision of secular education to Maine students. These reasons include Maine's interests in concentrating limited state funds on its goal of providing secular education, avoiding entanglement, and allaying concerns about accountability that undoubtedly would accompany state oversight of parochial schools' curricula and policies (especially those pertaining to admission, religious tolerance, and participation in religious activities). In all events, we accept the appellants' concession at face value and hold that their equal protection challenge to section 2951(2) fails as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry in addressing appellants' additional contention that section 2951(2) violates the fundamental right to speech because it discriminates on the basis of religious viewpoint. The statute at issue here does not implicate the appellants' speech rights at all. As the Supreme Court made clear in <i>Davey,</i> state programs to fund general tuition costs are not fora for speech. <i>Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3. The Maine education plan deals with the provision of secular secondary educational instruction to its residents; it does not commit to providing any open forum to encourage diverse views from private speakers. Consequently, cases dealing with speech fora &#8212; such as <i>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</i> 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), relied upon by the appellants &#8212; are not relevant. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting the appellees' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Without belaboring the point, we note that the Maine program is substantially narrower than the \"broad[] undertaking by the State to enhance educational options\" that was under scrutiny in<i>Zelman,</i> 536 U.S. at 647, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Moreover, Maine's scheme provides for the approval of applications based on an individualized assessment of educational benefit, whereas the Cleveland program employed only objective criteria of financial need and residency. <i>See id.</i> at 662, 122 S.Ct. 2460.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellants alleged for the first time in their appellate briefs that St. Dominic's faced an obstacle to suit arising out of the risk of \"reprisals\" by the appellees (e.g., the loss of approved status for purposes of Maine's compulsory school laws). This charge, in addition to being belated, is entirely without foundation in the summary judgment record. We therefore reject it out of hand</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In their briefs, the appellants alternately invoke the language of fundamental rights and suspect classifications. We focus here on their claim of religion as a fundamental right. We note, however, the hopelessness of any effort to suggest that those who choose to send their children to religious schools comprise a suspect class. The Supreme Court has taken a very limited approach in recognizing suspect classifications<i>See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison,</i> 415 U.S. 361, 375 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (describing criteria for establishing a suspect classification). The traditional indicia of suspect classification, such as immutable characteristics determined by birth or membership in a group that is politically powerless, are not present in this case. <i>See id.</i> (declining to categorize group of religious conscientious objectors as a suspect class); <i>see also Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos,</i> 483 U.S. 327, 338-39, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987) (explaining that although laws that draw distinctions among religions can give rise to a suspect classification triggering strict scrutiny, provisions that distinguish generally between secular and religious entities engender rational basis scrutiny).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The majority in<i>Strout</i> found it unnecessary to articulate the particular level of scrutiny it employed in rejecting the equal protection challenge. <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 64. To the extent the panel may have suggested that a religious discrimination claim might be twice subjected to an analysis aimed at determining the level of scrutiny to be applied &#8212; once under the Free Exercise Clause and again as a freestanding claim under the Equal Protection Clause &#8212; that implication must be abandoned. <i>Davey</i> unequivocally rejected such an approach on the ground that the free exercise analysis definitively answers the question whether the challenged state action impermissibly infringes upon the fundamental right to religion. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3. Thus, an equal protection claim that challenges a law found not to violate the Free Exercise Clause gives rise only to rational basis review. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We add that the statute does not exclude residents of Minot from participation in the tuition program on the basis of religion; all school-aged residents are equally eligible to apply for the benefit that the program extends &#8212; a free secular education. Any shift in the decisional calculus for parents who must decide whether to take advantage of that benefit or pay to send their children to a school that provides a religious education is a burden of the sort permitted in<i>Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1315.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We hold that the Equal Protection Clause does not impose any such obligation. Accordingly, although our reasoning differs from that of the district court, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By statute, Maine commits to providing all school-aged persons with \"an opportunity to receive the benefits of a free public education,\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, &#167; 2(1) (West 2004), and vests authority in local school districts to fulfill that undertaking by maintaining and supporting elementary and secondary education, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2(2), 4501. School districts, known in Maine's bureaucratic argot as school administrative units, enjoy some flexibility in administering this guarantee. They may satisfy the state mandate in any of three ways: by operating their own public schools, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1258(1), by contracting with outside public schools to accept their students, <i>see id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1258(2), 2701; or by paying private schools to provide such an education, <i>see id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2951, 5204(4). State law bars a school district that exercises the third option from paying tuition to any private sectarian school. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2951(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The town of Minot comprises a school administrative unit. It has decided to operate its own grade school (kindergarten through eighth grade), but has chosen to outsource secondary education. To this end, Minot has contracted with a neighboring school district &#8212; the town of Poland &#8212; to educate at least 90% of its eligible students at Poland Regional High School (PRHS). The contract gives Minot the right to send up to 10% of its high schoolers to other approved nonsectarian secondary schools (private or public) so long as those students can demonstrate that they have educational needs that PRHS cannot satisfy. The superintendent of School Union # 29, which consists of the school administrative units of Poland, Mechanic Falls, and Minot, reviews applications for such alternative placements on a case-by-case basis. By operation of section 2951(2), however, sectarian schools cannot win approval for publicly funded tuition payments (and, thus, Minot cannot underwrite tuition for youths seeking to attend such schools).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John and Belinda Eulitt and Kelly J. MacKinnon are parents residing in Minot who, on their own dime, send their daughters to St. Dominic's Regional High School, a Catholic secondary school that is indisputably sectarian. They believe that, under Minot's education plan, the state and the town should pay tuition directly to St. Dominic's on behalf of their daughters because PRHS does not offer classes in Catholic doctrine or teach from a Catholic viewpoint (and, therefore, does not meet the full range of their daughters' educational needs). The parents have not submitted formal applications for such funding because section 2951(2), which forbids the payment of public dollars to sectarian schools, would prevent the superintendent from approving any such applications. Instead, as parents and next friends of their daughters, they brought suit in Maine's federal district court against various state educational authorities. Pertinently, their complaint alleged that section 2951(2)'s restriction on the approval of sectarian schools for placements funded by public tuition payments violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because that restriction discriminates on the bases of religion, religious speech, and viewpoint. Additionally, the complaint asserted a separate equal protection claim on behalf of St. Dominic's, in which the parents argued that section 2951(2) strips the school of equal protection of the laws because it denies the school the ability to receive public funds for providing secondary education services even though it allows private nonsectarian schools to receive such stipends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge who recommended, inter alia, that summary judgment be granted in favor of the defendants on the equal protection claims. <i>Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> No. 02-162, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21909790</span></span>, at *4 (D.Me. Aug.8, 2003). The magistrate judge ruled that the Equal Protection Clause does not compel the provision of public funds to private sectarian schools, even when a school district has chosen to subsidize the payment of tuition to private nonsectarian schools on a limited basis. <i>Id.</i> at *3-4. On objection, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1); Fed. R.Civ.P. 72(b), the district court concurred with the magistrate judge's recommended decision, but it did so solely on the ground that this court's decision in <i>Strout v. Albanese,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764364\"><a href=\"/opinion/764364/no-98-1986/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999), had \"authoritatively answered exactly the same questions Plaintiffs now urge this Court to decide,\" and, therefore, pretermitted further inquiry under the doctrine of stare decisis. <i>Eulitt v.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants hawk three propositions on appeal. First, they urge that the doctrine of stare decisis does not foreclose consideration of their substantive claims. Second, they contend that the Establishment Clause does not compel Maine to eschew public funding of sectarian education (and, hence, does not prevent the state from providing the redress that they seek). Third, they asseverate that section 2951(2) violates the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates on the bases of religion, religious speech, and viewpoint. We consider these propositions sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Stare Decisis.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, the doctrine of stare decisis precludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously been heard and authoritatively determined. <i>Stewart v.

In other words, stare decisis \"renders the ruling of <i>law</i> in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision.\" <i>Gately v.

There, we upheld the constitutionality of section 2951(2) against equal protection, establishment, and free exercise challenges brought by parents (not the present plaintiffs) who sought public funding for their children's matriculation at St. Dominic's. <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 64-65. The <i>Strout</i> panel rejected the equal protection challenge because Maine had shown a compelling interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation through the exclusion of sectarian schools from its secondary education tuition program. <i>Id.</i> at 64. Two members of the panel further speculated, in dictum, that if Maine's proffered interest had been found to depend upon an erroneous understanding of the Establishment Clause (that is, if it had been determined that payments to sectarian schools were permissible under that clause), then the state's exclusion of sectarian schools from the tuition program would not withstand scrutiny. <i>Id.</i> at 64 n. 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three years later, the Supreme Court decided <i>Zelman v.

The <i>Zelman</i> Court announced that indirect public aid to sectarian education is constitutionally permissible when the financial assistance program has a valid secular purpose, provides benefits to a broad spectrum of individuals who can exercise genuine private choice among religious and secular options, and is neutral toward religion. <i>Id.</i> at 662-63., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121168\"><a href=\"/opinion/121168/zelman-v-simmons-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

By this, the <i>Davey</i> Court meant that \"there are some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Zelman</i> opinion raises the distinct possibility that <i>Strout's</i> view of Maine's asserted interest depended upon an incorrect interpretation of the Establishment Clause's strictures. <i>Davey</i> also casts doubt on the reasoning of <i>Strout</i> because it clarifies, and subtly alters, the decisional framework to be applied to equal protection claims that are rooted in allegations of religious discrimination. The district court nevertheless declined to consider the effects of <i>Zelman</i> and <i>Davey</i> on the continuing vitality of <i>Strout.</i> We do not find fault with that cautious approach. <i>See Crowe v.

Until a court of appeals revokes a binding precedent, a district court within the circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent unless it has unmistakably been cast into disrepute by supervening authority. <i>See Sarzen v.

Even though \"our precedent-based system of justice places a premium on finality, stability, and certainty in the law,\" <i>Stewart,</i> 230 F.3d at 467, \"<i>stare decisis</i> is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule,\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v.

Thus, a panel of the court of appeals has some flexibility, modest though it may be, with respect to its own precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit should consider themselves bound by prior panel decisions. <i>See United States v.

This rule is a specialized application of the stare decisis principle. It is, however, subject to at least two exceptions, either of which may warrant a departure from a prior holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first exception comes into play when a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court, a decision of the en banc court, or a statutory overruling. <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir. 1995). That exception does not apply here. Although <i>Zelman</i> did confirm that the state may provide funding for sectarian education in certain instances, <i>see Zelman,</i> 536 U.S. at 662-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121168\"><a href=\"/opinion/121168/zelman-v-simmons-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2460</span></a></span>. Even after <i>Zelman</i> and <i>Davey,</i> it is fairly debatable whether or not the Maine tuition program could survive an Establishment Clause challenge if the state eliminated section 2951(2) and allowed sectarian schools to receive tuition funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Thus, the newly emergent Supreme Court case law does not necessarily undercut the <i>Strout</i> panel's premise, 178 F.3d at 64 &amp; n. 12, that Maine could not extend funding to sectarian schools under its program without violating the Establishment Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second exception exists when recent Supreme Court precedent calls into legitimate question a prior opinion of an inferior court. <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 141; <i>see also Crowe,</i> 365 F.3d at 89, 92. In that context, a reviewing court must pause to consider the likely significance of the neoteric Supreme Court case law before automatically ceding the field to an earlier decision. <i>See Williams,</i> 45 F.3d at 592 (explaining that stare decisis may yield in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this exception applies here. In <i>Strout,</i> the panel explicitly relied on \"the present state of jurisprudence\" in determining that Maine's interest in excluding sectarian schools from its tuition program would survive any level of scrutiny because the Establishment Clause likely required the state to maintain such an exclusion. <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 64. In reaching this conclusion, the panel candidly observed that \"the guidance provided by the Supreme Court has been less than crystalline.\" <i>Id. Zelman</i> and <i>Davey</i> obviously constitute significant developments in the pertinent jurisprudence and shed new light on the case law upon which the <i>Strout</i> decision hinged. If these decisions, collectively, do not make the law crystalline, they at least provide more focused direction than was available to the <i>Strout</i> panel. Consequently, we find it incumbent upon us to reject a rote application of stare decisis here and to undertake a fresh analysis. <i>See Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v.

An individual who asserts the constitutional rights of a third party must, of course, satisfy the Article III requirements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability with respect to the third-party claim. <i>See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Sep. of Church &amp; State, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 472, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, the statute's restriction on the school translates into the parents' inability to gain approval for the public funding of their children's sectarian education. This link between the appellants' interests and those of St. Dominic's may suggest the type of special relationship that would support a departure from the general proscription on jus tertii claims. <i>See, e.g., Craig v.

The appellants have advanced no credible suggestion either that St. Dominic's is generically unable to assert its rights or that the circumstances of this case create some idiosyncratic barrier to such a suit. Then, too, all of the environmental factors point the other way. For one thing, section 2951(2) does not impose or threaten to impose any criminal or civil penalty for any action that might be taken by sectarian schools. Thus, this case does not fall into the isthmian category of cases in which courts have recognized jus tertii standing because a third party is understandably reluctant to engage in the allegedly protected activity for fear of prosecution or other penalty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Broadrick v.

For another thing, the appellants are not exposed to any criminal or civil penalty because of their interaction with the school; accordingly, cases in which the putative litigant faced such penalties by providing assistance or service to the holder of the third-party right are inapposite. <i>See, e.g., Craig,</i> 429 U.S. at 193-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109570\"><a href=\"/opinion/109570/craig-v-boren/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An exception to these basic maxims sometimes is warranted because a congruence of interests exists between a litigant and a third party. <i>See Playboy Enters.,</i> 906 F.2d at 38. Here, however, it is by no means apparent that the appellants and St. Dominic's share a common interest; it is entirely possible that the school has refrained from litigation precisely because it is not interested in participating in Maine's tuition program and thereby subjecting itself to any number of concomitant state regulations. <i>Cf., e.g., Am.

Although the appellants lack standing to pursue their jus tertii claim, they do have standing in their own right to seek global relief in the form of an injunction against the enforcement of section 2951(2) and a declaration of the statute's unconstitutionality. The appellants have established standing directly based on their allegation that section 2951(2) effectively deprives them of the opportunity to have their children's tuition at St. Dominic's paid by public funding. Even though it is the educational institution, not the parent, that would receive the tuition payments for a student whose \"educational requirements\" application was approved, it is the parent who must submit such an application and who ultimately will benefit from the approval. Because section 2951(2) imposes restrictions on that approval, the parents' allegation of injury in fact to their interest in securing tuition funding provides a satisfactory predicate for standing. <i>See Bennett v.

In <i>Davey,</i> the Supreme Court clearly rejected this type of effort to erect a separate and distinct framework for analyzing claims of religious discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3 (confirming that the Free Exercise Clause provides the primary framework for assessing religious discrimination claims). Along these lines, the Court held that if a challenged program comports with the Free Exercise Clause, that conclusion wraps up the religious discrimination analysis. <i>See id.</i> Thus, rational basis scrutiny applies to any further equal protection inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See id.; see also Johnson,</i> 415 U.S. at 375 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, we inquire whether intervening Supreme Court precedent alters the panel's conclusion in <i>Strout</i> that section 2951(2) marks no free exercise violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Strout,</i> the panel held that section 2951(2) imposes no substantial burden on religious beliefs or practices &#8212; and therefore does not implicate the Free Exercise Clause &#8212; because it does not prohibit attendance at a religious school or otherwise prevent parents from choosing religious education for their children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 65. Far from undermining that analysis, <i>Davey</i> reinforces it. Indeed, <i>Davey</i> confirms that the Free Exercise Clause's protection of religious beliefs and practices from direct government encroachment does not translate into an affirmative requirement that public entities fund religious activity simply because they choose to fund the secular equivalents of such activity. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1313. Consequently, the appellants' effort to characterize Maine's decision not to deploy limited tuition dollars toward the funding of religious education as an impermissible burden on their prerogative to send their children to Catholic school is futile. The fact that the state cannot interfere with a parent's fundamental right to choose religious education for his or her child does not mean that the state must fund that choice. <i>Cf. Maher v.

Their attempt is unpersuasive. We find no authority that suggests that the \"room for play in the joints\" identified by the <i>Davey</i> Court, 124 S.Ct. at 1311, is applicable to certain education funding decisions but not others. We read <i>Davey</i> more broadly: the decision there recognized that state entities, in choosing how to provide education, may act upon their legitimate concerns about excessive entanglement with religion, even though the Establishment Clause may not require them to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to holding that section 2951(2) imposes no constitutionally impermissible burden on religion, the <i>Strout</i> panel found no indication that substantial animus against religion had motivated the passage of that law. <i>See Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 65.

According to this thesis, the fact that the statute expressly excludes sectarian institutions as potential recipients of education funds necessarily indicates an animus against religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision in <i>Lukumi</i> cannot bear the weight that the appellants pile upon it. There, the Court invalidated a local ordinance that made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal slaughter because it found overwhelming evidence that animus against the Santeria religion had motivated the ordinance's passage. <i>See id.</i> at 535, 546, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To determine whether any implication that might be drawn from a state's decision not to fund a particular activity constitutes impermissible animus, an inquiring court must examine whether the state action in question imposes any civil or criminal sanction on religious practice, denies participation in the political affairs of the community, or requires individuals to choose between religious beliefs and government benefits. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312-13. To the extent that these factors articulate a test for smoking out an anti-religious animus, the statute here passes that test with flying colors. Maine's decision not to extend tuition funding to religious schools does not threaten any civil or criminal penalty. By the same token, it does not in any way inhibit political participation. Finally, it does not require residents to forgo religious convictions in order to receive the benefit offered by the state &#8212; a secular education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; <i>Davey</i> recognized that states are not required to go to the brink of what the Establishment Clause permits. <i>Id.</i> at 1311-12. As part of its formulation of this doctrine, the <i>Davey</i> Court confirmed the legitimacy of extra-constitutional Establishment Clause concerns. <i>See id.</i> Given these acknowledgments, it would be illogical to impose upon government entities a presumption of hostility whenever they take into account plausible entanglement concerns in making decisions in areas that fall within the figurative space between the Religion Clauses. Just as the <i>Davey</i> Court found that the scholarship program at issue there was not inherently suspect simply because \"there [was] no doubt that the State could, consistent with the Federal Constitution, permit [scholarship recipients] to pursue a degree in devotional theology,\" <i>id.,</i> the mere fact that a hypothetical program in which Maine extended tuition funding to parochial schools might comport with the Establishment Clause would not support a presumption that religious hostility motivated its decision not to adopt such a scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, recent Supreme Court jurisprudence reinforces rather than undermines <i>Strout's</i> conclusion that section 2951(2) perpetrates no free exercise violation. That reinforced conclusion shortens the road that we must travel. Having determined that the appellants' free exercise rights are not implicated by section 2951(2), we have no occasion to ponder whether Maine's Establishment Clause defense constitutes a compelling interest that justifies the challenged restriction. This, in turn, renders it unnecessary to construct and construe a hypothetical tuition plan based on the premise that Maine would repeal section 2951(2) but leave intact all other relevant provisions of the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows inexorably that we must apply rational basis scrutiny to the lines that the Maine statute actually draws. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3.

The appellants have declined to engage in it. At oral argument in this court, they conceded that if the rational basis test applies, their equal protection claim fails. This concession is understandable: the legislative history clearly indicates Maine's reasons for excluding religious schools from education plans that extend public funding to private schools for the provision of secular education to Maine students. These reasons include Maine's interests in concentrating limited state funds on its goal of providing secular education, avoiding entanglement, and allaying concerns about accountability that undoubtedly would accompany state oversight of parochial schools' curricula and policies (especially those pertaining to admission, religious tolerance, and participation in religious activities). In all events, we accept the appellants' concession at face value and hold that their equal protection challenge to section 2951(2) fails as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry in addressing appellants' additional contention that section 2951(2) violates the fundamental right to speech because it discriminates on the basis of religious viewpoint. The statute at issue here does not implicate the appellants' speech rights at all. As the Supreme Court made clear in <i>Davey,</i> state programs to fund general tuition costs are not fora for speech. <i>Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3. The Maine education plan deals with the provision of secular secondary educational instruction to its residents; it does not commit to providing any open forum to encourage diverse views from private speakers. Consequently, cases dealing with speech fora &#8212; such as <i>Rosenberger v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2460</span></a></span>. Moreover, Maine's scheme provides for the approval of applications based on an individualized assessment of educational benefit, whereas the Cleveland program employed only objective criteria of financial need and residency. <i>See id.</i> at 662, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121168\"><a href=\"/opinion/121168/zelman-v-simmons-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This charge, in addition to being belated, is entirely without foundation in the summary judgment record. We therefore reject it out of hand</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In their briefs, the appellants alternately invoke the language of fundamental rights and suspect classifications. We focus here on their claim of religion as a fundamental right. We note, however, the hopelessness of any effort to suggest that those who choose to send their children to religious schools comprise a suspect class. The Supreme Court has taken a very limited approach in recognizing suspect classifications<i>See, e.g., Johnson v. Robison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 375 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span> (1974) (describing criteria for establishing a suspect classification). The traditional indicia of suspect classification, such as immutable characteristics determined by birth or membership in a group that is politically powerless, are not present in this case. <i>See id.</i> (declining to categorize group of religious conscientious objectors as a suspect class); <i>see also Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 338-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111944\"><a href=\"/opinion/111944/corporation-of-presiding-bishop-of-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To the extent the panel may have suggested that a religious discrimination claim might be twice subjected to an analysis aimed at determining the level of scrutiny to be applied &#8212; once under the Free Exercise Clause and again as a freestanding claim under the Equal Protection Clause &#8212; that implication must be abandoned. <i>Davey</i> unequivocally rejected such an approach on the ground that the free exercise analysis definitively answers the question whether the challenged state action impermissibly infringes upon the fundamental right to religion. <i>See Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1312 n. 3. Thus, an equal protection claim that challenges a law found not to violate the Free Exercise Clause gives rise only to rational basis review. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We add that the statute does not exclude residents of Minot from participation in the tuition program on the basis of religion; all school-aged residents are equally eligible to apply for the benefit that the program extends &#8212; a free secular education. Any shift in the decisional calculus for parents who must decide whether to take advantage of that benefit or pay to send their children to a school that provides a religious education is a burden of the sort permitted in<i>Davey,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1315.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
