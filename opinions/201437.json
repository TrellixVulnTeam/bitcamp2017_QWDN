Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                        Howard, Circuit Judge,\n                  and Carter,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rafael A. Oliveras Lopez De Victoria on brief for appellants.\n     Carlos Concepción-Castro with whom Agustín Collazo Law Offices\nwas on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                           February 8, 2005\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge. Appellants Jennie Torres-Fuentes\n\nand her minor children brought this action under the Magnuson-Moss\n\nWarranty   Act   (\"Act\"),   15   U.S.C.    §   2301   et.    seq.,   against\n\nMotorambar, Inc. and a host of other defendants claiming that the\n\nKIA automobile that she purchased had severe mechanical defects.1\n\nTorres-Fuentes sought restitution of the purchase price of the car\n\n(plus financing costs) in the amount of $21,967.00, expenses of\n\n$1,400.00, and compensation for mental and moral anguish totaling\n\n$130,000.00.\n\n           Motorambar2 filed a motion to dismiss, which Torres-\n\nFuentes did not oppose, on the ground that the complaint, on its\n\nface, failed to meet the Act's jurisdictional requirement that the\n\namount in controversy equal or exceed $50,000.              See 15 U.S.C. §\n\n2310(d)(3)(B).    In support of this argument, Motorambar asserted\n\nthat damages for mental and moral anguish were not available under\n\nPuerto Rico law (the Act looks to state law to determine available\n\ndamages) on the facts alleged.           The district court agreed and\n\ndismissed the case with prejudice.        Torres-Fuentes never asked the\n\ndistrict court to vacate or set aside the judgment.            Instead, she\n\n\n\n     1\n       Torres-Fuentes also invoked \"pendent jurisdiction\" under the\nCivil Code of Puerto Rico in the complaint, but identified no\nparticular provisions of Puerto Rico law under which she was suing.\nThe district court construed the complaint as seeking recovery only\nunder the Act, and we follow its lead.\n     2\n      Torres-Fuentes failed to serve the other defendants, and the\nclaims against them were dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fbrought this appeal to argue that mental and moral anguish damages\n\nare available under Puerto Rico law if, as she argues here, the\n\nseller knew of the product's defective condition at the time of\n\nsale.    Alternatively, she argues that the dismissal should have\n\nbeen without prejudice.\n\n           Torres-Fuentes's   first    argument   is   forfeited.    We\n\nrecently held that \"a party who fails to object to a motion to\n\ndismiss must raise any claims of error by filing the appropriate\n\npost-judgment motion, or forfeit his or her right to raise those\n\nclaims before this court.\"    Pomerleau v. W. Springfield Pub. Sch.,\n\n362 F.3d 143, 146-47 (1st Cir. 2004).       \"To hold otherwise would\n\nundermine the ability of the district courts to serve as an\n\neffective and efficient forum for the resolution of disputes.\" Id.\n\nat 147.3      As set forth above, Torres-Fuentes filed neither a\n\nresponse to the motion to dismiss nor an appropriate motion to\n\nobtain reconsideration after judgment entered.         Accordingly, her\n\narguments regarding the appropriateness of the dismissal are not\n\npreserved.4\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      While Pomerleau dealt with a motion to dismiss under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6), we see no reason why the rule should not apply\nhere as well, as Motorambar's motion was solely directed to the\nallegations of the complaint.\n     4\n       Nor is this a case in which we would sua sponte recognize\nplain error –- regardless of whether Torres-Fuentes' view of Puerto\nRico law is correct.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           Torres-Fuentes's challenge to the form of the judgment is\n\na different story.      Dismissals for lack of jurisdiction should\n\ngenerally be without prejudice.            See, e.g., Mills v. Harmon Law\n\nOffices, 344 F.3d 42, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2003)(lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction precludes district court from disposing of the case on\n\nthe merits).     Indeed, in a case involving similar facts, the\n\nEleventh Circuit held that the plaintiff should not be barred from\n\nraising the identical claims in state court under the Act after a\n\ndismissal for failure to satisfy the $50,000 jurisdictional hurdle.\n\nSee Ansari v. Bella Auto. Group, Inc., 145 F.3d 1270, 1272 (11th\n\nCir. 1998).      See   also   15   U.S.C.    §   2310(d)(1)(A)(the    $50,000\n\njurisdictional   requirement       only    applies   to   claims   brought   in\n\nfederal court; litigants may still raise smaller claims in state\n\ncourt).   The judgment is modified to provide that the dismissal is\n\nwithout prejudice and is otherwise affirmed.5\n\n\n\n\n     5\n        At argument, Torres-Fuentes asked that we ignore the\njurisdictional limitations in the Act in the name of equity, as\nmost people who purchase automobiles would be barred from bringing\nclaims under the Act by the $50,000 jurisdictional threshold. As\nthis issue was not raised until argument, it is forfeited. See\nUnited States v. Sacko, 247 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2001). In any\nevent, as noted above, claims for less than $50,000 may be brought\nunder the Act in state court.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
