Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           STAHL, Circuit Judge.         Jason J. Robidoux sued James\n\nCorporation d/b/a James Construction (\"James Construction\") and\n\nMichael A. Muholland, Jr. (collectively \"defendants\") for personal\n\ninjuries Robidoux suffered while working at a construction site.\n\nThe district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment, finding that the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Act\n\n(\"Rhode Island Act\") applied to the action and barred the claims.\n\nBecause we conclude that the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation\n\nAct (\"Massachusetts Act\") applies to this suit and does not bar\n\nRobidoux's claims, we reverse and remand.\n\n                        I.   Facts & Background\n\n           Most of the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed.\n\nIn May 2006, James Construction, a general contractor incorporated\n\nand based in Pennsylvania, was working on a project at the Newport\n\nNaval Station in Rhode Island.      In search of temporary laborers,\n\nJames   Construction   contacted   a     temporary   employment   agency,\n\nNortheast Temps, Inc. d/b/a Labor Systems (\"Labor Systems\"), which\n\nis a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business\n\nin Massachusetts. It does also maintain an office in Rhode Island.\n\nIn   response   to   James   Construction's    request,   Labor   Systems\n\ndispatched Robidoux, a Massachusetts resident and newly-minted\n\nLabor Systems employee, from its Fall River, Massachusetts office\n\nto the Rhode Island job site.      While working at the Newport Naval\n\nStation, Robidoux was supervised by Muholland, a James Construction\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\femployee who was neither a Massachusetts resident nor a Rhode\n\nIsland   resident.         During    Robidoux's       work      on   the   project,    he\n\ndiscussed his Massachusetts residency with Muholland.                           At the\n\nconclusion of Robidoux's assignment, Muholland signed a work order\n\nthat displayed Labor Systems' two Massachusetts locations and their\n\ncorresponding 508 area code telephone numbers.\n\n            Almost six months later, on November 15, 2006, James\n\nConstruction again contacted Labor Systems, at one of the 508 area\n\ncode telephone numbers, to specifically request Robidoux's services\n\nfor a different project at the Newport Naval Station.                         The next\n\nday, Robidoux picked up a work order and his personal protective\n\nequipment at Labor Systems' Fall River office before traveling on\n\nto Rhode Island.\n\n            Robidoux's second stint working at the Newport Naval\n\nStation lasted approximately six weeks.                  During the course of this\n\nwork, Robidoux received his paychecks, with Rhode Island tax\n\nwithholdings, from Labor Systems.             For Robidoux's services,           James\n\nConstruction remitted payments to an Ohio address provided by Labor\n\nSystems.     Pursuant to a contract between James Construction and\n\nLabor    Systems,   James     Construction          assumed      responsibility       for\n\nsupervising    Robidoux      while    he    was     at    the    construction    site.\n\nMuholland,    who    was    serving    as     the    project's        superintendent,\n\nprovided this supervision.            Additionally, the contract required\n\nLabor Systems to provide workers' compensation insurance for the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\femployees it provided to James Construction.               At the time Labor\n\nSystems and James Construction agreed to the contract, Labor System\n\nalready had workers' compensation insurance policies from Liberty\n\nMutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\") for Massachusetts and\n\nfrom Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (\"Beacon Mutual\") for Rhode\n\nIsland.      James Construction also required Labor Systems to provide\n\na certificate of its Rhode Island workers' compensation insurance.1\n\n              On January 4, 2007, while working with Muholland at the\n\nNewport Naval Station site, Robidoux was seriously injured when a\n\n648 pound compactor fell on him. That same day, without Robidoux's\n\nknowledge, Labor Systems filed a report of injury so that Robidoux\n\ncould       collect   Rhode   Island     workers'    compensation      benefits.\n\nConsequently, Robidoux began receiving $629.27 a week from Beacon\n\nMutual.       These payments lasted for almost seventeen weeks and\n\ntotaled $10,248.15.\n\n              On   February   20,    2007,     Robidoux   filed    a   claim   for\n\nMassachusetts workers' compensation benefits with Liberty Mutual.\n\nAn   administrative      judge      in   the   Massachusetts      Department   of\n\nIndustrial Accidents concluded that Robidoux was entitled to these\n\nbenefits, and ordered Liberty Mutual to take credit for the monies\n\n\n        1\n      Robidoux, noting that this certificate was not received until\nthe day he was injured, asserts that James Construction did not\nactually require Labor Systems to provide this proof of insurance\nprior to his injury.      Moreover, Robidoux suggests that James\nConstruction only required Labor Systems to provide this\ncertificate because, in addition to Robidoux, Labor Systems also\ndispatched a Rhode Island resident to work for James Construction.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fpaid    by   Beacon     Mutual   and   assume   responsibility     for   future\n\nbenefits.\n\n             On January 9, 2009, Robidoux filed a diversity action in\n\nthe    District    of   Massachusetts    alleging    that   the    injuries   he\n\nsuffered at the construction site were caused by the defendants'\n\nnegligence.       On July 29, 2010, the district court allowed the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment.             Robidoux v. Muholland,\n\n733 F. Supp. 2d 198 (D. Mass. 2010).                Employing Massachusetts\n\nchoice of law principles, the district court determined that \"Rhode\n\nIsland [as opposed to Massachusetts] has a substantially more\n\nsignificant relationship to this litigation and, therefore, this\n\ncourt must apply Rhode Island law.\"           Id. at 203.   The court went on\n\nto conclude that, except in circumstances not present in the case\n\nat hand, the Rhode Island Act grants \"special employers,\" such as\n\nJames   Construction,      \"immunity     from   private   action    by   injured\n\nemployees.\"       Id.    Similarly, the court concluded that the Rhode\n\nIsland Act prohibits a plaintiff from suing co-employees such as\n\nMuholland.     Id. at 204.       Robidoux subsequently appealed.\n\n                                 II.   Discussion\n\n             \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"       Cortés-Rivera v. Dep't of Corr. and Rehab. of\n\nthe Commonwealth of P.R., 626 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2010).                 This\n\ncourt reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.            Id.    Choice of\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\flaw determinations are questions of law, which we also review de\n\nnovo.    See Crellin Tech., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 1994). Both parties agree that Massachusetts choice of\n\nlaw principles govern this case.\n\nA.           A Conflict Exists Between the Relevant Massachusetts and\n             Rhode Island Law\n\n             \"[T]he usual first step in applying conflict of law\n\nprinciples is to ascertain whether there is a conflict among the\n\nlaws of the various States involved.\"                      Cohen v. McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp., 450 N.E.2d 581, 584 n.7 (Mass. 1983).\n\n             The        Rhode   Island        Act        provides     that,       except      in\n\ncircumstances       not     alleged      in    this        appeal,    \"[t]he       right      to\n\ncompensation . . . and the remedy for an injury granted by [the\n\nRhode Island Act], shall be in lieu of all rights and remedies as\n\nto    that    injury      now   existing        .    .     .     against     an    employer,\n\nor its . . . employees.\"                  R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-20.                          The\n\ndefendants assert, as the district court concluded, that this\n\n\"employer\" immunity extends to \"special employers\" — that is,\n\n\"person[s] who contract[] for services with a general employer for\n\nthe   use    of    an    employee,\"      id.    §    28-29-2(6)(ii)           —   and    their\n\nemployees.        See Sorenson v. Colibri Corp., 650 A.2d 125 (R.I.\n\n1994).      Accordingly, the defendants contend, the Rhode Island Act\n\nbars Robidoux's claims against James Construction, the special\n\nemployer, and its employee, Muholland.                         On appeal, Robidoux does\n\nnot   dispute      this    interpretation           of    Rhode     Island    law,      and    we\n\n                                              -6-\n\ftherefore assume that the Rhode Island Act, if applicable, would\n\nbar this action.\n\n            The question therefore becomes whether the Massachusetts\n\nAct would similarly bar Robidoux's claims against the defendants.2\n\nWe conclude that it would not.\n\n            Generally, \"the [Massachusetts Act] bars employees from\n\nrecovering against their employers for injuries received on the\n\njob.\" Barrett v. Rodgers, 562 N.E.2d 480, 482 (Mass. 1990) (citing\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, §§ 23, 24).3   An injured employee retains\n\n\n     2\n      Although the district court did not address this issue, we\nare free to resolve questions of law in the first instance. See\nGately v. Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1228 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993).\n     3\n      Section 24 provides in part: \"An employee shall be held to\nhave waived his right of action at common law or under the law of\nany other jurisdiction in respect to an injury that is compensable\nunder this chapter, to recover damages for personal injuries, if he\nshall not have given his employer . . . written notice that he\nclaimed such right . . . .\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 24.\n\n     Section 23 reads:\n\n            If an employee files any claim or accepts\n            payment of compensation on account of personal\n            injury under this chapter, or submits to a\n            proceeding   before   the   department   under\n            sections ten to twelve, inclusive, such action\n            shall constitute a release to the insurer of\n            all claims or demands at common law, if any,\n            arising from the injury. If an employee\n            accepts payment of compensation under this\n            chapter on account of personal injury or makes\n            an agreement under section forty-eight, such\n            action shall constitute a release to the\n            insured of all claims or demands at common\n            law, if any, arising from the injury.\n\nId. § 23.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe right, however, \"to bring suit against third parties who may be\n\nliable for injuries compensable under the [Massachusetts] Act.\"\n\nId. (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 15).         More specifically,\n\n\"nothing   in   [section   fifteen],   or   in   section   eighteen   or\n\ntwenty-four shall be construed to bar an action at law . . .\n\nagainst any person other than the insured person employing such\n\nemployee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by\n\nthis chapter . . . and said insured person's employees.\"          Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 152, § 15 (emphasis added); cf. Searcy v. Paul, 478\n\nN.E.2d 1275, 1278 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985) (\"[T]he [above-quoted\n\nstatutory language] was taken by text and periodical writers as\n\nbroadly abolishing the so-called 'common employment' doctrine and\n\npermitting third party actions by . . . an injured employee against\n\nall but his immediate insured employer.\").\n\n           In short, for an employer to be immunized pursuant to the\n\nMassachusetts Act \"(1) a 'direct employment relationship must\n\nexist' between the injured party and the person claiming immunity,\n\nand (2) 'the employer must be an insured person liable for the\n\npayment of compensation.'\"    Roberts v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 599\n\nF.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting Fleming v. Shaheen Bros.,\n\nInc., 881 N.E.2d 1143, 1146 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008)).\n\n           Turning to the second prong of this test, an \"insured\n\nperson\" is \"an employer who has provided by insurance for the\n\npayment to his employees by an insurer of the compensation provided\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\ffor by this chapter, or is a self-insurer . . . or is a member of\n\nworkers' compensation self-insurance group.\"          Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n152, § 1(6).     Further, Massachusetts law requires that, absent an\n\nagreement to the contrary, in circumstances involving a special\n\nemployer and a general employer, \"the liability for the payment of\n\ncompensation for the injury shall be borne by the general employer\n\nor its insurer.\"     Id. § 18 (emphasis added).\n\n           James Construction is not an \"insured person liable for\n\nthe payment of [workers'] compensation.\" To the contrary, pursuant\n\nto the express terms of their agreement, Labor Systems assumed\n\nresponsibility     for   providing   Robidoux's    workers'   compensation\n\ninsurance.     Although James Construction may have paid a rate that\n\neffectively reimbursed Labor Systems for that insurance, James\n\nConstruction does not point to any authority suggesting that such\n\nan   arrangement   equates    to   \"provid[ing]\"   workers'   compensation\n\ninsurance and being \"liable for payment of workers' compensation.\"\n\nCf. Numberg v. GTE Transp., Inc., 607 N.E.2d 1, 2 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1993) (finding that special employer was not an insured person\n\nliable   for   payment   of   workers'     compensation,   even   though   it\n\nreimbursed general employer for the cost of workers' compensation\n\nbenefits, because there was no agreement that special employer\n\nwould provide those benefits).           Consequently, Robidoux's claims\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fagainst James Construction are not barred by the Massachusetts\n\nAct.4\n\n            Nor would the Massachusetts Act immunize Muholland, as a\n\n\"co-employee,\" from this action.      The defendants do not point to\n\nany case law suggesting that co-employee immunity exists beyond\n\nthat which is derived from an employer's immunity.      See Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 152, §      15 (\"Nothing in this section, or in section\n\neighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action . . .\n\nagainst any person other than the insured person employing such\n\nemployee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by\n\nthis chapter . . . and said insured person's employees.\" (emphasis\n\nadded)); Fredette v. Simpson, 797 N.E.2d 899, 901-02 (Mass. 2003)\n\n(citing section 15 as creating the Massachusetts Act's co-employee\n\nimmunity).      Because   James   Construction   does   not   meet   the\n\n\n        4\n      We are unpersuaded by the defendants' argument that James\nConstruction is protected from this action because it satisfies the\nMassachusetts Act's definition of \"employer\" and Robidoux was a\n\"loaned servant\" to James Construction. First, just because the\nMassachusetts Act's definition of \"employer\" may include a special\nemployer like James Construction, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, §\n1(5), it does not follow that its other requirements for immunity\n— outlined in sections 15, 23, and 24 — are meaningless. Nor are\nwe moved by the defendants' reliance on Roberts v. Delta Air Lines,\nInc., No. 07-cv-12154, 2008 WL 5156654 (D. Mass. Dec. 4, 2008),\naff'd, 599 F.3d 73. In that case, the plaintiff did not question\nwhether the defendant was an \"insured person,\" and the district\ncourt did not address this prerequisite for immunity. See id.; see\nalso Roberts, 599 F.3d at 78 n.5 (\"[Plaintiff] asserts . . . that\nthere is a dispute of fact as to whether Delta was an 'insured\nperson liable for payment of compensation' to Roberts such that it\nwas entitled to immunity.     Because Roberts did not raise this\nargument before the district court, it is waived.\" (internal\ncitations omitted)).\n\n                                  -10-\n\fMassachusetts     Act's       prerequisites      for   immunity,       neither   does\n\nMuholland.\n\nB.            Under Massachusetts Choice of Law Principles,                         the\n              Massachusetts Act Governs the Defendants' Immunity\n\n              Historically, in tort cases, Massachusetts applied the\n\nsubstantive law of the state where the alleged wrong occurred.\n\nCosme v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., 632 N.E.2d 832, 834 (Mass.\n\n1994).   In the last few decades, however, Massachusetts has moved\n\nto a \"functional\" approach for addressing choice of law issues.\n\nJoseph   W.    Glannon    &    Gabriel    Teninbaum,       Conflict     of   Laws    in\n\nMassachusetts Part I: Current Choice-of-Law Theory, 92 Mass. L.\n\nRev. 12, 14-15 (2009); see, e.g., New England Tel. & Tel. Co. v.\n\nGourdeau Constr. Co., Inc., 647 N.E.2d 42, 43-44 (Mass. 1995);\n\nCosme, 632 N.E.2d at 834.\n\n              This functional approach \"responds to the interests of\n\nthe parties, the States involved, and the interstate system as a\n\nwhole.\" Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 473 N.E.2d 662, 668\n\n(Mass. 1985).       In employing this approach, the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") \"ha[s] not elected by name any\n\nparticular     choice-of-law        doctrine.

Wright Med.\n\nTech., Inc., 528 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The Second Restatement provides that, in personal injury\n\ncases, \"the local law of the state where the injury occurred\n\ndetermines the rights and liabilities of the parties, unless, with\n\nrespect to the particular issue, some other state has a more\n\nsignificant relationship under the principles stated in § 6 to the\n\noccurrence and the parties.\" Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws\n\n§   146   (1971)   (hereinafter   \"Restatement\").   Section   6   of   the\n\nRestatement cites the following factors as relevant to choice of\n\nlaw decisions:\n\n            (a) the needs of the interstate and\n                international systems,\n            (b) the relevant policies of the forum,\n            (c) the relevant policies of other interested\n                states and the relative interests of\n                those states in the determination of the\n                particular issue,\n            (d) the protection of justified expectations,\n            (e) the basic policies underlying the\n                particular field of law,\n            (f) certainty, predictability and uniformity\n                of result, and\n\n\n\n      5\n      The SJC has cited one particular commentator, R.A. Leflar, on\nmultiple occasions. See, e.g., Bushkin Assocs., 473 N.E.2d at 670\n& n.7 (quoting R.A. Leflar, American Conflicts Law § 99, at 198 (3d\ned. 1977)).    The SJC has also observed that the factors Leflar\nurged courts to consider \"generally parallel the considerations\ncontained in longer lists, including § 6(2) of the Second\nRestatement.\" Id. In this case, we find that Leflar's factors are\neither inapplicable or overlap with the section 6 factors, and we\ntherefore do not discuss them.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f               (g) ease in the determination and application\n                   of the law to be applied.\n\nId.   §   6.     The     Second   Restatement     further     explains   that,    in\n\nbalancing the section 6 factors, courts should consider various\n\n\"contacts,\" including: \"(a) the place where the injury occurred,\n\n(b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c)\n\nthe domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and\n\nplace of business of the parties, and (d) the place where the\n\nrelationship, if any, between the parties is centered.\"                     Id. §\n\n145(2).6\n\n               We also note that \"the law of a single jurisdiction is\n\nnot necessarily to be applied to all issues in a particular case\";\n\nrather, we should weigh the relevant considerations \"according to\n\ntheir relative importance to the particular issue involved.\"                     Lou\n\nv.

See Restatement §§ 181-\n85. With the exception of the defendants quoting section 184 in a\nfootnote, neither party advances any argument based on these\nsections.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fsignificant relationship' to the parties and the occurrence under\n\nthe considerations provided in § 6.\"7        Cosme, 632 N.E.2d at 835.\n\n           First and most importantly, Massachusetts' interests in\n\nthis case substantially exceed those of Rhode Island.               Robidoux is\n\na Massachusetts resident who, after obtaining the approval of a\n\nMassachusetts     administrative   judge,    received     benefits      from   a\n\nMassachusetts     workers'    compensation   policy   for      an    injury    he\n\nsuffered while employed by a Massachusetts company. Even where the\n\ninjury occurs out of state, Massachusetts retains a significant\n\ninterest in the extent to which a resident is compensated for a\n\nworkplace injury.      See, e.g., id. at 836; see also Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 152, § 26 (expressly authorizing paying benefits for injuries\n\nsustained outside the state); cf. Pevoski v. Pevoski, 358 N.E.2d\n\n416 (Mass. 1976) (holding, in a wife's suit against her husband\n\nstemming from a New York car accident, that Massachusetts law\n\ngoverned spousal immunity issue in part because \"the economic and\n\nsocial   impact   of   this   litigation    will   fall   on   Massachusetts\n\ndomiciliaries and a Massachusetts insurer\").\n\n           In addition to its interest in the amount of Robidoux's\n\ncompensation, Massachusetts also has a stake in who pays that\n\ncompensation.     Specifically, the Massachusetts Act limits immunity\n\n\n\n     7\n      \"Because some of [the relevant] factors are either redundant\nor not determinative, we focus on considerations particularly\nrelevant to the case.\" Jasty, 528 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n                                   -14-\n\fto \"insured person[s] employing such employee and liable for\n\npayment of [workers'] compensation\" in part because permitting\n\nrecovery from other parties may decrease the cost of workers'\n\ncompensation insurance by allowing insurers to recoup benefits in\n\nsome cases.8     Accordingly, Massachusetts has an interest in injured\n\nemployees or insurers being able to recover from parties like James\n\nConstruction      and   Muholland     whenever      a   Massachusetts'      workers'\n\ncompensation policy assumes responsibility for the payment of\n\nbenefits.\n\n            In contrast, Rhode Island has little interest in how\n\nRobidoux    is    compensated       or    whether       these   non-Rhode     Island\n\ndefendants are protected by immunity.               Cf. Dasha v. Adelman, 699\n\nN.E.2d   20,     26   (Mass.   App.      Ct.    1998)   (noting   that,     although\n\nplaintiff was injured in Maine, \"Maine's interest is significantly\n\ndiminished\" because the Maine defendants were no longer parties to\n\nthe case).       The defendants argue that the Rhode Island Act's\n\nimmunity provision is in part intended to decrease the cost of\n\ndoing business in Rhode Island, and therefore Rhode Island has an\n\ninterest in immunizing contractors for any injury that occurs in\n\n\n     8\n      See Brown v. Leighton, 434 N.E.2d 176, 178 (Mass. 1982) (\"As\nstated in Furlong v. Cronan, 26 N.E.2d 382 (Mass. 1940), one of the\npurposes of § 15 is, 'to preserve the cause of action (against the\nthird party) for the benefit of the insurer.'\"); see also Mass.\nGen. Laws. ch. 152, § 15 (\"Either the employee or insurer may\nproceed to enforce the liability of [persons other than the\ninsured] . . . . The sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the\ninsurer, unless such sum is greater than that paid by it to the\nemployee . . . .\").\n\n                                         -15-\n\fthe state.    See also Restatement § 184, cmt. b (\"[T]o deny . . .\n\nimmunity . . . would frustrate the efforts of that state to\n\nrestrict the cost of industrial accidents and to afford a fair\n\nbasis for predicting what these costs will be.\").           As defense\n\ncounsel conceded at oral argument, however, there is nothing in the\n\nrecord    establishing   that   interstate   contractors,   like   James\n\nConstruction, see a decrease in liability insurance premiums when\n\nthey take on projects in Rhode Island as opposed to some other\n\nstate with less generous immunity rules.\n\n            To be sure, Rhode Island has an interest in regulating\n\nconduct within its borders, and it therefore has an interest in\n\napplying its own conduct-regulating rules to events that occur in\n\nRhode Island.   See Lou, 933 N.E.2d at 151 n.27; Restatement § 145,\n\ncmt. d.      The specific question in this case, however, is not\n\nwhether Massachusetts or Rhode Island standards of negligence\n\napply.    Rather, the issue here pertains to the application of\n\nworkers' compensation immunity rules. Consequently, Rhode Island's\n\nconduct-regulating interests are diminished, and our choice of law\n\nanalysis therefore \"place[s] a greater emphasis on the State in\n\nwhich the parties are domiciled.\"     See Lou, 933 N.E.2d at 151 n.27;\n\nsee also Restatement § 145, cmt. d (\"[S]ubject only to rare\n\nexceptions, the local law of the state where conduct and injury\n\noccurred will be applied to determine whether the actor satisfied\n\nminimum standards of acceptable conduct and whether the interest\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\faffected by the actor's conduct was entitled to legal protection .\n\n. . .    On the other hand,      the    local     law    of    the     state   where\n\nthe     parties    are domiciled . . . may be applied to determine\n\nwhether one party is immune from tort liability . . . .\").\n\n            We recognize that \"[a]n important objective of the [Rhode\n\nIsland Act] was to curtail litigation by injured employees who\n\nelected to take advantage of its expedited procedure for obtaining\n\ncompensation . . . .\"          See Sorenson, 650 A.2d at 129.              Because\n\nRobidoux ended up receiving compensation from a Massachusetts\n\npolicy,    however,     honoring     the      purposes   underlying        workers'\n\ncompensation      has   become   primarily      an   issue     of     Massachusetts\n\nconcern. As discussed above, Massachusetts prefers to retain third\n\nparty liability, and the costs associated with it, in order to\n\nallow insurers and injured employees to pursue recovery from\n\nresponsible third parties, which presumably Massachusetts hopes\n\nwill decrease workers' compensation premiums and attendant welfare\n\ncosts.     Conversely,       Rhode   Island    has   traded     the    benefits   of\n\nallowing recovery from special employers in exchange for insulating\n\nthose special employers from the risks of litigation, presumably in\n\nan effort decrease the cost of doing business in the state.                    Here,\n\napplying the Rhode Island Act to an out-of-state resident receiving\n\nout-of-state      workers'    compensation      benefits      would    allow   Rhode\n\nIsland to reap the benefits of this trade-off in a situation where\n\nthe state would not similarly bear any of the burdens.\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f            The parties devote considerable space in their briefs to\n\ndiscussing another section 6 factor: their own and each others'\n\nexpectations about which state's law would govern this type of\n\naction.     As for Robidoux's expectations, this consideration cuts\n\nboth ways. On the one hand, Robidoux was a Massachusetts resident,\n\ncovered by Massachusetts workers' compensation insurance, employed\n\nby a Massachusetts company.         On the other hand, the entirety of his\n\nwork for James Construction occurred in Rhode Island.\n\n            Turning to the defendants' reasonable expectations, we\n\nfirst note the parties' disagreement about whether the defendants\n\nknew that 508 was a Massachusetts area code, knew that Labor\n\nSystems was a Massachusetts company, and/or expected Rhode Island\n\nlaw to apply.         We need not, however, wade into these factual\n\ndisputes.       Suffice it to say that when James Construction secured\n\nthe services of a temporary worker by calling a Massachusetts-based\n\ncompany at a phone number with a Massachusetts area code, it lost\n\nany justification for expecting that an accident involving that\n\ntemporary worker would only implicate Rhode Island law. Similarly,\n\nMuholland lacked a reasonable expectation that he would only be\n\nsubject to Rhode Island law by supervising a temporary worker who\n\nhad told him he was a Massachusetts resident and by signing a work\n\norder that suggested that Robidoux was based out of a state other\n\nthan Rhode Island.           Even if we accept that James Construction's\n\ndemand    for    a   Rhode    Island   workers'   compensation   certificate\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\freflected its subjective belief that Rhode Island law would govern\n\nany workplace incident, that fact would not alter our conclusion\n\nabout what expectations were reasonable and justified under the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n           We acknowledge that this action involves substantial\n\ncontacts with Rhode Island.         The injury and injury-causing conduct\n\noccurred   in    Rhode    Island,    and   the   parties'   relationship   was\n\ncentered in Rhode Island.       See Restatement § 145(2).        These Rhode\n\nIsland contacts, however, are simply insufficient to outweigh\n\nMassachusetts' superior interests in this case.                Moreover, the\n\ncontacts with Massachusetts are not insubstantial.                Of the two\n\nstates, only Massachusetts can claim a party as a resident or local\n\ncompany,   and   the     Robidoux-James      Construction   relationship   was\n\nformed in part by communication — both between James Construction\n\nand Labor Systems, and between Labor Systems and Robidoux — to and\n\nwithin Massachusetts.\n\n                              III.    Conclusion\n\n           We conclude that Massachusetts law governs the immunity\n\nissue in this case and does not bar Robidoux's claims against the\n\ndefendants. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and\n\nremand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

Robidoux sued James Corporation d/b/a James Construction (\"James Construction\") and Michael A. Muholland, Jr. (collectively \"defendants\") for personal injuries Robidoux suffered while working at a construction site. The district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Act (\"Rhode Island Act\") applied to the action and barred the claims. Because we conclude that the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act (\"Massachusetts Act\") applies to this suit and does not bar Robidoux's claims, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts &amp; Background</h2>\n<p>Most of the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. In May 2006, James Construction, a general contractor incorporated and based in Pennsylvania, was working on a project at the Newport Naval Station in Rhode Island. In search of temporary laborers, James Construction contacted a temporary employment agency, Northeast Temps, Inc. d/b/a Labor Systems (\"Labor Systems\"), which is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. It does also maintain an office in Rhode Island. In response to James Construction's request, Labor Systems dispatched Robidoux, a Massachusetts resident and newly-minted Labor Systems employee, from its Fall River, Massachusetts office to the Rhode Island job site. While working at the Newport Naval Station, Robidoux was supervised by Muholland, a James Construction employee who was neither a Massachusetts resident nor a Rhode Island resident. During Robidoux's work on the project, he discussed his Massachusetts residency with Muholland. At the conclusion of Robidoux's assignment, Muholland signed a work order that displayed Labor Systems' two Massachusetts locations and their corresponding 508 area code telephone numbers.</p>\n<p>Almost six months later, on November 15, 2006, James Construction again contacted Labor Systems, at one of the 508 area code telephone numbers, to specifically request Robidoux's services for a different project at the Newport Naval Station. The next day, Robidoux picked up a work order and his personal protective equipment at Labor Systems' Fall River office before traveling on to Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Robidoux's second stint working at the Newport Naval Station lasted approximately six weeks. During the course of this work, Robidoux received his paychecks, with Rhode Island tax withholdings, from Labor Systems. For Robidoux's services, James Construction remitted payments to an Ohio address provided by Labor Systems. Pursuant to a contract between James Construction and Labor Systems, James Construction assumed responsibility for supervising Robidoux while he was at the construction site. Muholland, who was serving as the project's superintendent, provided this supervision. Additionally, the contract required Labor Systems to provide workers' compensation insurance for the employees it provided to James Construction. At the time Labor Systems <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> and James Construction agreed to the contract, Labor System already had workers' compensation insurance policies from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\") for Massachusetts and from Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (\"Beacon Mutual\") for Rhode Island. James Construction also required Labor Systems to provide a certificate of its Rhode Island workers' compensation insurance.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On January 4, 2007, while working with Muholland at the Newport Naval Station site, Robidoux was seriously injured when a 648 pound compactor fell on him. That same day, without Robidoux's knowledge, Labor Systems filed a report of injury so that Robidoux could collect Rhode Island workers' compensation benefits. Consequently, Robidoux began receiving $629.27 a week from Beacon Mutual. These payments lasted for almost seventeen weeks and totaled $10,248.15.</p>\n<p>On February 20, 2007, Robidoux filed a claim for Massachusetts workers' compensation benefits with Liberty Mutual. An administrative judge in the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents concluded that Robidoux was entitled to these benefits, and ordered Liberty Mutual to take credit for the monies paid by Beacon Mutual and assume responsibility for future benefits.</p>\n<p>On January 9, 2009, Robidoux filed a diversity action in the District of Massachusetts alleging that the injuries he suffered at the construction site were caused by the defendants' negligence. On July 29, 2010, the district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment. <i>Robidoux v. Muholland,</i> 733 F.Supp.2d 198 (D.Mass.2010). Employing Massachusetts choice of law principles, the district court determined that \"Rhode Island [as opposed to Massachusetts] has a substantially more significant relationship to this litigation and, therefore, this court must apply Rhode Island law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 203. The court went on to conclude that, except in circumstances not present in the case at hand, the Rhode Island Act grants \"special employers,\" such as James Construction, \"immunity from private action by injured employees.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the court concluded that the Rhode Island Act prohibits a plaintiff from suing co-employees such as Muholland. <i>Id.</i> at 204. Robidoux subsequently appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>\"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Cortés-Rivera v. Dep't of Corr. and Rehab. of the Commonwealth of P.R.,</i> 626 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.2010). This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Id.</i> Choice of law determinations are questions of law, which we also review de novo. <i>See </i><i>Crellin Tech., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp.,</i> 18 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994). Both parties agree that Massachusetts choice of law principles govern this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. A Conflict Exists Between the Relevant Massachusetts and Rhode Island Law</h2>\n<p>\"[T]he usual first step in applying conflict of law principles is to ascertain whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> there is a conflict among the laws of the various States involved.\" <i>Cohen v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.,</i> 389 Mass. 327, 450 N.E.2d 581, 584 n. 7 (1983).</p>\n<p>The Rhode Island Act provides that, except in circumstances not alleged in this appeal, \"[t]he right to compensation... and the remedy for an injury granted by [the Rhode Island Act], shall be in lieu of all rights and remedies as to that injury now existing ... against an employer, or its ... employees.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-20. The defendants assert, as the district court concluded, that this \"employer\" immunity extends to \"special employers\" that is, \"person[s] who contract[] for services with a general employer for the use of an employee,\" <i>id.</i> § 28-29-2(6)(ii)and their employees. <i>See </i><i>Sorenson v. Colibri Corp.,</i> 650 A.2d 125 (R.I.1994). Accordingly, the defendants contend, the Rhode Island Act bars Robidoux's claims against James Construction, the special employer, and its employee, Muholland. On appeal, Robidoux does not dispute this interpretation of Rhode Island law, and we therefore assume that the Rhode Island Act, if applicable, would bar this action.</p>\n<p>The question therefore becomes whether the Massachusetts Act would similarly bar Robidoux's claims against the defendants.<sup>[2]</sup> We conclude that it would not.</p>\n<p>Generally, \"the [Massachusetts Act] bars employees from recovering against their employers for injuries received on the job.\" <i>Barrett v. Rodgers,</i> 408 Mass. 614, 562 N.E.2d 480, 482 (1990) (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, §§ 23, 24).<sup>[3]</sup> An injured employee retains the right, however, \"to bring suit against third parties who may be liable for injuries compensable under the [Massachusetts] Act.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 15). More specifically, \"nothing in [section fifteen], or in section eighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action at law ... <i>against any person other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter</i> ... and said insured person's employees.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 15 (emphasis added); <i>cf. </i><i>Searcy v. Paul,</i> 20 Mass.App.Ct. 134, 478 N.E.2d 1275, 1278 (1985) (\"[T]he [above-quoted statutory language] was taken by text and periodical writers as broadly abolishing the so-called `common employment' doctrine and permitting third party actions by ... an injured employee against all but his immediate insured employer.\").</p>\n<p>In short, for an employer to be immunized pursuant to the Massachusetts Act \"(1) a `direct employment relationship must exist' between the injured party and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> the person claiming immunity, and (2) `the employer must be an insured person liable for the payment of compensation.'\" <i>Roberts v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 599 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Fleming v. Shaheen Bros., Inc.,</i> 71 Mass.App.Ct. 223, 881 N.E.2d 1143, 1146 (2008)).</p>\n<p>Turning to the second prong of this test, an \"insured person\" is \"an employer who has provided by insurance for the payment to his employees by an insurer of the compensation provided for by this chapter, or is a self-insurer ... or is a member of workers' compensation self-insurance group.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 1(6). Further, Massachusetts law requires that, absent an agreement to the contrary, in circumstances involving a special employer and a general employer, \"the liability for the payment of compensation for the injury shall be borne by the <i>general employer</i> or its insurer.\" <i>Id.</i> § 18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>James Construction is not an \"insured person liable for the payment of [workers'] compensation.\" To the contrary, pursuant to the express terms of their agreement, Labor Systems assumed responsibility for providing Robidoux's workers' compensation insurance. Although James Construction may have paid a rate that effectively reimbursed Labor Systems for that insurance, James Construction does not point to any authority suggesting that such an arrangement equates to \"provid[ing]\" workers' compensation insurance and being \"liable for payment of workers' compensation.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>Numberg v. GTE Transp., Inc.,</i> 34 Mass.App.Ct. 904, 607 N.E.2d 1, 2 (1993) (finding that special employer was not an insured person liable for payment of workers' compensation, even though it reimbursed general employer for the cost of workers' compensation benefits, because there was no agreement that special employer would provide those benefits). Consequently, Robidoux's claims against James Construction are not barred by the Massachusetts Act.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor would the Massachusetts Act immunize Muholland, as a \"co-employee,\" from this action. The defendants do not point to any case law suggesting that co-employee immunity exists beyond that which is derived from an employer's immunity. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 15 (\"Nothing in this section, or in section eighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action ... against <i>any person</i> other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter ... <i>and said insured person's employees.</i>\" (emphasis added)); <i>Fredette v. Simpson,</i> 440 Mass. 263, 797 N.E.2d 899, 901-02 (2003) (citing section 15 as creating the Massachusetts Act's co-employee immunity). Because James Construction does not meet the Massachusetts Act's prerequisites <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> for immunity, neither does Muholland.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Under Massachusetts Choice of Law Principles, the Massachusetts Act Governs the Defendants' Immunity</h2>\n<p>Historically, in tort cases, Massachusetts applied the substantive law of the state where the alleged wrong occurred. <i>Cosme v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc.,</i> 417 Mass. 643, 632 N.E.2d 832, 834 (1994). In the last few decades, however, Massachusetts has moved to a \"functional\" approach for addressing choice of law issues. Joseph W. Glannon &amp; Gabriel Teninbaum, <i>Conflict of Laws in Massachusetts Part I: Current Choice-of-Law Theory,</i> 92 Mass. L.Rev. 12, 14-15 (2009); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Gourdeau Constr. Co., Inc.,</i> 419 Mass. 658, 647 N.E.2d 42, 43-44 (1995); <i>Cosme,</i> 632 N.E.2d at 834.</p>\n<p>This functional approach \"responds to the interests of the parties, the States involved, and the interstate system as a whole.\" <i>Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 393 Mass. 622, 473 N.E.2d 662, 668 (1985). In employing this approach, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") \"ha[s] not elected by name any particular choice-of-law doctrine. Rather, [it] consider[s] choice-of-law issues by assessing various choice-influencing considerations, including those provided in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971), and those suggested by various commentators.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cosme,</i> 632 N.E.2d at 834 (quotation marks and other internal citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Jasty v. Wright Med. Tech., Inc.,</i> 528 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>The Second Restatement provides that, in personal injury cases, \"the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties, unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in § 6 to the occurrence and the parties.\" Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws § 146 (1971) (hereinafter \"Restatement\"). Section 6 of the Restatement cites the following factors as relevant to choice of law decisions:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) the needs of the interstate and international systems,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) the relevant policies of the forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) the protection of justified expectations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 6. The Second Restatement further explains that, in balancing the section 6 factors, courts should consider various \"contacts,\" including: \"(a) the place where the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> the parties, and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.\" <i>Id.</i> § 145(2).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We also note that \"the law of a single jurisdiction is not necessarily to be applied to all issues in a particular case\"; rather, we should weigh the relevant considerations \"according to their relative importance to the particular issue involved.\" <i>Lou v. Otis Elevator Co.,</i> 77 Mass.App.Ct. 571, 933 N.E.2d 140, 151 &amp; n. 27 (citing <i>Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart v. SCA Servs., Inc.,</i> 378 Mass. 535, 392 N.E.2d 1045 (1979); Restatement § 145, cmt. d), <i>review denied,</i> 458 Mass. 1108, 936 N.E.2d 435 (2010).</p>\n<p>Turning to the case at hand, we conclude that the Massachusetts Act's immunity provisions apply to Robidoux's claims because Massachusetts, as compared to Rhode Island, \"has a `more significant relationship' to the parties and the occurrence under the considerations provided in § 6.\"<sup>[7]</sup><i>Cosme,</i> 632 N.E.2d at 835.</p>\n<p>First and most importantly, Massachusetts' interests in this case substantially exceed those of Rhode Island. Robidoux is a Massachusetts resident who, after obtaining the approval of a Massachusetts administrative judge, received benefits from a Massachusetts workers' compensation policy for an injury he suffered while employed by a Massachusetts company. Even where the injury occurs out of state, Massachusetts retains a significant interest in the extent to which a resident is compensated for a workplace injury. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 836; <i>see also</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 26 (expressly authorizing paying benefits for injuries sustained outside the state); <i>cf. </i><i>Pevoski v. Pevoski,</i> 371 Mass. 358, 358 N.E.2d 416 (1976) (holding, in a wife's suit against her husband stemming from a New York car accident, that Massachusetts law governed spousal immunity issue in part because \"the economic and social impact of this litigation will fall on Massachusetts domiciliaries and a Massachusetts insurer\").</p>\n<p>In addition to its interest in the amount of Robidoux's compensation, Massachusetts also has a stake in <i>who</i> pays that compensation. Specifically, the Massachusetts Act limits immunity to \"insured person[s] employing such employee and liable for payment of [workers'] compensation\" in part because permitting recovery from other parties may decrease the cost of workers' compensation insurance by allowing insurers to recoup benefits in some cases.<sup>[8]</sup> Accordingly, Massachusetts has an interest in injured employees or insurers being able to recover from parties like James Construction and Muholland whenever a Massachusetts' workers' compensation policy assumes responsibility for the payment of benefits.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Rhode Island has little interest in how Robidoux is compensated or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> whether these non-Rhode Island defendants are protected by immunity. <i>Cf. </i><i>Dasha v. Adelman,</i> 45 Mass.App.Ct. 418, 699 N.E.2d 20, 26 (1998) (noting that, although plaintiff was injured in Maine, \"Maine's interest is significantly diminished\" because the Maine defendants were no longer parties to the case). The defendants argue that the Rhode Island Act's immunity provision is in part intended to decrease the cost of doing business in Rhode Island, and therefore Rhode Island has an interest in immunizing contractors for any injury that occurs in the state. <i>See also</i> Restatement § 184, cmt. b (\"[T]o deny ... immunity... would frustrate the efforts of that state to restrict the cost of industrial accidents and to afford a fair basis for predicting what these costs will be.\"). As defense counsel conceded at oral argument, however, there is nothing in the record establishing that interstate contractors, like James Construction, see a decrease in liability insurance premiums when they take on projects in Rhode Island as opposed to some other state with less generous immunity rules.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Rhode Island has an interest in regulating conduct within its borders, and it therefore has an interest in applying its own conduct-regulating rules to events that occur in Rhode Island. <i>See </i><i>Lou,</i> 933 N.E.2d at 151 n. 27; Restatement § 145, cmt. d. The specific question in this case, however, is not whether Massachusetts or Rhode Island standards of negligence apply. Rather, the issue here pertains to the application of workers' compensation immunity rules. Consequently, Rhode Island's conduct-regulating interests are diminished, and our choice of law analysis therefore \"place[s] a greater emphasis on the State in which the parties are domiciled.\" <i>See </i><i>Lou,</i> 933 N.E.2d at 151 n. 27; <i>see also</i> Restatement § 145, cmt. d (\"[S]ubject only to rare exceptions, the local law of the state where conduct and injury occurred will be applied to determine whether the actor satisfied minimum standards of acceptable conduct and whether the interest affected by the actor's conduct was entitled to legal protection.... On the other hand, the local law of the state where the parties are domiciled... may be applied to determine whether one party is immune from tort liability....\").</p>\n<p>We recognize that \"[a]n important objective of the [Rhode Island Act] was to curtail litigation by injured employees who elected to take advantage of its expedited procedure for obtaining compensation....\" <i>See </i><i>Sorenson,</i> 650 A.2d at 129. Because Robidoux ended up receiving compensation from a Massachusetts policy, however, honoring the purposes underlying workers' compensation has become primarily an issue of Massachusetts concern. As discussed above, Massachusetts prefers to retain third party liability, and the costs associated with it, in order to allow insurers and injured employees to pursue recovery from responsible third parties, which presumably Massachusetts hopes will decrease workers' compensation premiums and attendant welfare costs. Conversely, Rhode Island has traded the benefits of allowing recovery from special employers in exchange for insulating those special employers from the risks of litigation, presumably in an effort decrease the cost of doing business in the state. Here, applying the Rhode Island Act to an out-of-state resident receiving out-of-state workers' compensation benefits would allow Rhode Island to reap the benefits of this trade-off in a situation where the state would not similarly bear any of the burdens.</p>\n<p>The parties devote considerable space in their briefs to discussing another section 6 factor: their own and each others' expectations about which state's law would govern <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> this type of action. As for Robidoux's expectations, this consideration cuts both ways. On the one hand, Robidoux was a Massachusetts resident, covered by Massachusetts workers' compensation insurance, employed by a Massachusetts company. On the other hand, the entirety of his work for James Construction occurred in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Turning to the defendants' reasonable expectations, we first note the parties' disagreement about whether the defendants knew that 508 was a Massachusetts area code, knew that Labor Systems was a Massachusetts company, and/or expected Rhode Island law to apply. We need not, however, wade into these factual disputes. Suffice it to say that when James Construction secured the services of a temporary worker by calling a Massachusetts-based company at a phone number with a Massachusetts area code, it lost any justification for expecting that an accident involving that temporary worker would only implicate Rhode Island law. Similarly, Muholland lacked a reasonable expectation that he would only be subject to Rhode Island law by supervising a temporary worker who had told him he was a Massachusetts resident and by signing a work order that suggested that Robidoux was based out of a state other than Rhode Island. Even if we accept that James Construction's demand for a Rhode Island workers' compensation certificate reflected its subjective belief that Rhode Island law would govern any workplace incident, that fact would not alter our conclusion about what expectations were reasonable and justified under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that this action involves substantial contacts with Rhode Island. The injury and injury-causing conduct occurred in Rhode Island, and the parties' relationship was centered in Rhode Island. <i>See</i> Restatement § 145(2). These Rhode Island contacts, however, are simply insufficient to outweigh Massachusetts' superior interests in this case. Moreover, the contacts with Massachusetts are not insubstantial. Of the two states, only Massachusetts can claim a party as a resident or local company, and the Robidoux-James Construction relationship was formed in part by communicationboth between James Construction and Labor Systems, and between Labor Systems and Robidouxto and within Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We conclude that Massachusetts law governs the immunity issue in this case and does not bar Robidoux's claims against the defendants. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Robidoux, noting that this certificate was not received until the day he was injured, asserts that James Construction did not actually require Labor Systems to provide this proof of insurance prior to his injury. Moreover, Robidoux suggests that James Construction only required Labor Systems to provide this certificate because, in addition to Robidoux, Labor Systems also dispatched a Rhode Island resident to work for James Construction.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the district court did not address this issue, we are free to resolve questions of law in the first instance. <i>See </i><i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> 2 F.3d 1221, 1228 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 24 provides in part: \"An employee shall be held to have waived his right of action at common law or under the law of any other jurisdiction in respect to an injury that is compensable under this chapter, to recover damages for personal injuries, if he shall not have given his employer ... written notice that he claimed such right....\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 24.\n</p>\n<p>Section 23 reads:</p>\n<p>If an employee files any claim or accepts payment of compensation on account of personal injury under this chapter, or submits to a proceeding before the department under sections ten to twelve, inclusive, such action shall constitute a release to the insurer of all claims or demands at common law, if any, arising from the injury. If an employee accepts payment of compensation under this chapter on account of personal injury or makes an agreement under section forty-eight, such action shall constitute a release to the insured of all claims or demands at common law, if any, arising from the injury.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 23.</p>\n<p>[4]  We are unpersuaded by the defendants' argument that James Construction is protected from this action because it satisfies the Massachusetts Act's definition of \"employer\" and Robidoux was a \"loaned servant\" to James Construction. First, just because the Massachusetts Act's definition of \"employer\" may include a special employer like James Construction, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 1(5), it does not follow that its other requirements for immunityoutlined in sections 15, 23, and 24are meaningless. Nor are we moved by the defendants' reliance on <i>Roberts v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> No. 07-cv-12154, 2008 WL 5156654 (D.Mass. Dec. 4, 2008), <i>aff'd,</i> 599 F.3d 73. In that case, the plaintiff did not question whether the defendant was an \"insured person,\" and the district court did not address this prerequisite for immunity. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Roberts,</i> 599 F.3d at 78 n. 5 (\"[Plaintiff] asserts ... that there is a dispute of fact as to whether Delta was an `insured person liable for payment of compensation' to Roberts such that it was entitled to immunity. Because Roberts did not raise this argument before the district court, it is waived.\" (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>[5]  The SJC has cited one particular commentator, R.A. Leflar, on multiple occasions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bushkin Assocs.,</i> 473 N.E.2d at 670 &amp; n. 7 (quoting R.A. Leflar, American Conflicts Law § 99, at 198 (3d ed.1977)). The SJC has also observed that the factors Leflar urged courts to consider \"generally parallel the considerations contained in longer lists, including § 6(2) of the Second Restatement.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, we find that Leflar's factors are either inapplicable or overlap with the section 6 factors, and we therefore do not discuss them.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Restatement also includes five sections specifically addressing workers' compensation issues. <i>See</i> Restatement §§ 181-85. With the exception of the defendants quoting section 184 in a footnote, neither party advances any argument based on these sections.</p>\n<p>[7]  \"Because some of [the relevant] factors are either redundant or not determinative, we focus on considerations particularly relevant to the case.\" <i>Jasty,</i> 528 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See </i><i>Brown v.

Robidoux sued James Corporation d/b/a James Construction (\"James Construction\") and Michael A. Muholland, Jr. (collectively \"defendants\") for personal injuries Robidoux suffered while working at a construction site. The district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the Rhode Island Workers' Compensation Act (\"Rhode Island Act\") applied to the action and barred the claims. Because we conclude that the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act (\"Massachusetts Act\") applies to this suit and does not bar Robidoux's claims, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts &amp; Background</h2>\n<p>Most of the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. In May 2006, James Construction, a general contractor incorporated and based in Pennsylvania, was working on a project at the Newport Naval Station in Rhode Island. In search of temporary laborers, James Construction contacted a temporary employment agency, Northeast Temps, Inc. d/b/a Labor Systems (\"Labor Systems\"), which is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. It does also maintain an office in Rhode Island. In response to James Construction's request, Labor Systems dispatched Robidoux, a Massachusetts resident and newly-minted Labor Systems employee, from its Fall River, Massachusetts office to the Rhode Island job site. While working at the Newport Naval Station, Robidoux was supervised by Muholland, a James Construction employee who was neither a Massachusetts resident nor a Rhode Island resident. During Robidoux's work on the project, he discussed his Massachusetts residency with Muholland. At the conclusion of Robidoux's assignment, Muholland signed a work order that displayed Labor Systems' two Massachusetts locations and their corresponding 508 area code telephone numbers.</p>\n<p>Almost six months later, on November 15, 2006, James Construction again contacted Labor Systems, at one of the 508 area code telephone numbers, to specifically request Robidoux's services for a different project at the Newport Naval Station. The next day, Robidoux picked up a work order and his personal protective equipment at Labor Systems' Fall River office before traveling on to Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Robidoux's second stint working at the Newport Naval Station lasted approximately six weeks. During the course of this work, Robidoux received his paychecks, with Rhode Island tax withholdings, from Labor Systems. For Robidoux's services, James Construction remitted payments to an Ohio address provided by Labor Systems. Pursuant to a contract between James Construction and Labor Systems, James Construction assumed responsibility for supervising Robidoux while he was at the construction site. Muholland, who was serving as the project's superintendent, provided this supervision. Additionally, the contract required Labor Systems to provide workers' compensation insurance for the employees it provided to James Construction. At the time Labor Systems <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> and James Construction agreed to the contract, Labor System already had workers' compensation insurance policies from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\") for Massachusetts and from Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (\"Beacon Mutual\") for Rhode Island. James Construction also required Labor Systems to provide a certificate of its Rhode Island workers' compensation insurance.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On January 4, 2007, while working with Muholland at the Newport Naval Station site, Robidoux was seriously injured when a 648 pound compactor fell on him. That same day, without Robidoux's knowledge, Labor Systems filed a report of injury so that Robidoux could collect Rhode Island workers' compensation benefits. Consequently, Robidoux began receiving $629.27 a week from Beacon Mutual. These payments lasted for almost seventeen weeks and totaled $10,248.15.</p>\n<p>On February 20, 2007, Robidoux filed a claim for Massachusetts workers' compensation benefits with Liberty Mutual. An administrative judge in the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents concluded that Robidoux was entitled to these benefits, and ordered Liberty Mutual to take credit for the monies paid by Beacon Mutual and assume responsibility for future benefits.</p>\n<p>On January 9, 2009, Robidoux filed a diversity action in the District of Massachusetts alleging that the injuries he suffered at the construction site were caused by the defendants' negligence. On July 29, 2010, the district court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment. <i>Robidoux v. Muholland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2473875\"><a href=\"/opinion/2473875/robidoux-v-muholland/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2010). Employing Massachusetts choice of law principles, the district court determined that \"Rhode Island [as opposed to Massachusetts] has a substantially more significant relationship to this litigation and, therefore, this court must apply Rhode Island law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 203. The court went on to conclude that, except in circumstances not present in the case at hand, the Rhode Island Act grants \"special employers,\" such as James Construction, \"immunity from private action by injured employees.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the court concluded that the Rhode Island Act prohibits a plaintiff from suing co-employees such as Muholland. <i>Id.</i> at 204. Robidoux subsequently appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>\"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Cortés-Rivera v. Dep't of Corr. and Rehab. of the Commonwealth of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2010). This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Id.</i> Choice of law determinations are questions of law, which we also review de novo. <i>See </i><i>Crellin Tech., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195233\"><a href=\"/opinion/195233/crellin-v-equipmentlease-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1994). Both parties agree that Massachusetts choice of law principles govern this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. A Conflict Exists Between the Relevant Massachusetts and Rhode Island Law</h2>\n<p>\"[T]he usual first step in applying conflict of law principles is to ascertain whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> there is a conflict among the laws of the various States involved.\" <i>Cohen v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2238296\"><a href=\"/opinion/2238296/cohen-v-mcdonnell-douglas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2238296\"><a href=\"/opinion/2238296/cohen-v-mcdonnell-douglas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 584 n. 7 (1983).</p>\n<p>The Rhode Island Act provides that, except in circumstances not alleged in this appeal, \"[t]he right to compensation... and the remedy for an injury granted by [the Rhode Island Act], shall be in lieu of all rights and remedies as to that injury now existing ... against an employer, or its ... employees.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-20. The defendants assert, as the district court concluded, that this \"employer\" immunity extends to \"special employers\" that is, \"person[s] who contract[] for services with a general employer for the use of an employee,\" <i>id.</i> § 28-29-2(6)(ii)and their employees. <i>See </i><i>Sorenson v. Colibri Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2164999\"><a href=\"/opinion/2164999/sorenson-v-colibri-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span> (R.I.1994). Accordingly, the defendants contend, the Rhode Island Act bars Robidoux's claims against James Construction, the special employer, and its employee, Muholland. On appeal, Robidoux does not dispute this interpretation of Rhode Island law, and we therefore assume that the Rhode Island Act, if applicable, would bar this action.</p>\n<p>The question therefore becomes whether the Massachusetts Act would similarly bar Robidoux's claims against the defendants.<sup>[2]</sup> We conclude that it would not.</p>\n<p>Generally, \"the [Massachusetts Act] bars employees from recovering against their employers for injuries received on the job.\" <i>Barrett v.

Further, Massachusetts law requires that, absent an agreement to the contrary, in circumstances involving a special employer and a general employer, \"the liability for the payment of compensation for the injury shall be borne by the <i>general employer</i> or its insurer.\" <i>Id.</i> § 18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>James Construction is not an \"insured person liable for the payment of [workers'] compensation.\" To the contrary, pursuant to the express terms of their agreement, Labor Systems assumed responsibility for providing Robidoux's workers' compensation insurance. Although James Construction may have paid a rate that effectively reimbursed Labor Systems for that insurance, James Construction does not point to any authority suggesting that such an arrangement equates to \"provid[ing]\" workers' compensation insurance and being \"liable for payment of workers' compensation.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>Numberg v.

Consequently, Robidoux's claims against James Construction are not barred by the Massachusetts Act.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor would the Massachusetts Act immunize Muholland, as a \"co-employee,\" from this action. The defendants do not point to any case law suggesting that co-employee immunity exists beyond that which is derived from an employer's immunity. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 15 (\"Nothing in this section, or in section eighteen or twenty-four shall be construed to bar an action ... against <i>any person</i> other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter ... <i>and said insured person's employees.</i>\" (emphasis added)); <i>Fredette v.

Under Massachusetts Choice of Law Principles, the Massachusetts Act Governs the Defendants' Immunity</h2>\n<p>Historically, in tort cases, Massachusetts applied the substantive law of the state where the alleged wrong occurred. <i>Cosme v.

In the last few decades, however, Massachusetts has moved to a \"functional\" approach for addressing choice of law issues. Joseph W. Glannon &amp; Gabriel Teninbaum, <i>Conflict of Laws in Massachusetts Part I: Current Choice-of-Law Theory,</i> 92 Mass. L.Rev. 12, 14-15 (2009); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>New England Tel. &amp; Tel.

In employing this approach, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") \"ha[s] not elected by name any particular choice-of-law doctrine. Rather, [it] consider[s] choice-of-law issues by assessing various choice-influencing considerations, including those provided in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971), and those suggested by various commentators.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cosme,</i> 632 N.E.2d at 834 (quotation marks and other internal citation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Jasty v.

Section 6 of the Restatement cites the following factors as relevant to choice of law decisions:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) the needs of the interstate and international systems,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) the relevant policies of the forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) the protection of justified expectations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 6. The Second Restatement further explains that, in balancing the section 6 factors, courts should consider various \"contacts,\" including: \"(a) the place where the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> the parties, and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.\" <i>Id.</i> § 145(2).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>We also note that \"the law of a single jurisdiction is not necessarily to be applied to all issues in a particular case\"; rather, we should weigh the relevant considerations \"according to their relative importance to the particular issue involved.\" <i>Lou v.

Robidoux is a Massachusetts resident who, after obtaining the approval of a Massachusetts administrative judge, received benefits from a Massachusetts workers' compensation policy for an injury he suffered while employed by a Massachusetts company. Even where the injury occurs out of state, Massachusetts retains a significant interest in the extent to which a resident is compensated for a workplace injury. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 836; <i>see also</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 26 (expressly authorizing paying benefits for injuries sustained outside the state); <i>cf. </i><i>Pevoski v. Pevoski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043454\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043454/pevoski-v-pevoski/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2043454\"><a href=\"/opinion/2043454/pevoski-v-pevoski/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span> (1976) (holding, in a wife's suit against her husband stemming from a New York car accident, that Massachusetts law governed spousal immunity issue in part because \"the economic and social impact of this litigation will fall on Massachusetts domiciliaries and a Massachusetts insurer\").</p>\n<p>In addition to its interest in the amount of Robidoux's compensation, Massachusetts also has a stake in <i>who</i> pays that compensation. Specifically, the Massachusetts Act limits immunity to \"insured person[s] employing such employee and liable for payment of [workers'] compensation\" in part because permitting recovery from other parties may decrease the cost of workers' compensation insurance by allowing insurers to recoup benefits in some cases.<sup>[8]</sup> Accordingly, Massachusetts has an interest in injured employees or insurers being able to recover from parties like James Construction and Muholland whenever a Massachusetts' workers' compensation policy assumes responsibility for the payment of benefits.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Rhode Island has little interest in how Robidoux is compensated or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> whether these non-Rhode Island defendants are protected by immunity. <i>Cf. </i><i>Dasha v. Adelman,</i> 45 Mass.App.Ct. 418, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 26 (1998) (noting that, although plaintiff was injured in Maine, \"Maine's interest is significantly diminished\" because the Maine defendants were no longer parties to the case). The defendants argue that the Rhode Island Act's immunity provision is in part intended to decrease the cost of doing business in Rhode Island, and therefore Rhode Island has an interest in immunizing contractors for any injury that occurs in the state. <i>See also</i> Restatement § 184, cmt. b (\"[T]o deny ... immunity... would frustrate the efforts of that state to restrict the cost of industrial accidents and to afford a fair basis for predicting what these costs will be.\"). As defense counsel conceded at oral argument, however, there is nothing in the record establishing that interstate contractors, like James Construction, see a decrease in liability insurance premiums when they take on projects in Rhode Island as opposed to some other state with less generous immunity rules.</p>\n<p>To be sure, Rhode Island has an interest in regulating conduct within its borders, and it therefore has an interest in applying its own conduct-regulating rules to events that occur in Rhode Island. <i>See </i><i>Lou,</i> 933 N.E.2d at 151 n. 27; Restatement § 145, cmt. d. The specific question in this case, however, is not whether Massachusetts or Rhode Island standards of negligence apply. Rather, the issue here pertains to the application of workers' compensation immunity rules. Consequently, Rhode Island's conduct-regulating interests are diminished, and our choice of law analysis therefore \"place[s] a greater emphasis on the State in which the parties are domiciled.\" <i>See </i><i>Lou,</i> 933 N.E.2d at 151 n. 27; <i>see also</i> Restatement § 145, cmt. d (\"[S]ubject only to rare exceptions, the local law of the state where conduct and injury occurred will be applied to determine whether the actor satisfied minimum standards of acceptable conduct and whether the interest affected by the actor's conduct was entitled to legal protection.... On the other hand, the local law of the state where the parties are domiciled... may be applied to determine whether one party is immune from tort liability....\").</p>\n<p>We recognize that \"[a]n important objective of the [Rhode Island Act] was to curtail litigation by injured employees who elected to take advantage of its expedited procedure for obtaining compensation....\" <i>See </i><i>Sorenson,</i> 650 A.2d at 129. Because Robidoux ended up receiving compensation from a Massachusetts policy, however, honoring the purposes underlying workers' compensation has become primarily an issue of Massachusetts concern. As discussed above, Massachusetts prefers to retain third party liability, and the costs associated with it, in order to allow insurers and injured employees to pursue recovery from responsible third parties, which presumably Massachusetts hopes will decrease workers' compensation premiums and attendant welfare costs. Conversely, Rhode Island has traded the benefits of allowing recovery from special employers in exchange for insulating those special employers from the risks of litigation, presumably in an effort decrease the cost of doing business in the state. Here, applying the Rhode Island Act to an out-of-state resident receiving out-of-state workers' compensation benefits would allow Rhode Island to reap the benefits of this trade-off in a situation where the state would not similarly bear any of the burdens.</p>\n<p>The parties devote considerable space in their briefs to discussing another section 6 factor: their own and each others' expectations about which state's law would govern <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> this type of action. As for Robidoux's expectations, this consideration cuts both ways. On the one hand, Robidoux was a Massachusetts resident, covered by Massachusetts workers' compensation insurance, employed by a Massachusetts company. On the other hand, the entirety of his work for James Construction occurred in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>Turning to the defendants' reasonable expectations, we first note the parties' disagreement about whether the defendants knew that 508 was a Massachusetts area code, knew that Labor Systems was a Massachusetts company, and/or expected Rhode Island law to apply. We need not, however, wade into these factual disputes. Suffice it to say that when James Construction secured the services of a temporary worker by calling a Massachusetts-based company at a phone number with a Massachusetts area code, it lost any justification for expecting that an accident involving that temporary worker would only implicate Rhode Island law. Similarly, Muholland lacked a reasonable expectation that he would only be subject to Rhode Island law by supervising a temporary worker who had told him he was a Massachusetts resident and by signing a work order that suggested that Robidoux was based out of a state other than Rhode Island. Even if we accept that James Construction's demand for a Rhode Island workers' compensation certificate reflected its subjective belief that Rhode Island law would govern any workplace incident, that fact would not alter our conclusion about what expectations were reasonable and justified under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that this action involves substantial contacts with Rhode Island. The injury and injury-causing conduct occurred in Rhode Island, and the parties' relationship was centered in Rhode Island. <i>See</i> Restatement § 145(2). These Rhode Island contacts, however, are simply insufficient to outweigh Massachusetts' superior interests in this case. Moreover, the contacts with Massachusetts are not insubstantial. Of the two states, only Massachusetts can claim a party as a resident or local company, and the Robidoux-James Construction relationship was formed in part by communicationboth between James Construction and Labor Systems, and between Labor Systems and Robidouxto and within Massachusetts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We conclude that Massachusetts law governs the immunity issue in this case and does not bar Robidoux's claims against the defendants. We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Robidoux, noting that this certificate was not received until the day he was injured, asserts that James Construction did not actually require Labor Systems to provide this proof of insurance prior to his injury. Moreover, Robidoux suggests that James Construction only required Labor Systems to provide this certificate because, in addition to Robidoux, Labor Systems also dispatched a Rhode Island resident to work for James Construction.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although the district court did not address this issue, we are free to resolve questions of law in the first instance. <i>See </i><i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628597\"><a href=\"/opinion/628597/62-fair-emplpraccas-1033-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42508-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span>, 1228 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p>[3]  Section 24 provides in part: \"An employee shall be held to have waived his right of action at common law or under the law of any other jurisdiction in respect to an injury that is compensable under this chapter, to recover damages for personal injuries, if he shall not have given his employer ... written notice that he claimed such right....\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 24.\n</p>\n<p>Section 23 reads:</p>\n<p>If an employee files any claim or accepts payment of compensation on account of personal injury under this chapter, or submits to a proceeding before the department under sections ten to twelve, inclusive, such action shall constitute a release to the insurer of all claims or demands at common law, if any, arising from the injury. If an employee accepts payment of compensation under this chapter on account of personal injury or makes an agreement under section forty-eight, such action shall constitute a release to the insured of all claims or demands at common law, if any, arising from the injury.</p>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 23.</p>\n<p>[4]  We are unpersuaded by the defendants' argument that James Construction is protected from this action because it satisfies the Massachusetts Act's definition of \"employer\" and Robidoux was a \"loaned servant\" to James Construction. First, just because the Massachusetts Act's definition of \"employer\" may include a special employer like James Construction, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 1(5), it does not follow that its other requirements for immunityoutlined in sections 15, 23, and 24are meaningless. Nor are we moved by the defendants' reliance on <i>Roberts v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> No. 07-cv-12154, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5156654</span></span> (D.Mass.

In that case, the plaintiff did not question whether the defendant was an \"insured person,\" and the district court did not address this prerequisite for immunity. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Roberts,</i> 599 F.3d at 78 n. 5 (\"[Plaintiff] asserts ... that there is a dispute of fact as to whether Delta was an `insured person liable for payment of compensation' to Roberts such that it was entitled to immunity. Because Roberts did not raise this argument before the district court, it is waived.\" (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>[5]  The SJC has cited one particular commentator, R.A. Leflar, on multiple occasions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bushkin Assocs.,</i> 473 N.E.2d at 670 &amp; n. 7 (quoting R.A. Leflar, American Conflicts Law § 99, at 198 (3d ed.1977)). The SJC has also observed that the factors Leflar urged courts to consider \"generally parallel the considerations contained in longer lists, including § 6(2) of the Second Restatement.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, we find that Leflar's factors are either inapplicable or overlap with the section 6 factors, and we therefore do not discuss them.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Restatement also includes five sections specifically addressing workers' compensation issues. <i>See</i> Restatement §§ 181-85. With the exception of the defendants quoting section 184 in a footnote, neither party advances any argument based on these sections.</p>\n<p>[7]  \"Because some of [the relevant] factors are either redundant or not determinative, we focus on considerations particularly relevant to the case.\" <i>Jasty,</i> 528 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See </i><i>Brown v.
