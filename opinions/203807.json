Francisco A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David C. Indiano, with whom Seth A. Erbe and Indiano &\nWilliams, P.S.C. were on brief, for appellants.\n     David M. Rice, with whom Troy M. Yoshino, Carroll, Burdick &\nMcDonough LLP, Diego A. Ramos, Roberto Camara Fuertes, José L.\nRamírez Coll, and Fiddler, González & Rodriguez, PSC were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           May 6, 2009\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.      This appeal turns on a nuanced\n\nquestion that lurks at the intersection of federal and state law:\n\nDoes an amended complaint that changes the identity of a named\n\ndefendant after the expiration of the applicable limitations period\n\nrelate back to the date of the commencement of the action?             The\n\ndistrict   court,   after   first   concluding   that   the   Puerto   Rico\n\nrelation-back rule controlled the analysis, answered this question\n\nin the negative and jettisoned the action.1             We hold that the\n\nfederal relation-back rule applies; that because the conditions to\n\nthe operation of the federal rule are satisfied, the amendment\n\nrelates back to the date of the commencement of the action; and\n\nthat, therefore, the judgment below must be reversed.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The pertinent facts are largely undisputed.        On November\n\n29, 2004, a 1987 Mercedes-Benz 300SDL parked on an inclined street\n\nin Puerto Rico began rolling downhill and crushed a six-month-old\n\nchild, Johnathan Román Morel.         The infant died that evening.\n\nAlleging that the death resulted from the vehicle's flawed design,\n\nthe decedent's family members repaired to court.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       To be precise, the district court granted partial summary\njudgment in favor of this defendant. The order was for partial\nsummary judgment because one of the plaintiffs, Jean Carlos Román,\nis a minor, as to whom the one-year limitations period has not run.\nSee Cintrón v. Commonwealth, 127 P.R. Dec. 582, 589 (1990). The\ndistrict court did, however, certify the partial judgment for\nimmediate appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                 Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), the\n\nfamily members (whose names and exact relationships are immaterial\n\nhere) commenced their action in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico on November 4, 2005.                         Their\n\ncomplaint alleged a gallimaufry of product liability theories and\n\nnamed       as   a    defendant   \"Daimler-Chrysler,\"     which    the   complaint\n\ndescribed as \"an automobile company incorporated, operated, and\n\nwith its principal place of business in Michigan . . . .\"                     The\n\nplaintiffs served Daimler-Chrysler Corporation (DCC) on December\n\n12, 2005, in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\n                 On February 9, 2006, DCC responded to the complaint by\n\nmoving for summary judgment on the ground that it had never\n\nmanufactured or sold Mercedes-Benz vehicles; and that, therefore,\n\nthe plaintiffs had sued the wrong party.                     DCC noted that a\n\ndifferent entity, Daimler-Benz AG, had manufactured the vehicle\n\ndescribed in the complaint and that DaimlerChrysler AG (DCAG), a\n\nGerman company, was the successor in interest to Daimler-Benz AG.2\n\n                 On   February    16,   2006,   the   plaintiffs   amended   their\n\ncomplaint as of right, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), substituting DCAG\n\n\n\n        2\n       The motion papers explained that, in 1998, a pact between\nChrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz AG had created two legally\ndistinct corporate entities: DCC and DCAG. Under the terms of the\nagreement, Chrysler Corporation became known as DCC and continued\nto manufacture Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep motor vehicles.     DCAG\n(which, in mid-2007, changed its name to Daimler AG) assumed the\nbusiness formerly conducted by Daimler-Benz AG, including\nproprietorship of its Mercedes-Benz line.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fas the party defendant.             DCAG received a copy of the amended\n\ncomplaint on March 6, 2006.            The company was formally served under\n\nthe Hague Convention later that month.\n\n              The newly-designated defendant moved for partial summary\n\njudgment, see supra note 1, asserting that the adult plaintiffs'\n\nclaims were time-barred. The plaintiffs countered that, under Rule\n\n15(c)    of     the   Federal    Rules   of     Civil   Procedure,   the   amended\n\ncomplaint related back to the date of the commencement of the\n\naction and, thus, their suit was timely.\n\n              The district court concluded that a Puerto Rican statute\n\nof limitations conferred substantive rights and that Rule 15(c)\n\ncould     not    be    allowed    to     trump    those   rights.      Morel   v.\n\nDaimlerChrysler AG, No. 05-2162, slip op. at 12 (D.P.R. Jan. 10,\n\n2008) (unpublished).            Instead, the court applied Puerto Rico's\n\nrelation-back rule and determined that the amendment did not relate\n\nback.     Id. at 15 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, R.\n\n13.3).    Accordingly, the court granted DCAG's motion and entered a\n\nfinal (though partial) judgment under Rule 54(b).                    This appeal\n\nensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n              We afford de novo review to a district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment.          See Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La\n\nDiofusión Pública, 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).              Because this is\n\na diversity case featuring an array of tort claims rooted in local\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\flaw, we look to the law of the forum (here, Puerto Rico) for the\n\napplicable statute of limitations. See Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,\n\n326 U.S. 99, 110 (1945).    Under Puerto Rico law, the limitations\n\nperiod for tort claims is one year.         P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\n\n§ 5298.   Since the fatal accident took place on November 29, 2004,\n\nthe limitations period expired on November 29, 2005.\n\n           The plaintiffs sued on November 4, 2005, well within the\n\none-year period.    But that complaint did not mention DCAG.     They\n\nfiled their amended complaint — the first pleading targeting DCAG\n\nas a defendant — on February 16, 2006.           That was after the\n\nexpiration of the one-year period.      Thus, the question reduces to\n\nwhether the amended complaint relates back to the time of filing\n\nthe initial complaint.\n\n           In the first instance, the answer to this question hinges\n\non whether federal or state law furnishes the controlling relation-\n\nback rule.   Consequently, we start there.\n\n           DCAG maintains that Puerto Rico's statute of limitations\n\nis substantive.    See, e.g., Rodriguez Narváez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d\n\n38, 43 (1st Cir. 1990).     Building on that foundation, it reasons\n\nthat because an application of a federal relation-back rule would\n\nallow the plaintiffs to skirt that temporal bar, Puerto Rico's\n\nrelation-back rule must control.       Its argument boils down to the\n\nfollowing construct: if relation back under a federal standard\n\nwould require a party to defend a claim that would otherwise be\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbarred by operation of a substantive state rule, then the state\n\nrule must take precedence.   We do not decide, but accept arguendo,\n\nthat the claim would otherwise be barred by the Puerto Rico rule\n\n(regardless of whether that rule is characterized as substantive or\n\nprocedural).\n\n          This mode of \"outcome determination\" analysis has some\n\nfooting in the Supreme Court's diversity jurisprudence. See, e.g.,\n\nYork, 326 U.S. at 109. But \"'[o]utcome determination' analysis was\n\nnever intended to serve as a talisman.\"   Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S.\n\n460, 466-67 (1965) (citing Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Coop.,\n\n356 U.S. 525, 537 (1958)).\n\n          In fact, the Supreme Court has held that a federal rule\n\ncontrols notwithstanding that an inconsistent state rule would, if\n\napplied, have resulted in a different outcome.      Id. at 463-64.\n\nAlthough Chief Justice Warren acknowledged that a federal court\n\n\"need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes\n\nthe character and result of the federal litigation stray from the\n\ncourse it would follow in state courts,\" id. at 473, he made clear\n\nthat such a Civil Rule ordinarily should take precedence.      His\n\nopinion stated:\n\n          To hold that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n          must cease to function whenever it alters the\n          mode of enforcing state-created rights would\n          be to disembowel either the Constitution's\n          grant of power over federal procedure or\n          Congress' attempt to exercise that power in\n          the [Rules] Enabling Act.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fId. at 473-74 (footnote omitted).\n\n           Hanna held that the \"substance/procedure\" dichotomy,\n\nderived from the decision in Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64\n\n(1938), and York's \"outcome determination\" test do not apply to\n\nmatters covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.         Hanna,\n\n380 U.S. at 466-73.    Rather, as long as a Rule is consonant with\n\nboth the Constitution and the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2072,\n\nthat Rule must be given effect \"regardless of contrary state law.\"\n\nGasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427 n.7\n\n(1996); see also Hoyos v. Telecorp Comm., Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n           In the case at hand, Rule 15(c) is squarely on point.\n\nFor aught that appears, the Rule was properly promulgated and there\n\nis   no   credible   basis   for   impugning   its   constitutionality.\n\nNevertheless, DCAG asseverates that applying Rule 15(c) in the\n\ncircumstances of this case would contravene the Rules Enabling Act,\n\nwhich declares in part that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n\"shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\"       28\n\nU.S.C. § 2072.   We reject that asseveration.\n\n           This language does not preclude the use of Rule 15(c) in\n\nthe instant case.    The test of whether a challenged Rule violates\n\nthe statutory prohibition turns on the characterization of that\n\nRule; if the Rule relates directly to the practice and procedure of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthe district court, it does not violate that section of the\n\nstatute.    See Hanna, 380 U.S. at 464.\n\n            Rule 15(c) is of that genre.       It \"is a truly procedural\n\nrule because it governs the in-court dispute resolution processes\n\nrather than the dispute that brought the parties into court;\n\nconsequently, it does not transgress the Rules Enabling Act.\"\n\nJohansen v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 810 F.2d 1377, 1380 (5th\n\nCir. 1987); accord Brown v. E.W. Bliss Co., 818 F.2d 1405, 1409\n\n(8th Cir. 1987); Santana v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 686 F.2d 736, 740\n\n(9th Cir. 1982).      Indeed, \"no federal court has suggested that\n\n[Rule 15(c)] . . . is beyond the scope of the Rules Enabling Act.\"\n\n6A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1503, at\n\n171 (2d ed. 1990). The commentators' statement, published in 1990,\n\nremains true today.      We decline DCAG's invitation to break ranks\n\nand disregard Rule 15(c)'s quintessentially procedural nature.\n\n            Sound policy considerations support this point of view.\n\nThe federal policy behind the Rules Enabling Act aspires to the\n\ncreation of a system of procedure in the federal courts that is\n\nuniform, comprehensive, and rational.         The desirability of such a\n\nsystem substantially outweighs any countervailing state interest\n\nthat might be served by ceding absolute priority to a conflicting\n\nstate rule.   While application of a federal relation-back rule may\n\ninterfere   with   the   operation   of    state   rules   at   the   margins,\n\n\"[a]pplication of state rules as to relation back would disrupt\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fimportant federal policies favoring simplification and uniformity\n\nof pleading, and liberality of amendment.\"     Welch v. La. Power &\n\nLight Co., 466 F.2d 1344, 1346 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n           Moreover, even though Rule 15(c) is \"intimately connected\n\nwith the policy of the statute of limitations,\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n15(c) advisory committee notes (1966 Amendment), the Rule does not\n\nactually alter state limitations periods.     Under Rule 15(c), the\n\noriginal complaint still must be filed within that state-supplied\n\nlimitations period.   So viewed, \"[t]he state's underlying interest\n\n. . . in protecting persons against stale claims is adequately\n\nprotected by the practical notice requirements built into Rule\n\n15(c).\" Davis v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 615 F.2d 606, 612 (4th Cir.\n\n1980); see 19 Wright et al., supra § 4509, at 273-75.\n\n           The conclusion that Rule 15(c) applies in a diversity\n\ncase notwithstanding the incidence of a more restrictive state rule\n\nis implicit in our own precedent.     See Leonard v. Parry, 219 F.3d\n\n25, 28 (1st Cir. 2000); Freund v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc., 956 F.2d\n\n354, 362 (1st Cir. 1992) (Breyer, C.J.).    What is implied in these\n\ndecisions is explicit in the holdings of many other courts of\n\nappeals.   See, e.g., Simmons v. S. Cent. Skyworker's, Inc., 936\n\nF.2d 268, 270 (6th Cir. 1991); Johansen, 810 F.2d at 1380; Santana,\n\n686 F.2d at 740; Davis, 615 F.2d at 611-12; Ingram v. Kumar, 585\n\nF.2d 566, 570 n.5 (2d Cir. 1978); Loudenslager v. Teeple, 466 F.2d\n\n249, 250 (3d Cir. 1972); Crowder v. Gordons Transps., Inc., 387\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fF.2d 413, 416-17 (8th Cir. 1967).              We join the ranks of those\n\ncourts.\n\n             One other matter requires our attention.          In support of\n\nits position that state law controls, DCAG cites Marshall v.\n\nMulrenin, 508 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1974).           There, we stated that Rule\n\n15(c) \"is not to be applied to the extent, if any, that it would\n\ndefeat rights arising from state substantive law as distinguished\n\nfrom state procedure.\"       Id. at 44.       But context is important; in\n\nMarshall, the situation was the obverse of the situation here (that\n\nis, the state rule was more generous than the federal rule).               Id.\n\nat 41. In that circumstance, we applied the less restrictive state\n\nrule.     Id. at 44-45.     Thus, Marshall can be squared with Hanna\n\nbecause \"state and federal law do not directly conflict when state\n\nlaw is less restrictive and adhering to state law may be consistent\n\nwith the general purposes of Rule 15.\"             6A Wright et al., supra\n\n§ 1503, at 175.\n\n             At any rate, any questions either about this distinction\n\nor   about   the    correctness   of   the    Marshall   decision   have   been\n\nrendered moot by a 1991 amendment to Rule 15, which explicitly\n\ndictates relation back if \"the law that provides the applicable\n\nstatute of limitations allows relation back.\"               Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n15(c)(1)(A).       This subsection was designed to \"make it clear that\n\nthe rule does not apply to preclude any relation back that may be\n\npermitted under the applicable limitations law.\"             Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f15 advisory committee notes (1991 Amendment).                 The provision\n\ncements   in   place    a   one-way   ratchet;    less   restrictive      state\n\nrelation-back rules will displace federal relation-back rules, but\n\nmore restrictive state relation-back rules will not.\n\n           To say more on this point would be supererogatory.              For\n\nthese reasons, we hold that federal relation-back rules apply here.\n\nStill, that determination does not end our inquiry.             The question\n\nremains whether these rules allow relation back of the plaintiffs'\n\namended complaint.\n\n           Rule 15(c)(1)(C) limns three conditions,3 each of which\n\nmust be satisfied in order to permit relation back of an amended\n\ncomplaint seeking to substitute a newly-designated defendant.              See\n\nLeonard, 219 F.3d at 28.        First, the claim asserted against the\n\nnewly-designated       defendant   must      satisfy   the   terms   of   Rule\n\n15(c)(1)(B), which provides that the claim must arise \"out of the\n\nconduct, transaction, or occurrence set out — or attempted to be\n\nset out — in the original pleading.\"            Second, \"within the period\n\nprovided by [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 4(m) for serving the\n\nsummons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment\"\n\nmust have \"received such notice of the action that it will not be\n\n\n\n     3\n       Although Rule 15(c) was amended in 2007, the changes were\n\"intended to be stylistic only.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory\ncommittee notes (2007 Amendment). The various sub-parts of the\nRule were rearranged and renumbered but for present purposes the\nRule's substance and operation are unchanged.       For ease in\nexposition, we therefore refer to the present, revised version.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fprejudiced    in   defending   on     the   merits.\"     Fed.    R.   Civ.    P.\n\n15(c)(1)(C)(i).     Third, it must appear that within the same time\n\nframe the newly-designated defendant either \"knew or should have\n\nknown that the action would have been brought against it, but for\n\na mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii).\n\n            The first of these conditions is clearly satisfied here.\n\nThe claim asserted against DCAG unarguably arises out of the\n\noccurrence described in the original complaint.\n\n            The second condition involves notice.         That notice need\n\nnot   be   manifested   by   formal    service   of    process   within      the\n\nprescribed period.      Rather, notice must simply be such that the\n\ndefendant \"will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C)(i).             At a minimum, though, notice\n\nrequires knowledge of the filing of suit, not simply knowledge of\n\nthe incident giving rise to the cause of action.          Singletary v. Pa.\n\nDep't of Corr., 266 F.3d 186, 195 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n            The notice that was communicated here plainly satisfied\n\nthese criteria.     DCAG received a letter, attaching a copy of the\n\namended complaint, on March 6, 2006.         That transmittal informed it\n\nnot only of the nature of the claims but also of the pendency of\n\nthe suit.     The only nagging question is whether the notice was\n\ntimely under the terms of Rule 15(c)(1)(C), which requires that the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdefendant receive notice within the time allotted for service of\n\nprocess under Rule 4(m).\n\n            The    plaintiffs       argue         that   the     120-day    time      limit\n\nprescribed in Rule 4(m) does not apply in this case because Rule\n\n4(m) does not pertain to service of process in a foreign country;\n\ninstead, Rule 4(f) — which specifies no particular time limit —\n\napplies.    Regardless of what uncertainty surrounds the amount of\n\ntime   afforded    for    service        of   a    foreign     corporation       in   such\n\ncircumstances, it is logical that Rule 15(c)(1)(C) would afford no\n\nless time for the giving of notice in cases involving foreign\n\ncorporations than it would in the ordinary case to which Rule 4(m)\n\napplies. And here, DCAG received notice within the 120-day period.\n\n            To recapitulate briefly, the chronology is as follows.\n\nThe plaintiffs commenced the action on November 4, 2005.                         Because\n\nthe day of filing is excluded from the ensuing computation of time,\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1), the 120-day period began to run on\n\nNovember 5, 2005.           Measured from that date, the one-hundred-\n\ntwentieth day was Saturday, March 4, 2006.                     Both that day and the\n\nnext (Sunday, March 5) were excluded from the computation.                              See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(3).          Thus, the last day of the 120-day period\n\nwas    Monday,    March   6   —    the    day      on    which    the    aforementioned\n\ntransmittal      arrived.         This    time      line   shows        beyond   hope    of\n\ncontradiction that DCAG received notice of the action within the\n\nallotted period.\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f             This brings us to the third condition: knowledge of a\n\nmistake in identity.         To satisfy this condition, the plaintiffs\n\nmust show both that they made a mistake about the actual identity\n\nof the proper defendant and that, within the prescribed time, that\n\nparty knew or should have known that, but for the mistake, it would\n\nhave been sued.      See Leonard, 219 F.3d at 28.\n\n             It is obvious from the face of the original complaint\n\nthat   the    plaintiffs    intended    to    sue    the    manufacturer   of   the\n\nallegedly defective automobile.          For aught that appears, they made\n\na mistake concerning the manufacturer's identity.                  See generally\n\nWebster's Third New Int'l Dict. 1446 (1993) (defining \"mistake\" as\n\n\"a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment,\n\ninadequate knowledge, or inattention\").              But for this bevue, they\n\nwould have sued DCAG, not DCC.           Thus, when DCAG (which knew full\n\nwell   of    its   legal   responsibility      for    the    manufacture   of   the\n\nvehicle) received notice of the action, it must have known (or, at\n\nleast, should have known) that the action would have been brought\n\nagainst it in the first place but for the plaintiffs' mistake.\n\nConsequently, the final condition precedent to the operation of\n\nRule 15(c) was satisfied.\n\n             DCAG attempts to parry this thrust by suggesting that the\n\nplaintiffs might intentionally have \"sued 'Daimler-Chrysler' by an\n\nambiguous name and served the complaint in Michigan in the hopes\n\nthat [DCAG] would respond and thereby obviate the need for the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fcostly and often time-consuming requirements of Hague Convention\n\nservice.\" Appellee's Br. at 32. We find this suggestion fanciful.\n\n               The summary judgment record contains nothing that would\n\nsupport this suggestion (indeed, there is no indication that DCAG\n\nmade this argument below).          What we do find — for example, the\n\nassertion by plaintiffs' counsel that \"Daimler-Chrysler\" was named\n\nbecause the corporate website did not distinguish between DCC and\n\nDCAG — points in the opposite direction.\n\n               Litigation should not be reduced to a game of cat and\n\nmouse. In the last analysis, it seems highly improbable that, with\n\nthe limitations period about to expire, the plaintiffs, represented\n\nby seasoned counsel, would have made such a risky strategic choice.\n\nOn this record, the only reasonable inference is that a mistake was\n\nmade.4\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.       In this instance, Rule 15(c)\n\ncontrols. Because the plaintiffs have satisfied all the conditions\n\nfor    the     application   of   that   Rule,   their   amended   complaint\n\ndesignating DCAG as a party defendant relates back to the date of\n\nthe commencement of the action.5         It follows inexorably, as night\n\n\n       4\n       This inference is reinforced by the fact that, once the\nplaintiffs learned of their error, they had no difficulty in\nserving DCAG under the Hague Convention.\n       5\n       The plaintiffs have argued in the alternative that the\nbelated identification of DCAG can be justified as the correction\nof a misnomer. See, e.g., United States v. Davis, 261 F.3d 1, 33\n\n                                     -15-\n\ffollows day, that the action against DCAG was timely and that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting partial summary judgment.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\nn.25 (1st Cir. 2001).   We do not reach that argument.\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

The district court, after first concluding that the Puerto Rico relation-back rule controlled the analysis, answered this question in the negative and jettisoned the action.<sup>[1]</sup> We hold that the federal relation-back rule applies; that because the conditions to the operation of the federal rule are satisfied, the amendment relates back to the date of the commencement of the action; and that, therefore, the judgment below must be reversed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The pertinent facts are largely undisputed. On November 29, 2004, a 1987 Mercedes-Benz 300SDL parked on an inclined street in Puerto Rico began rolling downhill and crushed a six-month-old child, Johnathan Román Morel. The infant died that evening. Alleging that the death resulted from the vehicle's flawed design, the decedent's family members repaired to court.</p>\n<p>Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), the family members (whose names and exact relationships are immaterial here) commenced their action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on November 4, 2005. Their complaint alleged a gallimaufry of product liability theories and named as a defendant \"Daimler-Chrysler,\" which the complaint described as \"an automobile company incorporated, operated, and with its principal place of business in Michigan....\" The plaintiffs served Daimler-Chrysler Corporation (DCC) on December 12, 2005, in Auburn Hills, Michigan.</p>\n<p>On February 9, 2006, DCC responded to the complaint by moving for summary judgment on the ground that it had never manufactured or sold Mercedes-Benz vehicles; and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had sued the wrong party. DCC noted that a different entity, Daimler-Benz AG, had manufactured the vehicle described in the complaint and that DaimlerChrysler AG (DCAG), a German company, was the successor in interest to Daimler-Benz AG.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> On February 16, 2006, the plaintiffs amended their complaint as of right, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), substituting DCAG as the party defendant. DCAG received a copy of the amended complaint on March 6, 2006. The company was formally served under the Hague Convention later that month.</p>\n<p>The newly-designated defendant moved for partial summary judgment, <i>see supra</i> note 1, asserting that the adult plaintiffs' claims were time-barred. The plaintiffs countered that, under Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the amended complaint related back to the date of the commencement of the action and, thus, their suit was timely.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that a Puerto Rican statute of limitations conferred substantive rights and that Rule 15(c) could not be allowed to trump those rights. <i>Morel v. Daimler Chrysler AG,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d 240, 246 (D.P.R.2008) (unpublished). Instead, the court applied Puerto Rico's relation-back rule and determined that the amendment did not relate back. <i>Id.</i> at 247 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, R. 13.3). Accordingly, the court granted DCAG's motion and entered a final (though partial) judgment under Rule 54(b). This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We afford de novo review to a district court's entry of summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La Diofusión Pública,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007). Because this is a diversity case featuring an array of tort claims rooted in local law, we look to the law of the forum (here, Puerto Rico) for the applicable statute of limitations. <i>See </i><i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,</i> 326 U.S. 99, 110, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945). Under Puerto Rico law, the limitations period for tort claims is one year. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5298. Since the fatal accident took place on November 29, 2004, the limitations period expired on November 29, 2005.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs sued on November 4, 2005, well within the one-year period. But that complaint did not mention DCAG. They filed their amended complaintthe first pleading targeting DCAG as a defendant on February 16, 2006. That was after the expiration of the one-year period. Thus, the question reduces to whether the amended complaint relates back to the time of filing the initial complaint.</p>\n<p>In the first instance, the answer to this question hinges on whether federal or state law furnishes the controlling relation-back rule. Consequently, we start there.</p>\n<p>DCAG maintains that Puerto Rico's statute of limitations is substantive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rodriguez Narváez v. Nazario,</i> 895 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.1990). Building on that foundation, it reasons that because an application of a federal relation-back rule would allow the plaintiffs to skirt that temporal bar, Puerto Rico's relation-back rule must control. Its argument boils down to the following construct: if relation back under a federal standard would require a party to defend a claim that would otherwise be barred by operation of a substantive state rule, then the state rule must take precedence. We do not decide, but accept arguendo, that the claim would otherwise be barred by the Puerto Rico rule (regardless of whether that rule is characterized as substantive or procedural).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> This mode of \"outcome determination\" analysis has some footing in the Supreme Court's diversity jurisprudence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>York,</i> 326 U.S. at 109, 65 S.Ct. 1464. But \"`[o]utcome determination' analysis was never intended to serve as a talisman.\" <i>Hanna v. Plumer,</i> 380 U.S. 460, 466-67, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965) (citing <i>Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Coop.,</i> 356 U.S. 525, 537, 78 S.Ct. 893, 2 L.Ed.2d 953 (1958)).</p>\n<p>In fact, the Supreme Court has held that a federal rule controls notwithstanding that an inconsistent state rule would, if applied, have resulted in a different outcome. <i>Id.</i> at 463-64, 85 S.Ct. 1136. Although Chief Justice Warren acknowledged that a federal court \"need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts,\" <i>id.</i> at 473, 85 S.Ct. 1136, he made clear that such a Civil Rule ordinarily should take precedence. His opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote>To hold that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure must cease to function whenever it alters the mode of enforcing state-created rights would be to disembowel either the Constitution's grant of power over federal procedure or Congress' attempt to exercise that power in the [Rules] Enabling Act.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 473-74, 85 S.Ct. 1136 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p><i>Hanna</i> held that the \"substance/procedure\" dichotomy, derived from the decision in <i>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), and <i>York</i>'s \"outcome determination\" test do not apply to matters covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <i>Hanna,</i> 380 U.S. at 466-73, 85 S.Ct. 1136. Rather, as long as a Rule is consonant with both the Constitution and the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2072, that Rule must be given effect \"regardless of contrary state law.\" <i>Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 415, 427 n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996); <i>see also </i><i>Hoyos v. Telecorp Comm., Inc.,</i> 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, Rule 15(c) is squarely on point. For aught that appears, the Rule was properly promulgated and there is no credible basis for impugning its constitutionality. Nevertheless, DCAG asseverates that applying Rule 15(c) in the circumstances of this case would contravene the Rules Enabling Act, which declares in part that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \"shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2072. We reject that asseveration.</p>\n<p>This language does not preclude the use of Rule 15(c) in the instant case. The test of whether a challenged Rule violates the statutory prohibition turns on the characterization of that Rule; if the Rule relates directly to the practice and procedure of the district court, it does not violate that section of the statute. <i>See </i><i>Hanna,</i> 380 U.S. at 464, 85 S.Ct. 1136.</p>\n<p>Rule 15(c) is of that genre. It \"is a truly procedural rule because it governs the in-court dispute resolution processes rather than the dispute that brought the parties into court; consequently, it does not transgress the Rules Enabling Act.\" <i>Johansen v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 810 F.2d 1377, 1380 (5th Cir.1987); <i>accord </i><i>Brown v. E.W. Bliss Co.,</i> 818 F.2d 1405, 1409 (8th Cir.1987); <i>Santana v. Holiday Inns, Inc.,</i> 686 F.2d 736, 740 (9th Cir.1982). Indeed, \"no federal court has suggested that [Rule 15(c)] ... is beyond the scope of the Rules Enabling Act.\" 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 1503, at 171 (2d ed.1990). The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> commentators' statement, published in 1990, remains true today. We decline DCAG's invitation to break ranks and disregard Rule 15(c)'s quintessentially procedural nature.</p>\n<p>Sound policy considerations support this point of view. The federal policy behind the Rules Enabling Act aspires to the creation of a system of procedure in the federal courts that is uniform, comprehensive, and rational. The desirability of such a system substantially outweighs any countervailing state interest that might be served by ceding absolute priority to a conflicting state rule. While application of a federal relation-back rule may interfere with the operation of state rules at the margins, \"[a]pplication of state rules as to relation back would disrupt important federal policies favoring simplification and uniformity of pleading, and liberality of amendment.\" <i>Welch v. La. Power &amp; Light Co.,</i> 466 F.2d 1344, 1346 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p>Moreover, even though Rule 15(c) is \"intimately connected with the policy of the statute of limitations,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c) advisory committee notes (1966 Amendment), the Rule does not actually alter state limitations periods. Under Rule 15(c), the original complaint still must be filed within that state-supplied limitations period. So viewed, \"[t]he state's underlying interest ... in protecting persons against stale claims is adequately protected by the practical notice requirements built into Rule 15(c).\" <i>Davis v. Piper Aircraft Corp.,</i> 615 F.2d 606, 612 (4th Cir. 1980); <i>see</i> 19 Wright et al., <i>supra</i> § 4509, at 273-75.</p>\n<p>The conclusion that Rule 15(c) applies in a diversity case notwithstanding the incidence of a more restrictive state rule is implicit in our own precedent. <i>See </i><i>Leonard v. Parry,</i> 219 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>Freund v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc.,</i> 956 F.2d 354, 362 (1st Cir.1992) (Breyer, C.J.). What is implied in these decisions is explicit in the holdings of many other courts of appeals. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Simmons v. S. Cent. Skyworker's, Inc.,</i> 936 F.2d 268, 270 (6th Cir.1991); <i>Johansen,</i> 810 F.2d at 1380; <i>Santana,</i> 686 F.2d at 740; <i>Davis,</i> 615 F.2d at 611-12; <i>Ingram v. Kumar,</i> 585 F.2d 566, 570 n. 5 (2d Cir.1978); <i>Loudenslager v. Teeple,</i> 466 F.2d 249, 250 (3d Cir.1972); <i>Crowder v. Gordons Transports, Inc.,</i> 387 F.2d 413, 416-17 (8th Cir. 1967). We join the ranks of those courts.</p>\n<p>One other matter requires our attention. In support of its position that state law controls, DCAG cites <i>Marshall v. Mulrenin,</i> 508 F.2d 39 (1st Cir.1974). There, we stated that Rule 15(c) \"is not to be applied to the extent, if any, that it would defeat rights arising from state substantive law as distinguished from state procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 44. But context is important; in <i>Marshall,</i> the situation was the obverse of the situation here (that is, the state rule was more generous than the federal rule). <i>Id.</i> at 41. In that circumstance, we applied the less restrictive state rule. <i>Id.</i> at 44-45. Thus, <i>Marshall</i> can be squared with <i>Hanna</i> because \"state and federal law do not directly conflict when state law is less restrictive and adhering to state law may be consistent with the general purposes of Rule 15.\" 6A Wright et al., <i>supra</i> § 1503, at 175.</p>\n<p>At any rate, any questions either about this distinction or about the correctness of the <i>Marshall</i> decision have been rendered moot by a 1991 amendment to Rule 15, which explicitly dictates relation back if \"the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(A). This subsection was designed to \"make it clear that the rule does not apply to preclude any relation back that may be permitted under the applicable limitations law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15 advisory committee notes (1991 Amendment). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> The provision cements in place a one-way ratchet; less restrictive state relation-back rules will displace federal relation-back rules, but more restrictive state relation-back rules will not.</p>\n<p>To say more on this point would be supererogatory. For these reasons, we hold that federal relation-back rules apply here. Still, that determination does not end our inquiry. The question remains whether these rules allow relation back of the plaintiffs' amended complaint.</p>\n<p>Rule 15(c)(1)(C) limns three conditions,<sup>[3]</sup> each of which must be satisfied in order to permit relation back of an amended complaint seeking to substitute a newly-designated defendant. <i>See </i><i>Leonard,</i> 219 F.3d at 28. First, the claim asserted against the newly-designated defendant must satisfy the terms of Rule 15(c)(1)(B), which provides that the claim must arise \"out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set outor attempted to be set out-in the original pleading.\" Second, \"within the period provided by [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment\" must have \"received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Third, it must appear that within the same time frame the newly-designated defendant either \"knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p>The first of these conditions is clearly satisfied here. The claim asserted against DCAG unarguably arises out of the occurrence described in the original complaint.</p>\n<p>The second condition involves notice. That notice need not be manifested by formal service of process within the prescribed period. Rather, notice must simply be such that the defendant \"will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C)(i). At a minimum, though, notice requires knowledge of the filing of suit, not simply knowledge of the incident giving rise to the cause of action. <i>Singletary v. Pa. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 266 F.3d 186, 195 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The notice that was communicated here plainly satisfied these criteria. DCAG received a letter, attaching a copy of the amended complaint, on March 6, 2006. That transmittal informed it not only of the nature of the claims but also of the pendency of the suit. The only nagging question is whether the notice was timely under the terms of Rule 15(c)(1)(C), which requires that the defendant receive notice within the time allotted for service of process under Rule 4(m).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that the 120-day time limit prescribed in Rule 4(m) does not apply in this case because Rule 4(m) does not pertain to service of process in a foreign country; instead, Rule 4(f)which specifies no particular time limitapplies. Regardless of what uncertainty surrounds the amount of time afforded for service of a foreign corporation in such circumstances, it is logical that Rule 15(c)(1)(C) would afford no less time for the giving of notice in cases involving foreign corporations than it would in the ordinary case to which Rule 4(m) applies. And here, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> DCAG received notice within the 120-day period.</p>\n<p>To recapitulate briefly, the chronology is as follows. The plaintiffs commenced the action on November 4, 2005. Because the day of filing is excluded from the ensuing computation of time, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a)(1), the 120-day period began to run on November 5, 2005. Measured from that date, the one-hundred-twentieth day was Saturday, March 4, 2006. Both that day and the next (Sunday, March 5) were excluded from the computation. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(a)(3). Thus, the last day of the 120-day period was Monday, March 6 the day on which the aforementioned transmittal arrived. This time line shows beyond hope of contradiction that DCAG received notice of the action within the allotted period.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the third condition: knowledge of a mistake in identity. To satisfy this condition, the plaintiffs must show both that they made a mistake about the actual identity of the proper defendant and that, within the prescribed time, that party knew or should have known that, but for the mistake, it would have been sued. <i>See </i><i>Leonard,</i> 219 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>It is obvious from the face of the original complaint that the plaintiffs intended to sue the manufacturer of the allegedly defective automobile. For aught that appears, they made a mistake concerning the manufacturer's identity. <i>See generally Webster's Third New Int'l Dict.</i> 1446 (1993) (defining \"mistake\" as \"a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention\"). But for this bevue, they would have sued DCAG, not DCC. Thus, when DCAG (which knew full well of its legal responsibility for the manufacture of the vehicle) received notice of the action, it must have known (or, at least, should have known) that the action would have been brought against it in the first place but for the plaintiffs' mistake. Consequently, the final condition precedent to the operation of Rule 15(c) was satisfied.</p>\n<p>DCAG attempts to parry this thrust by suggesting that the plaintiffs might intentionally have \"sued `Daimler-Chrysler' by an ambiguous name and served the complaint in Michigan in the hopes that [DCAG] would respond and thereby obviate the need for the costly and often time-consuming requirements of Hague Convention service.\" Appellee's Br. at 32. We find this suggestion fanciful.</p>\n<p>The summary judgment record contains nothing that would support this suggestion (indeed, there is no indication that DCAG made this argument below). What we do findfor example, the assertion by plaintiffs' counsel that \"Daimler-Chrysler\" was named because the corporate website did not distinguish between DCC and DCAGpoints in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Litigation should not be reduced to a game of cat and mouse. In the last analysis, it seems highly improbable that, with the limitations period about to expire, the plaintiffs, represented by seasoned counsel, would have made such a risky strategic choice. On this record, the only reasonable inference is that a mistake was made.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. In this instance, Rule 15(c) controls. Because the plaintiffs have satisfied all the conditions for the application of that Rule, their amended complaint designating DCAG as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> a party defendant relates back to the date of the commencement of the action.<sup>[5]</sup> It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the action against DCAG was timely and that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  To be precise, the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of this defendant. The order was for partial summary judgment because one of the plaintiffs, Jean Carlos Román, is a minor, as to whom the one-year limitations period has not run. <i>See </i><i>Cintrón v. Estado Libre Asociado,</i> 127 D.P.R. 582, 589 (1990). The district court did, however, certify the partial judgment for immediate appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).</p>\n<p>[2]  The motion papers explained that, in 1998, a pact between Chrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz AG had created two legally distinct corporate entities: DCC and DCAG. Under the terms of the agreement, Chrysler Corporation became known as DCC and continued to manufacture Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep motor vehicles. DCAG (which, in mid-2007, changed its name to Daimler AG) assumed the business formerly conducted by Daimler-Benz AG, including proprietorship of its Mercedes-Benz line.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although Rule 15(c) was amended in 2007, the changes were \"intended to be stylistic only.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15 advisory committee notes (2007 Amendment). The various sub-parts of the Rule were rearranged and renumbered but for present purposes the Rule's substance and operation are unchanged. For ease in exposition, we therefore refer to the present, revised version.</p>\n<p>[4]  This inference is reinforced by the fact that, once the plaintiffs learned of their error, they had no difficulty in serving DCAG under the Hague Convention.</p>\n<p>[5]  The plaintiffs have argued in the alternative that the belated identification of DCAG can be justified as the correction of a misnomer. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Davis,</i> 261 F.3d 1, 33 n. 25 (1st Cir.2001). We do not reach that argument.</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court, after first concluding that the Puerto Rico relation-back rule controlled the analysis, answered this question in the negative and jettisoned the action.<sup>[1]</sup> We hold that the federal relation-back rule applies; that because the conditions to the operation of the federal rule are satisfied, the amendment relates back to the date of the commencement of the action; and that, therefore, the judgment below must be reversed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The pertinent facts are largely undisputed. On November 29, 2004, a 1987 Mercedes-Benz 300SDL parked on an inclined street in Puerto Rico began rolling downhill and crushed a six-month-old child, Johnathan Román Morel. The infant died that evening. Alleging that the death resulted from the vehicle's flawed design, the decedent's family members repaired to court.</p>\n<p>Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), the family members (whose names and exact relationships are immaterial here) commenced their action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico on November 4, 2005. Their complaint alleged a gallimaufry of product liability theories and named as a defendant \"Daimler-Chrysler,\" which the complaint described as \"an automobile company incorporated, operated, and with its principal place of business in Michigan....\" The plaintiffs served Daimler-Chrysler Corporation (DCC) on December 12, 2005, in Auburn Hills, Michigan.</p>\n<p>On February 9, 2006, DCC responded to the complaint by moving for summary judgment on the ground that it had never manufactured or sold Mercedes-Benz vehicles; and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had sued the wrong party. DCC noted that a different entity, Daimler-Benz AG, had manufactured the vehicle described in the complaint and that DaimlerChrysler AG (DCAG), a German company, was the successor in interest to Daimler-Benz AG.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> On February 16, 2006, the plaintiffs amended their complaint as of right, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), substituting DCAG as the party defendant. DCAG received a copy of the amended complaint on March 6, 2006. The company was formally served under the Hague Convention later that month.</p>\n<p>The newly-designated defendant moved for partial summary judgment, <i>see supra</i> note 1, asserting that the adult plaintiffs' claims were time-barred. The plaintiffs countered that, under Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the amended complaint related back to the date of the commencement of the action and, thus, their suit was timely.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that a Puerto Rican statute of limitations conferred substantive rights and that Rule 15(c) could not be allowed to trump those rights. <i>Morel v. Daimler Chrysler AG,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239156\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239156/morel-v-daimler-chrysler-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 246 (D.P.R.2008) (unpublished). Instead, the court applied Puerto Rico's relation-back rule and determined that the amendment did not relate back. <i>Id.</i> at 247 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, R. 13.3). Accordingly, the court granted DCAG's motion and entered a final (though partial) judgment under Rule 54(b). This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We afford de novo review to a district court's entry of summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La Diofusión Pública,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202880\"><a href=\"/opinion/202880/davila-v-corporacion-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2007). Because this is a diversity case featuring an array of tort claims rooted in local law, we look to the law of the forum (here, Puerto Rico) for the applicable statute of limitations. <i>See </i><i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116658/guaranty-trust-co-v-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 110, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1464</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">2079</span></span> (1945). Under Puerto Rico law, the limitations period for tort claims is one year. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5298. Since the fatal accident took place on November 29, 2004, the limitations period expired on November 29, 2005.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs sued on November 4, 2005, well within the one-year period. But that complaint did not mention DCAG. They filed their amended complaintthe first pleading targeting DCAG as a defendant on February 16, 2006. That was after the expiration of the one-year period. Thus, the question reduces to whether the amended complaint relates back to the time of filing the initial complaint.</p>\n<p>In the first instance, the answer to this question hinges on whether federal or state law furnishes the controlling relation-back rule. Consequently, we start there.</p>\n<p>DCAG maintains that Puerto Rico's statute of limitations is substantive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rodriguez Narváez v. Nazario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536032\"><a href=\"/opinion/536032/alicia-rodriguez-narvaez-v-ariel-nazario-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1990). Building on that foundation, it reasons that because an application of a federal relation-back rule would allow the plaintiffs to skirt that temporal bar, Puerto Rico's relation-back rule must control. Its argument boils down to the following construct: if relation back under a federal standard would require a party to defend a claim that would otherwise be barred by operation of a substantive state rule, then the state rule must take precedence. We do not decide, but accept arguendo, that the claim would otherwise be barred by the Puerto Rico rule (regardless of whether that rule is characterized as substantive or procedural).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> This mode of \"outcome determination\" analysis has some footing in the Supreme Court's diversity jurisprudence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>York,</i> 326 U.S. at 109, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1464</span></span>. But \"`[o]utcome determination' analysis was never intended to serve as a talisman.\" <i>Hanna v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span> (1958)).</p>\n<p>In fact, the Supreme Court has held that a federal rule controls notwithstanding that an inconsistent state rule would, if applied, have resulted in a different outcome. <i>Id.</i> at 463-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107024\"><a href=\"/opinion/107024/hanna-v-plumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For aught that appears, the Rule was properly promulgated and there is no credible basis for impugning its constitutionality. Nevertheless, DCAG asseverates that applying Rule 15(c) in the circumstances of this case would contravene the Rules Enabling Act, which declares in part that a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \"shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2072. We reject that asseveration.</p>\n<p>This language does not preclude the use of Rule 15(c) in the instant case. The test of whether a challenged Rule violates the statutory prohibition turns on the characterization of that Rule; if the Rule relates directly to the practice and procedure of the district court, it does not violate that section of the statute. <i>See </i><i>Hanna,</i> 380 U.S. at 464, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107024\"><a href=\"/opinion/107024/hanna-v-plumer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, \"no federal court has suggested that [Rule 15(c)] ... is beyond the scope of the Rules Enabling Act.\" 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 1503, at 171 (2d ed.1990). The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> commentators' statement, published in 1990, remains true today. We decline DCAG's invitation to break ranks and disregard Rule 15(c)'s quintessentially procedural nature.</p>\n<p>Sound policy considerations support this point of view. The federal policy behind the Rules Enabling Act aspires to the creation of a system of procedure in the federal courts that is uniform, comprehensive, and rational. The desirability of such a system substantially outweighs any countervailing state interest that might be served by ceding absolute priority to a conflicting state rule. While application of a federal relation-back rule may interfere with the operation of state rules at the margins, \"[a]pplication of state rules as to relation back would disrupt important federal policies favoring simplification and uniformity of pleading, and liberality of amendment.\" <i>Welch v.

Under Rule 15(c), the original complaint still must be filed within that state-supplied limitations period. So viewed, \"[t]he state's underlying interest ... in protecting persons against stale claims is adequately protected by the practical notice requirements built into Rule 15(c).\" <i>Davis v.

We join the ranks of those courts.</p>\n<p>One other matter requires our attention. In support of its position that state law controls, DCAG cites <i>Marshall v. Mulrenin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324009\"><a href=\"/opinion/324009/margaret-marshall-v-george-j-mulrenin/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1974). There, we stated that Rule 15(c) \"is not to be applied to the extent, if any, that it would defeat rights arising from state substantive law as distinguished from state procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 44. But context is important; in <i>Marshall,</i> the situation was the obverse of the situation here (that is, the state rule was more generous than the federal rule). <i>Id.</i> at 41. In that circumstance, we applied the less restrictive state rule. <i>Id.</i> at 44-45. Thus, <i>Marshall</i> can be squared with <i>Hanna</i> because \"state and federal law do not directly conflict when state law is less restrictive and adhering to state law may be consistent with the general purposes of Rule 15.\" 6A Wright et al., <i>supra</i> § 1503, at 175.</p>\n<p>At any rate, any questions either about this distinction or about the correctness of the <i>Marshall</i> decision have been rendered moot by a 1991 amendment to Rule 15, which explicitly dictates relation back if \"the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(A). This subsection was designed to \"make it clear that the rule does not apply to preclude any relation back that may be permitted under the applicable limitations law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15 advisory committee notes (1991 Amendment). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> The provision cements in place a one-way ratchet; less restrictive state relation-back rules will displace federal relation-back rules, but more restrictive state relation-back rules will not.</p>\n<p>To say more on this point would be supererogatory. For these reasons, we hold that federal relation-back rules apply here. Still, that determination does not end our inquiry. The question remains whether these rules allow relation back of the plaintiffs' amended complaint.</p>\n<p>Rule 15(c)(1)(C) limns three conditions,<sup>[3]</sup> each of which must be satisfied in order to permit relation back of an amended complaint seeking to substitute a newly-designated defendant. <i>See </i><i>Leonard,</i> 219 F.3d at 28. First, the claim asserted against the newly-designated defendant must satisfy the terms of Rule 15(c)(1)(B), which provides that the claim must arise \"out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set outor attempted to be set out-in the original pleading.\" Second, \"within the period provided by [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment\" must have \"received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Third, it must appear that within the same time frame the newly-designated defendant either \"knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p>The first of these conditions is clearly satisfied here. The claim asserted against DCAG unarguably arises out of the occurrence described in the original complaint.</p>\n<p>The second condition involves notice. That notice need not be manifested by formal service of process within the prescribed period. Rather, notice must simply be such that the defendant \"will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C)(i). At a minimum, though, notice requires knowledge of the filing of suit, not simply knowledge of the incident giving rise to the cause of action. <i>Singletary v. Pa. Dep't of Corr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774998\"><a href=\"/opinion/774998/dorothy-singletary-individually-and-as-administrator-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 195 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The notice that was communicated here plainly satisfied these criteria. DCAG received a letter, attaching a copy of the amended complaint, on March 6, 2006. That transmittal informed it not only of the nature of the claims but also of the pendency of the suit. The only nagging question is whether the notice was timely under the terms of Rule 15(c)(1)(C), which requires that the defendant receive notice within the time allotted for service of process under Rule 4(m).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that the 120-day time limit prescribed in Rule 4(m) does not apply in this case because Rule 4(m) does not pertain to service of process in a foreign country; instead, Rule 4(f)which specifies no particular time limitapplies. Regardless of what uncertainty surrounds the amount of time afforded for service of a foreign corporation in such circumstances, it is logical that Rule 15(c)(1)(C) would afford no less time for the giving of notice in cases involving foreign corporations than it would in the ordinary case to which Rule 4(m) applies. And here, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> DCAG received notice within the 120-day period.</p>\n<p>To recapitulate briefly, the chronology is as follows. The plaintiffs commenced the action on November 4, 2005. Because the day of filing is excluded from the ensuing computation of time, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a)(1), the 120-day period began to run on November 5, 2005. Measured from that date, the one-hundred-twentieth day was Saturday, March 4, 2006. Both that day and the next (Sunday, March 5) were excluded from the computation. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(a)(3). Thus, the last day of the 120-day period was Monday, March 6 the day on which the aforementioned transmittal arrived. This time line shows beyond hope of contradiction that DCAG received notice of the action within the allotted period.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the third condition: knowledge of a mistake in identity. To satisfy this condition, the plaintiffs must show both that they made a mistake about the actual identity of the proper defendant and that, within the prescribed time, that party knew or should have known that, but for the mistake, it would have been sued. <i>See </i><i>Leonard,</i> 219 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>It is obvious from the face of the original complaint that the plaintiffs intended to sue the manufacturer of the allegedly defective automobile. For aught that appears, they made a mistake concerning the manufacturer's identity. <i>See generally Webster's Third New Int'l Dict.</i> 1446 (1993) (defining \"mistake\" as \"a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention\"). But for this bevue, they would have sued DCAG, not DCC. Thus, when DCAG (which knew full well of its legal responsibility for the manufacture of the vehicle) received notice of the action, it must have known (or, at least, should have known) that the action would have been brought against it in the first place but for the plaintiffs' mistake. Consequently, the final condition precedent to the operation of Rule 15(c) was satisfied.</p>\n<p>DCAG attempts to parry this thrust by suggesting that the plaintiffs might intentionally have \"sued `Daimler-Chrysler' by an ambiguous name and served the complaint in Michigan in the hopes that [DCAG] would respond and thereby obviate the need for the costly and often time-consuming requirements of Hague Convention service.\" Appellee's Br. at 32. We find this suggestion fanciful.</p>\n<p>The summary judgment record contains nothing that would support this suggestion (indeed, there is no indication that DCAG made this argument below). What we do findfor example, the assertion by plaintiffs' counsel that \"Daimler-Chrysler\" was named because the corporate website did not distinguish between DCC and DCAGpoints in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Litigation should not be reduced to a game of cat and mouse. In the last analysis, it seems highly improbable that, with the limitations period about to expire, the plaintiffs, represented by seasoned counsel, would have made such a risky strategic choice. On this record, the only reasonable inference is that a mistake was made.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. In this instance, Rule 15(c) controls. Because the plaintiffs have satisfied all the conditions for the application of that Rule, their amended complaint designating DCAG as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> a party defendant relates back to the date of the commencement of the action.<sup>[5]</sup> It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the action against DCAG was timely and that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  To be precise, the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of this defendant. The order was for partial summary judgment because one of the plaintiffs, Jean Carlos Román, is a minor, as to whom the one-year limitations period has not run. <i>See </i><i>Cintrón v. Estado Libre Asociado,</i> 127 D.P.R. 582, 589 (1990). The district court did, however, certify the partial judgment for immediate appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).</p>\n<p>[2]  The motion papers explained that, in 1998, a pact between Chrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz AG had created two legally distinct corporate entities: DCC and DCAG. Under the terms of the agreement, Chrysler Corporation became known as DCC and continued to manufacture Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep motor vehicles. DCAG (which, in mid-2007, changed its name to Daimler AG) assumed the business formerly conducted by Daimler-Benz AG, including proprietorship of its Mercedes-Benz line.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although Rule 15(c) was amended in 2007, the changes were \"intended to be stylistic only.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15 advisory committee notes (2007 Amendment). The various sub-parts of the Rule were rearranged and renumbered but for present purposes the Rule's substance and operation are unchanged. For ease in exposition, we therefore refer to the present, revised version.</p>\n<p>[4]  This inference is reinforced by the fact that, once the plaintiffs learned of their error, they had no difficulty in serving DCAG under the Hague Convention.</p>\n<p>[5]  The plaintiffs have argued in the alternative that the belated identification of DCAG can be justified as the correction of a misnomer. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774499\"><a href=\"/opinion/774499/united-states-v-william-m-davis-ashland-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 33 n. 25 (1st Cir.2001). We do not reach that argument.</p>\n\n</div>",
