It denied appellants'\nmotion for a temporary restraining order on September 15, 2010, and then for a preliminary\ninjunction on September 17, 2010. The district court also denied appellants' motion to consolidate\nthe hearing on the preliminary injunction with the hearing on the merits. The court held it could not\ndetermine that there was no dispute over material facts, a dispute appellees strongly asserted existed,\nand reasoned that consolidation was not appropriate. No hearing on the ultimate merits of the case\nhas been held and final judgment has not been entered.\n\n       Appellants have appealed from the denial of the preliminary injunction, and have also filed\nan emergency motion for injunctive relief pending appeal, seeking relief before the November 2,\n2010 elections in Maine.\n\n       This Court in turn expedited consideration of both the appeal from the denial of the\npreliminary injunction and the emergency motion. Oral argument was held on Tuesday, October 5,\n2010 and the case was taken under advisement.\n\n       We deny the appellants' emergency motion to enjoin operation of the challenged provisions\nof Maine's election laws pending the outcome of this appeal.\n\nStandards for Issuance of Relief Pending Appeal\n\n       A party requesting injunctive relief pending appeal bears the burden of showing that the\ncircumstances of the case justify the exercise of the court's discretion. Nken v. Holder, 129 S.Ct.\n1749, 1760-61 (2009). As in cases involving stays of actions pending appeal, we are guided by\nconsideration of four factors: (1) whether the applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely\nto succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent relief; (3)\nwhether issuance of relief will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and\n(4) where the public interest lies. Id. at 1761 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776\n(1987)).\n\n        The first two factors are the most critical. Both require a showing of more than mere\npossibility. Plaintiffs must show a strong likelihood of success, and they must demonstrate that\nirreparable injury will be likely absent an injunction. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 129\nS. Ct. 365, 375-376 (2008).\n\nIrreparable Injury and Probability of Success on the Merits\n\n       The only irreparable injury claimed by appellants is that to their First Amendment rights.\n\"The fact that [appellants are] asserting First Amendment rights does not automatically require a\nfinding of irreparable injury.\" Pub. Serv. Co. of New Hampshire v. Town of West Newbury, 835\nF.2d 380, 382 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting Rushia v. Town of Ashburnham, 701 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.\n1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether there is any such harm is the issue that will\nultimately be addressed on the merits of the case. We recognize the importance of rights asserted\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\funder the First Amendment, but every case depends on its own facts.\n\n        We acknowledge that the issues raised by the challenges to Maine's laws are difficult and will\nrequire careful analysis, on a fully developed record. Given these difficulties, we cannot forecast\nwhat our ultimate judgment on the merits will be.\n\n        Appellees argue that even if Daggett v. Comm’n on Governmental Ethics & Election\nPractices, 205 F.3d 445 (1st Cir. 2000) has been altered by more recent Supreme Court case law, the\nultimate merits of the case turns on material factual disputes to be resolved after discovery. They\nargue that there are material distinctions between the operation of the Maine statute, and that of the\nConnecticut statute involved in Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield, Nos. 09-3760-cv, 09-3941-cv,\n2010 WL 2737153 (2d Cir. July 13, 2010), the Florida statute in Scott v. Roberts, 612 F.3d 1279\n(11th Cir. 2010), and the Minnesota statute in Day v. Holahan, 34 F.3d 1356 (8th Cir. 1994). They\nargue that, even assuming some burden on First Amendment rights of traditional candidates, a\nfactual hearing will be necessary to resolve the questions of the strength of the state's legitimate\ninterest in combating election fraud and the appearance of fraud, the degree of burden created by the\nchallenged laws, and the narrow tailoring of these laws to achieve the state's anti-corruption interests.\n\n        The appellants have not shown any immediate injury that requires issuance of an emergency\ninjunction, putting aside their claim that Maine's laws burden their speech in contravention of the\nFirst Amendment. They have not presented this Court with evidence that there are any actions\nremaining under the challenged matching fund provisions to enjoin before November 2, 2010. It was\nappellants' burden to produce such evidence.1\n\n        With respect to Maine's campaign contribution limits, we note that the $750 limit on\ncontributions to candidates for governor challenged by Appellant Clough is a limit per election,\nwhether it be a primary election or a general election. Although Clough reached this maximum in\nhis donation to the Republican candidate in the general election, he gave this candidate only $200\nin the primary election. He did not come close to reaching the aggregate contribution limit.\n\n       As to the Respect Maine PAC, it also has shown no immediate injury, as it has not produced\nevidence that it spent any sums nor has it alleged specific plans to make expenditures likely to trigger\nmatching funds.\n\nBalance of the Harms and the Public Interest\n\n       Under the balancing test, we consider the considerable harm that an emergency injunction\nwould cause the many candidates, both MCEA participants and not, who have relied on the\nchallenged provisions. We also note the harm to the public interest from the chaos that will ensue\n\n\n        1\n               Though given the opportunity to provide further affidavits setting forth any\ncontinuing injury to the appellants as of the date of denial of the preliminary injunction, and\nthrough the appeal, appellants have declined to do so.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fif the Maine election laws, which have been in place since 1996, are invalidated by a court order in\nthe crucial final weeks before an election.2\n\n        In determining the weight to be accorded to the appellants' claims, we also note that this\n\"emergency\" is largely one of their own making. The appellants, well aware of the requirements of\nthe election laws, chose not to bring this suit until August 5, 2010, shortly before the November 2\nelections. Appellant Cushing, an incumbent running for reelection, declared his candidacy before\nMarch 15, 2010. Appellants did not file their case until at least six months after roughly 280\ncandidates had declared their intention to rely on MCEA public funding, and two months after the\nprimary election.3 Further, the case law on which they rely is not new. They rely primarily on Davis\nv. Fed. Election Comm'n, 128 S.Ct. 2759 (2008), which was decided on June 26, 2008. Citizens\nUnited v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 130 S.Ct. 876 (2010), was decided in January 2010.\n\n        Given the potential harm to Maine and to all candidates if the emergency injunction were\ngranted, and the public interest in maintaining the status quo during the period of the Court's\ndeliberations, we deny the emergency motion.\n\n       So ordered.\n\n\n\n\ncc: Hon. George S. Singal, Ms. Linda Jacobson, Clerk, United States District Court for the District\nof Maine, James Bopp, Jr., Josiah Neeley, Anita Y. Woudenberg, David P. Crocker, Phyllis Gardiner\nMr. John R. Brautigam, Ms. Brenda Wright, Mr. Knowlton, Mr. Neeley, Ms. Danetz, Ms. Marziani,\nMs. Youn and Thomas A. Knowlton.\n\n\n\n       2\n                The district court in McComish v. Brewer, No. cv-08-1550, 2008 WL 4629337\n(D. Ariz. Oct. 17, 2008), found that although the plaintiffs challenging the Citizen Clean Election\nAct had shown \"a very strong likelihood of success on the merits,\" the \"extraordinary balance of\nthe harms required in the context of an ongoing election\" required a finding that they were not\nentitled to a preliminary injunction against the election. Id. at *12.\n       3\n               By contrast, in Daggett v. Comm’n on Gov'tal Ethics & Election Practices, 205\nF.3d 445 (1st Cir. 2000), plaintiffs filed their challenge almost two years ahead of the 2000\nelections.\n\n                                                -4-\n\f",

Braunskill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111892\"><a href=\"/opinion/111892/hilton-v-braunskill/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 776, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111892\"><a href=\"/opinion/111892/hilton-v-braunskill/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span> (1987)).</p>\n<p>The first two factors are the most critical. Both require a showing of more than mere possibility. Plaintiffs must show a strong likelihood of success, and they must demonstrate that irreparable injury will be likely absent an injunction. <i>Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145928\"><a href=\"/opinion/145928/winter-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span> (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Irreparable Injury and Probability of Success on the Merits</i></h2>\n<p>The only irreparable injury claimed by appellants is that to their First Amendment rights. \"The fact that [appellants are] asserting First Amendment rights does not automatically require a finding of irreparable injury.\" <i>Pub. Serv. Co. of New Hampshire v. Town of West Newbury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498700\"><a href=\"/opinion/498700/public-service-company-of-new-hampshire-v-town-of-west-newbury-thomas-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 382 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting <i>Rushia v. Town of Ashburnham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414526\"><a href=\"/opinion/414526/wilfred-e-rushia-v-town-of-ashburnham-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether there is any such harm is the issue that will ultimately be addressed on the merits of the case. We recognize the importance of rights asserted under the First Amendment, but every case depends on its own facts.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that the issues raised by the challenges to Maine's laws are difficult and will require careful analysis, on a fully developed record. Given these difficulties, we cannot forecast what our ultimate judgment on the merits will be.</p>\n<p>Appellees argue that even if <i>Daggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767873\"><a href=\"/opinion/767873/beverly-c-daggett-elaine-fuller-christopher-m-harte-mark-t-cenci/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000) has been altered by more recent Supreme Court case law, the ultimate merits of the case turns on material factual disputes to be resolved after discovery. They argue that there are material distinctions between the operation of the Maine statute, and that of the Connecticut statute involved in <i>Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150474\"><a href=\"/opinion/150474/green-party-of-connecticut-v-garfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span> (2d Cir.2010), the Florida statute in <i>Scott v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151935\"><a href=\"/opinion/151935/scott-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span> (11th Cir.2010), and the Minnesota statute in <i>Day v. Holahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677807\"><a href=\"/opinion/677807/scott-day-treasurer-of-impace-mea-impace-mea-a-political-fund-steve/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1994). They argue that, even assuming some burden on First Amendment rights of traditional candidates, a factual hearing will be necessary to resolve the questions of the strength of the state's legitimate interest in combating election fraud and the appearance of fraud, the degree of burden created by the challenged laws, and the narrow tailoring of these laws to achieve the state's anti-corruption interests.</p>\n<p>The appellants have not shown any <i>immediate</i> injury that requires issuance of an emergency injunction, putting aside their claim that Maine's laws burden their speech in contravention of the First Amendment. They have not presented this Court with evidence that there are any actions remaining under the challenged matching fund provisions to enjoin <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> before November 2, 2010. It was appellants' burden to produce such evidence.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to Maine's campaign contribution limits, we note that the $750 limit on contributions to candidates for governor challenged by Appellant Clough is a limit per election, whether it be a primary election or a general election. Although Clough reached this maximum in his donation to the Republican candidate in the general election, he gave this candidate only $200 in the primary election. He did not come close to reaching the aggregate contribution limit.</p>\n<p>As to the Respect Maine PAC, it also has shown no immediate injury, as it has not produced evidence that it spent any sums nor has it alleged specific plans to make expenditures likely to trigger matching funds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Balance of the Harms and the Public Interest</i></h2>\n<p>Under the balancing test, we consider the considerable harm that an emergency injunction would cause the many candidates, both MCEA participants and not, who have relied on the challenged provisions. We also note the harm to the public interest from the chaos that will ensue if the Maine election laws, which have been in place since 1996, are invalidated by a court order in the crucial final weeks before an election.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In determining the weight to be accorded to the appellants' claims, we also note that this \"emergency\" is largely one of their own making. The appellants, well aware of the requirements of the election laws, chose not to bring this suit until August 5, 2010, shortly before the November 2 elections. Appellant Cushing, an incumbent running for reelection, declared his candidacy before March 15, 2010. Appellants did not file their case until at least six months after roughly 280 candidates had declared their intention to rely on MCEA public funding, and two months after the primary election.<sup>[3]</sup> Further, the case law on which they rely is not new. They rely primarily on <i>Davis v. Fed. Election Comm'n,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145776\"><a href=\"/opinion/145776/davis-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span> (2008), which was decided on June 26, 2008. <i>Citizens United v. Fed.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010), was decided in January 2010.</p>\n<p>Given the potential harm to Maine and to all candidates if the emergency injunction were granted, and the public interest in maintaining the status quo during the period of the Court's deliberations, we deny the emergency motion.</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Though given the opportunity to provide further affidavits setting forth any continuing injury to the appellants as of the date of denial of the preliminary injunction, and through the appeal, appellants have declined to do so.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court in <i>McComish v. Brewer,</i> No. cv-08-1550, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4629337</span></span> (D.Ariz. Oct. 17, 2008), found that although the plaintiffs challenging the Citizen Clean Election Act had shown \"a very strong likelihood of success on the merits,\" the \"extraordinary balance of the harms required in the context of an ongoing election\" required a finding that they were not entitled to a preliminary injunction against the election. <i>Id.</i> at *12.</p>\n<p>[3]  By contrast, in <i>Daggett v.
