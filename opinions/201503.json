Debtors-Appellants\n\nMichael and Kathleen Watson (the \"Watsons\") appeal from an order of\n\nthe bankruptcy court denying confirmation of their proposed Chapter\n\n13 plan.       The bankruptcy court denied confirmation on the ground\n\nthe Watsons failed to establish that all projected \"disposable\n\nincome\" received during the plan period would be applied to make\n\npayments under the plan.          See 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(1)(B).         In\n\nparticular, the bankruptcy court determined that the cost of\n\nsending the Watsons' two minor children to parochial school was\n\nneither    a    \"reasonably   necessary\"    expense   nor    a   \"charitable\n\ncontribution\" -- each of which is excluded from the definition of\n\n\"disposable income\" under 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(2)(A).              See In re\n\nWatson, 299 B.R. 56, 58-60 (Bankr. D.R.I. 2003).             The bankruptcy\n\nappellate panel affirmed.      In re Watson, 309 B.R. 652, 657 (B.A.P.\n\n1st Cir. 2004).      This appeal followed.\n\n           Although they did not make the same argument in the\n\nbankruptcy court, the Watsons argue in this appeal that to deny\n\nconfirmation of the plan because of its provision for paying the\n\ncost of sending the children to parochial school burdens the\n\nprotected exercise of their Catholic faith, in contradiction of the\n\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, as amended.              See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000bb-1 et seq.      They also argue that the bankruptcy court erred\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fin finding that the parochial school tuition payments were not\n\nreasonably necessary.1         For reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                I.    Background\n\n              On January 17, 2003, the Watsons filed a joint case under\n\nChapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.            See 11 U.S.C. §\n\n1301 et seq.        Their Schedules I and J showed net monthly income of\n\n$5,770, expenses of $4,194, and disposable income of $1,576. Their\n\nproposed Chapter 13 plan provided for thirty-six monthly payments\n\nof $1,576 (total $56,736), which would have paid to unsecured\n\ncreditors twenty-five percent of their claims.\n\n              The    Chapter   13   trustee,   John   Boyajian   (\"Trustee\"),\n\nobjected to confirmation of the plan on the ground that the Watsons\n\nwere not contributing all of their disposable income as required\n\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(1)(B).2            \"Disposable income\" is defined\n\nas:       \"income which is received by the debtor and which is not\n\nreasonably necessary to be expended–-(A) for the maintenance or\n\n\n      1\n      The Watsons do not contend on appeal that the bankruptcy\ncourt erred in rejecting their argument that the parochial school\ntuition payments were charitable contributions within the\ndefinition of 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(2)(A). We do not, therefore,\naddress this issue.\n      2\n          11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(1)(B) provides:\n\n      If the trustee . . . objects to the confirmation of the\n      plan, then the court may not approve the plan unless, as\n      of the effective date of the plan--(B) the plan provides\n      that all of the debtor’s projected disposable income to\n      be received in the three-year period beginning on the\n      date that the first payment is due under the plan will be\n      applied to make payments under the plan.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsupport of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor, including\n\ncharitable contributions.\" 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(2)(A). The Trustee\n\nobjected in particular to a claimed expense of $735 per month for\n\nparochial school tuition for the Watsons' two minor children.                   The\n\nWatsons,    who    are   Catholics,   maintained      that     the    expense    is\n\nreasonably necessary under the circumstances.                 The Watsons also\n\nargued in    the    alternative   that      the   expense    is   a   \"charitable\n\ncontribution,\" hence a reasonably necessary expense under the\n\namended definition of \"disposable income\" provided by the Religious\n\nLiberty and Charitable Donation Act of 1998.                See supra note 1.\n\n            At a hearing before the bankruptcy court, Mr. Watson\n\ntestified that he, his wife, and their two children are devout\n\nCatholics who attend church every Sunday and during all the holy\n\ndays of obligation.         Mr. Watson testified that he is actively\n\ninvolved in church ministry, and that his children have been\n\nassisting at mass since the third grade.           Mr. Watson stated that he\n\nand his wife have always sent their children to parochial schools\n\nbecause they value the importance such schools place on God.\n\n            After further briefing and oral argument, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt, on September 15, 2003, issued an order denying confirmation\n\nof the plan, finding (1) that the tuition expense is not reasonably\n\nnecessary,    and    (2)   that   the    tuition     is     not   a   charitable\n\ncontribution excluded under the Religious Liberty and Charitable\n\nDonation Protection Act of 1998.            In re Watson, 299 B.R. at 57.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fThe bankruptcy court found that the Watsons had \"claimed many\n\nborderline and/or excessive expenses,\" that they were \"unwilling to\n\nextend     their    plan   beyond      three   years,\"   and   that   their    plan\n\ntherefore failed to demonstrate good faith.               Id. at 58.    The order\n\ndenying confirmation of the plan provided that, in accordance with\n\nthe local bankruptcy rules, the Watsons had eleven days within\n\nwhich to file an amended plan.            Id. at 60.\n\n             On September 24, 2003, the Watsons appealed from the\n\norder to the bankruptcy appellate panel (\"BAP\").                  Thereafter, the\n\nWatsons filed in the bankruptcy court a motion to stay pending\n\nappeal. On October 27, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered an order\n\ndenying the stay motion and dismissing the case.               The order stated\n\nas follows:\n\n      1.     The Motion for a Stay is denied and the case\n             dismissed.\n      2.     For administrative purposes, the underlying case\n             shall remain open and the deadline contained in\n             Rhode Island Local Bankruptcy Rule 3015-3(e)\n             extended generally until 10 days after the entry of\n             a decision on the merits of Debtors' appeal by the\n             Bankruptcy Appellate Panel.\n      3.     This order may be modified by any party in interest\n             upon the filing of an appropriate motion.\n\nOn   May   21,     2004,   the   BAP    issued   its   judgment    affirming    the\n\nbankruptcy court's denial of confirmation.               In re Watson, 309 B.R.\n\nat 664.      The BAP concluded that the bankruptcy court's order\n\ndenying confirmation of the plan was interlocutory and not final\n\nbecause the Watsons were \"free to propose an alternate plan.\"                   Id.\n\nat 659.       The BAP made no mention of the bankruptcy court's\n\n                                         -5-\n\fsubsequent order denying the motion to stay pending appeal and\n\ndismissing the case.      See id.   (\"Here, the Bankruptcy Court did not\n\ndismiss the case . . . .\").       In spite of its determination that the\n\nbankruptcy    court's   9/15/03     order    was     interlocutory,     the   BAP\n\nexercised    jurisdiction    to   hear     the    appeal   under   28   U.S.C.   §\n\n158(a)(3),    providing    for    review    of    interlocutory    orders,    and\n\naffirmed.    Id. at 657, 659.     On June 15, 2004, the Watsons appealed\n\nto this Court.\n\n                            II.     Jurisdiction\n\n             We have requested the parties to brief the question\n\n\"whether the finality of the [bankruptcy court's] 10/27/03 order\n\ndismissing the case is undercut by the order's provision that the\n\ncase 'shall remain open' and that the deadline for filing a\n\nmodified Plan shall be extended.\"                Both parties to this appeal\n\ncontend that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n158(d) to hear this appeal.         We agree.\n\n             Under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d), this Court has \"jurisdiction of\n\nappeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees.\"\n\nAlthough the BAP concluded that it had jurisdiction to review the\n\n10/27/03 order even if interlocutory, this Court has jurisdiction\n\nonly if the underlying bankruptcy court order is in fact final.\n\nSee In re Flor, 79 F.3d 281, 283 (2d Cir. 1996) (\"For purposes of\n\n§ 158(d), a determination of the district court is not 'final'\n\nunless the underlying order of the bankruptcy court is final.\");\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fsee also In re Lievsay, 118 F.3d 661, 662 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"If the\n\nunderlying bankruptcy court decision is interlocutory, the BAP\n\norder affirming or reversing it is also interlocutory.\").\n\n             The parties concede the bankruptcy court’s 9/15/03 order\n\ndenying confirmation of the plan was not final at the time it was\n\nissued \"because the Debtors remained free to propose an alternate\n\nplan.\"      In re Bentley, 266 B.R. 229, 233 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2001);\n\nsee Bartee v. Tara Colony Homeowners Ass'n (In re Bartee), 212 F.3d\n\n277, 283 (5th Cir. 2000) (stating, \"If the order was not intended\n\nto be final--for example, if the order addressed an issue that left\n\nthe    debtor      able   to   file   an    amended   plan   .   .   .   appellate\n\njurisdiction would be lacking.\").                But even if the 9/15/03 order\n\ndenying confirmation of the plan was not final at the time it was\n\nissued, the parties assert that the order became final after\n\nOctober 27, 2003, when the bankruptcy court entered its order\n\ndismissing the case.           See In re Bentley, 266 B.R. at 234 (holding\n\nthat order denying confirmation of plan \"became final when, upon\n\nbeing notified that the Debtors did not intend to seek confirmation\n\nof an alternate plan, the court dismissed their case\").\n\n             In In re Parque Forestal, Inc., this Court held that a\n\ndistrict court’s appellate order was final and appealable, even\n\nassuming the underlying bankruptcy court order was not final at the\n\ntime   it    was    appealed,     because    the    bankruptcy   case    had   been\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fdismissed before appeal to this Court, \"making the orders below, in\n\neffect, final.\"   949 F.2d 504, 508 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n      [E]ven assuming, for purposes of argument, that the\n      [bankruptcy court] order then lacked finality, the\n      subsequent dismissal of the bankruptcy proceeding makes\n      this assumption largely irrelevant. The Supreme Court\n      has held that \"the requirement of finality is to be given\n      a    'practical      rather     than     a     technical\n      construction.'\" . . . Whether or not the bankruptcy\n      court's order was final at the time it was appealed to\n      the district court, there is no possibility now that\n      either court's order will be changed or become moot, or\n      that \"piecemeal appeals\" will waste the time of this\n      court or the parties.\n\nId.   (citations omitted).   See also Welch v. Cadre Capital, 923\n\nF.2d 989, 992 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that there was appellate\n\njurisdiction under principle that \"a premature notice of appeal\n\nfrom a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a\n\nfinal judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and\n\nthe appellee suffers no prejudice\"), vacated on other grounds, 501\n\nU.S. 1247 (1991); cf. Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, 1184\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (holding that \"by virtue of Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(2), [appellant's] premature notice of appeal ripened when the\n\ndistrict court certified its December 31, 1992, amended judgment\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)\").\n\n           Here, regardless whether the bankruptcy court's September\n\n15, 2003 order denying confirmation of the plan was final when\n\nissued, it became final in light of the bankruptcy court's October\n\n27, 2003 order dismissing the case and the Watsons' subsequent\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\ffailure to file an amended plan within the limited time allowed in\n\nthat order.\n\n          To be sure, the 10/27/03 order, while dismissing the\n\ncase, also stated that, \"[f]or administrative purposes,\" the case\n\n\"shall remain open\" and that the deadline contained in Rhode Island\n\nLocal Bankruptcy Rule 3015-3(e) would be extended until ten days\n\nafter the entry of the BAP's decision in the case.      Local Rule\n\n3015-3(e) provides:\n\n     Confirmation of Plan Denied. If confirmation is denied,\n     the Court may enter an order dismissing the Chapter 13\n     case, unless, within eleven (11) days after entry of the\n     order denying confirmation:\n     (1) the debtor files a modified plan;\n     (2) the debtor moves to convert the case to one under\n     another chapter of the Code;\n     (3) the debtor files a motion for reconsideration;\n     (4) the debtor appeals the order denying confirmation; or\n     (5) the Court otherwise orders.\n\nIt is evident from the docket entry for the hearing on the motion\n\nfor stay that the 10/27/03 order was intended to leave the Watsons\n\nfree for ten days after the BAP's decision to file an amended plan\n\nif the BAP affirmed the bankruptcy court's denial of confirmation.\n\nThe entry states: \"Trustee suggested extending the time to file an\n\namended plan until 10 days after a decision on the case by the BAP.\n\nParties consent to this and will submit an order.\"    The Watsons,\n\nhowever, never filed an amended plan within the ten-day grace\n\nperiod following the BAP's judgment which was issued on May 21,\n\n2004.   Instead, on June 15, 2004, 25 days later, they filed a\n\ntimely appeal to this Court.     Their appeal had the effect of\n\n                               -9-\n\ftransferring jurisdiction here from the bankruptcy court.                See\n\nGriggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)\n\n(\"The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\n\nsignificance--it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and\n\ndivests the district court of its control over those aspects of the\n\ncase involved in the appeal.\").      By this point, the window in the\n\n10/27/03 order was closed, and, for all practical purposes, the\n\n9/15/03 order was final.\n\n            \"[T]he   requirement   of     finality   is   to    be   given   a\n\n'practical rather than a technical construction.'\"              Gillespie v.\n\nUnited States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 152 (1964) (quoting Cohen\n\nv. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949)).             This\n\ncase, while not wholly identical, is conceptually similar to\n\nParque.   The bankruptcy court's 10/27/03 order dismissing the case\n\nleft it open only \"[f]or administrative purposes\" designed to\n\npermit the filing of an amended plan within ten days after the\n\nBAP's decision came down.    After that period had expired, the only\n\nremaining limitation upon total dismissal was the taking of an\n\nappeal to our court, an event which in no way compromised the\n\nfinality of the bankruptcy court's own order.                  Dismissal and\n\nclosure of a case are distinct events, and there is no reason why\n\na case cannot be dismissed but kept open for limited administrative\n\npurposes.    See Armel Laminates, Inc. v. Lomas & Nettleton Co. (In\n\nre Income Prop. Builders, Inc.), 699 F.2d 963, 965 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fWe are satisfied that in the circumstances the appealed bankruptcy\n\ncourt's order denying confirmation of the plan was rendered final\n\nby the later order and occurrences. We have jurisdiction over this\n\nappeal.3\n\n                           III.   Discussion\n\nA.   Religious Freedom Restoration Act\n\n           The Watsons argue on appeal that the bankruptcy court's\n\norder denying confirmation of the plan substantially burdens the\n\nprotected exercise of their Catholic faith in violation of the\n\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), as amended by the\n\nProtection of Religious Exercise in Land Use and Institutionalized\n\nPersons (\"RLUIPA\").     See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1, 2000cc-2000cc-5.\n\nThis argument, however, was never made to, nor considered by, the\n\nbankruptcy court.     It is true the Watsons alluded briefly to the\n\nRFRA in briefs submitted to the bankruptcy court and in vague\n\nreferences in their second oral argument in that court.      In each\n\ninstance, however, the Watsons only raised the RFRA in relation to\n\nthe argument that parochial school tuition payments constituted\n\ncharitable contributions -- an issue decided against them below and\n\nnot now appealed to this Court.    See supra note 1.   The bankruptcy\n\ncourt did not mention the RFRA in its opinion.     In a brief later\n\n\n     3\n      To avoid future questions, we suggest that such seemingly\nopen-ended orders add a proviso to the effect that if the debtor\ndoes not timely take the actions in Local Rule 3015-3(e)(1), (2) or\n(3), or does not take an action under (4), then the order is final\nas entered.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fsubmitted on appeal to the BAP, the Watsons discussed the RFRA,\n\nreferenced the RLUIPA by citation, and admitted that the RFRA issue\n\nhad not been \"fully briefed below.\" In affirming the order denying\n\nconfirmation of the plan, the BAP held that the RFRA does not\n\nafford the Watsons the right to use disposable income for parochial\n\nschool tuition.    In re Watson, 309 B.R. at 663.\n\n           A party's failure to raise an issue in the bankruptcy\n\ncourt forfeits its right to raise that issue for the first time on\n\nappeal in this Court.      Evergreen Credit Union v. Woodman (In re\n\nWoodman), 379 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004); Gannett v. Carp (In re\n\nCarp), 340 F.3d 15, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2003).            The Watsons' brief\n\nreferences below to the RFRA, made in context of their charitable\n\ncontributions argument, were not tantamount to the RFRA and RLUIPA\n\narguments now advanced on appeal.           Cf. McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of\n\nTech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (refusing to address issue\n\nwhere plaintiff, in the district court, \"made passing mention of\n\nthe general point - a mention which, in its entirety, comprised two\n\nsentences and one citation (to a tangentially relevant case)\").\n\nThe rule that a party may not raise an argument for the first time\n\non appeal is elemental.     In re Carp, 340 F.3d at 26.       While we have\n\ndiscretion in exceptional circumstances to address an issue not\n\nraised   below,   no   exceptional    circumstances   exist    here.   See\n\nSheridan v. Michels (In re Sheridan), 362 F.3d 96, 105 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f2004) (noting our discretion in \"rare instances\" to review an issue\n\nnot raised below).\n\n           We recognize the BAP saw fit to address the Watsons' RFRA\n\ncontention.     But the BAP's action does not cure the matter from our\n\nperspective.     See In re Woodman, 379 F.3d at 3 n.1.            The effective\n\nadministration of our judicial system requires that ordinarily each\n\nand every non-jurisdictional issue to be determined be initially\n\npresented to the nisi prius tribunal.          That a separate court in the\n\nappellate chain, for its own reasons, chose to overlook the breach\n\nof this rule does not bind our court.                  As the Watsons have\n\nforfeited the RFRA argument, we do not now consider it.\n\nB.    Reasonably Necessary Expenses\n\n            The Watsons contend that the bankruptcy court erred in\n\ndetermining that parochial school tuition payments for their two\n\nminor children are not reasonably necessary expenses within the\n\nprovisions of 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b).            To qualify for confirmation,\n\nthe   Chapter   13    plan   must   provide    \"that   all   of   the    debtor's\n\ndisposable income to be received in the three-year period beginning\n\non the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be\n\napplied    to   make    payment     under     the   plan.\"        11    U.S.C.   §\n\n1325(b)(1)(B).       \"Disposable income\" is defined as:\n\n       income which is received by the debtor and which is not\n       reasonably necessary to be expended–-\n       (A) for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a\n       dependent   of   the   debtor,   including   charitable\n       contributions . . .\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(2)(A).       At issue here is whether the portion of\n\nthe Watsons' income devoted to pay parochial school tuition for\n\ntheir two minor children is income \"reasonably necessary\" to be\n\nexpended for this purpose.         In reviewing the bankruptcy court's\n\ndetermination of this matter, we review for \"clear error unless the\n\nbankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the\n\nlegal principles involved.\"       In re Carp, 340 F.3d at 22.        Here, the\n\nbankruptcy court's view of the guiding legal principles was not\n\nmistaken and the court did not commit clear factual error.\n\n           We begin with the self-evident proposition that it is the\n\ndebtor   who   bears   the    burden    of    proving   that   an   expense   is\n\nreasonably necessary.        See, e.g., Lynch v. Tate (In re Lynch), 299\n\nB.R. 776, 779 (W.D.N.C. 2003); In re Webb, 262 B.R. 685, 688\n\n(Bankr. E.D. Tex. 2001). Here, the bankruptcy court concluded that\n\nthe debtors \"have not shown that the public schools in their area\n\n. . . are not adequate, and neither have they suggested any other\n\nspecial need [to attend parochial school].\" In re Watson, 299 B.R.\n\nat 58.   The court went on to allude to the general proposition\n\nadvanced in Webb and by other bankruptcy courts that \"[i]n the\n\nabsence of some compelling circumstance . . . a private school\n\neducation is not reasonably necessary.\"            In re Webb, 262 B.R. at\n\n690; see, e.g., In re Jones, 55 B.R. 462, 467 (Bankr. D. Minn.\n\n1985) (\"An expensive private school education is not a basic need\n\nof the Debtor's dependents . . . .\").            The court then went on to\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdistinguish the present case from other bankruptcy cases where\n\ncompelling circumstances for a private education have been found to\n\nexist.    See In re Watson, 299 B.R. at 58.   It concluded, in effect,\n\nthat the Watsons had not shown any educational necessities or\n\nspecial circumstances why their children needed to attend parochial\n\nschool in lieu of the available public school.      The court went on\n\nto say:\n\n     The   only   reason  advanced    by  [the   debtors]   is\n     preferential, i.e., their children have always attended\n     parochial school because of the family's strong religious\n     ties. . . .    Allowing these Debtors to pay parochial\n     school tuition which over the life of the Plan will\n     exceed the amount distributed to creditors, is to require\n     general creditors to fund the private education of the\n     Debtors' kids.\n\nId. at 58-59.\n\n            As noted above, we defer broadly to the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's determinations in a matter of this type, which entail\n\nbalancing the creditors' rights against the appropriate basic needs\n\nof the debtors and their dependents.    We can find no clear error in\n\nthe balance the court struck here in its thoughtful opinion.\n\n            The Watsons complain that they were unfairly criticized\n\nby the court for what it found was their unwillingness to forgo\n\ncertain \"borderline and/or excessive expenses\" while also claiming\n\nthe tuition expense.    We have examined the record and see no clear\n\nerror in the court's overall assessment in this regard.\n\n            To allow the Watsons to pay parochial school tuition over\n\nthe life of the proposed plan would require already severely\n\n                                 -15-\n\freduced creditors to fund the private education of the Watsons'\n\nchildren. We can appreciate the importance attached by the Watsons\n\nto the religious values of a parochial school education. Still, it\n\nis not impossible to inculcate those values outside of a school,\n\nand the court could reasonably conclude, in the circumstances\n\npresented here, that it would be improper to impose the added\n\nexpense on the Watsons' unpaid creditors where the children's\n\neducational needs could otherwise be met in the public schools.\n\nThere was no clear error in the bankruptcy court's determination.\n\n                             IV.   Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the order of the United States\n\nBankruptcy   Court   order   denying   confirmation   of   the   plan   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

The bankruptcy court denied confirmation on the ground the Watsons failed to establish that all projected \"disposable income\" received during the plan period would be applied to make payments under the plan. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B). In particular, the bankruptcy court determined that the cost of sending the Watsons' two minor children to parochial school was neither a \"reasonably necessary\" expense nor a \"charitable contribution\" &#8212; each of which is excluded from the definition of \"disposable income\" under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). <i>See In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. 56, 58-60 (Bankr.D.R.I.2003). The bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed. <i>In re Watson,</i> 309 B.R. 652, 657 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2004). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they did not make the same argument in the bankruptcy court, the Watsons argue in this appeal that to deny confirmation of the plan because of its provision for paying the cost of sending the children to parochial school burdens the protected exercise of their Catholic faith, in contradiction of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as amended. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb-1 <i>et seq.</i> They also argue that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the parochial school tuition payments were not reasonably necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2003, the Watsons filed a joint case under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1301 <i>et seq.</i> Their Schedules I and J showed net monthly income of $5,770, expenses of $4,194, and disposable income of $1,576. Their proposed Chapter 13 plan provided for thirty-six monthly payments of $1,576 (total $56,736), which would have paid to unsecured creditors twenty-five percent of their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chapter 13 trustee, John Boyajian (\"Trustee\"), objected to confirmation of the plan on the ground that the Watsons were not contributing all of their disposable income as required under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> \"Disposable income\" is defined as: \"income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended &#8212; (A) for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor, including charitable contributions.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). The Trustee objected in particular to a claimed expense of $735 per month for parochial school tuition for the Watsons' two minor children. The Watsons, who are Catholics, maintained that the expense is reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The Watsons also argued in the alternative that the expense is a \"charitable contribution,\" hence a reasonably necessary expense under the amended definition of \"disposable income\" provided by the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Act of 1998. <i>See supra</i> note 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing before the bankruptcy court, Mr. Watson testified that he, his wife, and their two children are devout Catholics who attend church every Sunday and during all the holy days of obligation. Mr. Watson testified that he is actively involved in church ministry, and that his children have been assisting at mass since the third grade. Mr. Watson stated that he and his wife have always sent their children to parochial schools because they value the importance such schools place on God.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further briefing and oral argument, the bankruptcy court, on September 15, 2003, issued an order denying confirmation of the plan, finding (1) that the tuition expense is not reasonably necessary, and (2) that the tuition is not a charitable contribution excluded under the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act of 1998. <i>In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. at 57. The bankruptcy court found that the Watsons had \"claimed many borderline and/or excessive expenses,\" that they were \"unwilling to extend their plan beyond three years,\" and that their plan therefore failed to demonstrate good faith. <i>Id.</i> at 58. The order denying confirmation of the plan provided that, in accordance with the local bankruptcy rules, the Watsons had eleven days within which to file an amended plan. <i>Id.</i> at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 2003, the Watsons appealed from the order to the bankruptcy appellate panel (\"BAP\"). Thereafter, the Watsons filed in the bankruptcy court a motion to stay pending appeal. On October 27, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered an order denying the stay motion and dismissing the case. The order stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The BAP concluded that the bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan was interlocutory and not final because the Watsons were \"free to propose an alternate plan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 659. The BAP made no mention of the bankruptcy court's subsequent order denying the motion to stay pending appeal and dismissing the case. <i>See id.</i> (\"Here, the Bankruptcy Court did not dismiss the case....\"). In spite of its determination that the bankruptcy court's 9/15/03 order was interlocutory, the BAP exercised jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3), providing for review of interlocutory orders, and affirmed. <i>Id.</i> at 657, 659. On June 15, 2004, the Watsons appealed to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

But even if the 9/15/03 order denying confirmation of the plan was not final at the time it was issued, the parties assert that the order became final after October 27, 2003, when the bankruptcy court entered its order dismissing the case. <i>See In re Bentley,</i> 266 B.R. at 234 (holding that order denying confirmation of plan \"became final when, upon being notified that the Debtors did not intend to seek confirmation of an alternate plan, the court dismissed their case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>In re Parque Forestal, Inc.,</i> this Court held that a district court's appellate order was final and appealable, even assuming the underlying bankruptcy court order was not final at the time it was appealed, because the bankruptcy case had been dismissed before appeal to this Court, \"making the orders below, in effect, final.\" 949 F.2d 504, 508 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[E]ven assuming, for purposes of argument, that the [bankruptcy court] order then lacked finality, the subsequent dismissal of the bankruptcy proceeding makes this assumption largely irrelevant.

The entry states: \"Trustee suggested extending the time to file an amended plan until 10 days after a decision on the case by the BAP. Parties consent to this and will submit an order.\" The Watsons, however, never filed an amended plan within the ten-day grace period following the BAP's judgment which was issued on May 21, 2004. Instead, on June 15, 2004, 25 days later, they filed a timely appeal to this Court. Their appeal had the effect of transferring jurisdiction here from the bankruptcy court. <i>See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co.,</i> 459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (\"The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance &#8212; it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\").

This case, while not wholly identical, is conceptually similar to <i>Parque.</i> The bankruptcy court's 10/27/03 order dismissing the case left it open only \"[f]or administrative purposes\" designed to permit the filing of an amended plan within ten days after the BAP's decision came down. After that period had expired, the only remaining limitation upon total dismissal was the taking of an appeal to our court, an event which in no way compromised the finality of the bankruptcy court's own order. Dismissal and closure of a case are distinct events, and there is no reason why a case cannot be dismissed but kept open for limited administrative purposes. <i>See Armel Laminates, Inc. v.

Religious Freedom Restoration Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Watsons argue on appeal that the bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan substantially burdens the protected exercise of their Catholic faith in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), as amended by the Protection of Religious Exercise in Land Use and Institutionalized Persons (\"RLUIPA\"). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000bb-1, 2000cc-2000cc-5. This argument, however, was never made to, nor considered by, the bankruptcy court. It is true the Watsons alluded briefly to the RFRA in briefs submitted to the bankruptcy court and in vague references in their second oral argument in that court. In each instance, however, the Watsons only raised the RFRA in relation to the argument that parochial school tuition payments constituted charitable contributions &#8212; an issue decided against them below and not now appealed to this Court. <i>See supra</i> note 1. The bankruptcy court did not mention the RFRA in its opinion. In a brief later submitted on appeal to the BAP, the Watsons discussed the RFRA, referenced the RLUIPA by citation, and admitted that the RFRA issue had not been \"fully briefed below.\" In affirming the order denying confirmation of the plan, the BAP held that the RFRA does not afford the Watsons the right to use disposable income for parochial school tuition. <i>In re Watson,</i> 309 B.R. at 663.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's failure to raise an issue in the bankruptcy court forfeits its right to raise that issue for the first time on appeal in this Court. <i>Evergreen Credit Union v. Woodman (In re Woodman),</i> 379 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp),</i> 340 F.3d 15, 25-26 (1st Cir.2003). The Watsons' brief references below to the RFRA, made in context of their charitable contributions argument, were not tantamount to the RFRA and RLUIPA arguments now advanced on appeal. <i>Cf. McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (refusing to address issue where plaintiff, in the district court, \"made passing mention of the general point &#8212; a mention which, in its entirety, comprised two sentences and one citation (to a tangentially relevant case)\"). The rule that a party may not raise an argument for the first time on appeal is elemental. <i>In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d at 26. While we have discretion in exceptional circumstances to address an issue not raised below, no exceptional circumstances exist here. <i>See Sheridan v. Michels (In re Sheridan),</i> 362 F.3d 96, 105 (1st Cir.2004) (noting our discretion in \"rare instances\" to review an issue not raised below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize the BAP saw fit to address the Watsons' RFRA contention. But the BAP's action does not cure the matter from our perspective. <i>See In re Woodman,</i> 379 F.3d at 3 n. 1. The effective administration of our judicial system requires that ordinarily each and every non-jurisdictional issue to be determined be initially presented to the nisi prius tribunal. That a separate court in the appellate chain, for its own reasons, chose to overlook the breach of this rule does not bind our court. As the Watsons have forfeited the RFRA argument, we do not now consider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonably Necessary Expenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Watsons contend that the bankruptcy court erred in determining that parochial school tuition payments for their two minor children are not reasonably necessary expenses within the provisions of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b). To qualify for confirmation, the Chapter 13 plan must provide \"that all of the debtor's disposable income to be received in the three-year period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payment under the plan.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B). \"Disposable income\" is defined as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor, including charitable contributions ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). At issue here is whether the portion of the Watsons' income devoted to pay parochial school tuition for their two minor children is income \"reasonably necessary\" to be expended for this purpose. In reviewing the bankruptcy court's determination of this matter, we review for \"clear error unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.\" <i>In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d at 22. Here, the bankruptcy court's view of the guiding legal principles was not mistaken and the court did not commit clear factual error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the self-evident proposition that it is the debtor who bears the burden of proving that an expense is reasonably necessary. <i>See, e.g., Lynch v. Tate (In re Lynch),</i> 299 B.R. 776, 779 (W.D.N.C.2003); <i>In re Webb,</i> 262 B.R. 685, 688 (Bankr.E.D.Tex.2001). Here, the bankruptcy court concluded that the debtors \"have not shown that the public schools in their area ... are not adequate, and neither have they suggested any other special need [to attend parochial school].\" <i>In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. at 58. The court went on to allude to the general proposition advanced in <i>Webb</i> and by other bankruptcy courts that \"[i]n the absence of some compelling circumstance ... a private school education is not reasonably necessary.\" <i>In re Webb,</i> 262 B.R. at 690; <i>see, e.g., In re Jones,</i> 55 B.R. 462, 467 (Bankr.D.Minn.1985) (\"An expensive private school education is not a basic need of the Debtor's dependents....\"). The court then went on to distinguish the present case from other bankruptcy cases where compelling circumstances for a private education have been found to exist. <i>See In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. at 58. It concluded, in effect, that the Watsons had not shown any educational necessities or special circumstances why their children needed to attend parochial school in lieu of the available public school. The court went on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only reason advanced by [the debtors] is preferential, i.e., their children have always attended parochial school because of the family's strong religious ties.... Allowing these Debtors to pay parochial school tuition which over the life of the Plan will exceed the amount distributed to creditors, is to require general creditors to fund the private education of the Debtors' kids.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 58-59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, we defer broadly to the bankruptcy court's determinations in a matter of this type, which entail balancing the creditors' rights against the appropriate basic needs of the debtors and their dependents. We can find no clear error in the balance the court struck here in its thoughtful opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Watsons complain that they were unfairly criticized by the court for what it found was their unwillingness to forgo certain \"borderline and/or excessive expenses\" while also claiming the tuition expense. We have examined the record and see no clear error in the court's overall assessment in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To allow the Watsons to pay parochial school tuition over the life of the proposed plan would require already severely reduced creditors to fund the private education of the Watsons' children. We can appreciate the importance attached by the Watsons to the religious values of a parochial school education. Still, it is not impossible to inculcate those values outside of a school, and the court could reasonably conclude, in the circumstances presented here, that it would be improper to impose the added expense on the Watsons' unpaid creditors where the children's educational needs could otherwise be met in the public schools. There was no clear error in the bankruptcy court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

The bankruptcy court denied confirmation on the ground the Watsons failed to establish that all projected \"disposable income\" received during the plan period would be applied to make payments under the plan. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B). In particular, the bankruptcy court determined that the cost of sending the Watsons' two minor children to parochial school was neither a \"reasonably necessary\" expense nor a \"charitable contribution\" &#8212; each of which is excluded from the definition of \"disposable income\" under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). <i>See In re Watson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1994798\"><a href=\"/opinion/1994798/in-re-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 58-60 (Bankr.D.R.I.2003).

This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they did not make the same argument in the bankruptcy court, the Watsons argue in this appeal that to deny confirmation of the plan because of its provision for paying the cost of sending the children to parochial school burdens the protected exercise of their Catholic faith, in contradiction of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as amended. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb-1 <i>et seq.</i> They also argue that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the parochial school tuition payments were not reasonably necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2003, the Watsons filed a joint case under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1301 <i>et seq.</i> Their Schedules I and J showed net monthly income of $5,770, expenses of $4,194, and disposable income of $1,576. Their proposed Chapter 13 plan provided for thirty-six monthly payments of $1,576 (total $56,736), which would have paid to unsecured creditors twenty-five percent of their claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chapter 13 trustee, John Boyajian (\"Trustee\"), objected to confirmation of the plan on the ground that the Watsons were not contributing all of their disposable income as required under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> \"Disposable income\" is defined as: \"income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended &#8212; (A) for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor, including charitable contributions.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). The Trustee objected in particular to a claimed expense of $735 per month for parochial school tuition for the Watsons' two minor children. The Watsons, who are Catholics, maintained that the expense is reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The Watsons also argued in the alternative that the expense is a \"charitable contribution,\" hence a reasonably necessary expense under the amended definition of \"disposable income\" provided by the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Act of 1998. <i>See supra</i> note 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing before the bankruptcy court, Mr. Watson testified that he, his wife, and their two children are devout Catholics who attend church every Sunday and during all the holy days of obligation. Mr. Watson testified that he is actively involved in church ministry, and that his children have been assisting at mass since the third grade. Mr. Watson stated that he and his wife have always sent their children to parochial schools because they value the importance such schools place on God.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further briefing and oral argument, the bankruptcy court, on September 15, 2003, issued an order denying confirmation of the plan, finding (1) that the tuition expense is not reasonably necessary, and (2) that the tuition is not a charitable contribution excluded under the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act of 1998. <i>In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. at 57. The bankruptcy court found that the Watsons had \"claimed many borderline and/or excessive expenses,\" that they were \"unwilling to extend their plan beyond three years,\" and that their plan therefore failed to demonstrate good faith. <i>Id.</i> at 58. The order denying confirmation of the plan provided that, in accordance with the local bankruptcy rules, the Watsons had eleven days within which to file an amended plan. <i>Id.</i> at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 2003, the Watsons appealed from the order to the bankruptcy appellate panel (\"BAP\"). Thereafter, the Watsons filed in the bankruptcy court a motion to stay pending appeal. On October 27, 2003, the bankruptcy court entered an order denying the stay motion and dismissing the case. The order stated as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The BAP concluded that the bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan was interlocutory and not final because the Watsons were \"free to propose an alternate plan.\" <i>Id.</i> at 659. The BAP made no mention of the bankruptcy court's subsequent order denying the motion to stay pending appeal and dismissing the case. <i>See id.</i> (\"Here, the Bankruptcy Court did not dismiss the case....\"). In spite of its determination that the bankruptcy court's 9/15/03 order was interlocutory, the BAP exercised jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3), providing for review of interlocutory orders, and affirmed. <i>Id.</i> at 657, 659.

The entry states: \"Trustee suggested extending the time to file an amended plan until 10 days after a decision on the case by the BAP. Parties consent to this and will submit an order.\" The Watsons, however, never filed an amended plan within the ten-day grace period following the BAP's judgment which was issued on May 21, 2004. Instead, on June 15, 2004, 25 days later, they filed a timely appeal to this Court. Their appeal had the effect of transferring jurisdiction here from the bankruptcy court. <i>See Griggs v.

This case, while not wholly identical, is conceptually similar to <i>Parque.</i> The bankruptcy court's 10/27/03 order dismissing the case left it open only \"[f]or administrative purposes\" designed to permit the filing of an amended plan within ten days after the BAP's decision came down. After that period had expired, the only remaining limitation upon total dismissal was the taking of an appeal to our court, an event which in no way compromised the finality of the bankruptcy court's own order. Dismissal and closure of a case are distinct events, and there is no reason why a case cannot be dismissed but kept open for limited administrative purposes. <i>See Armel Laminates, Inc. v. Lomas &amp; Nettleton Co. (In re Income Prop.

We are satisfied that in the circumstances the appealed bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan was rendered final by the later order and occurrences.

Religious Freedom Restoration Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Watsons argue on appeal that the bankruptcy court's order denying confirmation of the plan substantially burdens the protected exercise of their Catholic faith in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), as amended by the Protection of Religious Exercise in Land Use and Institutionalized Persons (\"RLUIPA\"). <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000bb-1, 2000cc-2000cc-5. This argument, however, was never made to, nor considered by, the bankruptcy court. It is true the Watsons alluded briefly to the RFRA in briefs submitted to the bankruptcy court and in vague references in their second oral argument in that court. In each instance, however, the Watsons only raised the RFRA in relation to the argument that parochial school tuition payments constituted charitable contributions &#8212; an issue decided against them below and not now appealed to this Court. <i>See supra</i> note 1. The bankruptcy court did not mention the RFRA in its opinion. In a brief later submitted on appeal to the BAP, the Watsons discussed the RFRA, referenced the RLUIPA by citation, and admitted that the RFRA issue had not been \"fully briefed below.\" In affirming the order denying confirmation of the plan, the BAP held that the RFRA does not afford the Watsons the right to use disposable income for parochial school tuition. <i>In re Watson,</i> 309 B.R. at 663.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's failure to raise an issue in the bankruptcy court forfeits its right to raise that issue for the first time on appeal in this Court. <i>Evergreen Credit Union v.

The Watsons' brief references below to the RFRA, made in context of their charitable contributions argument, were not tantamount to the RFRA and RLUIPA arguments now advanced on appeal. <i>Cf. McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (refusing to address issue where plaintiff, in the district court, \"made passing mention of the general point &#8212; a mention which, in its entirety, comprised two sentences and one citation (to a tangentially relevant case)\"). The rule that a party may not raise an argument for the first time on appeal is elemental. <i>In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d at 26. While we have discretion in exceptional circumstances to address an issue not raised below, no exceptional circumstances exist here. <i>See Sheridan v. Michels (In re Sheridan),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200940\"><a href=\"/opinion/200940/sheridan-v-michels/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 105 (1st Cir.2004) (noting our discretion in \"rare instances\" to review an issue not raised below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize the BAP saw fit to address the Watsons' RFRA contention. But the BAP's action does not cure the matter from our perspective. <i>See In re Woodman,</i> 379 F.3d at 3 n. 1. The effective administration of our judicial system requires that ordinarily each and every non-jurisdictional issue to be determined be initially presented to the nisi prius tribunal. That a separate court in the appellate chain, for its own reasons, chose to overlook the breach of this rule does not bind our court. As the Watsons have forfeited the RFRA argument, we do not now consider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonably Necessary Expenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Watsons contend that the bankruptcy court erred in determining that parochial school tuition payments for their two minor children are not reasonably necessary expenses within the provisions of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b). To qualify for confirmation, the Chapter 13 plan must provide \"that all of the debtor's disposable income to be received in the three-year period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payment under the plan.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B). \"Disposable income\" is defined as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor, including charitable contributions ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). At issue here is whether the portion of the Watsons' income devoted to pay parochial school tuition for their two minor children is income \"reasonably necessary\" to be expended for this purpose. In reviewing the bankruptcy court's determination of this matter, we review for \"clear error unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.\" <i>In re Carp,</i> 340 F.3d at 22. Here, the bankruptcy court's view of the guiding legal principles was not mistaken and the court did not commit clear factual error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the self-evident proposition that it is the debtor who bears the burden of proving that an expense is reasonably necessary. <i>See, e.g., Lynch v. Tate (In re Lynch),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1994794\"><a href=\"/opinion/1994794/in-re-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span>, 779 (W.D.N.C.2003); <i>In re Webb,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1550159\"><a href=\"/opinion/1550159/in-re-webb/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 688 (Bankr.E.D.Tex.2001). Here, the bankruptcy court concluded that the debtors \"have not shown that the public schools in their area ... are not adequate, and neither have they suggested any other special need [to attend parochial school].\" <i>In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. at 58. The court went on to allude to the general proposition advanced in <i>Webb</i> and by other bankruptcy courts that \"[i]n the absence of some compelling circumstance ... a private school education is not reasonably necessary.\" <i>In re Webb,</i> 262 B.R. at 690; <i>see, e.g., In re Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1543445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1543445/in-re-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 467 (Bankr.D.Minn.1985) (\"An expensive private school education is not a basic need of the Debtor's dependents....\"). The court then went on to distinguish the present case from other bankruptcy cases where compelling circumstances for a private education have been found to exist. <i>See In re Watson,</i> 299 B.R. at 58. It concluded, in effect, that the Watsons had not shown any educational necessities or special circumstances why their children needed to attend parochial school in lieu of the available public school. The court went on to say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only reason advanced by [the debtors] is preferential, i.e., their children have always attended parochial school because of the family's strong religious ties.... Allowing these Debtors to pay parochial school tuition which over the life of the Plan will exceed the amount distributed to creditors, is to require general creditors to fund the private education of the Debtors' kids.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 58-59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, we defer broadly to the bankruptcy court's determinations in a matter of this type, which entail balancing the creditors' rights against the appropriate basic needs of the debtors and their dependents. We can find no clear error in the balance the court struck here in its thoughtful opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Watsons complain that they were unfairly criticized by the court for what it found was their unwillingness to forgo certain \"borderline and/or excessive expenses\" while also claiming the tuition expense. We have examined the record and see no clear error in the court's overall assessment in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To allow the Watsons to pay parochial school tuition over the life of the proposed plan would require already severely reduced creditors to fund the private education of the Watsons' children. We can appreciate the importance attached by the Watsons to the religious values of a parochial school education. Still, it is not impossible to inculcate those values outside of a school, and the court could reasonably conclude, in the circumstances presented here, that it would be improper to impose the added expense on the Watsons' unpaid creditors where the children's educational needs could otherwise be met in the public schools. There was no clear error in the bankruptcy court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the United States Bankruptcy Court denying confirmation of the plan is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Watsons do not contend on appeal that the bankruptcy court erred in rejecting their argument that the parochial school tuition payments were charitable contributions within the definition of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(2)(A). We do not, therefore, address this issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)(1)(B) provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If the trustee ... objects to the confirmation of the plan, then the court may not approve the plan unless, as of the effective date of the plan &#8212; (B) the plan provides that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in the three-year period beginning on the date that the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments under the plan.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To avoid future questions, we suggest that such seemingly open-ended orders add a proviso to the effect that if the debtor does not timely take the actions in Local Rule 3015-3(e)(1), (2) or (3), or does not take an action under (4), then the order is final as entered</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
