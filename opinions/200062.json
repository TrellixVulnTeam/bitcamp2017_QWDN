Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Michael J. Iacopino and Brennan, Caron, Lenehan & Iacopino on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and Mark E.\nHoward, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 7, 2002\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.      This appeal raises an interesting\n\nquestion about a defendant's entitlement to a \"missing witness\"\n\ninstruction with respect to a confidential informant (CI) whose\n\ntestimony the government elected not to present at trial.                  We\n\nuphold    the   district    court's   refusal    to    give   the   requested\n\ninstruction, and, consequently, affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\n            This case has its roots in an investigation that targeted\n\ntwo   suspected   drug     dealers,   \"Tony\"    and    \"Taboo.\"     The   lead\n\ninvestigator was Trooper Paul Hardcastle, a member of the New\n\nJersey State Police, working undercover in New Hampshire.                   On\n\nJanuary 11 — all dates are in the year 2000 — Hardcastle met the CI\n\nat a parking lot in Salem, New Hampshire.             He entered a number on\n\nhis cellular telephone and then handed the telephone to the CI with\n\ninstructions to arrange a purchase of crack cocaine.                  The CI\n\nobliged.    The number that Hardcastle called was listed to the\n\nresidence of defendant-appellant Juan Perez.\n\n            Shortly thereafter, the appellant arrived in the parking\n\nlot behind the wheel of a motor vehicle.              Hardcastle and the CI\n\napproached the car and gave the appellant $300.           A passenger in the\n\ncar, later identified as Manuel Guillen, then handed twenty packets\n\nof crack cocaine to Hardcastle.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The government's evidence at trial indicated that Perez and\nGuillen were \"Tony\" and \"Taboo.\"\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          On January 19, Hardcastle and the CI initiated a second\n\ntransaction in much the same manner.        The appellant again arrived\n\nat the parking lot in response to the CI's call.         When Hardcastle\n\nasked the appellant for larger quantities of crack cocaine, the\n\nappellant directed him to a second vehicle, occupied by José\n\nAntonio Garcia.       This vehicle was registered to the appellant.\n\n          Hardcastle planned the coup de grace to occur on March 8.\n\nHe provided \"buy money\" to the CI, who proceeded to the same\n\nparking lot under the watchful eyes of a police surveillance team.\n\nThe CI purchased crack cocaine from one Dione Bare.             Hardcastle\n\nthen recognized Garcia in the rear seat of another vehicle in the\n\nparking lot.        The police arrested the occupants of that vehicle\n\n(namely, Garcia, Guillen, and the appellant).\n\n             The grand jury indicted the appellant on one count of\n\nconspiracy     to    possess   controlled   substances   with   intent   to\n\ndistribute and four counts of distribution on specific dates.            See\n\n21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.       The government later dropped one of\n\nthe distribution counts.       At the ensuing trial, Hardcastle was the\n\nonly witness to identify the appellant as a first-hand participant\n\nin the January 11 and January 19 transactions.             The appellant\n\nchallenged this identification evidence, contending that Hardcastle\n\nhad made a mistake.       The CI was not called to testify.\n\n             At the close of the evidence, the appellant's request for\n\na missing witness instruction relating to the CI was denied.             The\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fjudge charged the jury, and the appellant properly preserved his\n\nrights.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 30.       The jurors found the appellant\n\nguilty on the four remaining counts.       The district court imposed a\n\nten-year incarcerative sentence.       This appeal followed.\n\n          In this venue, the appellant assigns error to the trial\n\ncourt's   refusal   to   give    the     sought-after   missing   witness\n\ninstruction.   He argues that the CI's testimony was essential to a\n\nfair determination of the central issue in the case:        the identity\n\nof the person with whom Hardcastle dealt on January 11 and January\n\n19.   We reject this argument.\n\n           The rationale behind a missing witness instruction is\n\nthat upon \"the failure of a party to produce available evidence\n\nthat would help decide an issue,\" the jury may infer \"that the\n\nevidence would [have been] unfavorable to the party to whom it is\n\navailable or whom it would ordinarily be expected to favor.\"\n\nUnited States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 597 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (citation omitted); accord United States v. Ariza-\n\nIbarra, 651 F.2d 2, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1981).       If other conditions are\n\nmet, a missing witness instruction is proper when a witness is\n\neither actually unavailable to the party seeking the instruction or\n\nso obviously partial to the other side that the witness is deemed\n\nto be legally unavailable.      See United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d\n\n620, 632 (1st Cir. 1992).       Thus, as a preliminary requirement to\n\nthe consideration of a missing witness instruction, a criminal\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdefendant must demonstrate that the uncalled witness is either\n\n\"favorably disposed\" to testify on behalf of the government by\n\nvirtue of status or relationship or \"peculiarly available\" to the\n\ngovernment.   United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 38 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    Once   past   that     point,      the    court   must    consider     the\n\nexplanation (if any) for the witness's absence and whether the\n\nwitness, if called, would be likely to provide relevant, non-\n\ncumulative testimony.      United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1336\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).   The decision to grant or deny such an instruction\n\nin a specific case is reviewed for abuse of discretion.                    DeLuca,\n\n137 F.3d at 38; Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1336.\n\n           Here, the appellant asseverates that the trial court\n\nabused its    discretion    in   refusing      to    give   a    missing   witness\n\ninstruction vis-à-vis the CI.          This asseveration lacks force.\n\n           Federal courts long have recognized that the government,\n\nin the due performance of its law enforcement functions, must rely\n\nto some extent on informants.          But tattling on criminals is risky\n\nbusiness, and confidentiality sometimes is a matter of life or\n\ndeath.   Identifying an informant (as, say, by calling him to the\n\nwitness stand) not only may expose that person to harm but also may\n\nbe seen as a breach of trust by others (making them reluctant to\n\ncooperate with the government in future cases).                 It is, therefore,\n\nwidely   acknowledged   that     the    government      has     a   \"privilege    to\n\nwithhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\finformation    of   violations    of    law   to    officers   charged    with\n\nenforcement of that law.\"        Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53,\n\n59 (1957).\n\n           To be sure, this privilege is qualified, not absolute.\n\nThere are circumstances in which the interests of justice require\n\nthat the privilege yield in order to preserve the accused's right\n\nto a fair trial.       See id. at 60-61.           But the privilege serves\n\nimportant ends, and the law places the burden squarely on the party\n\nseeking disclosure (typically, the defendant) to demonstrate that\n\nknowledge of the identity of a confidential informant is vital to\n\nthe proper preparation and presentation of his case.              See, e.g.,\n\nLewis, 40 F.3d at 1335; United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 130\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           This inquiry defies mechanical solutions: in determining\n\nwhether the privilege must give way, the trial court must consider\n\nthe particular circumstances of each case, balancing the accused's\n\nright to     prepare   and   present    his   defense   against   the    public\n\ninterest in acquiring needed information and the informant's stake\n\nin confidentiality.      United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 106\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).       The battle over entitlement to the privilege\n\ntypically is fought out in motion practice and other pretrial\n\nproceedings (including evidentiary hearings, where warranted).\n\nE.g., id. at 105-06; United States v. Bibbey, 735 F.2d 619, 621\n\n(1st Cir. 1984).        In recognition of the seminal case on the\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\finformant's privilege, pretrial evidentiary hearings devoted to\n\nthis issue have come to be known as \"Roviaro hearings.\"\n\n            In the instant case, the appellant eschewed the filing of\n\na motion for disclosure of the CI's identity.                  He likewise chose\n\nnot to ask the trial court to convene a Roviaro hearing.                  Instead,\n\nhe attempted an end run around the safeguards that attend the\n\nqualified privilege:         he waited until both sides had rested and\n\nthen, despite having made no effort to obtain the informant's\n\nidentity in the usual manner, implored the court to instruct the\n\njurors   that    they   could    draw      an     adverse   inference     from   the\n\ngovernment's failure to offer the CI's testimony.                    Under these\n\ncircumstances, we agree with the district court that the appellant\n\nwas not entitled to such an instruction.\n\n            The appellant argues that there is no strict requirement\n\nthat he file a motion requesting disclosure of an informant's\n\nidentity.    That may be so, but it is beside the pertinent point.\n\nIf a defendant moves for disclosure, and loses, then he is not\n\nentitled to a missing witness instruction.                 A defendant who elects\n\nnot to contest the matter at all hardly can be more advantaged.                   In\n\nall events, a negative inference is unwarranted as a matter of\n\nlogic. The fact that the government chose to withhold the identity\n\nof its informant does not, in and of itself, justify an adverse\n\ninference,      for   \"there    is   no    basis     for    concluding    that   the\n\ngovernment's      decision     not    to        reveal   the   identity    of    its\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fconfidential informant was the result of any consideration other\n\nthan its concern for the informant's safety and anonymity.\" United\n\nStates v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 925 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          The sockdolager is that to grant the appellant the\n\ninstruction that he seeks would undermine the Roviaro privilege —\n\nand without good reason.      At whatever stage of the proceedings the\n\nquestion arises, the accused has the burden to show that something\n\nspecial about   his    case   suffices   to   override   both   the   public\n\ninterest in encouraging the flow of information to law enforcement\n\nagencies and the source's private interest in his or her own\n\nsafety. See Martinez, 922 F.2d at 920-21; United States v. Hemmer,\n\n729 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1984).         A defendant cannot evade this\n\nresponsibility by the simple expedient of lying low until both\n\nsides have rested, and then attempting to treat the informant as a\n\nperson whose identity ought to have been revealed.\n\n          Viewed      in   this   light,      the   appellant's   argument\n\nnecessarily fails. After all, he did not make the showing required\n\nto overcome the Roviaro privilege (indeed, he did not even attempt\n\nto make it).    Since an inference unfavorable to the government\n\ncannot arise simply because the government decides not to call a\n\nconfidential informant to testify, the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in refusing to give the requested jury instruction.\n\n          If more were needed — and we do not think that it is — we\n\nremark that the appellant was permitted, in his summation, to argue\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthat       the    jury   should        draw   a     negative   inference    from       the\n\ngovernment's failure to bring forward the CI.                       Defense counsel\n\nhammered this point home, the prosecutor did not object, and the\n\ncourt gave no curative instruction.                    This is reminiscent of the\n\nsituation in Martinez, in which we wrote:\n\n                 We note here counsel was permitted, without\n                 objection by the government or instruction by\n                 the court, to argue to the jury that it should\n                 draw   a    negative    inference   from   the\n                 government's    failure    to    produce   its\n                 confidential informant.     Particularly under\n                 these circumstances, we have found that any\n                 claim that the denial of a \"missing witness\"\n                 instruction was detrimental to the defense is\n                 significantly undercut.\n\n922 F.2d at 925 (citation omitted); see also Ariza-Ibarra, 651 F.2d\n\nat 16 n.22 (explaining that the fact that the defendants argued,\n\nwithout objection or contrary instruction by the court, that the\n\njury should draw a negative inference from the government's failure\n\nto call a witness \"materially undercuts [their] argument that the\n\ndenial of         a   missing    witness      instruction      deprived   them    of    an\n\ninference favorable to the defense\").                   So it is here.\n\n                 We need go no further.2            We hold that where, as here, a\n\ncriminal         defendant      does    not    attempt    to    pierce    the    Roviaro\n\nprivilege, a missing witness instruction as to a confidential\n\n\n\n       2\n      The district court offered a salmagundi of other reasons for\ndenying the missing witness instruction (e.g., that the appellant's\ncounsel was engaging in \"gamesmanship\" and that, in all events, the\nCI's testimony would have been cumulative).      We need not reach\nthese issues.\n\n                                              -9-\n\finformant is improper. For that reason, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the appellant's request for such an\n\ninstruction.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

But tattling on criminals is risky business, and confidentiality sometimes is a matter of life or death. Identifying an informant (as, say, by calling him to the witness stand) not only may expose that person to harm but also may be seen as a breach of trust by others (making them reluctant to cooperate with the government in future cases). It is, therefore, widely acknowledged that the government has a \"privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\" <i>Roviaro v.

A defendant who elects not to contest the matter at all hardly can be more advantaged. In all events, a negative inference is unwarranted as a matter of logic. The fact that the government chose to withhold the identity of its informant does not, in and of itself, justify an adverse inference, for \"there is no basis for concluding that the government's decision not to reveal the identity of its confidential informant was the result of any consideration other than its concern for the informant's safety and anonymity.\" <i>United States v.

We uphold the district court's refusal to give the requested instruction, and, consequently, affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case has its roots in an investigation that targeted two suspected drug dealers, \"Tony\" and \"Taboo.\" The lead investigator was Trooper Paul Hardcastle, a member of the New Jersey State Police, working undercover in New Hampshire. On January 11 &#8212; all dates are in the year 2000 &#8212; Hardcastle met the CI at a parking lot in Salem, New Hampshire. He entered a number on his cellular telephone and then handed the telephone to the CI with instructions to arrange a purchase of crack cocaine. The CI obliged. The number that Hardcastle called was listed to the residence of defendant-appellant Juan Perez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the appellant arrived in the parking lot behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. Hardcastle and the CI approached the car and gave the appellant $300. A passenger in the car, later identified as Manuel Guillen, then handed twenty packets of crack cocaine to Hardcastle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, Hardcastle and the CI initiated a second transaction in much the same manner. The appellant again arrived at the parking lot in response to the CI's call. When Hardcastle asked the appellant for larger quantities of crack cocaine, the appellant directed him to a second vehicle, occupied by Jos&#233; Antonio Garcia. This vehicle was registered to the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardcastle planned the coup de grace to occur on March 8. He provided \"buy money\" to the CI, who proceeded to the same parking lot under the watchful eyes of a police surveillance team. The CI purchased crack cocaine from one Dione Bare. Hardcastle then recognized Garcia in the rear seat of another vehicle in the parking lot. The police arrested the occupants of that vehicle (namely, Garcia, Guillen, and the appellant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted the appellant on one count of conspiracy to possess controlled substances with intent to distribute and four counts of distribution on specific dates. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846. The government later dropped one of the distribution counts. At the ensuing trial, Hardcastle was the only witness to identify the appellant as a first-hand participant in the January 11 and January 19 transactions. The appellant challenged this identification evidence, contending that Hardcastle had made a mistake. The CI was not called to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the evidence, the appellant's request for a missing witness instruction relating to the CI was denied. The judge charged the jury, and the appellant properly preserved his rights. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. The jurors found the appellant guilty on the four remaining counts. The district court imposed a ten-year incarcerative sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant assigns error to the trial court's refusal to give the sought-after missing witness instruction. He argues that the CI's testimony was essential to a fair determination of the central issue in the case: the identity of the person with whom Hardcastle dealt on January 11 and January 19. We reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale behind a missing witness instruction is that upon \"the failure of a party to produce available evidence that would help decide an issue,\" the jury may infer \"that the evidence would [have been] unfavorable to the party to whom it is available or whom it would ordinarily be expected to favor.\" <i>United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526736\"><a href=\"/opinion/526736/united-states-v-st-michaels-credit-union-and-janice-sacharczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 597 (1st Cir.1989) (citation omitted); <i>accord United States v.

If other conditions are met, a missing witness instruction is proper when a witness is either actually unavailable to the party seeking the instruction or so obviously partial to the other side that the witness is deemed to be legally unavailable. <i>See United States v. Spinosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597409\"><a href=\"/opinion/597409/united-states-v-vincent-d-spinosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 632 (1st Cir.1992). Thus, as a preliminary requirement to the consideration of a missing witness instruction, a criminal defendant must demonstrate that the uncalled witness is either \"favorably disposed\" to testify on behalf of the government by virtue of status or relationship or \"peculiarly available\" to the government. <i>United States v. DeLuca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751763\"><a href=\"/opinion/751763/united-states-v-robert-p-deluca-sr-united-states-of-america-v-gerard/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1998).
