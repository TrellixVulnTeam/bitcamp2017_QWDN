An automobile manufacturer upset\n\none of its existing franchisees when it decided to open a new\n\ndealership near the existing franchise.    The franchisee brought a\n\ndiversity action, alleging that the manufacturer's actions violated\n\nstate law.   Following a bench trial, the district court entered\n\njudgment for the manufacturer.      The franchisee now appeals.   We\n\nconsider whether the district court erred in either its evidentiary\n\nadmissions or factual findings and, discerning no error, affirm the\n\ncourt's judgment.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           Plaintiff-appellant Gallo Motor Corporation (\"Gallo\")\n\nbecame a dealer for defendant-appellee Mazda Motor of America, Inc.\n\n(\"Mazda\") in 1994, when Gallo acquired an existing Mazda dealership\n\non Shrewsbury Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Gallo management\n\ndecided to purchase the franchise despite its awareness of other\n\nMazda dealers in the area.\n\n           Like all new Mazda franchisees, Gallo was assigned a\n\nspecific geographic area called a Statistical Observation Area\n\n(\"SOA\").   Mazda uses the SOA to monitor its dealers' performances.\n\nBy comparing new vehicle registrations in each SOA with industry-\n\nwide benchmarks (such as Mazda's national and regional market\n\nshares), Mazda is able to determine whether sales in a particular\n\nSOA are above or below average.     Gallo's assigned SOA encompassed\n\nall of Worcester and neighboring Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            At the time Gallo purchased the franchise, Mazda's sales\n\nin   the   Worcester-Shrewsbury   SOA    were   below   the   national     and\n\nregional averages.     Because Mazda believed that the poor location\n\nof the Shrewsbury Street dealership (in Worcester) was at least\n\npartially to blame for the substandard sales, it conditioned its\n\napproval of the Gallo franchise on Gallo's agreement to relocate\n\nthe dealership from Shrewsbury Street to Gold Star Boulevard (also\n\nin Worcester).     Gallo agreed to an eventual relocation.\n\n            In 1997, approximately three years after Gallo began\n\noperating    the   Shrewsbury   Street   dealership     but   prior   to   its\n\nrelocation, Mazda commissioned market studies to evaluate more than\n\n80 of its metropolitan market areas throughout the country.            These\n\nstudies were part of a \"dealer revitalization program,\" which was\n\ndesigned both to eliminate dealers with poor performance records\n\nand to maximize the efficiencies of the remaining dealerships.\n\n            Based on market data from 1994 through 1997, the studies\n\nrevealed that the greater Worcester area, which encompasses Gallo's\n\nWorcester-Shrewsbury SOA as well as the neighboring Westborough\n\nSOA, was not performing at an optimal level.            At the time of the\n\nstudies, this area contained three dealerships: Gallo, North End,\n\nand Roy Rioux.     A report accompanying the studies cautioned that,\n\nwhile three dealerships were sufficient for the area, all three\n\ndealerships needed to achieve superior sales and service records if\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fMazda was to achieve its expected market share in the greater\n\nWorcester area.\n\n           In 1998, the number of Mazda dealerships in the greater\n\nWorcester area decreased from three to two when Roy Rioux closed\n\nits doors.     Located on Route 9 in Westborough, Massachusetts, the\n\nformer Rioux dealership was approximately 7.6 miles away from\n\nGallo's Shrewsbury Street facility in Worcester. Unable to find an\n\nacceptable buyer for the Rioux facility, Mazda quickly began\n\nsearching for a new dealership to service the Westborough area.\n\n             After considering a number of factors, including the 1997\n\ngreater Worcester area market study, Mazda's management determined\n\nthat a new dealership on Route 9 would lead to greater market\n\npenetration in the Westborough SOA.                 Accordingly, in late 1998,\n\nMazda   entered    into   an    agreement         with   Ford   Motor   Company   to\n\nestablish a joint Lincoln-Mercury/Mazda dealership (\"MetroWest\") on\n\nRoute 9   in    Shrewsbury,         just   over    the   Westborough    town   line.\n\nMeanwhile, in March 1999, Gallo relocated from Shrewsbury Street to\n\nGold Star Boulevard in Worcester pursuant to its franchising\n\nagreement with Mazda.\n\n             On August 16, 1999, three months after Gallo's move,\n\nMazda   notified    Gallo      by    certified      mail   of   its   intention   to\n\nestablish a new dealership \"at the Southwest corner of Route 9 and\n\nWalnut Street in Westborough, Massachusetts\" (emphasis added).\n\nAlthough the letter's description provided an accurate street\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\faddress, it incorrectly identified the new dealership's site as\n\nWestborough instead of Shrewsbury. Based on this defective letter,\n\nGallo management assumed that the new dealership was effectively\n\nreplacing the former Rioux dealership in Westborough. Accordingly,\n\nit neither objected nor inquired further.\n\n          With no pending protests, Mazda and Ford proceeded with\n\ntheir plans to establish the MetroWest dealership.         At completion,\n\nthe $3.8 million facility –- located approximately 6.5 miles away\n\nfrom Gallo's Gold Star Boulevard dealership in Worcester –- was\n\nentirely Ford-owned.\n\n          In March 2001, just a few months prior to MetroWest's\n\ngrand   opening,   Gallo   management   discovered    that    the   joint\n\ndealership   was   located   in   Shrewsbury   -–    not     Westborough.\n\nManagement immediately contacted Mazda's Regional General Manager\n\nto express concern.    On June 21, 2001, Gallo's counsel sent Mazda\n\na letter complaining about both the establishment of the MetroWest\n\ndealership and Mazda's failure to provide Gallo with the notice\n\nrequired by Massachusetts law.     On July 13, 2001, Mazda's counsel\n\nresponded with a corrected notice letter, which confirmed Mazda's\n\nintention to proceed with the MetroWest dealership.\n\n          Gallo thereafter filed a diversity action in federal\n\ndistrict court, alleging violations of Massachusetts' so-called\n\n\"Dealer's Bill of Rights.\"    See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B) (amended\n\n2002). Specifically, Gallo claimed that Mazda's MetroWest decision\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fwas arbitrary and that Mazda had failed to provide adequate notice\n\nof its decision.   The pertinent text of the statute, as it existed\n\nat the time of trial, is reproduced below.\n\n          [It is a violation for a manufacturer]\n          arbitrarily and without notice to existing\n          franchisees . . . to grant or enter into a\n          franchise or selling agreement to or with an\n          additional franchisee who intends or would be\n          required by such franchise selling agreement\n          to conduct its dealership operations from a\n          place of business situated within the relevant\n          market area of an existing franchisee . . . .\n          ...\n          Any manufacturer . . . which intends to grant\n          or enter into an additional franchise or\n          selling agreement, shall, at least sixty days\n          prior to granting such franchise or entering\n          into such agreement, give written notice of\n          its intention to do so to each motor vehicle\n          dealer with a franchise or selling agreement\n          covering the same line make within a twenty\n          mile radius of the location where the business\n          of the proposed franchise will be located.\n          Such notice shall state the date on or after\n          which such proposed franchise shall be granted\n          or entered into.\n          ...\n          In   determining    whether   such    proposed\n          appointment is arbitrary, the court shall\n          consider all pertinent circumstances. These\n          may include but are not limited to: [a list of\n          eight lengthy statutory factors].1\n\n\n     1\n      As summarized by the district court, these factors include\n\"(i) the economic justification for the new franchise; (ii) the\nrecord of the objecting dealer, and other dealers in the area, in\nexploiting the relevant market; (iii) the investment in their\nfranchises of the objecting dealer and other dealers in the\nrelevant market area; (iv) the permanency of the investment of such\ndealers in the relevant market area; (v) whether the proposed\ndealership serves the public interest; (vi) whether such dealers\nprovide adequate competition and convenient customer care; (vii)\nwhether such dealers offer satisfactory facilities, equipment,\n\n                                -6-\n\fMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), § 4(3)(l) (amended 2002).\n\n          During the five-day bench trial, Gallo sought to prove\n\nthe arbitrariness of Mazda's decision by arguing, inter alia, the\n\npresence/absence of the statutory factors.    Gallo also asserted\n\nthat Mazda's decision was influenced more by Ford's participation\n\nin the MetroWest facility –- in particular, Ford's financing -–\n\nthan by any rational weighing of the pros and cons.\n\n          Unconvinced, the district court entered judgment for\n\nMazda.   See Gallo Motor Ctr. Corp., 204 F. Supp. 2d at 150, 156.\n\nAfter considering \"all pertinent circumstances,\" see id. at 151\n\n(quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), § 4(3)(l) (amended 2002)),\n\nincluding several of the eight statutory factors, the court found\n\nthat \"Gallo has not sustained its burden of demonstrating [by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence] that Mazda's establishment of the\n\nMetroWest dealership is arbitrary[;] [t]o the contrary, Mazda's new\n\ndealership promotes competition which, in turn, benefits the public\n\ninterest.\"   Id. at 156.     Regarding Gallo's claim that Mazda\n\nprovided inadequate notice of its MetroWest decision, the court\n\nfound that \"[although] the notice given by Mazda on August 16, 1999\n\nwas defective and inadequate[,] [i]ts subsequent letter of July 13,\n\n\n\n\nvehicle parts and qualified personnel; and (viii) whether the\nestablishment of an additional franchise would increase competition\nand therefore be in the public interest.\"         Gallo Motor Ctr.\nCorp. v. Mazda Motor of Am., Inc., 204 F. Supp. 2d 144, 151 (D.\nMass. 2002) (citing Mass. Gen Laws ch. 93(B), § 4(3)(l) (amended\n2002)).\n\n                               -7-\n\f2001 was . . . effective statutory notice pursuant to Chapter 93B.\"\n\nId. at 150.\n\n            This appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Essentially, we are presented with two broad questions:\n\n(1) whether the district court improperly admitted and considered\n\ncertain evidence; and (2) whether, as a result of improperly\n\nweighing the evidence, the district court erred in its factual\n\nfindings.\n\n            Given these separate questions, two standards of review\n\napply.2     First, we review a district court's decision to admit\n\nevidence for abuse of discretion.         See Larch v. Mansfield Mun.\n\nElec. Dept., 272 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir. 2001); see also United\n\nStates v. Davis, 261 F.3d 1, 42 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"A trial court\n\nenjoys considerable discretion in connection with the admission or\n\nexclusion of evidence.\").    Second, we review findings of fact for\n\nclear error.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); Persson v. Scotia Prince\n\nCruises, Ltd., 330 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 2003).      Under the clear-\n\nerror standard, \"we will give . . . [factual] findings effect\n\nunless, after carefully reading the record and according due\n\ndeference to the trial court, we form a strong, unyielding belief\n\n\n\n     2\n      To the extent that answering these questions first requires\nan interpretation of the relevant statute, we shall provide a de\nnovo reading. See Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 337 F.3d 17,\n29 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthat a mistake has been made.\"       Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nGiragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1995) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n          A.   Evidentiary Admissions\n\n          Gallo   contends    that    the   district   court   improperly\n\nadmitted and considered (1) Mazda's 1997 market study, (2) a report\n\nauthored in 2002 by a Mazda expert, and (3) evidence of Gallo\n\nmanagement's state of mind.    We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n(1) The 1997 Market Study\n\n          According to Gallo, \"[t]he plain language of [Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch.] 93(B), § 4(3)(l) renders Mazda's 1997 . . . market study\n\nobsolete and unworthy of consideration.\"       For support, Gallo looks\n\nto one of the eight non-exhaustive statutory factors that a court\n\nmay consider when determining arbitrariness:\n\n          the   retail  sales   and   service   business\n          transacted by the . . . dealers with a place\n          of business in the market area to be served by\n          the additional franchisee during the three\n          year period immediately preceding [the notice\n          required by this statute].\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), § 4(3)(l)(ii) (emphasis added). Because\n\nthe 1997 study was based on data that existed outside this three-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fyear window,3 Gallo argues that it should have been excluded as\n\nirrelevant.\n\n             Gallo's argument misses the mark. As the district court\n\ncorrectly noted, the eight statutory factors are neither exhaustive\n\nnor definitive.         We need not even resort to case law for support;\n\nthe   statute      is    unambiguous.              \"In   determining      whether    [the\n\nestablishment of the new dealership] is arbitrary, the court shall\n\nconsider all pertinent circumstances.                    These may include but are\n\nnot limited to [the eight factors].\"                        Id. § 4(3)(l) (emphases\n\nadded).    So while we agree with Gallo that the statutory language\n\nis \"plain,\" we disagree with Gallo's interpretation of it.\n\n            The statutory language is sufficiently broad to permit\n\nthe   admission         of    the     1997    market     study.       \"All   pertinent\n\ncircumstances\"          means    all     pertinent       circumstances.        That    a\n\nparticular piece of evidence does not fall within the purview of a\n\nparticular factor in a non-exhaustive statutory list is not a sound\n\nbasis for objecting to its admissibility.                     Although Gallo did not\n\nreceive its formal statutory notice until 2001, Mazda had made its\n\nMetroWest decision two years earlier, as evidenced by the defective\n\nnotice    letter    dated       August       16,    1999.     Mazda's     decision    was\n\npartially    based       on     the   1997    study      –-   a   major   market    study\n\n\n      3\n      As discussed above, the district court held that, while\nMazda's initial notice on August 16, 1999, was defective,\neffective notice was given on July 13, 2001.       Therefore, for\npurposes of Gallo's argument, the critical dates are July 13, 1998\nthrough July 13, 2001.\n\n                                             -10-\n\fcommissioned for the purpose of evaluating Mazda's businesses and\n\nbusiness opportunities.           The results of this study are not only\n\n\"pertinent\"    to   an   arbitrariness        inquiry,   they   are    important.\n\nAccordingly, the court did not abuse its broad discretion in\n\ndetermining that the 1997 study was relevant to an arbitrariness\n\ninquiry.   See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 444 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (noting that the district court has broad discretion in\n\nmaking relevancy determinations).\n\n(2) The 2002 expert report\n\n             Next, Gallo asserts that Mazda's 2002 expert report was\n\nan \"after-the-fact justification\" for the MetroWest facility that\n\nshould have been excluded.4           For support, Gallo cites two cases,\n\neach of which involves a lawsuit that closely parallels this one.\n\nSee Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 440\n\nN.E.2d 29 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982); Richard Lundgren, Inc. v. Am.\n\nHonda Motor Co., Inc., 1994 WL 879478 (Mass. Super. 1994).\n\n             Neither case controls.        In both cases, the court found\n\narbitrariness despite the assembly of after-the-fact market data --\n\nnot because of it.           In Ricky Smith, the court noted that the\n\nfactfinder     \"could    .    .   .   consider    the    absence      of   careful\n\nconsideration or relevant data at the time the [franchising]\n\nappointment was made as evidence that the . . . franchise was\n\n\n\n     4\n      The report concluded, inter alia, that the addition of the\nMetroWest dealership was justified.\n\n                                       -11-\n\farbitrarily granted, despite [the manufacturer's] assembly, after\n\nthe fact, of information which tended to support its actions.\" 440\n\nN.E.2d at 43 (emphases added).              Similarly, in Richard Lundgren,\n\nthe court found that, while witnesses for the manufacturer \"have\n\nstrived diligently to assemble after-the-fact market data in an\n\nattempt to support its action, . . . the intended creation of a new\n\ndealership . . . was not based on any careful consideration of\n\nrelevant market data at the time, and was hence arbitrary.\"                1994\n\nWL 879478, at *5 (emphasis added).              Neither case held that after-\n\nthe-fact data must be excluded or that a manufacturer must conduct\n\na contemporaneous market study.\n\n               Here, the district court considered several pieces of\n\nevidence, most of which involved pre-MetroWest data.5                 Mazda, of\n\ncourse, could not have based its 1999 MetroWest decision on the\n\n2002       expert   report.   Such   a    report,    then,   merely   serves   as\n\nadditional relevant evidence supporting Mazda's decision –- a\n\ndecision that was based on \"careful consideration of relevant\n\nmarket data at the time.\"       See id.         An after-the-fact study is not\n\nper se irrelevant to the court's analysis of arbitrariness because,\n\nas here, it can provide an account of the \"pertinent circumstances\"\n\nthat the court is statutorily required to consider.               Accordingly,\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       Mazda based its decision on, inter alia, the 1997 market\nstudy, the closure of the Rioux dealership, and the need to improve\nits market share.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fthe district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this\n\nexpert report.\n\n(3) The State-Of-Mind Evidence\n\n          In its final attack on the admissibility of evidence,\n\nGallo asserts that the district court improperly admitted evidence\n\nof Gallo management's \"state of mind.\"   At issue is the following\n\nstatement by the court:\n\n                 [Gallo] has consistently voiced no\n                 objection to the introduction of a\n                 dealership in Westborough, the Town in\n                 which the Roy Rioux dealership was\n                 located, because it is sufficiently\n                 removed from [the Gallo] dealership [so\n                 as] to pose little competitive threat.\n                 . . . Notwithstanding the perceived\n                 difference   between   Shrewsbury   and\n                 Westborough, [management's] lack of\n                 concern about a Westborough competitor\n                 seriously undercuts [its] claim that\n                 Mazda's decision to establish MetroWest\n                 was arbitrary.\n\nGallo, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 155.\n\n          According to Gallo, the \"all pertinent circumstances\"\n\nlanguage in the statute \"does not extend to evidence which is\n\ndirectly contrary to the statute's intent.\"       Seeking de novo\n\nreview, Gallo argues that, because the eight statutory factors\n\nemphasize public interest concerns and objective evidence, evidence\n\nas to management's state of mind is irrelevant \"to the objective\n\nexamination of the benefit or detriment that the new dealership\n\nwill pose to the consuming public.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f           We are not convinced.          As discussed above, the broad\n\nlanguage in the statute permits a court to consider a wide range of\n\nfactors –- public and private, objective and subjective, statutory\n\nand    non-statutory   -–   when     making     its    determination   of\n\narbitrariness.     Cf. Ricky Smith, 440 N.E.2d at 43 (noting that,\n\ngiven the language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), the lower court\n\n\"could have properly considered [the manufacturer's] conduct prior\n\nto [the new dealership's] appointment as manifesting indifference\n\nto the statute and to the impact that the new dealer would have on\n\nexisting franchisees\").\n\n           In failing to object to the proposed Westborough site (as\n\nerroneously noted in the 1999 notice letter), Gallo management\n\nundermined   its   subsequent   position      that    MetroWest's   actual\n\nShrewsbury location was arbitrary.         See Gallo, 204 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n155.   This evidence, itself a \"pertinent circumstance,\" is further\n\nsupported by several other \"pertinent circumstances\": (1) the close\n\nproximity of MetroWest to the Westborough border (less than one-\n\nhalf mile), id.; (2) the fact that MetroWest's actual Shrewsbury\n\nlocation is only one mile closer to Gallo's Gold Star dealership\n\nthan the former Rioux dealership was to Gallo's initial Shrewsbury\n\nStreet dealership, id.; and (3) the testimony of Gallo management\n\nthat, in its opinion, the greater Worcester market area was not\n\n\"overdealered\" when it purchased the Shrewsbury Street franchise\n\n(despite the presence of the Rioux dealership). Given all these\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f\"pertinent circumstances,\" the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion       when    it    considered    relevant    evidence   of      Gallo\n\nmanagement's failure to object.\n\n            B.    Factual Findings\n\n            Gallo       next   contends     that   the   district   court    (1)\n\nimproperly focused on evidence of Mazda's market share to the\n\nneglect of other statutory factors, (2) improperly assessed Gallo's\n\nperformance in the Westborough market instead of the Worcester\n\nmarket, (3) improperly construed Gallo management's state of mind,\n\nand (4) improperly weighed Ford's participation in the MetroWest\n\ndecision.    We find no clear error.\n\n(1) The Market-Share Evidence\n\n             Gallo claims that the district court clearly erred when\n\nit \"focus[ed] on Mazda's market share without [giving] sufficient\n\nconsideration to other [statutory] factors.\"                Arguing that the\n\ndistrict court's findings were against the weight of the evidence,\n\nGallo asserts that the district court gave too little weight to the\n\n\"voluminous factual and expert evidence\" regarding, inter alia, the\n\nadequacy of its facilities and the substantial amount and permanent\n\nnature of its investment.\n\n            We disagree.         As the district court explained in its\n\nthorough opinion,\n\n            [t]he factors constituting the calculus of\n            arbitrariness are neither exhaustive nor\n            definitive. The statute pointedly directs a\n            court to consider all pertinent circumstances.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f            By implication, courts need not perform a\n            mechanical analysis of all the elements that\n            may    have   bearing   upon   whether   the\n            establishment of a proposed dealership is\n            arbitrary.    Common sense, experience and\n            expert   opinion   may  properly   serve  as\n            guideposts in th[e] [c]ourt's arbitrariness\n            analysis.\n\nGallo,    204   F.    Supp.    2d   at    151    (internal    citation    omitted).\n\nFurther, as this Court has explained,\n\n            in a jury-waived case, appellate courts cannot\n            presume to decide factual issues anew. . . .\n            If the district court's account of the\n            evidence is plausible in light of the record\n            reviewed in its entirety, the court of appeals\n            may not reverse it even though convinced that\n            had it been sitting as trier of fact, it would\n            have weighed the evidence differently.\n\nCumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (internal citation omitted).                  Here, because the market-\n\nshare statistics were reliable and telling indicators of Mazda's\n\nbelow-average        performance     in   the     region,    we   are   not   at   all\n\nconvinced that we even would have weighed the evidence differently.\n\nAccordingly, we discern no clear error.\n\n(2) The Assessment of Gallo's Performance\n\n            In its written opinion, the district court stated that\n\nthe \"thorny question is . . . whether Mazda's existing dealership\n\nnetwork,    without      the   MetroWest         site,    adequately    serves     the\n\nWestborough area . . . .\"           Gallo, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 154 (emphasis\n\nadded).    Gallo argues on appeal that, because the new MetroWest\n\nfacility was established to serve the Worcester market, the statute\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\frequires the court to evaluate the arbitrariness of the MetroWest\n\ndecision in terms of whether or not Gallo and other Mazda dealers\n\nwere    adequately     serving     the    Worcester          market    –-   not    the\n\n\"Westborough area.\"       For support, Gallo notes that five of the\n\neight statutory factors refer to \"the market area to be served by\n\nthe additional       franchisee.\"        See    Mass.     Gen.   Laws    ch.   93(B),\n\n§ 4(3)(l)(ii)-(iv), (vi)-(vii).                Further, Gallo seeks de novo\n\nreview of this particular question \"since the interpretation of\n\n[Chapter 93B] is an issue of law\" and \"the plain language of the\n\nstatute    does    not   contemplate           or     sanction    this      [']thorny\n\nquestion['].\"\n\n              Irrespective of the standard of review that ought to\n\napply, we discern no basis for reversing because of this finding.\n\nGiven Gallo's previous position on the relevant market, which it\n\nnow abandons, our finding should come as no surprise.                       At trial,\n\nGallo's own expert testified that the area to be served by the\n\nMetroWest dealership was the combined SOAs of Gallo and the \"add-\n\npoint,\" which includes Westborough.                 Moreover, Gallo's expert not\n\nonly testified that the Worcester and Westborough markets were\n\nlinked historically, he also presented an analysis based on an\n\nopinion that the two markets ought to be considered together.\n\nWhile   not    dispositive,      this    evidence       is   telling     because    it\n\nindicates that, at least at trial, Gallo believed an accurate\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fassessment of its performance would require an inquiry into markets\n\nother than just Worcester.\n\n            The district court was thorough in its analysis; in\n\ndetermining arbitrariness, it considered Mazda's sales performance\n\nin both the Westborough and Worcester markets.              See Gallo, 204 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 152 (\"Although experts continue to debate the proper\n\nperformance benchmark, it is clear that Mazda's sales performance\n\nin the Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA was inadequate from 1998 to the\n\npresent.    Moreover, Mazda was not performing at expected levels in\n\nthe [Westborough SOA].\").           That the Westborough analysis was \"the\n\nthorny question\" indicates only that, for lack of a better phrase,\n\none determination was \"thorn[ier]\" than the other.\n\n(3) The interpretation of Gallo management's state of mind\n\n            Having anticipated that this Court might reject its\n\nargument as to the inadmissibility of state-of-mind evidence, Gallo\n\ninvites    us   to   accept   its    fallback   position:   \"Even   if   [Gallo\n\nmanagement's state of mind was] relevant, the [d]istrict [c]ourt\n\nmisunderstood the testimony on this point.\"           As indicated earlier,\n\nGallo takes issue with the following statement:\n\n                      [Gallo] has consistently voiced no\n                      objection to the introduction of a\n                      dealership in Westborough, the Town in\n                      which the Roy Rioux dealership was\n                      located, because it is sufficiently\n                      removed from [the Gallo] dealership [so\n                      as] to pose little competitive threat.\n                      . . . Notwithstanding the perceived\n                      difference   between   Shrewsbury   and\n                      Westborough, [management's] lack of\n\n                                       -18-\n\f                   concern about a Westborough competitor\n                   seriously undercuts [its] claim that\n                   Mazda's decision to establish MetroWest\n                   was arbitrary.\n\nGallo, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 155.     Gallo posits that, contrary to the\n\nfindings of the district court, an objection was not made because\n\na new dealership in Westborough would have provided \"enough space\n\nto compete equally.\"\n\n            Gallo's argument fails for two reasons.             First and\n\nforemost,   no   discrepancy   exists    between   the   district   court's\n\nfindings and the position advocated by Gallo on appeal.             Second,\n\neven if a discrepancy exists, there is no clear error.          Given the\n\nevidence and the deferential standard of review, Gallo cannot\n\nestablish reversible error in the court's refusal to accept that,\n\nwhile a MetroWest dealership on Route 9 in Westborough would be\n\nunobjectionable, a MetroWest dealership on Route 9 that is only\n\none-half mile away from the Westborough town line makes all the\n\ndifference in terms of competition.\n\n(4) Ford's Participation\n\n            In a final attempt to establish clear error, Gallo\n\nasserts that \"the district court overlooked the participation of\n\nFord Motor Company in the new dealership.\"           According to Gallo,\n\n\"[t]he absence from the [d]istrict [c]ourt's Memorandum of Decision\n\nof Ford's silent but ominous presence in this case is [evidence of]\n\nclear error in that it [shows that the district court] overlooked\n\ncertain important, and undisputed, facts.\"\n\n                                  -19-\n\f            We reject Gallo's argument.        Standing alone, the fact\n\nthat a judicial opinion neglects to mention a particular piece of\n\nevidence is no proof that the court failed to consider it.            \"[I]t\n\nis the very essence of the trial court's function to choose from\n\namong the competing and conflicting inferences and conclusions that\n\nwhich it deems most reasonable.\"       Evans v. United States, 319 F.2d\n\n751, 755 (1st Cir. 1963) (citation omitted).         The district court's\n\ncareful opinion in this case gives us every reason to suppose that\n\nthe court carefully weighed all the evidence before coming to its\n\ndecision.\n\n                                    III.\n\n            For   the   reasons   stated   above,   the   judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f",

The franchisee brought a diversity action, alleging that the manufacturer's actions violated state law. Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment for the manufacturer. The franchisee now appeals. We consider whether the district court erred in either its evidentiary admissions or factual findings and, discerning no error, affirm the court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Gallo Motor Corporation (\"Gallo\") became a dealer for defendant-appellee Mazda Motor of America, Inc. (\"Mazda\") in 1994, when Gallo acquired an existing Mazda dealership on Shrewsbury Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Gallo management decided to purchase the franchise despite its awareness of other Mazda dealers in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like all new Mazda franchisees, Gallo was assigned a specific geographic area called a Statistical Observation Area (\"SOA\"). Mazda uses the SOA to monitor its dealers' performances. By comparing new vehicle registrations in each SOA with industry-wide benchmarks (such as Mazda's national and regional market shares), Mazda is able to determine whether sales in a particular SOA are above or below average. Gallo's assigned SOA encompassed all of Worcester and neighboring Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time Gallo purchased the franchise, Mazda's sales in the Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA were below the national and regional averages. Because Mazda believed that the poor location of the Shrewsbury Street dealership (in Worcester) was at least partially to blame for the substandard sales, it conditioned its approval of the Gallo franchise on Gallo's agreement to relocate the dealership from Shrewsbury Street to Gold Star Boulevard (also in Worcester). Gallo agreed to an eventual relocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, approximately three years after Gallo began operating the Shrewsbury Street dealership but prior to its relocation, Mazda commissioned market studies to evaluate more than 80 of its metropolitan market areas throughout the country. These studies were part of a \"dealer revitalization program,\" which was designed both to eliminate dealers with poor performance records and to maximize the efficiencies of the remaining dealerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on market data from 1994 through 1997, the studies revealed that the greater Worcester area, which encompasses Gallo's Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA as well as the neighboring Westborough SOA, was not performing at an optimal level. At the time of the studies, this area contained three dealerships: Gallo, North End, and Roy Rioux. A report accompanying the studies cautioned that, while three dealerships were sufficient for the area, all three dealerships needed to achieve superior sales and service records if Mazda was to achieve its expected market share in the greater Worcester area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the number of Mazda dealerships in the greater Worcester area decreased from three to two when Roy Rioux closed its doors. Located on Route 9 in Westborough, Massachusetts, the former Rioux dealership was approximately 7.6 miles away from Gallo's Shrewsbury Street facility in Worcester. Unable to find an acceptable buyer for the Rioux facility, Mazda quickly began searching for a new dealership to service the Westborough area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering a number of factors, including the 1997 greater Worcester area market study, Mazda's management determined that a new dealership on Route 9 would lead to greater market penetration in the Westborough SOA. Accordingly, in late 1998, Mazda entered into an agreement with Ford Motor Company to establish a joint Lincoln-Mercury/Mazda dealership (\"MetroWest\") on Route 9 in Shrewsbury, just over the Westborough town line. Meanwhile, in March 1999, Gallo relocated from Shrewsbury Street to Gold Star Boulevard in Worcester pursuant to its franchising agreement with Mazda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1999, three months after Gallo's move, Mazda notified Gallo by certified mail of its intention to establish a new dealership \"at the Southwest corner of Route 9 and Walnut Street in <i>Westborough, Massachusetts</i>\" (emphasis added). Although the letter's description provided an accurate street address, it incorrectly identified the new dealership's site as Westborough instead of Shrewsbury. Based on this defective letter, Gallo management assumed that the new dealership was effectively replacing the former Rioux dealership in Westborough. Accordingly, it neither objected nor inquired further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With no pending protests, Mazda and Ford proceeded with their plans to establish the MetroWest dealership. At completion, the $3.8 million facility &#8212; located approximately 6.5 miles away from Gallo's Gold Star Boulevard dealership in Worcester &#8212; was entirely Ford-owned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, just a few months prior to MetroWest's grand opening, Gallo management discovered that the joint dealership was located in Shrewsbury &#8212; not Westborough. Management immediately contacted Mazda's Regional General Manager to express concern. On June 21, 2001, Gallo's counsel sent Mazda a letter complaining about both the establishment of the MetroWest dealership and Mazda's failure to provide Gallo with the notice required by Massachusetts law. On July 13, 2001, Mazda's counsel responded with a corrected notice letter, which confirmed Mazda's intention to proceed with the MetroWest dealership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo thereafter filed a diversity action in federal district court, alleging violations of Massachusetts' so-called \"Dealer's Bill of Rights.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B) (amended 2002). Specifically, Gallo claimed that Mazda's MetroWest decision was arbitrary and that Mazda had failed to provide adequate notice of its decision.

Second, we review findings of fact for clear error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <i>Persson v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd.,</i> 330 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.2003). Under the clear-error standard, \"we will give ...

We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The 1997 Market Study</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gallo, \"[t]he plain language of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.] 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>) renders Mazda's 1997 ... market study obsolete and unworthy of consideration.\" For support, Gallo looks to one of the eight <i>non-exhaustive</i> statutory factors that a court may consider when determining arbitrariness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the retail sales and service business transacted by the ... dealers with a place of business in the market area to be served by the additional franchisee during the <i>three year period</i> immediately preceding [the notice required by this statute].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>)(ii) (emphasis added). Because the 1997 study was based on data that existed outside this three-year window,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Gallo argues that it should have been excluded as irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo's argument misses the mark. As the district court correctly noted, the eight statutory factors are neither exhaustive nor definitive. We need not even resort to case law for support; the statute is unambiguous. \"In determining whether [the establishment of the new dealership] is arbitrary, the court shall consider <i>all pertinent circumstances.</i> These may include but are <i>not limited to</i> [the eight factors].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>) (emphases added). So while we agree with Gallo that the statutory language is \"plain,\" we disagree with Gallo's interpretation of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory language is sufficiently broad to permit the admission of the 1997 market study. \"All pertinent circumstances\" means all pertinent circumstances. That a particular piece of evidence does not fall within the purview of a particular factor in a non-exhaustive statutory list is not a sound basis for objecting to its admissibility. Although Gallo did not receive its formal statutory notice until 2001, Mazda had made its MetroWest decision two years earlier, as evidenced by the defective notice letter dated August 16, 1999. Mazda's decision was partially based on the 1997 study &#8212; a major market study commissioned for the purpose of evaluating Mazda's businesses and business opportunities. The results of this study are not only \"pertinent\" to an arbitrariness inquiry, they are important. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining that the 1997 study was relevant to an arbitrariness inquiry. <i>See United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 444 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that the district court has broad discretion in making relevancy determinations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The 2002 expert report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Gallo asserts that Mazda's 2002 expert report was an \"after-the-fact justification\" for the MetroWest facility that should have been excluded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For support, Gallo cites two cases, each of which involves a lawsuit that closely parallels this one. <i>See Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc.,</i> 14 Mass. App.Ct. 396, 440 N.E.2d 29 (1982); <i>Richard Lundgren, Inc. v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc.,</i> 1994 WL 879478 (Mass.Super.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither case controls. In both cases, the court found arbitrariness <i>despite</i> the assembly of after-the-fact market data &#8212; <i>not because</i> of it. In <i>Ricky Smith,</i> the court noted that the factfinder \"<i>could</i> ... consider the absence of careful consideration or relevant data at the time the [franchising] appointment was made as evidence that the ... franchise was arbitrarily granted, <i>despite</i> [the manufacturer's] assembly, after the fact, of information which tended to support its actions.\" 440 N.E.2d at 43 (emphases added). Similarly, in <i>Richard Lundgren,</i> the court found that, while witnesses for the manufacturer \"have strived diligently to assemble after-the-fact market data in an attempt to support its action, ... the intended creation of a new dealership ... was not based on <i>any</i> careful consideration of relevant market data at the time, and was hence arbitrary.\" 1994 WL 879478, at *5 (emphasis added). Neither case held that after-the-fact data must be excluded or that a manufacturer must conduct a contemporaneous market study.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court considered several pieces of evidence, most of which involved pre-MetroWest data.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Mazda, of course, could not have based its 1999 MetroWest decision on the 2002 expert report. Such a report, then, merely serves as <i>additional</i> relevant evidence supporting Mazda's decision &#8212; a decision that was based on \"careful consideration of relevant market data at the time.\" <i>See id.</i> An after-the-fact study is not <i>per se</i> irrelevant to the court's analysis of arbitrariness because, as here, it can provide an account of the \"pertinent circumstances\" that the court is statutorily required to consider. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this expert report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The State-Of-Mind Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its final attack on the admissibility of evidence, Gallo asserts that the district court improperly admitted evidence of Gallo management's \"state of mind.\" At issue is the following statement by the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Gallo] has consistently voiced no objection to the introduction of a dealership in Westborough, the Town in which the Roy Rioux dealership was located, because it is sufficiently removed from [the Gallo] dealership [so as] to pose little competitive threat.... Notwithstanding the perceived difference between Shrewsbury and Westborough, [management's] lack of concern about a Westborough competitor seriously undercuts [its] claim that Mazda's decision to establish MetroWest was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gallo, the \"all pertinent circumstances\" language in the statute \"does not extend to evidence which is directly contrary to the statute's intent.\" Seeking <i>de novo</i> review, Gallo argues that, because the eight statutory factors emphasize public interest concerns and objective evidence, evidence as to management's state of mind is irrelevant \"to the objective examination of the benefit or detriment that the new dealership will pose to the consuming public.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not convinced. As discussed above, the broad language in the statute permits a court to consider a wide range of factors &#8212; public and private, objective and subjective, statutory and non-statutory &#8212; when making its determination of arbitrariness. <i>Cf. Ricky Smith,</i> 440 N.E.2d at 43 (noting that, given the language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), the lower court \"could have properly considered [the manufacturer's] conduct prior to [the new dealership's] appointment as manifesting indifference to the statute and to the impact that the new dealer would have on existing franchisees\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In failing to object to the proposed Westborough site (as erroneously noted in the 1999 notice letter), Gallo management undermined its subsequent position that MetroWest's actual Shrewsbury location was arbitrary. <i>See Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 155. This evidence, itself a \"pertinent circumstance,\" is further supported by several other \"pertinent circumstances\": (1) the close proximity of MetroWest to the Westborough border (less than one-half mile), <i>id.;</i> (2) the fact that MetroWest's actual Shrewsbury location is only one mile closer to Gallo's Gold Star dealership than the former Rioux dealership was to Gallo's initial Shrewsbury Street dealership, <i>id.</i>; and (3) the testimony of Gallo management that, in its opinion, the greater Worcester market area was not \"overdealered\" when it purchased the Shrewsbury Street franchise (despite the presence of the Rioux dealership). Given all these \"pertinent circumstances,\" the district court did not abuse its discretion when it considered relevant evidence of Gallo management's failure to object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Factual Findings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo next contends that the district court (1) improperly focused on evidence of Mazda's market share to the neglect of other statutory factors, (2) improperly assessed Gallo's performance in the Westborough market instead of the Worcester market, (3) improperly construed Gallo management's state of mind, and (4) improperly weighed Ford's participation in the MetroWest decision. We find no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The Market-Share Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo claims that the district court clearly erred when it \"focus[ed] on Mazda's market share without [giving] sufficient consideration to other [statutory] factors.\" Arguing that the district court's findings were against the weight of the evidence, Gallo asserts that the district court gave too little weight to the \"voluminous factual and expert evidence\" regarding, <i>inter alia,</i> the adequacy of its facilities and the substantial amount and permanent nature of its investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.

The statute pointedly directs a court to consider all pertinent circumstances. By implication, courts need not perform a mechanical analysis of all the elements that may have bearing upon whether the establishment of a proposed dealership is arbitrary.

Here, because the market-share statistics were reliable and telling indicators of Mazda's below-average performance in the region, we are not at all convinced that we even would have weighed the evidence differently.

Gallo argues on appeal that, because the new MetroWest facility was established to serve the <i>Worcester market,</i> the statute requires the court to evaluate the arbitrariness of the MetroWest decision in terms of whether or not Gallo and other Mazda dealers were adequately serving the Worcester market &#8212; not the \"Westborough area.\" For support, Gallo notes that five of the eight statutory factors refer to \"the market area to be served by the additional franchisee.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>)(ii)-(iv), (vi)-(vii). Further, Gallo seeks <i>de novo</i> review of this particular question \"since the interpretation of [Chapter 93B] is an issue of law\" and \"the plain language of the statute does not contemplate or sanction this [`]thorny question['].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irrespective of the standard of review that ought to apply, we discern no basis for reversing because of this finding. Given Gallo's previous position on the relevant market, which it now abandons, our finding should come as no surprise. At trial, Gallo's own expert testified that the area to be served by the MetroWest dealership was the combined SOAs of Gallo <i>and</i> the \"add-point,\" which includes Westborough. Moreover, Gallo's expert not only testified that the Worcester and Westborough markets were linked historically, he also presented an analysis based on an opinion that the two markets ought to be considered together. While not dispositive, this evidence is telling because it indicates that, at least at trial, Gallo believed an accurate assessment of its performance would require an inquiry into markets other than just Worcester.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was thorough in its analysis; in determining arbitrariness, it considered Mazda's sales performance in <i>both</i> the Westborough and Worcester markets. <i>See Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 152 (\"Although experts continue to debate the proper performance benchmark, it is clear that Mazda's sales performance in the Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA was inadequate from 1998 to the present. Moreover, Mazda was not performing at expected levels in the [Westborough SOA].\"). That the Westborough analysis was \"the thorny question\" indicates only that, for lack of a better phrase, one determination was \"thorn[ier]\" than the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The interpretation of Gallo management's state of mind</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having anticipated that this Court might reject its argument as to the inadmissibility of state-of-mind evidence, Gallo invites us to accept its fallback position: \"Even if [Gallo management's state of mind was] relevant, the [d]istrict [c]ourt misunderstood the testimony on this point.\" As indicated earlier, Gallo takes issue with the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Gallo] has consistently voiced no objection to the introduction of a dealership in Westborough, the Town in which the Roy Rioux dealership was located, because it is sufficiently removed from [the Gallo] dealership [so as] to pose little competitive threat.... Notwithstanding the perceived difference between Shrewsbury and Westborough, [management's] lack of concern about a Westborough competitor seriously undercuts [its] claim that Mazda's decision to establish MetroWest was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 155. Gallo posits that, contrary to the findings of the district court, an objection was not made because a new dealership in Westborough would have provided \"enough space to compete equally.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo's argument fails for two reasons. First and foremost, no discrepancy exists between the district court's findings and the position advocated by Gallo on appeal. Second, even if a discrepancy exists, there is no clear error. Given the evidence and the deferential standard of review, Gallo cannot establish reversible error in the court's refusal to accept that, while a MetroWest dealership on Route 9 in Westborough would be unobjectionable, a MetroWest dealership on Route 9 that is only one-half mile away from the Westborough town line makes all the difference in terms of competition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Ford's Participation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final attempt to establish clear error, Gallo asserts that \"the district court overlooked the participation of Ford Motor Company in the new dealership.\" According to Gallo, \"[t]he absence from the [d]istrict [c]ourt's Memorandum of Decision of Ford's silent but ominous presence in this case is [evidence of] clear error in that it [shows that the district court] overlooked certain important, and undisputed, facts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Gallo's argument. Standing alone, the fact that a judicial opinion neglects to mention a particular piece of evidence is no proof that the court failed to consider it. \"[I]t is the very essence of the trial court's function to choose from among the competing and conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it deems most reasonable.\" <i>Evans v. United States,</i> 319 F.2d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1963) (citation omitted).

The franchisee brought a diversity action, alleging that the manufacturer's actions violated state law. Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment for the manufacturer. The franchisee now appeals. We consider whether the district court erred in either its evidentiary admissions or factual findings and, discerning no error, affirm the court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Gallo Motor Corporation (\"Gallo\") became a dealer for defendant-appellee Mazda Motor of America, Inc. (\"Mazda\") in 1994, when Gallo acquired an existing Mazda dealership on Shrewsbury Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Gallo management decided to purchase the franchise despite its awareness of other Mazda dealers in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like all new Mazda franchisees, Gallo was assigned a specific geographic area called a Statistical Observation Area (\"SOA\"). Mazda uses the SOA to monitor its dealers' performances. By comparing new vehicle registrations in each SOA with industry-wide benchmarks (such as Mazda's national and regional market shares), Mazda is able to determine whether sales in a particular SOA are above or below average. Gallo's assigned SOA encompassed all of Worcester and neighboring Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time Gallo purchased the franchise, Mazda's sales in the Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA were below the national and regional averages. Because Mazda believed that the poor location of the Shrewsbury Street dealership (in Worcester) was at least partially to blame for the substandard sales, it conditioned its approval of the Gallo franchise on Gallo's agreement to relocate the dealership from Shrewsbury Street to Gold Star Boulevard (also in Worcester). Gallo agreed to an eventual relocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, approximately three years after Gallo began operating the Shrewsbury Street dealership but prior to its relocation, Mazda commissioned market studies to evaluate more than 80 of its metropolitan market areas throughout the country. These studies were part of a \"dealer revitalization program,\" which was designed both to eliminate dealers with poor performance records and to maximize the efficiencies of the remaining dealerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on market data from 1994 through 1997, the studies revealed that the greater Worcester area, which encompasses Gallo's Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA as well as the neighboring Westborough SOA, was not performing at an optimal level. At the time of the studies, this area contained three dealerships: Gallo, North End, and Roy Rioux. A report accompanying the studies cautioned that, while three dealerships were sufficient for the area, all three dealerships needed to achieve superior sales and service records if Mazda was to achieve its expected market share in the greater Worcester area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the number of Mazda dealerships in the greater Worcester area decreased from three to two when Roy Rioux closed its doors. Located on Route 9 in Westborough, Massachusetts, the former Rioux dealership was approximately 7.6 miles away from Gallo's Shrewsbury Street facility in Worcester. Unable to find an acceptable buyer for the Rioux facility, Mazda quickly began searching for a new dealership to service the Westborough area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering a number of factors, including the 1997 greater Worcester area market study, Mazda's management determined that a new dealership on Route 9 would lead to greater market penetration in the Westborough SOA. Accordingly, in late 1998, Mazda entered into an agreement with Ford Motor Company to establish a joint Lincoln-Mercury/Mazda dealership (\"MetroWest\") on Route 9 in Shrewsbury, just over the Westborough town line. Meanwhile, in March 1999, Gallo relocated from Shrewsbury Street to Gold Star Boulevard in Worcester pursuant to its franchising agreement with Mazda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1999, three months after Gallo's move, Mazda notified Gallo by certified mail of its intention to establish a new dealership \"at the Southwest corner of Route 9 and Walnut Street in <i>Westborough, Massachusetts</i>\" (emphasis added). Although the letter's description provided an accurate street address, it incorrectly identified the new dealership's site as Westborough instead of Shrewsbury. Based on this defective letter, Gallo management assumed that the new dealership was effectively replacing the former Rioux dealership in Westborough. Accordingly, it neither objected nor inquired further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With no pending protests, Mazda and Ford proceeded with their plans to establish the MetroWest dealership. At completion, the $3.8 million facility &#8212; located approximately 6.5 miles away from Gallo's Gold Star Boulevard dealership in Worcester &#8212; was entirely Ford-owned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, just a few months prior to MetroWest's grand opening, Gallo management discovered that the joint dealership was located in Shrewsbury &#8212; not Westborough. Management immediately contacted Mazda's Regional General Manager to express concern. On June 21, 2001, Gallo's counsel sent Mazda a letter complaining about both the establishment of the MetroWest dealership and Mazda's failure to provide Gallo with the notice required by Massachusetts law. On July 13, 2001, Mazda's counsel responded with a corrected notice letter, which confirmed Mazda's intention to proceed with the MetroWest dealership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo thereafter filed a diversity action in federal district court, alleging violations of Massachusetts' so-called \"Dealer's Bill of Rights.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B) (amended 2002). Specifically, Gallo claimed that Mazda's MetroWest decision was arbitrary and that Mazda had failed to provide adequate notice of its decision. The pertinent text of the statute, as it existed at the time of trial, is reproduced below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[It is a violation for a manufacturer] arbitrarily and without notice to existing franchisees ... to grant or enter into a franchise or selling agreement to or with an additional franchisee who intends or would be required by such franchise selling agreement to conduct its dealership operations from a place of business situated within the relevant market area of an existing franchisee....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any manufacturer ... which intends to grant or enter into an additional franchise or selling agreement, shall, at least sixty days prior to granting such franchise or entering into such agreement, give written notice of its intention to do so to each motor vehicle dealer with a franchise or selling agreement covering the same line make within a twenty mile radius of the location where the business of the proposed franchise will be located.

Gallo also asserted that Mazda's decision was influenced more by Ford's participation in the MetroWest facility &#8212; in particular, Ford's financing &#8212; than by any rational weighing of the pros and cons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unconvinced, the district court entered judgment for Mazda. <i>See Gallo Motor Ctr.

Laws ch. 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>) (amended 2002)), including several of the eight statutory factors, the court found that \"Gallo has not sustained its burden of demonstrating [by a preponderance of the evidence] that Mazda's establishment of the MetroWest dealership is arbitrary[;] [t]o the contrary, Mazda's new dealership promotes competition which, in turn, benefits the public interest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 156. Regarding Gallo's claim that Mazda provided inadequate notice of its MetroWest decision, the court found that \"[although] the notice given by Mazda on August 16, 1999 was defective and inadequate[,] [i]ts subsequent letter of July 13, 2001 was ... effective statutory notice pursuant to Chapter 93B.\" <i>Id.</i> at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, we are presented with two broad questions: (1) whether the district court improperly admitted and considered certain evidence; and (2) whether, as a result of improperly weighing the evidence, the district court erred in its factual findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these separate questions, two standards of review apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> First, we review a district court's decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>See Larch v.

Second, we review findings of fact for clear error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <i>Persson v.

Under the clear-error standard, \"we will give ...

We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The 1997 Market Study</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gallo, \"[t]he plain language of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.] 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>) renders Mazda's 1997 ... market study obsolete and unworthy of consideration.\" For support, Gallo looks to one of the eight <i>non-exhaustive</i> statutory factors that a court may consider when determining arbitrariness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the retail sales and service business transacted by the ... dealers with a place of business in the market area to be served by the additional franchisee during the <i>three year period</i> immediately preceding [the notice required by this statute].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>)(ii) (emphasis added). Because the 1997 study was based on data that existed outside this three-year window,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Gallo argues that it should have been excluded as irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo's argument misses the mark. As the district court correctly noted, the eight statutory factors are neither exhaustive nor definitive. We need not even resort to case law for support; the statute is unambiguous. \"In determining whether [the establishment of the new dealership] is arbitrary, the court shall consider <i>all pertinent circumstances.</i> These may include but are <i>not limited to</i> [the eight factors].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>) (emphases added). So while we agree with Gallo that the statutory language is \"plain,\" we disagree with Gallo's interpretation of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory language is sufficiently broad to permit the admission of the 1997 market study. \"All pertinent circumstances\" means all pertinent circumstances. That a particular piece of evidence does not fall within the purview of a particular factor in a non-exhaustive statutory list is not a sound basis for objecting to its admissibility. Although Gallo did not receive its formal statutory notice until 2001, Mazda had made its MetroWest decision two years earlier, as evidenced by the defective notice letter dated August 16, 1999. Mazda's decision was partially based on the 1997 study &#8212; a major market study commissioned for the purpose of evaluating Mazda's businesses and business opportunities. The results of this study are not only \"pertinent\" to an arbitrariness inquiry, they are important. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining that the 1997 study was relevant to an arbitrariness inquiry. <i>See United States v. Brandon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 444 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that the district court has broad discretion in making relevancy determinations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The 2002 expert report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Gallo asserts that Mazda's 2002 expert report was an \"after-the-fact justification\" for the MetroWest facility that should have been excluded.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For support, Gallo cites two cases, each of which involves a lawsuit that closely parallels this one. <i>See Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc.,</i> 14 Mass. App.Ct. 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237597\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237597/ricky-smith-pontiac-v-subaru-of-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span> (1982); <i>Richard Lundgren, Inc. v.

In both cases, the court found arbitrariness <i>despite</i> the assembly of after-the-fact market data &#8212; <i>not because</i> of it. In <i>Ricky Smith,</i> the court noted that the factfinder \"<i>could</i> ... consider the absence of careful consideration or relevant data at the time the [franchising] appointment was made as evidence that the ... franchise was arbitrarily granted, <i>despite</i> [the manufacturer's] assembly, after the fact, of information which tended to support its actions.\" 440 N.E.2d at 43 (emphases added). Similarly, in <i>Richard Lundgren,</i> the court found that, while witnesses for the manufacturer \"have strived diligently to assemble after-the-fact market data in an attempt to support its action, ... the intended creation of a new dealership ... was not based on <i>any</i> careful consideration of relevant market data at the time, and was hence arbitrary.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">879478</span></span>, at *5 (emphasis added). Neither case held that after-the-fact data must be excluded or that a manufacturer must conduct a contemporaneous market study.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court considered several pieces of evidence, most of which involved pre-MetroWest data.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Mazda, of course, could not have based its 1999 MetroWest decision on the 2002 expert report. Such a report, then, merely serves as <i>additional</i> relevant evidence supporting Mazda's decision &#8212; a decision that was based on \"careful consideration of relevant market data at the time.\" <i>See id.</i> An after-the-fact study is not <i>per se</i> irrelevant to the court's analysis of arbitrariness because, as here, it can provide an account of the \"pertinent circumstances\" that the court is statutorily required to consider. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this expert report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The State-Of-Mind Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its final attack on the admissibility of evidence, Gallo asserts that the district court improperly admitted evidence of Gallo management's \"state of mind.\" At issue is the following statement by the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Gallo] has consistently voiced no objection to the introduction of a dealership in Westborough, the Town in which the Roy Rioux dealership was located, because it is sufficiently removed from [the Gallo] dealership [so as] to pose little competitive threat.... Notwithstanding the perceived difference between Shrewsbury and Westborough, [management's] lack of concern about a Westborough competitor seriously undercuts [its] claim that Mazda's decision to establish MetroWest was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Gallo, the \"all pertinent circumstances\" language in the statute \"does not extend to evidence which is directly contrary to the statute's intent.\" Seeking <i>de novo</i> review, Gallo argues that, because the eight statutory factors emphasize public interest concerns and objective evidence, evidence as to management's state of mind is irrelevant \"to the objective examination of the benefit or detriment that the new dealership will pose to the consuming public.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not convinced. As discussed above, the broad language in the statute permits a court to consider a wide range of factors &#8212; public and private, objective and subjective, statutory and non-statutory &#8212; when making its determination of arbitrariness. <i>Cf. Ricky Smith,</i> 440 N.E.2d at 43 (noting that, given the language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), the lower court \"could have properly considered [the manufacturer's] conduct prior to [the new dealership's] appointment as manifesting indifference to the statute and to the impact that the new dealer would have on existing franchisees\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In failing to object to the proposed Westborough site (as erroneously noted in the 1999 notice letter), Gallo management undermined its subsequent position that MetroWest's actual Shrewsbury location was arbitrary. <i>See Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 155. This evidence, itself a \"pertinent circumstance,\" is further supported by several other \"pertinent circumstances\": (1) the close proximity of MetroWest to the Westborough border (less than one-half mile), <i>id.;</i> (2) the fact that MetroWest's actual Shrewsbury location is only one mile closer to Gallo's Gold Star dealership than the former Rioux dealership was to Gallo's initial Shrewsbury Street dealership, <i>id.</i>; and (3) the testimony of Gallo management that, in its opinion, the greater Worcester market area was not \"overdealered\" when it purchased the Shrewsbury Street franchise (despite the presence of the Rioux dealership). Given all these \"pertinent circumstances,\" the district court did not abuse its discretion when it considered relevant evidence of Gallo management's failure to object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Factual Findings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo next contends that the district court (1) improperly focused on evidence of Mazda's market share to the neglect of other statutory factors, (2) improperly assessed Gallo's performance in the Westborough market instead of the Worcester market, (3) improperly construed Gallo management's state of mind, and (4) improperly weighed Ford's participation in the MetroWest decision. We find no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The Market-Share Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo claims that the district court clearly erred when it \"focus[ed] on Mazda's market share without [giving] sufficient consideration to other [statutory] factors.\" Arguing that the district court's findings were against the weight of the evidence, Gallo asserts that the district court gave too little weight to the \"voluminous factual and expert evidence\" regarding, <i>inter alia,</i> the adequacy of its facilities and the substantial amount and permanent nature of its investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.

Here, because the market-share statistics were reliable and telling indicators of Mazda's below-average performance in the region, we are not at all convinced that we even would have weighed the evidence differently. Accordingly, we discern no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The Assessment of Gallo's Performance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its written opinion, the district court stated that the \"thorny question is ... whether Mazda's existing dealership network, without the MetroWest site, adequately serves the <i>Westborough area</i>....\" <i>Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 154 (emphasis added). Gallo argues on appeal that, because the new MetroWest facility was established to serve the <i>Worcester market,</i> the statute requires the court to evaluate the arbitrariness of the MetroWest decision in terms of whether or not Gallo and other Mazda dealers were adequately serving the Worcester market &#8212; not the \"Westborough area.\" For support, Gallo notes that five of the eight statutory factors refer to \"the market area to be served by the additional franchisee.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93(B), &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>)(ii)-(iv), (vi)-(vii). Further, Gallo seeks <i>de novo</i> review of this particular question \"since the interpretation of [Chapter 93B] is an issue of law\" and \"the plain language of the statute does not contemplate or sanction this [`]thorny question['].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irrespective of the standard of review that ought to apply, we discern no basis for reversing because of this finding. Given Gallo's previous position on the relevant market, which it now abandons, our finding should come as no surprise. At trial, Gallo's own expert testified that the area to be served by the MetroWest dealership was the combined SOAs of Gallo <i>and</i> the \"add-point,\" which includes Westborough. Moreover, Gallo's expert not only testified that the Worcester and Westborough markets were linked historically, he also presented an analysis based on an opinion that the two markets ought to be considered together. While not dispositive, this evidence is telling because it indicates that, at least at trial, Gallo believed an accurate assessment of its performance would require an inquiry into markets other than just Worcester.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was thorough in its analysis; in determining arbitrariness, it considered Mazda's sales performance in <i>both</i> the Westborough and Worcester markets. <i>See Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 152 (\"Although experts continue to debate the proper performance benchmark, it is clear that Mazda's sales performance in the Worcester-Shrewsbury SOA was inadequate from 1998 to the present. Moreover, Mazda was not performing at expected levels in the [Westborough SOA].\"). That the Westborough analysis was \"the thorny question\" indicates only that, for lack of a better phrase, one determination was \"thorn[ier]\" than the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The interpretation of Gallo management's state of mind</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having anticipated that this Court might reject its argument as to the inadmissibility of state-of-mind evidence, Gallo invites us to accept its fallback position: \"Even if [Gallo management's state of mind was] relevant, the [d]istrict [c]ourt misunderstood the testimony on this point.\" As indicated earlier, Gallo takes issue with the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Gallo] has consistently voiced no objection to the introduction of a dealership in Westborough, the Town in which the Roy Rioux dealership was located, because it is sufficiently removed from [the Gallo] dealership [so as] to pose little competitive threat.... Notwithstanding the perceived difference between Shrewsbury and Westborough, [management's] lack of concern about a Westborough competitor seriously undercuts [its] claim that Mazda's decision to establish MetroWest was arbitrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gallo,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 155. Gallo posits that, contrary to the findings of the district court, an objection was not made because a new dealership in Westborough would have provided \"enough space to compete equally.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallo's argument fails for two reasons. First and foremost, no discrepancy exists between the district court's findings and the position advocated by Gallo on appeal. Second, even if a discrepancy exists, there is no clear error. Given the evidence and the deferential standard of review, Gallo cannot establish reversible error in the court's refusal to accept that, while a MetroWest dealership on Route 9 in Westborough would be unobjectionable, a MetroWest dealership on Route 9 that is only one-half mile away from the Westborough town line makes all the difference in terms of competition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Ford's Participation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final attempt to establish clear error, Gallo asserts that \"the district court overlooked the participation of Ford Motor Company in the new dealership.\" According to Gallo, \"[t]he absence from the [d]istrict [c]ourt's Memorandum of Decision of Ford's silent but ominous presence in this case is [evidence of] clear error in that it [shows that the district court] overlooked certain important, and undisputed, facts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Gallo's argument. Standing alone, the fact that a judicial opinion neglects to mention a particular piece of evidence is no proof that the court failed to consider it. \"[I]t is the very essence of the trial court's function to choose from among the competing and conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it deems most reasonable.\" <i>Evans v.
