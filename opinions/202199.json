Garcia, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           May 8, 2006\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.                In October 2004, Dionisio\n\nZapete-Garcia (Zapete) disembarked from an airplane in Isla Verde,\n\nPuerto Rico.    The flight had originated in the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn arrival, Zapete presented United States immigration officials\n\nwith an American permanent resident card bearing his own photograph\n\nand the name Vetilio E. Fajardo. Upon questioning, Zapete admitted\n\nthat he had obtained the card fraudulently, paying approximately\n\n$1,500 for it. Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement records\n\nrevealed that Zapete had been deported from the United States twice\n\npreviously, once in 1985 and once in 1987.\n\n          That December, Zapete pleaded guilty to one count of\n\nknowingly using or attempting to use a forged, counterfeit, or\n\naltered immigration document in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a).\n\nHis sentencing hearing took place on February 4, 2005 in the\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                       The district\n\njudge,   following      the      recommendation         of    the     Pre-Sentence\n\nInvestigation    Report   (PSR),     began      his    calculations     under    the\n\nfederal Sentencing Guidelines1 with a base offense level of 8.                    He\n\nthen added two levels because Zapete was an unlawful alien who had\n\npreviously   been     deported    from    the   United       States   (U.S.S.G.    §\n\n2L2.2(b)(1))    and     subtracted       two    levels       for    acceptance    of\n\nresponsibility (§ 3E1.1), arriving at a total offense level of 8.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court relied on the November 2004 version of the\nGuidelines.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fBecause Zapete had never before been convicted of any offense, the\n\ncourt determined his criminal history category to be I.       The    total\n\noffense level combined with the criminal history category yielded\n\na recommended guidelines sentencing range of zero to six months.\n\nThe district judge, however, after reminding the parties that\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), had rendered the\n\nguidelines advisory rather than mandatory, sentenced Zapete to 48\n\nmonths in prison, eight times the maximum guideline-recommended\n\nsentence.2        As explanation for the sentence he chose, the judge\n\nstated:\n\n             The Court imposes this sentence based on the\n             following factors. As it appear[s] from the\n             presentence report . . . this defendant has\n             already been deported twice from the United\n             States. He had been deported back in October\n             of [19]85 and August of 1987. It also appears\n             from the presentence report that he was\n             arrested on November 14, 1991, in New York\n             City, charged with criminal possession of\n             controlled substance, narcotics, a Class A\n             Felony, and with criminal possession of a\n             weapon, which is a Class D Felony. And since\n             1992 a bench warrant [that] has been issued\n             for his arrest remains outstanding. For those\n             reasons the Court imposes the sentence that it\n             has imposed.\n\nZapete now challenges his sentence.\n\n             We     review   sentences    imposed   after   Booker    for\n\nreasonableness. Booker, 543 U.S. at 261; United States v. Alli, __\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The statutory maximum penalty for Zapete's offense was ten\nyears of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a).\n\n                                    -3-\n\fF.3d       __,   2006   WL   893620,    at   *4   (1st   Cir.   Apr.   7,   2006).3\n\nProcedurally, under the advisory guidelines scheme set in place by\n\nBooker, a sentencing court will ordinarily begin by calculating the\n\napplicable        guidelines    range   and    then   determine   whether    other\n\nfactors \"warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline\n\nrange.\" United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc).          The court must consider factors identified\n\nby the parties, see id., and is also bound to consider the several\n\nsentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).4                Alli, 2006 WL\n\n\n       3\n      Zapete argues that we should review his sentence de novo\nbecause he pleaded guilty before Booker was decided, even though he\nwas sentenced post-Booker. However, we have already made clear\nthat sentences imposed after Booker was handed down are reviewed\nfor reasonableness. It is possible to construe Zapete's brief as\narguing that Zapete was denied due process and fair warning because\nthe sentence he was given was \"higher than any that might\nrealistically have been imagined at the time of the crime,\" United\nStates v. Lata, 415 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2005), but our\ndisposition of the case on reasonableness grounds makes any\nconsideration of due process unnecessary. See id.\n       4\n      These factors are:\n     (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant;\n     (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of\nthe offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just\npunishment; to afford adequate deterrence; to protect the public;\nand to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational\ntraining or medical care;\n     (3) the kinds of sentences available;\n     (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established\nby the Guidelines;\n     (5) any pertinent policy statement;\n     (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among\ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\nsimilar conduct; and\n     (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the\noffense.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f893620, at *4; United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   When we review the chosen sentence for reasonableness, we\n\nlook for \"a plausible explanation and a defensible overall result.\"\n\nUnited States v. Smith, __ F.3d __, 2006 WL 893622, at *3 (1st Cir.\n\nApr. 7, 2006) (quoting Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519).\n\n           Here, the judge offered two reasons for imposing a\n\nsentence upon Zapete that was eight times the length of the maximum\n\nguideline-recommended sentence.     First, he mentioned the fact that\n\nZapete had previously been deported twice from the United States.\n\nSecond, he indicated that Zapete's arrest in New York some years\n\nearlier, along with the accompanying outstanding bench warrant, was\n\na factor calling for a longer sentence.         We evaluate these two\n\nfactors with an eye to \"a reasoned explanation\" and \"a plausible\n\noutcome.\" Alli, 2006 WL 893620, at *5 (quoting Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d at 519).\n\n           The first factor, Zapete's previous deportations from the\n\nUnited   States,   was   already   accounted   for   in   the   guideline\n\ncalculation: the PSR recommended, and the judge adopted, a two-\n\nlevel increase applicable to a defendant who \"is an unlawful alien\n\nwho has been deported (voluntarily or involuntarily) on one or more\n\noccasions prior to the instant offense.\"       U.S.S.G. § 2L2.2(b)(1).\n\nWhen a factor is already included in the calculation of the\n\nguidelines sentencing range, a judge who wishes to rely on that\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fsame factor to impose a sentence above or below the range must\n\narticulate       specifically     the    reasons     that   this     particular\n\ndefendant's situation is different from the ordinary situation\n\ncovered by the guidelines calculation.          See Smith, 2006 WL 893622,\n\nat *5.    The judge in this case provided no such explanation.            We do\n\nnote that the two-level guideline enhancement in § 2L2.2(b)(1)\n\napplies to any unlawful alien defendant who has previously been\n\ndeported at least once; the guideline does not recommend a steeper\n\nenhancement for defendants who have been deported multiple times.\n\nIt is not necessarily unreasonable for a judge to increase the\n\nsentence of a defendant who had previously been deported more than\n\nonce, and indeed Zapete had been deported twice. However, although\n\nsome amount of increase for multiple violations might be reasonable\n\nif supported by an explanation, here there was no explanation for\n\nan increase of such magnitude.          In any event we cannot say that one\n\nadditional    prior   deportation       reasonably   warrants   an   eightfold\n\nincrease in punishment. Cf. Smith, 2006 WL 893622, at *6 (sentence\n\nless than half of minimum guideline suggestion plainly unreasonable\n\nwhere judge provided no sustainable explanation).\n\n            The second factor relied upon by the district judge to\n\nenhance the sentence, Zapete's arrest in New York City in 1991 and\n\nthe accompanying outstanding bench warrant, is also unpersuasive to\n\nsupport    the   magnitude   of   the    increase.     To   begin    with,   the\n\nguidelines contain a policy statement that allows sentencing courts\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f\"to consider 'prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in\n\na criminal conviction'\" but prohibits them from basing an upward\n\ndeparture solely on a defendant's prior arrest record. Williams v.\n\nUnited   States,    503    U.S.    193,      197    (1992)   (quoting     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n4A1.3(a)(3)). Although this policy statement is no longer binding,\n\nsee Smith, 2006 WL 893622, at *3, one of the seven statutory\n\nfactors a judge must consider in sentencing is \"any pertinent\n\npolicy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.\"                     18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3553(a)(5).      Therefore,        while       not   controlling,     the   policy\n\nstatement prohibiting reliance solely on arrest records must be\n\nduly considered by the district judge.                   There is no evidence that\n\nthe judge in this case did so.\n\n           More generally, a mere arrest, especially a lone arrest,\n\nis not evidence that the person arrested actually committed any\n\ncriminal conduct.        This is because arrest \"happens to the innocent\n\nas well as the guilty.\"         Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469,\n\n482 (1948); cf. Cheek v. Bates, 615 F.2d 559, 563 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(\"mere arrest\" without conviction \"clearly inadmissible to show\n\nlack of credibility\").          The guideline policy statement recognizes\n\nthis limitation on the value of an arrest as information about a\n\ndefendant's      criminal    propensity,           highlighting     the    important\n\ndistinction between direct evidence of past criminal behavior and\n\nmere   arrests    that    may     or   may    not    have    been   the   result     of\n\nwrongdoing.      Although a series of past arrests might legitimately\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fsuggest a pattern of unlawful behavior even in the absence of any\n\nconvictions, Zapete was arrested only a single time, more than a\n\ndecade ago.   Thus, we conclude that it was unreasonable for the\n\ndistrict   court   to   rely   on   Zapete's   single   prior   arrest   as\n\njustification for enhancing his sentence.\n\n           Finally, we emphasize that we do not reject the sentence\n\nimposed below solely because of the magnitude of its deviation from\n\nthe guideline-recommended range.       Although \"circumstances may make\n\na major variance reasonable,\" Smith, 2006 WL 893622, at *3, no such\n\ncircumstances are obvious from the record in this case and no\n\nadequate explanation for such a large variation has been provided.\n\n           The appellant's sentence is vacated and the matter is\n\nremanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

His sentencing hearing took place on February 4, 2005 in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The district judge, following the recommendation of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSR), began his calculations under the federal Sentencing Guidelines<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with a base offense level of 8. He then added two levels because Zapete was an unlawful alien who had previously been deported from the United States (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L2.2(b)(1)) and subtracted two levels for acceptance of responsibility (&#167; 3E1.1), arriving at a total offense level of 8. Because Zapete had never before been convicted of any offense, the court determined his criminal history category to be I.

When a factor is already included in the calculation of the guidelines sentencing range, a judge who wishes to rely on that same factor to impose a sentence above or below the range must articulate specifically the reasons that this particular defendant's situation is different from the ordinary situation covered by the guidelines calculation. <i>See Smith,</i> at 3. The judge in this case provided no such explanation.

However, although some amount of increase for multiple violations might be reasonable if supported by an explanation, here there was no explanation for an increase of such magnitude.

To begin with, the guidelines contain a policy statement that allows sentencing courts \"to consider `prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction'\" but prohibits them from basing an upward departure solely on a defendant's prior arrest record. <i>Williams v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 193, 197, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(a)(3)). Although this policy statement is no longer binding, <i>see Smith,</i> at 3, one of the seven statutory factors a judge must consider in sentencing is \"any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(5). Therefore, while not controlling, the policy statement prohibiting reliance solely on arrest records must be duly considered by the district judge.

The guideline policy statement recognizes this limitation on the value of an arrest as information about a defendant's criminal propensity, highlighting the important distinction between direct evidence of past criminal behavior and mere arrests that may or may not have been the result of wrongdoing. Although a series of past arrests might legitimately suggest a pattern of unlawful behavior even in the absence of any convictions, Zapete was arrested only a single time, more than a decade ago. Thus, we conclude that it was unreasonable for the district court to rely on Zapete's single prior arrest as justification for enhancing his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we emphasize that we do not reject the sentence imposed below solely because of the magnitude of its deviation from the guideline-recommended range.

The flight had originated in the Dominican Republic. On arrival, Zapete presented United States immigration officials with an American permanent resident card bearing his own photograph and the name Vetilio E. Fajardo. Upon questioning, Zapete admitted that he had obtained the card fraudulently, paying approximately $1,500 for it. Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement records revealed that Zapete had been deported from the United States twice previously, once in 1985 and once in 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That December, Zapete pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly using or attempting to use a forged, counterfeit, or altered immigration document in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1546(a). His sentencing hearing took place on February 4, 2005 in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The district judge, following the recommendation of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSR), began his calculations under the federal Sentencing Guidelines<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with a base offense level of 8. He then added two levels because Zapete was an unlawful alien who had previously been deported from the United States (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L2.2(b)(1)) and subtracted two levels for acceptance of responsibility (&#167; 3E1.1), arriving at a total offense level of 8. Because Zapete had never before been convicted of any offense, the court determined his criminal history category to be I. The total offense level combined with the criminal history category yielded a recommended guidelines sentencing range of zero to six months. The district judge, however, after reminding the parties that <i>United States v.

When we review the chosen sentence for reasonableness, we look for \"a plausible explanation and a defensible overall result.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202151\"><a href=\"/opinion/202151/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the judge offered two reasons for imposing a sentence upon Zapete that was eight times the length of the maximum guideline-recommended sentence. First, he mentioned the fact that Zapete had previously been deported twice from the United States. Second, he indicated that Zapete's arrest in New York some years earlier, along with the accompanying outstanding bench warrant, was a factor calling for a longer sentence. We evaluate these two factors with an eye to \"a reasoned explanation\" and \"a plausible outcome.\" <i>Alli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202173\"><a href=\"/opinion/202173/united-states-v-alli/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39 (quoting <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first factor, Zapete's previous deportations from the United States, was already accounted for in the guideline calculation: the PSR recommended, and the judge adopted, a two-level increase applicable to a defendant who \"is an unlawful alien who has been deported (voluntarily or involuntarily) on one or more occasions prior to the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L2.2(b)(1). When a factor is already included in the calculation of the guidelines sentencing range, a judge who wishes to rely on that same factor to impose a sentence above or below the range must articulate specifically the reasons that this particular defendant's situation is different from the ordinary situation covered by the guidelines calculation. <i>See Smith,</i> at 3. The judge in this case provided no such explanation. We do note that the two-level guideline enhancement in &#167; 2L2.2(b)(1) applies to any unlawful alien defendant who has previously been deported at least once; the guideline does not recommend a steeper enhancement for defendants who have been deported multiple times. It is not necessarily unreasonable for a judge to increase the sentence of a defendant who had previously been deported more than once, and indeed Zapete had been deported twice. However, although some amount of increase for multiple violations might be reasonable if supported by an explanation, here there was no explanation for an increase of such magnitude. In any event we cannot say that one additional prior deportation reasonably warrants an eightfold increase in punishment. <i>Cf. Smith,</i> at 4 (sentence less than half of minimum guideline suggestion plainly unreasonable where judge provided no sustainable explanation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor relied upon by the district judge to enhance the sentence, Zapete's arrest in New York City in 1991 and the accompanying outstanding bench warrant, is also unpersuasive to support the magnitude of the increase. To begin with, the guidelines contain a policy statement that allows sentencing courts \"to consider `prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction'\" but prohibits them from basing an upward departure solely on a defendant's prior arrest record. <i>Williams v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 197, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span> (1992) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(a)(3)). Although this policy statement is no longer binding, <i>see Smith,</i> at 3, one of the seven statutory factors a judge must consider in sentencing is \"any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(5). Therefore, while not controlling, the policy statement prohibiting reliance solely on arrest records must be duly considered by the district judge. There is no evidence that the judge in this case did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More generally, a mere arrest, especially a lone arrest, is not evidence that the person arrested actually committed any criminal conduct. This is because arrest \"happens to the innocent as well as the guilty.\" <i>Michelson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span>, 482, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
