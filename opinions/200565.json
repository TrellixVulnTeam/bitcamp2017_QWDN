Garcia, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Karen B. Burzycki, Assistant\nRegional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 24, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam. Claimant Luis M. Arias appeals from the judgment\n\nof the district court affirming the partial denial of Social\n\nSecurity disability benefits.    The Commissioner of Social Security\n\ndetermined that claimant was disabled, and thus was entitled to\n\nsuch benefits, as of November 1, 1997, but not before.     Claimant\n\ncontends that he became disabled as of March 31, 1995 -- the date\n\nof onset he originally had alleged in his application.\n\n     Claimant, who suffers from prostate cancer and a mental\n\nimpairment, worked at Damas Hospital in Puerto Rico until March 31,\n\n1995, when he was fired.      The Commissioner rejected this as an\n\nonset date because claimant had worked subsequent to this time at\n\nAuto Mart de Ponce, and this work had amounted to substantial\n\ngainful employment.     Claimant stopped this second job in March\n\n1996.     However, the Commissioner determined that from April 1996\n\nthrough the end of October 1997, claimant had retained the residual\n\nfunctional capacity to perform his past work.      It was not until\n\nclaimant's cancer had metastasized in approximately November 1997\n\nthat the Commissioner found that claimant had become disabled.\n\n        On appeal, claimant argues that his job at Auto Mart was an\n\nunsuccessful work attempt and thus did not amount to substantial\n\ngainful activity.    See Social Security Ruling 84-25, Determination\n\nof Substantial Gainful Activity if Substantial Work Activity is\n\nDiscontinued or Reduced -- Unsuccessful Work Attempt, 1984 WL\n\n49799.    However, claimant never presented this argument below.   It\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fis settled that arguments which could have been presented to the\n\ndistrict court, but were not, generally are waived on appeal.\n\nWindsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 56 n.7\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     Even assuming, without deciding, that claimant's job at Auto\n\nMart was an unsuccessful work attempt, the onset date of November\n\n1, 1997 initially established by the administrative law judge (ALJ)\n\nis supported by substantial evidence.   See Nguyen v. Chater, 172\n\nF.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (\"[t]he ALJ's findings of\n\nfact are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence\").   In\n\nthis regard, there are two time periods in issue:   (1) April 1996\n\nthrough the end of October 1997 -- the period during which the ALJ\n\nconcluded that claimant could perform his past work; and (2) April\n\n1995 through March 1996 -- the period the ALJ did not adjudicate\n\nbecause he had found that claimant had been engaged in substantial\n\ngainful activity during this time.    As for the adjudicated time\n\nperiod, the ALJ concluded that claimant (1) retained the residual\n\nfunctional capacity (RFC) for light work, (2) could walk or sit for\n\nup to six hours each in an eight-hour work day, and (3) did not\n\nhave any limitations on his ability to engage in mental work-\n\nrelated activities.\n\n     In relation to his physical impairment, claimant argues only\n\nthat because he never had recovered from his cancer, he became\n\ndisabled on March 31, 1995. However, claimant does not address the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\freal issue -- the impact of his cancer on his capacity to perform\n\nthe exertional requirements of work.           A review of the record\n\nnonetheless indicates that claimant experienced little in the way\n\nof physical limitations as the result of his prostate cancer during\n\nthe relevant time.\n\n     After claimant's surgery (November 1993), claimant reported\n\nthat he essentially was doing well.       And, although claimant's PSA\n\nlevels were increasing in July and November 1996, there were no\n\nreports by claimant of any physical complaints. Indeed, claimant's\n\ntreating physician completed a Genito-Urinary Medical Report, dated\n\nNovember 11, 1996, in which he indicates that claimant's only\n\nlimitations were that he was precluded from heavy lifting and\n\nstrenuous   exercise.     In   addition   to   the   foregoing,   an   RFC\n\nassessment, completed by a non-examining physician in 1996 and\n\naffirmed by a second non-examining physician in April 1997, found\n\nthat claimant was capable of performing medium work.          Thus, the\n\nALJ's decision that, from April 1996 through the end of October\n\n1997, claimant retained the exertional RFC to perform his past work\n\n-- which was light -- is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n     As for claimant's mental impairment, the ALJ concluded that\n\nthis condition was not severe during the period from April 1996\n\nthrough the end of October 1997.     Claimant argues that the ALJ was\n\nrequired to give controlling weight to the opinion of Dr. Ruben\n\nRivera   Carrion   that   claimant   essentially     was   incapable    of\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fperforming any work due to his mental impairment.                  We disagree and\n\nfind    that    substantial     evidence       supports    the     ALJ's   decision\n\nregarding the non-severity of this impairment.\n\n       First, Dr. Rivera did not have a long treatment relationship\n\nwith claimant, having seen claimant on only three occasions.\n\nSecond, Dr. Rivera's conclusions about the severity of claimant's\n\nmental impairment are not consistent with the other substantial\n\nevidence in the record.           See Keating v. Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services 848 F.2d 271, 275-76 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam)\n\n(the conclusions of a treating physician regarding disability may\n\nbe   rejected    by    the    Commissioner      where     contradictory    medical\n\nevidence appears in the record).                  In particular, both of the\n\nconsultative psychiatrists who had examined claimant opined that\n\nclaimant was coherent, relevant, logical, and oriented; they also\n\nfound that claimant's memory was intact. And, although Dr. Luis A.\n\nToro found that claimant's capacity for concentration had slightly\n\ndiminished,      Dr.   Carmen     M.     Cotto-Perez       found    that   it    was\n\nsatisfactory.      See Sitar v. Schweiker, 671 F.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n1982)   (\"a    treating      physician's       diagnosis    is   not   necessarily\n\nentitled to more weight than that of a [physician] who examines the\n\nclaimant only once\").\n\n       Further, two of the non-examining physicians who completed\n\nPsychiatric      Review      Technique    forms    specifically        opined   that\n\nclaimant's mental impairment was not severe.                And, both Drs. Cotto\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fand Toro never indicated that claimant was incapable of working due\n\nto his emotional problems.      Although the report of Dr. Rivera\n\nconflicts with the above, the resolution of conflicts in the\n\nevidence and the ultimate determination of disability are for the\n\nALJ, not the courts.     See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n     Given the above, we see no reason for a remand for a decision\n\nregarding the un-adjudicated period of April 1995 through March\n\n1996.    In particular, there simply is no indication that either of\n\nclaimant's impairments were worse during this earlier time.      It\n\ntherefore is clear that, based on the evidence in the record and\n\nthe findings the ALJ already had made, only one result could obtain\n\nfor this earlier time -- that claimant retained the RFC for light\n\nwork and that he did not have any limitations on his ability to\n\nengage in mental work-related activities.     As a result, claimant\n\ndid not become disabled until November 1, 1997 the onset date\n\nestablished by the Commissioner.\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
