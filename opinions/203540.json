Gebhart, Bonnie S. McGuire, Heather S. Crall, and\nRopes & Gray LLP on brief for petitioners.\n     Greg D. Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Gregory G. Katsas, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Division, Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           October 27, 2008\n\f              PER CURIAM.     Colette Ligoussou, of the Central African\n\nRepublic   (\"CAR\"),      petitions     for    review      of   the     denial   of   her\n\napplication,     filed    for   herself      and    her    husband,      for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.\n\n              We do not repeat here the familiar legal structure for\n\njudicial review of such claims, which is set forth in numerous\n\nopinions of this court. See, e.g., Kechichian v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2008).          It suffices to say Ligoussou must establish\n\nthere was some material error of law by the immigration agency or\n\nthat the evidence before the immigration agency compelled the\n\ngranting of the relief she seeks.             We have reviewed the record and\n\nthe arguments.\n\n              We start with Ligoussou's objection that her hearing\n\nbefore the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") did not comport with the due\n\nprocess requirements of the Constitution.                      The case started in\n\nBoston   on    March   30,    2005,    and    the   hearing      was    continued     to\n\nSeptember 23, 2005, when the parties appeared, without objection,\n\nby tele-video conference.        In her petition, Ligoussou contends the\n\nconduct of the hearing by video conference itself violated due\n\nprocess, the hearing was conducted by a hostile IJ in a manner\n\nwhich    prevented     her    from    communicating        her    story,    and      that\n\ntranslation errors added to the problem. There were, though, never\n\nany objections made to the IJ to this effect.                           The Board of\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") correctly ruled that it is well settled\n\nthat IJs may conduct video conferences to the same extent they\n\nconduct   hearings   with   witnesses     present.    See   8   C.F.R.\n\nยง 1003.25(c).   The BIA rejected the other arguments that Ligoussou\n\nwas deprived of a fair hearing.         Our own review of the record\n\nconfirms the BIA's view.    As the BIA stated:\n\n          Further, the Immigration Judge's insistence\n          that    the     lead    respondent     testify\n          chronologically, the nature of his questioning\n          of the lead respondent, and his efforts to\n          ensure the lead respondent's responsiveness to\n          questions     constituted      the     routine\n          administration of court proceedings that did\n          not offend principles of fundamental fairness,\n          deprive the lead respondent of an opportunity\n          to meaningfully present her case, or otherwise\n          cause a deficiency in the record. See, e.g.,\n          Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 62-63 (1st\n          Cir. 2004).\n\nWe add there is nothing unfair in an IJ, especially one who has\n\nspent hours reviewing the written materials in a case, urging that\n\nthe testimony of the petitioner get to the heart of the matter of\n\npersecution and proceed in a chronological fashion.     The argument\n\nthat Ligoussou's due process rights were violated fails.\n\n          Turning to the merits, the IJ supportably found that\n\nLigoussou was not credible on a number of her statements in her\n\naccount of why she feared persecution, and additionally found she\n\nlacked for corroborating evidence, although such evidence would not\n\nhave been difficult to obtain.     Colette Ligoussou was the only\n\nwitness offered by petitioners.    The lack-of-credibility finding\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fwas based on direct contradictions and unexplained discrepancies in\n\nher testimony, and on observation of her demeanor.    Our own review\n\nof the record confirms the BIA's upholding of the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility finding and that the inconsistencies were material and\n\ncentral to Ligoussou's claim.    The declaration of her psychiatrist\n\ndoes not require a different outcome.\n\n            Because Ligoussou was not credible, it was entirely\n\ncorrect for the IJ to require her to provide corroboration.        8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 1208.13.    Corroboration was far from difficult, she had\n\nfamily in both France and the CAR in a position to verify her\n\naccounts of persecution, were they true.    It was her choice not to\n\ncall her husband as a witness.\n\n            Moreover, Ligoussou voluntarily returned to the CAR in\n\nApril 2001 after the supposed persecution.     She also left the CAR\n\nwith government permission in November 2001.    The record certainly\n\ndoes not compel the conclusion that she suffered persecution.\n\n            The BIA found that Ligoussou did not raise the issue of\n\nthe IJ's denial of voluntary departure in her appeal of the IJ's\n\ndecision.   Since the BIA was correct in finding the issue had been\n\nwaived, we are consequently precluded from addressing it.    Sela v.\n\nMukasey, 520 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
