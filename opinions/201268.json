William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n                          October 5, 2004\n\n\n\n     Anthony Drago on Opposition to Motion to Vacate, for\npetitioner.\n     Papu Sandhu, Office of Immigration Litigation, on Motion to\nVacate, for respondents.\n\f            Per Curiam.   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\n\nappeals a judgment of the district court granting petitioner Gloria\n\nArevalo's request for habeas relief.      Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 260\n\nF.Supp.2d 347 (D. Mass. 2003) (Arevalo I).       Subsequent to the\n\nfiling of this appeal, this court issued a decision vacating\n\npetitioner's order of removal.      Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1\n\n(1st Cir.   2003) (Arevalo II).   Since the district court decision\n\nis now moot, we must dismiss the instant appeal for lack of\n\njurisdiction.   At the same time, at the request of ICE, we instruct\n\nthe district court to vacate its judgment granting habeas relief.\n\n\n\n            We summarize only the facts essential to this appeal.\n\nFurther background can be found in our prior opinion.      In early\n\n2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)1 served\n\npetitioner with notice that it intended to reinstate, pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. ยง 1231(a)(5), a prior deportation order and to remove her\n\nfrom the United States.     At the same time, the INS took Arevalo\n\ninto custody.    When Arevalo sought relief in the district court,\n\nthat court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover her request and transferred the case to this court.       This\n\ncourt temporarily stayed petitioner's deportation and denied her\n\nrequest for habeas relief without prejudice to her seeking such\n\n\n     1\n      Effective March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its\ninterior enforcement functions were transferred to the Department\nof Homeland Security. ICE is a sub-agency of this department.\n\n                                  -2-\n\frelief in the district court.          While petitioner's appeal of the\n\nremoval order was pending in this court, the district court granted\n\nArevalo's request for habeas relief.            The court held that the\n\nrelevant statute did not authorize ICE to detain Arevalo after the\n\n90-day period provided by 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231(a) expired.            Arevalo I,\n\n260 F.Supp.2d at 349-50.           ICE appealed.    While its appeal was\n\npending, we decided that ICE could not reinstate its prior removal\n\norder against Arevalo because of ex post facto concerns. Arevalo\n\nII, 344 F.3d at 9-15. This effectively mooted the instant appeal.\n\nICE now seeks to have the district court judgment vacated because\n\nof what it claims is the district court's erroneous interpretation\n\nof ยง 1231(a).\n\n              Whether or not to vacate a decision that has become moot\n\non   appeal    rests   in   the   equitable   discretion   of   this    court.\n\nKerkhoff v. MCI Worldcom, Inc., 282 F.3d 44, 53 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nA primary consideration is whether the appellant deliberately\n\nmooted the appeal.     See id.; see also Fed. Ins. Co. v. Maine Yankee\n\nAtomic Power Co., 311 F.3d 79, 82 (1st Cir. 2002).                     Vacatur\n\nnormally is granted unless the mootness arises from settlement\n\nbetween the parties or from appellant's voluntary withdrawal of the\n\nappeal.   Med. Prof'l       Mut. Ins. Co. v. Breon Labs., Inc., 141 F.3d\n\n373, 375 (1st Cir. 1998).         As explained by the Supreme Court, \"[a]\n\nparty who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling, but is\n\nfrustrated by the vagaries of circumstance, ought not in fairness\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fbe forced to acquiesce in the judgment.\"                United States Bancorp\n\nMortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25 (1994).\n\n              Equitable considerations favor vacatur in the instant\n\n case.     Not only did ICE vigorously pursue its appeal but, \"as a\n\n repeat player before the courts, [it] is primarily concerned with\n\n the precedential effect of the decision below,\" Motta v. Dist.\n\n Dir. of INS, 61 F.3d 117, 119 (1st Cir. 1995), and \"has an\n\n institutional interest in vacating adverse rulings of potential\n\n precedential value,\" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 322 F.3d\n\n 747, 750 (1st Cir. 2003).         \"A case that becomes moot pending\n\n appeal, necessarily untested by appellate scrutiny, lacks the\n\n stamp of reliability that is required to warrant preclusive\n\n effect.\" Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists\n\n and     Aerospace   Workers,   915    F.2d       43,   48   (1st   Cir.    1990)\n\n (attributions and internal quotation marks omitted).                 Moreover,\n\n petitioner is no longer subject to reinstatement of the removal\n\n order against her.         Consequently, vacating the judgment harms\n\n neither party and leaves the interpretation of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231(a)\n\n to be litigated fully in a more appropriate case.\n\n              We need go no further.             The appeal is dismissed as\n\n moot.      The   case   is   remanded      to    the   district    court    with\n\n instructions to vacate its memorandum and order, dated May 9,\n\n 2003.    This disposition in no way reflects any view of the merits\n\n of the appeal.\n\n              So ordered.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
