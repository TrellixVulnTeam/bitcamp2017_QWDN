Andri    Fnu,   hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “Andri and/or         Petitioner,” a native and citizen of\n\nIndonesia, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration    Appeals     (“BIA”)    denying     his   requests    for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and           protection under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (“CAT”).             Andri contends that the BIA\n\nerred (1) in determining that the Petitioner did not establish harm\n\nrising to the level of persecution, (2) by failing to properly take\n\ninto consideration the country conditions of record, and (3) by\n\nfailing to take into account the totality of the circumstances for\n\npurposes of both past persecution and well founded fear of future\n\npersecution.     For     the   reasons   stated     below,    we    dismiss   the\n\npetition.\n\n                               I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            Andri arrived in the United States on a visa which he\n\nadmitted was fraudulently obtained, misrepresenting himself as a\n\nBoy Scout organizer.        He was admitted on January 16, 2001, with\n\npermission to remain in the United States for three months until\n\nApril 15, 2001. Andri filed an application for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT), which was received by the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService on July 10, 2002.\n\n            Petitioner was interviewed on September 19, 2003 in\n\nconnection    with   his   application      and   was   referred     to   removal\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fproceedings after his interview via a Notice to Appear dated\n\nSeptember 25, 2003.       Andri was charged with being removable from\n\nthe   United   States,    pursuant     to    INA   §237(a)(1)(B),       8    U.S.C.\n\n§1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who overstayed in the United States\n\nlonger than permitted.\n\n            Represented    by    counsel,      Andri       appeared    before   an\n\nimmigration    judge   (“IJ”)    for    a    hearing   on    January    8,   2004.\n\nPetitioner admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear and\n\nconceded the charge of removability.           A second hearing was held on\n\nSeptember 21, 2005, wherein Andri presented evidence and testimony\n\nin support of his asylum application.\n\n            In support of his application, Andri testified before the\n\nIJ that he was bullied as a child in school and in his neighborhood\n\nfor being of Chinese ethnicity.         In 1990 Petitioner and his family\n\nmoved within Indonesia from Jakarta to Solo. Nevertheless, in 1995\n\nAndri moved back to Jakarta in order to administer a bakery\n\nbusiness which he owned.        Petitioner testified that approximately\n\nin 1993, a group of people presumed to be Muslims by Petitioner,\n\nwent to his father’s pig farm and killed almost half of his\n\nfamily’s    livestock,     at    the    time       being     about     200   pigs.\n\nNevertheless, Andri admitted that he learned about the incident\n\nthrough his father as he was not living at home when the incident\n\noccurred.   Furthermore, Petitioner testified that on May 13, 1998,\n\nwhile he was running his own bakery business, a group of about\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffifteen people, who Andri alleged were of Muslim extraction,\n\nstopped him and coerced him to show his national ID card which\n\nidentified   his religion.      After that they made him undress and\n\nproceeded to turn over his car.         Petitioner stated that, fearing\n\nfor his life, he had to walk six miles back to his house, without\n\nwearing any clothes.       He stated that after that incident he was\n\nemotionally stressed for weeks, and that he was unable to eat or\n\nsleep.\n\n           Petitioner further provided testimony relating to an\n\nincident that occurred on a particular Friday night in February of\n\n1999.    He stated that during a home prayer at an evangelical\n\nneighbor’s house, Muslims heaved rocks at the house and expressed\n\nthat if the occupants did not cease the praying, the house would be\n\ntorched.\n\n           Andri also testified about an incident that occurred the\n\nnight before Christmas in the year 2000.       He alleged that while in\n\nchurch, he heard a large explosion outside; he then saw that cars\n\nwere being overturned in the parking lot.         Andri further stated\n\nthat he later observed in the news that other churches had been\n\nbombed around that same time.\n\n           After the hearing had ended, the IJ issued an oral\n\ndecision   denying   all   three   of   petitioner’s   claims.   The   IJ\n\nspecifically concluded that Andri had failed to file his asylum\n\napplication within one (1) year of his arrival in the United States\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fand had failed to establish extraordinary or changed circumstances\n\nexcusing the untimeliness of his application.           In the alternative,\n\nthe IJ concluded that even if Petitioner’s application had been\n\ntimely filed, Andri had failed to establish eligibility for asylum.\n\nFurthermore, the IJ concluded that Petitioner had also failed to\n\nestablish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection\n\nunder CAT.   Nevertheless, the IJ granted Petitioner’s application\n\nfor voluntary departure.\n\n          Andri filed a timely appeal before the BIA; on April 9,\n\n2007 the Board dismissed Andri’s appeal.          The BIA agreed with the\n\nIJ’s determination.    Petitioner was ruled ineligible for asylum\n\nsince he failed to file an asylum application within the one (1)\n\nyear   filing   deadline    and    failed   to    establish   any   changed\n\ncircumstances   affecting    his    eligibility    or   any   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances that would justify the delay in filing his asylum\n\napplication.    The BIA further stated that Andri had failed to\n\naddress this finding with any specificity on appeal.           Furthermore,\n\nthe BIA agreed with the IJ’s alternative finding, turning to the\n\nmerits of Andri’s application for asylum, that even though Andri’s\n\ntestimony was credible, he failed to establish harm rising to the\n\nlevel of persecution. Moreover, the BIA found that the evidence of\n\nrecord demonstrated a change in country conditions sufficient to\n\nrebut a presumption of well-founded fear or clear probability of\n\nfuture persecution in Indonesia based on Andri’s Chinese ethnicity\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\for Christian religion.        The BIA further concluded that the fact\n\nthat Andri’s family members had continued to reside in Indonesia\n\nunharmed, properly rebutted any claimed fear of future harm.\n\nFinally,   the    BIA    stated   that    Petitioner   failed    to   allege    or\n\nidentify error in the denial of protection pursuant to the CAT.\n\nConsequently, the BIA did not address said issue.               The BIA further\n\nordered that pursuant to the IJ’s determination and conditioned\n\nupon compliance with the conditions set forth by the IJ and the\n\nstatute, Petitioner was permitted to voluntarily depart from the\n\nUnited States.\n\n                                  II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n     The   Court    of     appeals   reviews     BIA   decisions      under    the\n\n“substantial evidence” standard based “on the record as whole”, and\n\n“reverse[s] only if ‘any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.’”           El-Labaki v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 1,\n\n*4-*5   (1st     Cir.    2008)(emphasis        ours)(quoting     8    U.S.C.     §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n           This standard requires us to uphold the\n           agency's    findings   of   fact,    including\n           credibility determinations, as long as they\n           are “supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n           probative evidence on the record considered as\n           a whole.” INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478,\n           481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); see\n           also Long v. Gonzáles, 422 F.3d 37, 40 (1st\n           Cir.2005). We reverse only if “any reasonable\n           adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n           the contrary.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see\n           also Chikkeur v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 1381,\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            1382-83 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\nId.\n\n            Nevertheless, “[w]hen the BIA both adopts the decision of\n\nan immigration judge and adds a new ground for upholding the\n\nresult, ‘this court reviews the IJ's decision as though it were the\n\nBIA's to the extent of the adoption, and the BIA's decision as to\n\nthe additional ground.’”       Singh v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 1, *4        (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (emphasis ours) (quoting Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales, 460\n\nF.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 2006)).\n\n\n\nB.    Asylum Claim\n\n            Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § § 1158(a)(2)(B), 1158(a)(2)(D), an\n\napplication for asylum must be “filed within 1 year after the date\n\nof the alien's arrival in the United States”, unless “the alien\n\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the\n\nexistence of changed circumstances which materially affect the\n\napplicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\n\nrelating to the delay in filing an application within the period\n\nspecified...”.       Nevertheless, this Court has no jurisdiction to\n\nreview the “agency's determination regarding the timeliness of the\n\nasylum   application     or   its   application   of   the   ‘extraordinary\n\ncircumstances’ exception, unless the petitioner identifies a legal\n\nor constitutional defect in the decision.”        El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at\n\n*5 (quoting 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(3), 1252(a)(2)(D)).\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            In the instant case it is uncontested that Petitioner\n\nfailed to file his application for asylum within one (1) year of\n\nhis arrival in the United States.                 Furthermore, the BIA, in\n\nagreement with the IJ stated that Andri had failed to establish any\n\n“changed    circumstances”       affecting    his       eligibility   or    any\n\n“extraordinary circumstances” that would warrant the delay in\n\nfiling his asylum application. Moreover, not only did the BIA find\n\nthat Andri had failed to address this issue with any specificity on\n\nappeal before the BIA, but we find that he also failed to raise the\n\nissue on appeal before this Court.\n\n            Petitioner also failed to raise any constitutional claims\n\nor questions of law.       Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe BIA’s “determination regarding the timeliness of the asylum\n\napplication or its application of the ‘extraordinary circumstances’\n\nexception.”        Id.; see also Hayek v. Gonzalez, 445 F.3d 501 , 506\n\n(1st Cir. 2006);         Ly v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 126, 130 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)(“This court lacks jurisdiction to review a decision based on\n\nthe timeliness of an asylum application. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3);\n\nRotinsulu     v.    Mukasey,   515   F.3d   68,    71   (1st   Cir.2008).   The\n\ngovernment's argument that the issue of asylum was waived is\n\ninapposite.”).\n\n            Nevertheless, we deem it necessary to emphasize that\n\nAndri is not eligible for asylum because he failed to timely file\n\nhis asylum application and failed since the very inception of the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcase before the IJ, to establish any “changed circumstances”\n\naffecting his eligibility or any “extraordinary circumstances” that\n\nwould excuse the delay in filing his asylum application.                In other\n\nwords, Andri is not ineligible for asylum because he failed to\n\nestablish that he is a refugee within the meaning of INA, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. §1208.13, he is ineligible because he failed\n\nto timely file his application and failed to establish any “changed\n\ncircumstances” affecting his eligibility or any “extraordinary\n\ncircumstances” that would justify the delay.                Therefore, we find\n\nthat   the   IJ’s    on       the   merits   alternative   analysis   regarding\n\nPetitioner’s failure to establish that he is a refugee within the\n\nmeaning of INA, 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. §1208.13, was\n\nperformed arguendo, and as such we have no jurisdiction to review\n\nthe IJ’s nor the BIA’s determinations regarding said alternative\n\nfinding. See El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at *5. Hence, all of Petitioner’s\n\narguments pertaining to said alternative analysis are inapposite.\n\n             Andri argues before this Court that the BIA committed\n\nclear error in ruling that the IJ had found that Petitioner did not\n\nestablish harm rising to the level of persecution, since the IJ\n\nstated three times in her oral decision that Andri had suffered\n\npersecution. Consequently, Petitioner argues that since the IJ did\n\nmake an explicit finding of past persecution, he is therefore\n\npresumed     to   have    a    well-founded    fear   of   future   persecution.\n\nFinally, Andri avers that the administrative agency failed to\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fproperly take into consideration the country conditions of record,\n\nand failed to take into account the totality of the circumstances\n\nfor purposes of both past persecution and well founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n              After reviewing all of Petitioner’s arguments, we find\n\nthat these assertions all relate to the IJ’s alternative analysis\n\nof his asylum claim, which as aforementioned, we lack jurisdiction\n\nto review.     See El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at *5.\n\n\n\nC. Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture (CAT)\nClaims\n\n              As to a claim for withholding of removal, the same\n\nimposes “‘a more stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a\n\ncounterpart claim for asylum.’ Withholding of removal requires that\n\nan alien establish a clear probability of persecution, rather than\n\nmerely a well-founded fear of persecution.”Ang v. Gonzalez, 430\n\nF.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2005)(internal citations omitted)(quoting\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005));\n\nsee also De Oliveira v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 78, 79 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(“In order to qualify for withholding of removal, [Petitioner]\n\nwould need to prove that it is more likely than not that he will\n\nface persecution should he return to [Indonesia].”) (emphasis\n\nours)( citing INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct.\n\n1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999)); Journal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 13\n\n(1st   Cir.   2007).   “This   showing   can   be   made   by   proving   past\n\n                                    -10-\n\fpersecution,   which   raises    a     rebuttable   presumption   of   the\n\nlikelihood of future persecution.”          De Oliveira, 520 F.3d at 79.\n\n          “An applicant for protection under Article III of CAT\n\nmust prove that it is more likely than not that he or she will be\n\ntortured if removed to the country designated for removal.” El-\n\nLabaki, 544 F.3d at *7 (quoting 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18) .\n\n          Torture is defined as any act by which severe\n          pain or suffering, whether physical or mental,\n          is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by\n          or at the instigation of or with the consent\n          or acquiescence of a public official or other\n          person acting in an official capacity.” Id. §\n          1208.18(a)(1). The possibility of internal\n          relocation is relevant in determining whether\n          the applicant has shown that he is likely to\n          be    tortured     if    removed.     Id.    §\n          1208.16(c)(3)(ii).\n\n\nTendean v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).        “Such torture\n\nmust be inflicted by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent\n\nor acquiescence of, a public official or other person acting in an\n\nofficial capacity.”    El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at *7.\n\n          Although Andri applied for withholding of removal and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture, he “devoted his\n\nappellate brief exclusively to his asylum claim and has failed to\n\ndevelop any argument supporting either his claim for withholding of\n\nremoval or his claim for protection under CAT.          Consequently, we\n\ndeem those claims abandoned.” Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115,\n\n120 FN. 3 (1st Cir. 2005).      Furthermore, “issues adverted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\n                                     -11-\n\fargumentation, are deemed waived.”     United States v. Zannino, 895\n\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990); see also Bonilla v. Mukasey, 539 F.3d 72,\n\n75 FN 1(1st Cir. 2008)(citing Ramallo Bros. Printing, Inc., v. El\n\nDia, Inc., 490 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 2007); Bebri v. Mukasey, ___\n\nF. 3d ___, 2008 WL 4603452 (1st Cir. 2008);     Makhoul v. Ashcroft,\n\n387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).   Moreover, Petitioner also failed\n\nto allege or identify any error in the denial of his CAT claim\n\nbefore the BIA.   Therefore, not only has he waived said claim, but\n\nwe lack jurisdiction to consider it.     See   Bollanos v. Gonzalez,\n\n461 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 2006)(citing Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d\n\n75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the petition for judicial review is\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

Andri    Fnu,   hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “Andri and/or         Petitioner,” a native and citizen of\n\nIndonesia, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration    Appeals     (“BIA”)    denying     his   requests    for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and           protection under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (“CAT”).             Andri contends that the BIA\n\nerred (1) in determining that the Petitioner did not establish harm\n\nrising to the level of persecution, (2) by failing to properly take\n\ninto consideration the country conditions of record, and (3) by\n\nfailing to take into account the totality of the circumstances for\n\npurposes of both past persecution and well founded fear of future\n\npersecution.     For     the   reasons   stated     below,    we    dismiss   the\n\npetition.\n\n                               I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            Andri arrived in the United States on a visa which he\n\nadmitted was fraudulently obtained, misrepresenting himself as a\n\nBoy Scout organizer.        He was admitted on January 16, 2001, with\n\npermission to remain in the United States for three months until\n\nApril 15, 2001. Andri filed an application for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT), which was received by the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService on July 10, 2002.\n\n            Petitioner was interviewed on September 19, 2003 in\n\nconnection    with   his   application      and   was   referred     to   removal\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fproceedings after his interview via a Notice to Appear dated\n\nSeptember 25, 2003.       Andri was charged with being removable from\n\nthe   United   States,    pursuant     to    INA   §237(a)(1)(B),       8    U.S.C.\n\n§1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who overstayed in the United States\n\nlonger than permitted.\n\n            Represented    by    counsel,      Andri       appeared    before   an\n\nimmigration    judge   (“IJ”)    for    a    hearing   on    January    8,   2004.\n\nPetitioner admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear and\n\nconceded the charge of removability.           A second hearing was held on\n\nSeptember 21, 2005, wherein Andri presented evidence and testimony\n\nin support of his asylum application.\n\n            In support of his application, Andri testified before the\n\nIJ that he was bullied as a child in school and in his neighborhood\n\nfor being of Chinese ethnicity.         In 1990 Petitioner and his family\n\nmoved within Indonesia from Jakarta to Solo. Nevertheless, in 1995\n\nAndri moved back to Jakarta in order to administer a bakery\n\nbusiness which he owned.        Petitioner testified that approximately\n\nin 1993, a group of people presumed to be Muslims by Petitioner,\n\nwent to his father’s pig farm and killed almost half of his\n\nfamily’s    livestock,     at    the    time       being     about     200   pigs.\n\nNevertheless, Andri admitted that he learned about the incident\n\nthrough his father as he was not living at home when the incident\n\noccurred.   Furthermore, Petitioner testified that on May 13, 1998,\n\nwhile he was running his own bakery business, a group of about\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffifteen people, who Andri alleged were of Muslim extraction,\n\nstopped him and coerced him to show his national ID card which\n\nidentified   his religion.      After that they made him undress and\n\nproceeded to turn over his car.         Petitioner stated that, fearing\n\nfor his life, he had to walk six miles back to his house, without\n\nwearing any clothes.       He stated that after that incident he was\n\nemotionally stressed for weeks, and that he was unable to eat or\n\nsleep.\n\n           Petitioner further provided testimony relating to an\n\nincident that occurred on a particular Friday night in February of\n\n1999.    He stated that during a home prayer at an evangelical\n\nneighbor’s house, Muslims heaved rocks at the house and expressed\n\nthat if the occupants did not cease the praying, the house would be\n\ntorched.\n\n           Andri also testified about an incident that occurred the\n\nnight before Christmas in the year 2000.       He alleged that while in\n\nchurch, he heard a large explosion outside; he then saw that cars\n\nwere being overturned in the parking lot.         Andri further stated\n\nthat he later observed in the news that other churches had been\n\nbombed around that same time.\n\n           After the hearing had ended, the IJ issued an oral\n\ndecision   denying   all   three   of   petitioner’s   claims.   The   IJ\n\nspecifically concluded that Andri had failed to file his asylum\n\napplication within one (1) year of his arrival in the United States\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fand had failed to establish extraordinary or changed circumstances\n\nexcusing the untimeliness of his application.           In the alternative,\n\nthe IJ concluded that even if Petitioner’s application had been\n\ntimely filed, Andri had failed to establish eligibility for asylum.\n\nFurthermore, the IJ concluded that Petitioner had also failed to\n\nestablish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection\n\nunder CAT.   Nevertheless, the IJ granted Petitioner’s application\n\nfor voluntary departure.\n\n          Andri filed a timely appeal before the BIA; on April 9,\n\n2007 the Board dismissed Andri’s appeal.          The BIA agreed with the\n\nIJ’s determination.    Petitioner was ruled ineligible for asylum\n\nsince he failed to file an asylum application within the one (1)\n\nyear   filing   deadline    and    failed   to    establish   any   changed\n\ncircumstances   affecting    his    eligibility    or   any   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances that would justify the delay in filing his asylum\n\napplication.    The BIA further stated that Andri had failed to\n\naddress this finding with any specificity on appeal.           Furthermore,\n\nthe BIA agreed with the IJ’s alternative finding, turning to the\n\nmerits of Andri’s application for asylum, that even though Andri’s\n\ntestimony was credible, he failed to establish harm rising to the\n\nlevel of persecution. Moreover, the BIA found that the evidence of\n\nrecord demonstrated a change in country conditions sufficient to\n\nrebut a presumption of well-founded fear or clear probability of\n\nfuture persecution in Indonesia based on Andri’s Chinese ethnicity\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\for Christian religion.        The BIA further concluded that the fact\n\nthat Andri’s family members had continued to reside in Indonesia\n\nunharmed, properly rebutted any claimed fear of future harm.\n\nFinally,   the    BIA    stated   that    Petitioner   failed    to   allege    or\n\nidentify error in the denial of protection pursuant to the CAT.\n\nConsequently, the BIA did not address said issue.               The BIA further\n\nordered that pursuant to the IJ’s determination and conditioned\n\nupon compliance with the conditions set forth by the IJ and the\n\nstatute, Petitioner was permitted to voluntarily depart from the\n\nUnited States.\n\n                                  II.

Asylum Claim\n\n            Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § § 1158(a)(2)(B), 1158(a)(2)(D), an\n\napplication for asylum must be “filed within 1 year after the date\n\nof the alien's arrival in the United States”, unless “the alien\n\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the\n\nexistence of changed circumstances which materially affect the\n\napplicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\n\nrelating to the delay in filing an application within the period\n\nspecified...”.       Nevertheless, this Court has no jurisdiction to\n\nreview the “agency's determination regarding the timeliness of the\n\nasylum   application     or   its   application   of   the   ‘extraordinary\n\ncircumstances’ exception, unless the petitioner identifies a legal\n\nor constitutional defect in the decision.”        El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at\n\n*5 (quoting 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(3), 1252(a)(2)(D)).\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            In the instant case it is uncontested that Petitioner\n\nfailed to file his application for asylum within one (1) year of\n\nhis arrival in the United States.                 Furthermore, the BIA, in\n\nagreement with the IJ stated that Andri had failed to establish any\n\n“changed    circumstances”       affecting    his       eligibility   or    any\n\n“extraordinary circumstances” that would warrant the delay in\n\nfiling his asylum application. Moreover, not only did the BIA find\n\nthat Andri had failed to address this issue with any specificity on\n\nappeal before the BIA, but we find that he also failed to raise the\n\nissue on appeal before this Court.\n\n            Petitioner also failed to raise any constitutional claims\n\nor questions of law.       Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe BIA’s “determination regarding the timeliness of the asylum\n\napplication or its application of the ‘extraordinary circumstances’\n\nexception.”        Id.; see also Hayek v.

The\n\ngovernment's argument that the issue of asylum was waived is\n\ninapposite.”).\n\n            Nevertheless, we deem it necessary to emphasize that\n\nAndri is not eligible for asylum because he failed to timely file\n\nhis asylum application and failed since the very inception of the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcase before the IJ, to establish any “changed circumstances”\n\naffecting his eligibility or any “extraordinary circumstances” that\n\nwould excuse the delay in filing his asylum application.                In other\n\nwords, Andri is not ineligible for asylum because he failed to\n\nestablish that he is a refugee within the meaning of INA, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. §1208.13, he is ineligible because he failed\n\nto timely file his application and failed to establish any “changed\n\ncircumstances” affecting his eligibility or any “extraordinary\n\ncircumstances” that would justify the delay.                Therefore, we find\n\nthat   the   IJ’s    on       the   merits   alternative   analysis   regarding\n\nPetitioner’s failure to establish that he is a refugee within the\n\nmeaning of INA, 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. §1208.13, was\n\nperformed arguendo, and as such we have no jurisdiction to review\n\nthe IJ’s nor the BIA’s determinations regarding said alternative\n\nfinding. See El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at *5. Hence, all of Petitioner’s\n\narguments pertaining to said alternative analysis are inapposite.\n\n             Andri argues before this Court that the BIA committed\n\nclear error in ruling that the IJ had found that Petitioner did not\n\nestablish harm rising to the level of persecution, since the IJ\n\nstated three times in her oral decision that Andri had suffered\n\npersecution. Consequently, Petitioner argues that since the IJ did\n\nmake an explicit finding of past persecution, he is therefore\n\npresumed     to   have    a    well-founded    fear   of   future   persecution.\n\nFinally, Andri avers that the administrative agency failed to\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fproperly take into consideration the country conditions of record,\n\nand failed to take into account the totality of the circumstances\n\nfor purposes of both past persecution and well founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n              After reviewing all of Petitioner’s arguments, we find\n\nthat these assertions all relate to the IJ’s alternative analysis\n\nof his asylum claim, which as aforementioned, we lack jurisdiction\n\nto review.     See El-Labaki, 544 F.3d at *5.\n\n\n\nC. Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture (CAT)\nClaims\n\n              As to a claim for withholding of removal, the same\n\nimposes “‘a more stringent burden of proof on an alien than does a\n\ncounterpart claim for asylum.’ Withholding of removal requires that\n\nan alien establish a clear probability of persecution, rather than\n\nmerely a well-founded fear of persecution.”Ang v.
