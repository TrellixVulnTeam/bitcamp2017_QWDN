This case is the first occasion\n\nfor   us   to   address   a   copyright     infringement     suit   under   the\n\nArchitectural Works Copyright Protection Act (\"AWCPA\"), Pub. L. No.\n\n101-650, §§ 701-706, 104 Stat. 5089, 5133-34 (1990) (codified in\n\nscattered sections of 17 U.S.C.), which created a new category of\n\ncopyrightable subject matter for \"architectural works.\"              17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 102(a)(8).\n\n            The plaintiffs, T-Peg, Inc. and Timberpeg East, Inc.\n\n(collectively, \"Timberpeg\"), sell both architectural designs and\n\nthe   associated   packages    of    material    for   the   construction   of\n\ntimberframed homes.       Timberpeg created architectural plans for a\n\nhome for Stanley Isbitski in Salisbury, New Hampshire. The central\n\nfeature of those plans was the timberframed main house, although\n\nthe plans did not show a completed final architectural design for\n\nthe actual timberframe. The plaintiffs registered their second set\n\nof preliminary plans as an architectural work with the Copyright\n\nOffice, and maintained ownership over the copyright in the work\n\nembodied in the plans.\n\n            Isbitski,     however,    never     purchased    a   construction\n\nmaterials package and final plans from Timberpeg.             He did file the\n\nregistered plans with the Town of Salisbury in order to get a\n\nbuilding permit.     Isbitski hired defendant, Vermont Timber Works,\n\nInc. (\"VTW\"), to erect a timberframe for his home.            VTW erected its\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\ftimberframe, but Isbitski never completed his home.                 A later owner\n\nbought the property and completed the home.\n\n            Timberpeg filed suit against both Isbitski and VTW,\n\nclaiming, inter alia, that the timberframe designed through shop\n\ndrawings and constructed by VTW for Isbitski infringed Timberpeg's\n\ncopyright in the architectural work. This appeal concerns only the\n\ncopyright infringement claim against VTW.               Isbitski could not be\n\nfound and was never served.\n\n            The district court granted summary judgment to VTW,\n\nfinding that no reasonable jury could conclude that VTW copied\n\nTimberpeg's    architectural      work,        or   that    VTW's     frame   was\n\n\"substantially similar\" to Timberpeg's registered plans.                      The\n\ndistrict court also awarded attorneys' fees to VTW.\n\n            We reverse the judgment of the district court, finding\n\nthat there is a genuine issue of material fact as to Timberpeg's\n\ncopyright infringement claim under the AWCPA. As a result, we also\n\nvacate the award of attorneys' fees and remand.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We recount the facts, taking all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of Timberpeg, the party that opposed the entry of summary\n\njudgment.    See Senior v. NSTAR Elec. & Gas Corp., 449 F.3d 206, 208\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Stanley Isbitski owned a plot of land in Salisbury, New\n\nHampshire,    on   which   he   wanted    to    build   a   home     featuring   a\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f\"timberframe.\"     A timberframe is a house frame using wooden posts\n\nand beams which remain visible inside the building.                   The more\n\ncommon \"stick built\" home, by contrast, is framed using two-inch\n\nlumber rather than posts and beams.               Isbitski dealt both with\n\nTimberpeg and with VTW, two companies that are, broadly speaking,\n\nin   the    timberframe     business,      but   have   different    sorts   of\n\noperations. Douglas Friant is one of the founders and co-owners of\n\nVTW, and is responsible for the drafting of timberframe shop\n\ndrawings1 for VTW.       Isbitski's dealings with Timberpeg and VTW, and\n\nhis own work on his house (he was acting as his own general\n\ncontractor for the construction of the home), ran somewhat in\n\nparallel.     We describe his dealings with each company separately.\n\nA.           Isbitski's Dealings with Timberpeg\n\n             Timberpeg markets and sells designs and its own brand of\n\n\"packages\" for the construction of timberframe homes.               A Timberpeg\n\npackage consists of the materials used for the construction of a\n\nhome's     timberframe    and   exterior    building    envelope    (including\n\nwindows, exterior doors, insulation, siding, exterior trim, and\n\ncedar roof shakes).         Timberpeg does not erect the packages it\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Friant distinguished between \"shop drawings,\" which \"deal\nspecifically with the components of the timberframe, their location\nand their connections,\" and \"architectural plans,\" which \"show the\noverall scope of the building\" and \"consist of foundation drawings,\nfirst and second floor drawings, elevations, sections, roof plans\nsometimes, perspectives sometimes.\"\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsells; instead, a customer must hire a builder or contractor to\n\nassemble and erect the package.\n\n            Timberpeg provides architectural design services for\n\ncustomers, and has a staff of architects and designers who can\n\ncreate all the necessary designs and architectural plans to build\n\na   home.   Timberpeg's business model is not based on selling design\n\nservices or architectural plans. Rather, Timberpeg makes its money\n\non the sale of its packages of construction material based on its\n\narchitectural     plans.     Timberpeg    provides       architectural   design\n\nservices as a way to facilitate the sale of its packages.\n\n            Sometime in 1999 or perhaps earlier, Isbitski approached\n\nTimberpeg    to   consider   the   purchase   of     a    Timberpeg   package.\n\nIsbitski, working with a Timberpeg employee, filled out a \"design\n\ninformation sheet\" about what he wanted the house to look like.\n\nThe actual design information sheet is not in the record.                    On\n\nNovember 15, 1999, Isbitski and Timberpeg entered into a \"Deposit\n\nAgreement for TIMBERPEG Preliminary Plans and Drawings.\"                  Under\n\nthis deposit agreement, Isbitski paid a $2500 deposit to Timberpeg,\n\nin exchange for which Timberpeg would and did create preliminary\n\narchitectural plans and construction plans for the house.                   The\n\npreliminary architectural plans would consist of a basement plan,\n\nfloor plans, four elevations (external, vertical views of the house\n\nfrom different angles showing exterior features such as window and\n\ndoor locations, roof pitches, and ceiling heights), and a building\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcross section. After Isbitski's approval of the preliminary plans,\n\nIsbitski would receive construction plans, including foundation\n\nplans and details of Timberpeg's standard construction techniques.\n\nAccording to the contract, the construction plans could \"be used\n\nfor   planning   the   construction    process,   ordering   materials,\n\nobtaining contractor bids, and securing a building permit.\"       Final\n\nplans, which included the complete frame drawings, would not be\n\nprepared as part of the deposit agreement, but would be prepared as\n\npart of the final contract for the purchase of a Timberpeg package.\n\nTimberpeg, in all, provided Isbitski with two versions of the\n\npreliminary plans and then construction plans. No final plans were\n\never provided.\n\n          Under the contract, Isbitski represented to Timberpeg\n\nthat \"any house plans, specifications, drawings or sketches of any\n\nkind (the 'Drawings') provided to [Timberpeg were] the result of an\n\noriginal design (the 'Design'),\" represented that he (Isbitski) was\n\nthe \"sole owner of the Design and has exclusive rights, including\n\ncopyright, in and to the Design as represented in the Drawings,\"\n\nand agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Timberpeg from use of the\n\ndrawings and design.     Timberpeg would own the copyright in the\n\n\"Preliminary Plans, Construction Plans, specifications, drawings,\n\nand other material (the 'Plans').\"      Isbitski could use the plans\n\n\"solely in connection with the evaluation and construction of one\n\n(1) Package purchased from [Timberpeg],\" and\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           [a]ny other use of the Plans, including, but\n           not   limited  to,  the   following,  is   an\n           unauthorized appropriation of copyright by\n           Customer and a breach of this Agreement: a)\n           the copying of all or any part of the Plans;\n           b) the utilization or partial utilization of\n           the Plans for the construction of a similar\n           building or structure; or c) any transfer or\n           delivery of the Plans to another person\n           without     written    authorization     from\n           [Timberpeg].\n\n           Isbitski was under no obligation to purchase a Timberpeg\n\npackage after seeing the preliminary plans or even the construction\n\nplans.   If he chose to purchase a package, the $2500 deposit would\n\nbe credited against the price of the package.         If he chose not to\n\npurchase a package, Isbitski would have to return the plans, and\n\nTimberpeg would return the deposit minus a fee for design time,\n\nbilled at $49 per hour, and other incidental costs.\n\n           Timberpeg created a first set of preliminary plans on\n\nDecember 29, 1999 and gave them to Isbitski.          These plans showed\n\nthe design of a house with a timberframed main portion and a wing\n\nthat would be stick built.     The record does not contain this first\n\nset of plans, and these plans were never registered with the\n\nCopyright Office.\n\n           In early 2001, Isbitski met again with Timberpeg, saying\n\nthat he was unsatisfied with the first set of preliminary plans.\n\nTimberpeg completed a new design for Isbitski on April 20, 2001\n\n\"based on [its] interpretation of Mr. Isbitski's rough ideas and\n\npreferences.\"    The   plans   were   given   to   Isbitski.   Timberpeg\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fregistered these plans with the Copyright Office on May 18, 2001.\n\nThe registration certificate shows that these second preliminary\n\nplans were registered as an \"architectural work.\"    It is only this\n\nsecond, registered set of preliminary plans that is at issue here.\n\n            Based on these plans, Isbitski applied for a building\n\npermit from the Town of Salisbury.      As part of the permitting\n\nprocess, in April 2001, Isbitski submitted the second preliminary\n\nplans to the Town of Salisbury, where they were placed in a public\n\nfile.\n\n            The second set of preliminary plans contained elevations\n\nand floor plans. The plans showed a two-floor main house connected\n\nvia a covered breezeway to a three-car garage with a lofted space\n\nabove it.    The first floor of the main house was nine feet tall;\n\nthe second floor was eight feet tall.     The main house consisted,\n\nbroadly speaking, of two major portions.        One portion -- the\n\nportion which would be timberframed -- was backwards-L-shaped.    A\n\ngreat room (with two-floor ceilings on the northern end of the\n\nhouse), kitchen, breakfast room, and dining room were on the first\n\nfloor, and a den was on the lofted second floor (which occupied\n\nonly the southern portion of the house).        The plans for this\n\nportion of the house did not contain a complete design of the\n\ntimberframe, but the floor plans did show where the vertical posts\n\nwould connect to the foundation and the location of at least some\n\nof the internal horizontal beams.       The timberframing in this\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fportion of the house used a particular style featuring common\n\nrafters with principal purlins (horizontal timbers supporting the\n\nrafters).    The roof in this portion was oriented north-to-south,2\n\nwith a particular pitch (roof angle) referred to as a \"twelve-by-\n\ntwelve\" pitch.\n\n            The exact dimensions of the timberframed portion of the\n\nmain house were 44 feet by 28 feet, with a 14-foot-by-8-foot\n\nsection cut out in the northwest corner to form the L shape, where\n\na screen porch would be located.          There was also a \"bump-out\" in\n\nthe kitchen on the western side of the house -- an approximately\n\neight-foot portion of the western wall containing windows that\n\njutted out one foot beyond the rest of the wall.           The timberframed\n\nportion of the house also featured a central switchback staircase\n\nlocated in the center of the timberframed portion of the home.            In\n\naddition to labels denoting the various rooms, the floor plan\n\nshowed the location of various fixtures, including a kitchen sink\n\n(located at the \"bump-out\"), a stove, and a fireplace.\n\n            The   second   major   component    of   the   main   house   --\n\ncontaining bedrooms, bathrooms, and the foyer -- was connected to\n\nthe eastern side of the timberframed portion, and was to be stick-\n\nbuilt.   The roof in this portion of the house was oriented east-to-\n\n\n     2\n       The orientations described here may not reflect true\nphysical orientation, but assume that the \"vertical\" part of the\nbackwards L in the home is pointed north. All references to the\ndirectional orientation of features of the home will make the same\nassumption.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fwest, and had a pitch of nine-by-twelve.            There was a covered porch\n\non the northern part of this portion, which connected to the\n\ncovered breezeway and the three-car garage.\n\n               In May 2001, Isbitski asked Timberpeg to modify its\n\npreliminary plans so that they reflected a timberframe in a \"bent\"\n\nstyle rather than the style previously used (which is variously\n\nreferred to in the record as a \"purlin\" style or a \"purlin with\n\ncommon rafters\" style).           He gave Timberpeg a picture clipped from\n\na magazine showing a bent frame (this was the same picture he later\n\ngave    to   VTW).     No    modifications       were   undertaken    until    the\n\nconstruction plans were drafted.\n\n               Later, in August 2001, Isbitski asked Timberpeg for a set\n\nof foundation plans showing the location of various support posts\n\nand    steel    girders,     so   he   could   start    pouring   the   concrete\n\nfoundation.      Timberpeg agreed, but asked Isbitski to send in $1500\n\nto cover past due and future design fees.               Timberpeg asserts that\n\nit continued to assume that Isbitski would eventually buy a package\n\nfrom   Timberpeg.       On    September    20,    2001,   Timberpeg     sent   its\n\n\"construction plans,\" reflecting a timberframe in a bent-frame\n\nstyle (although not containing a complete frame design), and the\n\nfoundation plan. This third set of plans, which reflected the bent\n\nframe, was never registered with the Copyright Office.                  Sometime\n\nthereafter, Isbitski poured the foundation of the home and also\n\nbegan construction of the three-car garage.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fB.          Dealings with VTW\n\n            In December 2000, a year after Isbitski had seen the\n\nfirst preliminary Timberpeg plans but before Isbitski had asked\n\nTimberpeg     for    a    second   set    of    preliminary    plans,    Isbitski\n\napproached VTW.          VTW is located in Vermont, and specializes in\n\ntimberframing.       It has no architects on staff, and does not design\n\nbuildings   or      create     architectural     plans.       Instead,   it   uses\n\nspecifications provided by the customer to create shop drawings of\n\nthe frame of the building.          These specifications typically are in\n\nthe form of architectural plans, but VTW also can draw frames based\n\non rough sketches, as long as VTW receives information about the\n\nbuilding's footprint (the outline of the building as it sits on the\n\nground) and wall height.           VTW also has an in-house frame assembly\n\ncrew that actually erects the frame on site.\n\n            According to VTW, Isbitski stated that he had developed\n\na layout for a house plan with his then-deceased wife.                   Isbitski\n\nstated that his plan was to have VTW draw and construct only the\n\ntimberframe    for       the   timberframed     main   portion    of    the   home.\n\nIsbitski was going to act as the general contractor for the\n\nremainder of the home, subcontracting work to other people or\n\ncompanies as needed.            Starting at the end of 2000, VTW began\n\ndrawing a timberframe for Isbitski.\n\n            It is undisputed that in his first meeting with VTW in\n\nDecember 2000, Isbitski provided VTW with a copy of the first,\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\funregistered set of preliminary plans created by Timberpeg.                VTW\n\nasserts that its personnel only saw this first set of preliminary\n\nplans, not the second, registered plans, on which the claim here is\n\nbrought.   VTW also claims that those first preliminary plans did\n\nnot even factor into its creation of its timberframe for Isbitski's\n\nhome because Isbitski said he was unhappy with the plans, and that\n\nVTW, in fact, asked Isbitski to consult an architect to develop\n\nfloor plans and elevations for the home.        This, VTW says, would not\n\nhave been necessary had VTW been relying even on Timberpeg's first,\n\nunregistered     plans.     Timberpeg   counters   that   VTW    could   have\n\nobtained the second, registered preliminary plans, either through\n\nIsbitski himself or through the Town of Salisbury.                Timberpeg\n\npoints to a letter written by VTW's attorney after litigation had\n\ncommenced, which stated that Isbitski asked VTW \"to design a frame\n\nto fit a portion of the floor plans of his house\" and that Isbitski\n\nhad \"represented to [VTW] that he paid for and owned a set of\n\nplans, which he provided to [VTW] that were drawn by Timberpeg.\"\n\nThe letter does not say whether the plans referred to were the\n\nfirst set or the second set of plans created by Timberpeg.\n\n           VTW's position is that it took its directions only from\n\nIsbitski   and   that     Isbitski   provided   substantial     guidance   in\n\ndetermining VTW's shop drawings of the timberframe.             According to\n\nDouglas Friant at VTW, Isbitski said that he had been \"planning\n\nthis house for years and [was] working on the design for years.\"\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fAt the first meeting in December 2000, Isbitski provided the\n\ndimensions of his plan (although the record does not reveal the\n\nexact dimensions that he gave to VTW).       He also brought pictures\n\nclipped from a magazine and a catalog (not from Timberpeg) showing\n\nhow he wanted the frame to look.      The pictures showed a bent-style\n\nframe.     Friant stated that during the drafting process (starting\n\nfrom December 2000 until May 2002) Isbitski frequently would drop\n\nby or call VTW's shop unexpectedly, and would talk with Friant\n\nabout his ideas about what he wanted for the timberframe.         As an\n\nexample, Friant testified at his deposition that Isbitski was \"very\n\nconcerned about how the stairway looked\" and \"absolutely emphatic\n\nabout . . . making sure that he was able to hang a chandelier in\n\nthe stairway area,\" and this instruction required Friant to modify\n\nthe   shop    drawings.   According   to   VTW,   some   of   Isbitski's\n\ninstructions were very specific.      Isbitski would tell VTW where to\n\nplace posts within an eighth of an inch, and asked VTW to change\n\nthe roof pitch in VTW's original designs to a precise pitch he\n\nprovided.     During the time VTW was working on its shop drawings,\n\nIsbitski received the second preliminary plans and the construction\n\nplans from Timberpeg.\n\n             Isbitski agreed to purchase the VTW timberframe on March\n\n8, 2002.     By this time, Timberpeg's second preliminary plans, the\n\nregistered plans, had been in his hands for nearly one year, and\n\npublicly available for about the same amount of time.          Isbitski\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\falso had had possession of the construction drawings from Timberpeg\n\nfor nearly six months.     VTW completed final revisions to its shop\n\ndrawings of the timberframe design in May 2002.        The shop drawings\n\nshowed a bent-style frame which was in some ways similar to, and in\n\nother ways different from, the timberframed portion of the main\n\nhouse in Timberpeg's registered preliminary plan.            We consider\n\nthese similarities and differences in detail below.\n\n           By June 2002, Isbitski had completed the foundation and\n\nthe   three-car   garage   with   the    loft.   VTW   erected,   on   that\n\nfoundation, the frame as provided for in the shop drawings.            The\n\nparties assume that the erected frame reflected the shop drawings.\n\n           In September 2002, Isbitski informed Timberpeg that he\n\nwas not going to be purchasing a Timberpeg package.         According to\n\nTimberpeg, Isbitski said the reason was that he was going to build\n\na stick-built, rather than a timberframed, house.           Timberpeg in\n\nresponse asked for the remainder of the design fees due (which fees\n\nhad, by that point, exceeded Isbitski's total deposit), amounting\n\nto approximately $1000.     It is unclear whether Isbitski ever paid\n\nthis amount.   Soon thereafter, Timberpeg learned that Isbitski was\n\nbuilding a house, using VTW's timberframe, that looked like the\n\nhouse it had designed.\n\nC.         The Aftermath\n\n           Isbitski never completed the home, apparently because he\n\nran into financial difficulty.          Isbitski had begun enclosing the\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\ftimberframe built by VTW with exterior wall panels, but never\n\ncompleted that task, and the frame was left open to the elements.\n\nTimberpeg sold a license to its registered design to Sugar River\n\nSavings Bank in October 2003 in order to assist with the completion\n\nof construction of the home.    Under the terms of the license, the\n\nbank was free to re-sell to any party other than Isbitski or VTW.\n\nSometime in 2004, a representative from Timberpeg visited the\n\nIsbitski site.   The property had been purchased by a Mr. Dupee, who\n\nhad largely completed construction of the house in a manner which,\n\naccording to Timberpeg, was similar to the design as reflected in\n\nthe second set of preliminary plans created for Isbitski.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Timberpeg filed suit against VTW and Isbitski in the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court in New Hampshire on October 23, 2003.        Timberpeg\n\nasserted, inter alia, copyright infringement claims against VTW\n\nunder 17 U.S.C. §§ 501 et seq.    Timberpeg's claim against VTW was\n\nthat the timberframe designed in shop drawings and built by VTW was\n\n\"substantially similar to the architectural work embodied in the\"\n\nsecond   preliminary   plans,   which   it   had   registered   as   an\n\narchitectural work.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       After having been unable to locate and effect service upon\nIsbitski, Timberpeg voluntarily dismissed its claims against him\nwithout prejudice. Timberpeg later amended its complaint to add\nFriant as a defendant.\n\n                                 -15-\n\f           On February 9, 2005, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment to VTW on all counts.       As to the copyright infringement\n\nclaim, the district court first held, incorrectly relying on pre-\n\nAWCPA law, that VTW's constructed frame could not be a copy of an\n\narchitectural plan under copyright law.             The district court,\n\nconsidering only whether VTW's shop drawings were an infringing\n\ncopy of Timberpeg's architectural work, as embodied in the second\n\npreliminary plans, held as a matter of law that VTW had not\n\nactually copied Timberpeg's plans, and even assuming copying, that\n\nVTW's shop drawings were not substantially similar to Timberpeg's\n\narchitectural plans.\n\n           Timberpeg moved for reconsideration, pointing out that\n\nits claim was based on the AWCPA.          It argued that the district\n\ncourt's   holding   that   a   building   could   not   be   a   copy   of   an\n\narchitectural plan under copyright law was contrary to the AWCPA.4\n\nIt also argued that there was at least a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to unlawful copying.        Timberpeg relied, in part, on the\n\nletter from VTW's counsel, which it argued contained an admission\n\nthat the defendants had copied Timberpeg's plans.                  Timberpeg\n\nemphasized that its \"central theory . . . is that the timberframe,\n\nin the shop drawings and as constructed by the defendants[,] is an\n\ninfringing copy of the architectural work reflected in Timberpeg's\n\n\n     4\n       VTW, in response, agreed that the district court erred in\nconcluding that a building could not infringe an architectural work\nas embodied in an architectural plan.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fcopyright[ed] architectural plans, as opposed to an infringing copy\n\nof the plans themselves\" and that the claim squarely fell under the\n\nAWCPA.5\n\n              The district court reconsidered, and on April 6, 2005,\n\nheld that no reasonable jury could conclude that the timberframe as\n\nconstructed according to VTW's shop drawings was substantially\n\nsimilar to the architectural work as embodied in Timberpeg's\n\nregistered plans. In doing so, it rejected Timberpeg's reliance on\n\nthe letters from VTW's counsel.\n\n              VTW moved for attorneys' fees under the Copyright Act, 17\n\nU.S.C.    §   505.    The   district    court   granted   VTW's   motion   for\n\nattorneys' fees and awarded $116,642.43.\n\n                                       III.\n\n              Before turning to the specific arguments on appeal, we\n\ndiscuss the governing framework of copyright law and the AWCPA.\n\nThe AWCPA extended copyright protection to a class of works called\n\n\"architectural works,\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(8), which are defined as\n\n              the design of a building as embodied in any\n              tangible medium of expression, including a\n              building, architectural plans, or drawings.\n              The work includes the overall form as well as\n              the arrangement and composition of spaces and\n              elements in the design, but does not include\n              individual standard features.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       It is undisputed that Timberpeg's second preliminary plans\nwere created after the effective date of the AWCPA.     See AWCPA\n§ 706, 104 Stat. at 5134 (codified at 17 U.S.C. § 102 note).\n\n                                       -17-\n\f17 U.S.C. § 101.      Timberpeg argues that this definition is broad,\n\nand that VTW's timberframe (as reflected in the shop drawings and\n\nas   constructed)       infringes       Timberpeg's     copyright     in    the\n\narchitectural    work    as     embodied    in   its    second,     registered\n\npreliminary plans and including a particular configuration of\n\nelements which together form the work.\n\n            We first briefly lay out the requirements of a claim of\n\ncopyright infringement.\n\nA.          Copyright Infringement\n\n            Under the Copyright Act, \"[c]opyright protection subsists\n\n. . . in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium\n\nof expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be\n\nperceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly\n\nor with the aid of a machine or device.\"             17 U.S.C. § 102(a).     An\n\n\"architectural work\" is a work of authorship.            Id. § 102(a)(8).     A\n\ncopyright    holder   has     certain    exclusive    rights   to   the    work,\n\nincluding the right to reproduce all or any part of the copyrighted\n\nwork.    Id. § 106; see also Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).   One infringes a copyright when he or she violates one\n\nof the exclusive rights to a work held by a copyright owner, and\n\nthe owner has the right to sue for infringement.               See 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 501.\n\n            \"To establish copyright infringement under the Copyright\n\nAct, 'two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fcopyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that\n\nare original.'\"       Johnson, 409 F.3d at 17 (quoting Feist Publ'ns,\n\nInc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991)); see also\n\nYankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater Candle Co., 259 F.3d 25, 33 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co., 207 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).       Proving \"copying of constituent elements of the\n\nwork that are original\" (the second element of the Feist test)\n\nitself involves two steps: the plaintiff must show (a) that the\n\ndefendant actually copied the work as a factual matter, either\n\nthrough direct evidence or through indirect means, see Yankee\n\nCandle Co., 259 F.3d at 33; Segrets, 207 F.3d at 60, and (b) that\n\nthe   defendant's     \"copying    of   the    copyrighted    material   was    so\n\nextensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works\n\n'substantially similar,'\" Johnson, 409 F.3d at 17-18 (quoting Lotus\n\nDev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807, 813 (1st Cir.\n\n1995), aff'd by an equally divided court, 516 U.S. 233 (1996)).\n\n              In an infringement action, the burden is on the plaintiff\n\nto prove these elements.         Id.   VTW does not challenge Timberpeg's\n\nownership of a valid copyright in this case.                  This leaves the\n\nquestion of whether VTW \"cop[ied] constituent elements of the work\n\nthat are original.\"      Feist, 499 U.S. at 361.\n\nB.            The Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act\n\n              Historically, copyright law provided limited protection\n\nto    works    of   architecture.       Architectural       plans,   while    not\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fexplicitly mentioned in the Copyright Act of 1976, were covered\n\nunder a provision affording protection to \"pictorial, graphic, and\n\nsculptural works.\"     17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(5); see also 1 Nimmer &\n\nNimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 2.08[D][2][a], at 2-117 (2006)\n\n(discussing legislative history of Copyright Act of 1976).                   But\n\narchitectural structures themselves were afforded virtually no\n\nprotection.   See 1 Nimmer & Nimmer, supra, § 2.08[D][2][b], at 2-\n\n126; Ginsburg, Copyright in the 101st Congress: Commentary on the\n\nVisual Artists Rights Act and the Architectural Works Copyright\n\nProtection Act of 1990, 14 Colum.-VLA J.L. & Arts 477, 490 (1990).\n\n           This began to change with the accession of the United\n\nStates to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and\n\nArtistic Works, Sept. 9, 1886, as last revised July 24, 1971 and\n\namended Sept. 28, 1979, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-27, 1161 U.N.T.S. 30.\n\nThe Berne Convention requires protection for \"works of . . .\n\narchitecture\"    as   distinct   from    \"illustrations,    maps,       plans,\n\nsketches   and   three-dimensional       works   relative   to      .    .    .\n\narchitecture.\"    Id. art. 2.     The United States joined the Berne\n\nConvention with the passage of the Berne Convention Implementation\n\nAct of 1988 (\"BCIA\"), Pub. L. No. 100-568, 102 Stat. 2853 (1988).\n\nWhile the BCIA amended the definition of \"pictorial, graphic, and\n\nsculptural works\" to explicitly include \"architectural plans,\" id.\n\n§ 4 (codified at 17 U.S.C. § 101), it did not explicitly extend\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fprotection to \"architectural works,\" as distinct from architectural\n\nplans.\n\n            To ensure United States' compliance with the requirements\n\nof the Berne Convention, the AWCPA was signed into law on December\n\n1, 1990.    Pub. L. No. 101-650, §§ 701-706, 104 Stat. 5089, 5133-34\n\n(codified in scattered sections of 17 U.S.C.); see also H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 101-735 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6935. The AWCPA\n\nadded \"architectural works\" as a new category of copyrightable\n\nworks.     17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(8).     The legislative history makes it\n\nclear that \"[p]rotection for architectural plans, drawings, and\n\nmodels as pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works under section\n\n102(a)(5) . . . is unaffected by\" the AWCPA.          H.R. Rep. No. 101-\n\n735, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6950.\n\n            The definition of an \"architectural work,\" 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 101, quoted in full above, has three main components.           First, an\n\n\"architectural work\" is the \"design of a building as embodied in\n\nany tangible medium of expression.\"         Id.   The definition provides\n\nthree exemplars of such a tangible medium of expression -- \"a\n\nbuilding, architectural plans, or drawings\" -- although these are\n\nnot the only possible media of expression.            Id.   As originally\n\ndrafted, the bill only referred to architectural works as embodied\n\nin   buildings.      H.R.   Rep.    No.    101-735,   reprinted   in   1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6950. According to the legislative history for the\n\nAWCPA, \"there was concern that a defendant with access to the plans\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\for drawings could construct an identical building but escape\n\nliability so long as the plans or drawings were not copied.\"                 Id.\n\nTo close this potential gap, the bill was reworded to expand the\n\ndefinition of an architectural work to encompass a building design\n\n\"as embodied in any tangible medium of expression.\"             Id.\n\n          This more expansive definition means that the holder of\n\na copyright in an architectural plan (such as Timberpeg) has two\n\nforms of protection, one under the provision for an \"architectural\n\nwork\" under 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(8), and another under the provision\n\nfor a \"pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work\" under 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 102(a)(5).     The legislative history confirms this point.                See\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 101-735, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6950 (\"An\n\nindividual creating an architectural work by depicting that work in\n\nplans or drawing will have two separate copyrights, one in the\n\narchitectural work (section 102(a)(8)), the other in the plans or\n\ndrawings (section 102(a)(5)).\"). The two avenues of protection are\n\nslightly different in scope, as discussed below. As Timberpeg made\n\nclear in its motion for reconsideration before the district court,\n\nits   \"central   theory\"    is   based      on   the   protection     afforded\n\narchitectural works under § 102(a)(8) rather than the protection\n\nafforded architectural plans under § 102(a)(5).\n\n          The    second    component   of    the   definition   is    that    an\n\narchitectural work \"includes the overall form as well as the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\farrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design.\"\n\n17 U.S.C. § 101.      According to the legislative history,\n\n            [t]he phrase 'arrangement and composition of\n            spaces and elements' recognizes that: (1)\n            creativity in architecture frequently takes\n            the form of a selection, coordination, or\n            arrangement of unprotectible elements into an\n            original, protectible whole; (2) an architect\n            may   incorporate  new,   protectible   design\n            elements     into    otherwise      standard,\n            unprotectible building features; and (3)\n            interior architecture may be protected.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 101-735, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6949.\n\n            Finally, the definition excludes from the protectable\n\n\"architectural work\" \"individual standard features.\" 17 U.S.C.\n\n§   101.    The   legislative       history    provides   examples    of   such\n\nindividual standard features: \"common windows, doors, and other\n\nstaple building components.\"         H.R. Rep. No. 101-735, reprinted in\n\n1990   U.S.C.C.A.N.    at   6949.      Non-standard      individual   features\n\nreflecting some amount of originality are not necessarily excluded\n\nfrom copyright protection.           Id.     Furthermore, while individual\n\nstandard features may not be individually copyrightable, as the\n\nquoted legislative history above confirms, the combination of such\n\nstandard features may be copyrightable.            Id.\n\n            Under the Copyright Act, architectural works are, in at\n\nleast one sense, \"subject to a standard of copyrightability more\n\ngenerous   than   that   accorded     pictorial,    graphic    or   sculptural\n\nworks.\"    Ginsburg, supra, at 491.          Under 17 U.S.C. § 101,\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f               pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works . . .\n               include   works  of   artistic   craftsmanship\n               insofar as their form but not their mechanical\n               or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the\n               design of a useful article, as defined in this\n               section, shall be considered a pictorial,\n               graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only\n               to the extent that, such design incorporates\n               pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features\n               that can be identified separately from, and\n               are capable of existing independently of, the\n               utilitarian aspects of the article.\n\nId.    (emphasis     added).      The   requirement      that    the     protectable\n\nelements of a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work be separated\n\nfrom    the    \"utilitarian     aspects\"      of   the   work    under    17   U.S.C.\n\n§ 102(a)(5) is known as the \"separability test.\"                       By contrast,\n\nthere is no separability test for an architectural work.                       In the\n\nAWCPA, Congress purposefully did not impose such a separability\n\ntest for determining the copyrightability of architectural works.\n\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 101-735, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6951\n\n(\"[T]he       copyrightability    of    architectural      works    shall      not   be\n\nevaluated under the separability test applicable to pictorial,\n\ngraphic, or sculptural works.\").\n\n                                        IV.\n\n               We review the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nde novo.

McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).\n\n            On appeal, the arguments center around whether there is\n\na genuine issue of material fact as to substantial similarity. The\n\ndistrict court, at least in its first order, also concluded that no\n\nreasonable    jury   could   conclude   that   VTW   had   actually   copied\n\nTimberpeg's plans.      Since copying is a necessary element of a\n\ncopyright infringement claim, see Johnson, 409 F.3d at 17-18, we\n\nwould uphold summary judgment if the district court were correct on\n\nthis ground, and we may affirm on any ground supported by the\n\nrecord, see Senior, 449 F.3d at 216.            We briefly discuss the\n\nevidence of copying and conclude that the district court was not\n\ncorrect.\n\nA.          Actual Copying\n\n            Copying may be proven through direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence.     Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18.         Timberpeg points both to\n\ndirect and to circumstantial evidence of copying, sufficient to\n\ncreate a material issue of fact for a jury.\n\n            For direct evidence, Timberpeg points to the letter from\n\nVTW's attorneys stating that Isbitski \"represented to [VTW] that he\n\npaid for and owned a set of plans, which he provided to [VTW] that\n\nwere drawn by Timberpeg.\"      Timberpeg argues that this letter is an\n\nadmission by VTW that it relied on the registered preliminary\n\nplans.   VTW, like the district court, rejects Timberpeg's reliance\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fon the letters, arguing that the letters were not admissions, but\n\nto the contrary, state that VTW did not copy Timberpeg's plans.\n\nThe letter from VTW's attorney does not say whether the plans\n\nreferenced are the second, registered preliminary plans (about\n\nwhich there is a dispute as to whether VTW saw the plans) or the\n\nfirst, unregistered preliminary plans (which VTW acknowledges it\n\nreceived, but states it did not rely on).               This is a factual\n\ndispute about the meaning of the admission by counsel, and that\n\nissue cannot be resolved on summary judgment.\n\n            In the absence of direct evidence of copying -- such\n\ndirect evidence is rare, see Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18 -- one of the\n\nways   to   indirectly    establish   that    the   defendant    copied    the\n\nplaintiff's work is to provide evidence that (1) the defendant\n\n\"enjoyed    access   to   the   copyrighted    work,\"    and    so   had   the\n\nopportunity to copy the work, and (2) \"a sufficient degree of\n\nsimilarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly\n\ninfringing work to give rise to an inference of actual copying.\"\n\nId. The similarity inquiry used to indirectly establish copying is\n\nreferred to as \"probative similarity\" and is \"somewhat akin to, but\n\ndifferent than, the requirement of substantial similarity\" that\n\nmust be shown to prove copyright infringement.           Id.\n\n            As to access, Timberpeg argues that VTW had access to its\n\nregistered preliminary plans both because Isbitski had made those\n\nplans public by filing them with the Town of Salisbury, and because\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fVTW could have received the plans directly from Isbitski.               A trier\n\nof fact may impute access when there is \"evidence that a third\n\nparty with whom both the plaintiff and defendant were dealing had\n\npossession     of    plaintiff's    work,\"       and   the   \"plaintiff's     and\n\ndefendant's dealings took place concurrently.\"               4 Nimmer & Nimmer,\n\nsupra, § 13.02[A].       That is the case here.\n\n             As to whether there is a genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to \"probative similarity\" -- whether \"a sufficient degree of\n\nsimilarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly\n\ninfringing work to give rise to an inference of actual copying\" --\n\nthis analysis merges somewhat with the question of \"substantial\n\nsimilarity\" (although they are separate questions).                 We discuss\n\nbelow the similarities and dissimilarities between Timberpeg's\n\nregistered plans and VTW's frame in the context of the substantial\n\nsimilarity inquiry.      We conclude that a reasonable jury could find\n\na    sufficient     degree   of   probative      similarity    exists   between\n\nTimberpeg's architectural work and VTW's frame \"to give rise to an\n\ninference of actual copying\" for the same reasons a jury could find\n\nthere is substantial similarity.\n\nB.           Substantial Similarity\n\n             The substantial similarity inquiry \"entails proof that\n\nthe copying was so extensive that it rendered the works so similar\n\nthat   the   later    work   represented     a   wrongful     appropriation   of\n\nexpression.\"      Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18.        The inquiry focuses not on\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fevery aspect of the copyrighted work, but on those \"'aspects of the\n\nplaintiff's work [that] are protectible under copyright laws and\n\nwhether whatever copying took place appropriated those [protected]\n\nelements.'\"     Id. at 19 (second alteration in original) (quoting\n\nMatthews v. Freedman, 157 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998)); see also\n\nFeist, 499 U.S. at 361 (noting that wrongful copying requires\n\nshowing of \"copying of constituent elements of the work that are\n\noriginal\" (emphasis added)).         Summary judgment on substantial\n\nsimilarity is \"unusual\" but can be warranted on the right set of\n\nfacts.   See Segrets, 207 F.3d at 62.              \"Summary judgment on\n\n[substantial    similarity]   is   appropriate    only   when   a   rational\n\nfactfinder, correctly applying the pertinent legal standards, would\n\nbe compelled to conclude that no substantial similarity exists\n\nbetween the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work.\"\n\nJohnson, 409 F.3d at 18.\n\n          The     copyrighted      work   at     issue   is     Timberpeg's\n\narchitectural work as embodied in the second preliminary plans. As\n\nfor the allegedly infringing works, there are both VTW's shop\n\ndrawings and the frame as actually erected by VTW.              The parties\n\nhave assumed that the frame as erected matches VTW's shop drawings.\n\nVTW's shop drawings also reflect certain other features that VTW\n\ndid not actually build -- the exterior walls and the actual\n\nstaircase (although VTW did build the posts that define the stair\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fbay).      We    include   these   features   as   part   of   the   allegedly\n\ninfringing work when conducting the similarity analysis.\n\n            Substantial similarity can be measured by the \"ordinary\n\nobserver\" test.      Id.   Under that test, two works will be said to be\n\nsubstantially similar if a reasonable, ordinary observer, upon\n\nexamination of the two works, would \"conclude that the defendant\n\nunlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectable expression.\"\n\nId.     The two works need not be exact copies to be substantially\n\nsimilar.    Differences between the works have some effect on the\n\ninquiry, but the mere existence of differences is insufficient to\n\nend the matter in the defendant's favor.            Id.; see also Concrete\n\nMach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 608 (1st\n\nCir. 1988) (\"Slight or trivial variations between works will not\n\npreclude a finding of infringement under the ordinary observer\n\ntest.\").        \"If the points of dissimilarity not only exceed the\n\npoints of similarity, but indicate that the remaining points of\n\nsimilarity are, within the context of plaintiff's work, of minimal\n\nimportance,       either   quantitatively     or   qualitatively,    then   no\n\ninfringement results.\" 4 Nimmer & Nimmer, supra, § 13.03[B][1][a].\n\n            The record shows the following similarities between VTW's\n\nshop drawings and Timberpeg's registered plans:\n\n1.      VTW's shop drawings and the frame as constructed had a\n\nbackwards-L-shaped footprint with exactly the same dimensions as\n\nthe timberframed portion of the main house in Timberpeg's plans.\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f2.   VTW's shop drawings and the constructed frame had a kitchen\n\n\"bump-out\" along the western wall, although the VTW bump-out was\n\nabout two feet wider than the one in Timberpeg's plans.\n\n3.   VTW's shop drawings showed a central switchback staircase in\n\nprecisely the same location as the staircase in Timberpeg's plans,\n\nand the constructed frame included the posts used to define the\n\nstair bay.\n\n4.   VTW's frame showed a lofted second floor in the same location\n\nand with the same dimensions as in Timberpeg's plans.\n\n5.    VTW's frame had the same roof pitch and dimensions as in\n\nTimberpeg's plans.\n\n6.   The plate (wall) height was the same in both Timberpeg's plans\n\nand VTW's shop drawings.\n\n7.   VTW's shop drawings appeared to contemplate a further wing\n\nattached to the eastern wall of the timberframe; the shop drawings\n\nshowed the location of exterior wall panels (which VTW would not\n\nerect but were nonetheless reflected in the drawings), and there\n\nwere no such panels along the eastern side.          The Timberpeg plans\n\nshowed a separate stick-built wing attached to the eastern side of\n\nthe timberframed portion of the home.\n\n           VTW   and   the   district   court   pointed   to   a   number   of\n\ndifferences shown in the record between VTW's shop drawings and\n\nTimberpeg's registered plans:\n\n\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\f1.       VTW asserts that its frame was able to support any number of\n\ndesigns, depending on how the panels and walls were applied to the\n\nframe, while the Timberpeg design showed a particular internal\n\nfloor plan and external features.            Timberpeg acknowledges that the\n\nframe was not determinative, but points out that VTW's frame could\n\naccommodate Timberpeg's whole house design (if one chose to do so).\n\n2.       Timberpeg's     registered    plans    did    not   show    a    complete\n\ntimberframe       design,    while   VTW's    shop   drawings    showed    only   a\n\ntimberframe, and VTW only erected a timberframe.\n\n3.   The frame components that were shown in Timberpeg's second,\n\nregistered preliminary plans reflected a certain framing style with\n\ncommon rafters and principal purlins,6 while VTW's shop drawings\n\nand frame were in a bent style.\n\n4.   While Timberpeg's plans and VTW's frame both had 27 posts,\n\nthere are differences.           There were two posts in the VTW shop\n\ndrawings without any corresponding equivalents in the Timberpeg\n\ndesign.      Of    the   twenty-five    equivalent     posts,    only    two   were\n\nidentical in size, orientation, notching, and location.\n\n             VTW    argues    that   these    differences       \"preclude[]    the\n\nexistence of a material dispute on whether there was 'substantial\n\nsimilarity.'\"       Timberpeg argues that all of these differences are\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       The Timberpeg construction plans showed a bent frame but\nwere not registered with the Copyright Office.\n\n                                       -31-\n\fminimal, and are insufficient to overcome the similarities such\n\nthat summary judgment for VTW is warranted.\n\n          Keeping in mind the definition of an \"architectural work\"\n\nas \"includ[ing] the overall form as well as the arrangement and\n\ncomposition of spaces and elements in the design,\" 17 U.S.C. § 101,\n\nwe conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to\n\nsubstantial similarity.\n\n          The district court erred in failing to consider those\n\nsimilarities that went to the \"overall form\" of the building as\n\nwell as the \"arrangement and composition of spaces and elements.\"7\n\nThe district court found that the only similarities were in \"the\n\nidea of a twenty-eight by forty-four foot part of a house, with a\n\nstair bay located in a particular position\"8 and so found that no\n\n\n     7\n       \"The extent to which the [copyrighted work] contain[s]\nprotected expression is a matter of law, determined by the court.\nOnce this determination is made, the question of whether two works\nare substantially similar (and corresponding application of the\nordinary observer test) is a matter for the trier of fact unless\nsummary judgment is proper.\" Yankee Candle Co., 259 F.3d at 34\nn.5.\n     8\n        The district court referred to the \"idea/expression\"\ndichotomy in copyright law.     \"It is axiomatic that, while 'no\nauthor may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates,' an author\nmay copyright the expression of those ideas.\" John G. Danielson,\nInc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc., 322 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir.\n2003) (quoting Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471\nU.S. 539, 556 (1985)). Drawing the line between an idea and the\nexpression of that idea can be difficult. As Judge Learned Hand\nrecognized, \"Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an\nimitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its\n'expression.'   Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.\"\nPeter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489\n(2d Cir. 1960).      Regardless of whether a house of certain\n\n                               -32-\n\freasonable jury could conclude that VTW's shop drawings were\n\nsubstantially similar to Timberpeg's registered plans.\n\n           In fact, the relevant similarities here go beyond those\n\nrecognized by the district court.          At issue here is a particular\n\ncombination    of   elements   in   Timberpeg's   architectural   work:   a\n\nportion of a home featuring a timberframe with a backwards-L-shaped\n\nfootprint, with a particular arrangement of posts, with certain\n\ndimensions and a bump-out along the western wall, featuring a\n\ncentral switchback staircase, with a lofted second floor of a\n\ncertain floor area and in a certain location, with a certain roof\n\npitch   with   certain   dimensions,   and   certain   wall   heights.    A\n\nreasonable jury, properly considering this combination of elements,\n\ncould conclude that VTW's frame was substantially similar to\n\nTimberpeg's registered plans.\n\n           The district court also concluded that the differences\n\nbetween VTW's frame and Timberpeg's registered plans were such that\n\nno reasonable jury could conclude there was substantial similarity.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n           The district court and VTW emphasized that VTW designed\n\nonly a frame, while Timberpeg's plans did not contain a complete\n\nframe design. This emphasis wrongly assumes that the only question\n\nhere is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's frame\n\n\ndimensions with a central staircase might be regarded as an idea,\nthe combination of elements at issue here go beyond an idea into\nthe realm of expression.\n\n                                    -33-\n\fis substantially similar to Timberpeg's frame design, and that\n\nsince Timberpeg never designed a complete frame, there can be no\n\ninfringement.     That is wrong.         The question here is whether a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that VTW's frame as drawn and built\n\nis substantially similar to Timberpeg's architectural work (which\n\nincludes   \"the   overall    form   as    well    as   the   arrangement   and\n\ncomposition of spaces and elements in the design\") as embodied in\n\nthe second preliminary plans for the Isbitski house. This does not\n\nnecessarily turn on whether Timberpeg created a complete frame\n\ndesign or not.9\n\n           As to VTW's claim that it is a dispositive difference\n\nthat the VTW frame could accommodate any number of internal layouts\n\nand   external    features    other      than    those   reflected   in    the\n\n\n\n      9\n       VTW might be understood to be making a slightly different\nargument as well: that under 17 U.S.C. § 101, an architectural work\nis the \"design of a building\" and that because the VTW frame is not\na \"building\" and Isbitski never completed the \"building,\" then\nVTW's frame is not an \"architectural work\" and cannot be\nsubstantially similar to Timberpeg's architectural work.        The\npredicates of this argument are shaky, but the more fundamental\nproblem is that the statute does not require that the infringing\nwork meet the definition of an architectural work.    For instance,\nthe AWCPA excludes from the scope of exclusive rights in\narchitectural works \"the right to prevent the making, distributing,\nor public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other\npictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the\nwork is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public\nplace.\" Pub. L. No. 101-650, § 704, 104 Stat. at 5133 (codified at\n17 U.S.C. § 120); see generally Leicester v. Warner Bros., 232 F.3d\n1212 (9th Cir. 2000) (discussing this exception). Such a specific\ncarve-out for works that are not architectural works weighs\nstrongly against any argument that only architectural works can be\ninfringing.\n\n                                    -34-\n\farchitectural plans created by Timberpeg, this too stems from a\n\nmisunderstanding of Timberpeg's claim. Copyright protection exists\n\nnot only in the architectural work taken as a whole (which includes\n\na particular floor plan and arrangement of external features), but\n\nalso in protectable portions of the work.                Timberpeg bases its\n\nclaims here on a combination of elements, which, taken together,\n\nare protectable under the definition of an architectural work in 17\n\nU.S.C. § 101.       As the legislative history for the AWCPA states,\n\n\"[t]he phrase 'arrangement and composition of spaces and elements'\n\nrecognizes that . . . creativity in architecture frequently takes\n\nthe   form    of    a    selection,     coordination,    or   arrangement    of\n\nunprotectible elements into an original, protectible whole.\"                H.R.\n\nRep. No. 101-735, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6949.               A jury\n\ncould reasonably conclude that VTW's frame is substantially similar\n\nto these protectable elements of Timberpeg's architectural work.\n\nThe   fact   that       VTW's   frame   might   not   necessarily   result   in\n\nother elements being taken from Timberpeg's architectural work is\n\nnot dispositive.\n\n             VTW also considers the differences in the posts between\n\nTimberpeg's plan and VTW's frame to be dispositive.                 This is an\n\nargument that can be addressed to the jury, but is not itself\n\ndispositive on summary judgment. Timberpeg argues that differences\n\nin almost all of the posts are measured on the scale of inches\n\nrather than feet.         VTW has not argued that Timberpeg is wrong on\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\fthis point, and has not demonstrated that no reasonable jury would\n\nfind the differences insignificant.         VTW makes general statements\n\nthat certain posts have a different size, orientation, or notching,\n\nbut   the   actual   measure   of   the    differences   is   important   to\n\nevaluating substantial similarity; a difference of a few feet\n\nobviously weighs more strongly against substantial similarity than\n\na difference of a few inches.       Both the magnitude and significance\n\nof any differences present disputed issues of material fact that\n\ncannot be resolved on summary judgment.\n\n            VTW also relies on the difference in the size of the\n\nkitchen bump-out and the fact that Timberpeg's second preliminary\n\nplan contemplated a common rafter style, whereas the VTW frame\n\nfeatured a bent style.         While these differences may also weigh\n\nagainst a finding of substantial similarity by the fact finder,\n\nthis is evidence for the jury to weigh.\n\n            This analysis alone requires reversal.        We also comment\n\non one other point to give guidance to the district court and to\n\nclarify an earlier decision of ours.\n\n            Timberpeg and VTW both introduced reports prepared by\n\nexpert witnesses.     The district court rejected any reference to\n\nexpert affidavits in the context of substantial similarity, citing\n\nour Segrets case.10    We have not, however, uniformly rejected the\n\n\n      10\n       In Segrets, we noted in a footnote in dicta the rule that\n\"[w]hile expert testimony may be used to establish that there was\ncopying . . ., where factual copying has been established, as here,\n\n                                    -36-\n\fuse of expert testimony on substantial similarity.         See Johnson,\n\n409 F.3d at 20 (noting that the plaintiff's \"burden of establishing\n\nboth probative similarity . . . and substantial similarity . . .\n\n[are] dependent on three purported similarities (points one, two,\n\nand seven in Mr. John's [expert] report)\").11      Moreover, the need\n\nfor expert testimony may be greater in cases involving complex\n\nsubject matters where an ordinary observer may find it difficult to\n\nproperly evaluate the similarity of two works without the aid of\n\nexpert testimony. As Nimmer notes, \"[a] special challenge is posed\n\nin adjusting the traditional categories of substantial similarity\n\nto the burgeoning areas of technology protected by copyright.\"          4\n\nNimmer & Nimmer, supra, § 13.03[E][4].\n\n          We leave to the district court the determination of\n\nwhether this may be a case in which expert testimony would be\n\nhelpful on the issue of substantial similarity.     We also note that\n\nthe district court did not determine whether the expert reports\n\notherwise met applicable standards for admissibility, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702, 703, and we do not address this issue.      If admissible,\n\nthe conflicting reports indicate material issues of fact as to\n\nsubstantial   similarity.   Timberpeg's   expert    (who   was   also   a\n\n\nthere should be no expert testimony to establish whether or not\nthere was substantial similarity.\" 207 F.3d at 66 n.11. In this\ncase, factual copying has not been established, and expert\ntestimony is at least admissible for that purpose.\n     11\n        Johnson was decided after the district court issued its\ndecisions in this case.\n\n                               -37-\n\fTimberpeg employee) stated that \"the outline and design of the\n\nIsbitski house in the [VTW] drawings matches almost exactly the\n\narchitectural design represented in Timberpeg's plans\" and that\n\n\"the overall dimensions are the same, the stair is the same design\n\nin the same location, and the area shown as a loft is the same size\n\nin the same location.\"    VTW's expert report, by contrast, noted a\n\nnumber of differences, including the fact that the VTW frame was a\n\nbent frame rather than a frame using common rafters with purlins as\n\nin Timberpeg's plans.    It also noted that the VTW posts were placed\n\non basement \"footings\" that were already in place when the frame\n\nwas constructed.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          The issue of whether VTW's shop drawings and constructed\n\nframe were substantially similar to Timberpeg's architectural work\n\nas embodied in the second preliminary plans for the Isbitski home\n\nis one for a jury to decide after trial.          At present there are\n\ngenuine issues of material fact both as to copying and as to\n\nsubstantial similarity, making the question one that cannot be\n\nresolved on summary judgment.\n\n          We   reverse   the   entry    of   summary   judgment   against\n\nTimberpeg, vacate the attorneys' fee award, and remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.       Costs are awarded to T-\n\nPeg, Inc. and Timberpeg East, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\f",

(collectively, \"Timberpeg\"), sell both architectural designs and the associated packages of material for the construction of timberframed homes. Timberpeg created architectural plans for a home for Stanley Isbitski in Salisbury, New Hampshire. The central feature of those plans was the timberframed main house, although the plans did not show a completed final architectural design for the actual timberframe. The plaintiffs registered their second set of preliminary plans as an architectural work with the Copyright Office, and maintained ownership over the copyright in the work embodied in the plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski, however, never purchased a construction materials package and final plans from Timberpeg. He did file the registered plans with the Town of Salisbury in order to get a building permit. Isbitski hired defendant, Vermont Timber Works, Inc. (\"VTW\"), to erect a timberframe for his home. VTW erected its timberframe, but Isbitski never completed his home. A later owner bought the property and completed the home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg filed suit against both Isbitski and VTW, claiming, inter alia, that the timberframe designed through shop drawings and constructed by VTW for Isbitski infringed Timberpeg's copyright in the architectural work. This appeal concerns only the copyright infringement claim against VTW. Isbitski could not be found and was never served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment to VTW, finding that no reasonable jury could conclude that VTW copied Timberpeg's architectural work, or that VTW's frame was \"substantially similar\" to Timberpeg's registered plans. The district court also awarded attorneys' fees to VTW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the judgment of the district court, finding that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to Timberpeg's copyright infringement claim under the AWCPA.

NSTAR Elec. &amp; Gas Corp.,</i> 449 F.3d 206, 208 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanley Isbitski owned a plot of land in Salisbury, New Hampshire, on which he wanted to build a home featuring a \"timberframe.\" A timberframe is a house frame using wooden posts and beams which remain visible inside the building. The more common \"stick built\" home, by contrast, is framed using two-inch lumber rather than posts and beams. Isbitski dealt both with Timberpeg and with VTW, two companies that are, broadly speaking, in the timberframe business, but have different sorts of operations. Douglas Friant is one of the founders and co-owners of VTW, and is responsible for the drafting of timberframe shop drawings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for VTW. Isbitski's dealings with Timberpeg and VTW, and his own work on his house (he was acting as his own general contractor for the construction of the home), ran somewhat in parallel. We describe his dealings with each company separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Isbitski's Dealings with Timberpeg</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg markets and sells designs and its own brand of \"packages\" for the construction of timberframe homes. A Timberpeg package consists of the materials used for the construction of a home's timberframe and exterior building envelope (including windows, exterior doors, insulation, siding, exterior trim, and cedar roof shakes). Timberpeg does not erect the packages it sells; instead, a customer must hire a builder or contractor to assemble and erect the package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg provides architectural design services for customers, and has a staff of architects and designers who can create all the necessary designs and architectural plans to build a home. Timberpeg's business model is not based on selling design services or architectural plans. Rather, Timberpeg makes its money on the sale of its packages of construction material based on its architectural plans. Timberpeg provides architectural design services as a way to facilitate the sale of its packages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1999 or perhaps earlier, Isbitski approached Timberpeg to consider the purchase of a Timberpeg package. Isbitski, working with a Timberpeg employee, filled out a \"design information sheet\" about what he wanted the house to look like. The actual design information sheet is not in the record. On November 15, 1999, Isbitski and Timberpeg entered into a \"Deposit Agreement for TIMBERPEG Preliminary Plans and Drawings.\" Under this deposit agreement, Isbitski paid a $2500 deposit to Timberpeg, in exchange for which Timberpeg would and did create preliminary architectural plans and construction plans for the house. The preliminary architectural plans would consist of a basement plan, floor plans, four elevations (external, vertical views of the house from different angles showing exterior features such as window and door locations, roof pitches, and ceiling heights), and a building cross section. After Isbitski's approval of the preliminary plans, Isbitski would receive construction plans, including foundation plans and details of Timberpeg's standard construction techniques. According to the contract, the construction plans could \"be used for planning the construction process, ordering materials, obtaining contractor bids, and securing a building permit.\" Final plans, which included the complete frame drawings, would not be prepared as part of the deposit agreement, but would be prepared as part of the final contract for the purchase of a Timberpeg package. Timberpeg, in all, provided Isbitski with two versions of the preliminary plans and then construction plans. No final plans were ever provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the contract, Isbitski represented to Timberpeg that \"any house plans, specifications, drawings or sketches of any kind (the `Drawings') provided to [Timberpeg were] the result of an original design (the `Design'),\" represented that he (Isbitski) was the \"sole owner of the Design and has exclusive rights, including copyright, in and to the Design as represented in the Drawings,\" and agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Timberpeg from use of the drawings and design. Timberpeg would own the copyright in the \"Preliminary Plans, Construction Plans, specifications, drawings, and other material (the `Plans').\" Isbitski could use the plans \"solely in connection with the evaluation and construction of one (1) Package purchased from [Timberpeg],\" and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ny other use of the Plans, including, but not limited to, the following, is an unauthorized appropriation of copyright by Customer and a breach of this Agreement: a) the copying of all or any part of the Plans; b) the utilization or partial utilization of the Plans for the construction of a similar building or structure; or c) any transfer or delivery of the Plans to another person without written authorization from [Timberpeg].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski was under no obligation to purchase a Timberpeg package after seeing the preliminary plans or even the construction plans. If he chose to purchase a package, the $2500 deposit would be credited against the price of the package. If he chose not to purchase a package, Isbitski would have to return the plans, and Timberpeg would return the deposit minus a fee for design time, billed at $49 per hour, and other incidental costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg created a first set of preliminary plans on December 29, 1999 and gave them to Isbitski. These plans showed the design of a house with a timberframed main portion and a wing that would be stick built. The record does not contain this first set of plans, and these plans were never registered with the Copyright Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, Isbitski met again with Timberpeg, saying that he was unsatisfied with the first set of preliminary plans. Timberpeg completed a new design for Isbitski on April 20, 2001 \"based on [its] interpretation of Mr. Isbitski's rough ideas and preferences.\" The plans were given to Isbitski. Timberpeg registered these plans with the Copyright Office on May 18, 2001. The registration certificate shows that these second preliminary plans were registered as an \"architectural work.\" It is only this second, registered set of preliminary plans that is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these plans, Isbitski applied for a building permit from the Town of Salisbury. As part of the permitting process, in April 2001, Isbitski submitted the second preliminary plans to the Town of Salisbury, where they were placed in a public file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of preliminary plans contained elevations and floor plans. The plans showed a two-floor main house connected via a covered breezeway to a three-car garage with a lofted space above it. The first floor of the main house was nine feet tall; the second floor was eight feet tall. The main house consisted, broadly speaking, of two major portions. One portion &#8212; the portion which would be timberframed &#8212; was backwards-L-shaped. A great room (with two-floor ceilings on the northern end of the house), kitchen, breakfast room, and dining room were on the first floor, and a den was on the lofted second floor (which occupied only the southern portion of the house). The plans for this portion of the house did not contain a complete design of the timberframe, but the floor plans did show where the vertical posts would connect to the foundation and the location of at least some of the internal horizontal beams. The timberframing in this portion of the house used a particular style featuring common rafters with principal purlins (horizontal timbers supporting the rafters). The roof in this portion was oriented north-to-south,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with a particular pitch (roof angle) referred to as a \"twelve-by-twelve\" pitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exact dimensions of the timberframed portion of the main house were 44 feet by 28 feet, with a 14-foot-by-8-foot section cut out in the northwest corner to form the L shape, where a screen porch would be located. There was also a \"bump-out\" in the kitchen on the western side of the house &#8212; an approximately eight-foot portion of the western wall containing windows that jutted out one foot beyond the rest of the wall. The timberframed portion of the house also featured a central switchback staircase located in the center of the timberframed portion of the home. In addition to labels denoting the various rooms, the floor plan showed the location of various fixtures, including a kitchen sink (located at the \"bump-out\"), a stove, and a fireplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second major component of the main house &#8212; containing bedrooms, bathrooms, and the foyer &#8212; was connected to the eastern side of the timberframed portion, and was to be stick-built. The roof in this portion of the house was oriented east-to-west, and had a pitch of nine-by-twelve. There was a covered porch on the northern part of this portion, which connected to the covered breezeway and the three-car garage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2001, Isbitski asked Timberpeg to modify its preliminary plans so that they reflected a timberframe in a \"bent\" style rather than the style previously used (which is variously referred to in the record as a \"purlin\" style or a \"purlin with common rafters\" style). He gave Timberpeg a picture clipped from a magazine showing a bent frame (this was the same picture he later gave to VTW). No modifications were undertaken until the construction plans were drafted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, in August 2001, Isbitski asked Timberpeg for a set of foundation plans showing the location of various support posts and steel girders, so he could start pouring the concrete foundation. Timberpeg agreed, but asked Isbitski to send in $1500 to cover past due and future design fees. Timberpeg asserts that it continued to assume that Isbitski would eventually buy a package from Timberpeg. On September 20, 2001, Timberpeg sent its \"construction plans,\" reflecting a timberframe in a bent-frame style (although not containing a complete frame design), and the foundation plan. This third set of plans, which reflected the bent frame, was never registered with the Copyright Office. Sometime thereafter, Isbitski poured the foundation of the home and also began construction of the three-car garage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Dealings with VTW</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2000, a year after Isbitski had seen the first preliminary Timberpeg plans but before Isbitski had asked Timberpeg for a second set of preliminary plans, Isbitski approached VTW. VTW is located in Vermont, and specializes in timberframing. It has no architects on staff, and does not design buildings or create architectural plans. Instead, it uses specifications provided by the customer to create shop drawings of the frame of the building. These specifications typically are in the form of architectural plans, but VTW also can draw frames based on rough sketches, as long as VTW receives information about the building's footprint (the outline of the building as it sits on the ground) and wall height. VTW also has an in-house frame assembly crew that actually erects the frame on site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to VTW, Isbitski stated that he had developed a layout for a house plan with his then-deceased wife. Isbitski stated that his plan was to have VTW draw and construct only the timberframe for the timberframed main portion of the home. Isbitski was going to act as the general contractor for the remainder of the home, subcontracting work to other people or companies as needed. Starting at the end of 2000, VTW began drawing a timberframe for Isbitski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that in his first meeting with VTW in December 2000, Isbitski provided VTW with a copy of the first, unregistered set of preliminary plans created by Timberpeg. VTW asserts that its personnel only saw this first set of preliminary plans, not the second, registered plans, on which the claim here is brought. VTW also claims that those first preliminary plans did not even factor into its creation of its timberframe for Isbitski's home because Isbitski said he was unhappy with the plans, and that VTW, in fact, asked Isbitski to consult an architect to develop floor plans and elevations for the home. This, VTW says, would not have been necessary had VTW been relying even on Timberpeg's first, unregistered plans. Timberpeg counters that VTW could have obtained the second, registered preliminary plans, either through Isbitski himself or through the Town of Salisbury. Timberpeg points to a letter written by VTW's attorney after litigation had commenced, which stated that Isbitski asked VTW \"to design a frame to fit a portion of the floor plans of his house\" and that Isbitski had \"represented to [VTW] that he paid for and owned a set of plans, which he provided to [VTW] that were drawn by Timberpeg.\" The letter does not say whether the plans referred to were the first set or the second set of plans created by Timberpeg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW's position is that it took its directions only from Isbitski and that Isbitski provided substantial guidance in determining VTW's shop drawings of the timberframe. According to Douglas Friant at VTW, Isbitski said that he had been \"planning this house for years and [was] working on the design for years.\" At the first meeting in December 2000, Isbitski provided the dimensions of his plan (although the record does not reveal the exact dimensions that he gave to VTW). He also brought pictures clipped from a magazine and a catalog (not from Timberpeg) showing how he wanted the frame to look. The pictures showed a bent-style frame. Friant stated that during the drafting process (starting from December 2000 until May 2002) Isbitski frequently would drop by or call VTW's shop unexpectedly, and would talk with Friant about his ideas about what he wanted for the timberframe. As an example, Friant testified at his deposition that Isbitski was \"very concerned about how the stairway looked\" and \"absolutely emphatic about . . . making sure that he was able to hang a chandelier in the stairway area,\" and this instruction required Friant to modify the shop drawings. According to VTW, some of Isbitski's instructions were very specific. Isbitski would tell VTW where to place posts within an eighth of an inch, and asked VTW to change the roof pitch in VTW's original designs to a precise pitch he provided. During the time VTW was working on its shop drawings, Isbitski received the second preliminary plans and the construction plans from Timberpeg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski agreed to purchase the VTW timberframe on March 8, 2002. By this time, Timberpeg's second preliminary plans, the registered plans, had been in his hands for nearly one year, and publicly available for about the same amount of time. Isbitski also had had possession of the construction drawings from Timberpeg for nearly six months. VTW completed final revisions to its shop drawings of the timberframe design in May 2002. The shop drawings showed a bent-style frame which was in some ways similar to, and in other ways different from, the timberframed portion of the main house in Timberpeg's registered preliminary plan. We consider these similarities and differences in detail below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By June 2002, Isbitski had completed the foundation and the three-car garage with the loft. VTW erected, on that foundation, the frame as provided for in the shop drawings. The parties assume that the erected frame reflected the shop drawings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2002, Isbitski informed Timberpeg that he was not going to be purchasing a Timberpeg package. According to Timberpeg, Isbitski said the reason was that he was going to build a stick-built, rather than a timberframed, house. Timberpeg in response asked for the remainder of the design fees due (which fees had, by that point, exceeded Isbitski's total deposit), amounting to approximately $1000. It is unclear whether Isbitski ever paid this amount. Soon thereafter, Timberpeg learned that Isbitski was building a house, using VTW's timberframe, that looked like the house it had designed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Aftermath</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski never completed the home, apparently because he ran into financial difficulty. Isbitski had begun enclosing the timberframe built by VTW with exterior wall panels, but never completed that task, and the frame was left open to the elements. Timberpeg sold a license to its registered design to Sugar River Savings Bank in October 2003 in order to assist with the completion of construction of the home. Under the terms of the license, the bank was free to re-sell to any party other than Isbitski or VTW. Sometime in 2004, a representative from Timberpeg visited the Isbitski site. The property had been purchased by a Mr. Dupee, who had largely completed construction of the house in a manner which, according to Timberpeg, was similar to the design as reflected in the second set of preliminary plans created for Isbitski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg filed suit against VTW and Isbitski in the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire on October 23, 2003. Timberpeg asserted, inter alia, copyright infringement claims against VTW under 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 501 <i>et seq.</i> Timberpeg's claim against VTW was that the timberframe designed in shop drawings and built by VTW was \"substantially similar to the architectural work embodied in the\" second preliminary plans, which it had registered as an architectural work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 2005, the district court granted summary judgment to VTW on all counts. As to the copyright infringement claim, the district court first held, incorrectly relying on pre-AWCPA law, that VTW's constructed frame could not be a copy of an architectural plan under copyright law. The district court, considering only whether VTW's shop drawings were an infringing copy of Timberpeg's architectural work, as embodied in the second preliminary plans, held as a matter of law that VTW had not actually copied Timberpeg's plans, and even assuming copying, that VTW's shop drawings were not substantially similar to Timberpeg's architectural plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg moved for reconsideration, pointing out that its claim was based on the AWCPA. It argued that the district court's holding that a building could not be a copy of an architectural plan under copyright law was contrary to the AWCPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It also argued that there was at least a genuine issue of material fact as to unlawful copying. Timberpeg relied, in part, on the letter from VTW's counsel, which it argued contained an admission that the defendants had copied Timberpeg's plans. Timberpeg emphasized that its \"central theory . . . is that the timberframe, in the shop drawings and as constructed by the defendants[,] is an infringing copy of the architectural work reflected in Timberpeg's copyright[ed] architectural plans, as opposed to an infringing copy of the plans themselves\" and that the claim squarely fell under the AWCPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reconsidered, and on April 6, 2005, held that no reasonable jury could conclude that the timberframe as constructed according to VTW's shop drawings was substantially similar to the architectural work as embodied in Timberpeg's registered plans. In doing so, it rejected Timberpeg's reliance on the letters from VTW's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW moved for attorneys' fees under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 505. The district court granted VTW's motion for attorneys' fees and awarded $116,642.43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to the specific arguments on appeal, we discuss the governing framework of copyright law and the AWCPA. The AWCPA extended copyright protection to a class of works called \"architectural works,\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a)(8), which are defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the design of a building as embodied in any tangible medium of expression, including a building, architectural plans, or drawings. The work includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design, but does not include individual standard features.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">17 U.S.C. &#167; 101. Timberpeg argues that this definition is broad, and that VTW's timberframe (as reflected in the shop drawings and as constructed) infringes Timberpeg's copyright in the architectural work as embodied in its second, registered preliminary plans and including a particular configuration of elements which together form the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first briefly lay out the requirements of a claim of copyright infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Copyright Infringement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Copyright Act, \"[c]opyright protection subsists . . . in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a).

The United States joined the Berne Convention with the passage of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (\"BCIA\"), Pub.L. No. 100-568, 102 Stat. 2853 (1988). While the BCIA amended the definition of \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\" to explicitly include \"architectural plans,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 4 (codified at 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101), it did not explicitly extend protection to \"architectural works,\" as distinct from architectural plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To ensure United States' compliance with the requirements of the Berne Convention, the AWCPA was signed into law on December 1, 1990.

The legislative history makes it clear that \"[p]rotection for architectural plans, drawings, and models as pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works under section 102(a)(5) . . . is unaffected by\" the AWCPA.

First, an \"architectural work\" is the \"design of a building as embodied in any tangible medium of expression.\" <i>Id.</i> The definition provides three exemplars of such a tangible medium of expression &#8212; \"a building, architectural plans, or drawings\" &#8212; although these are not the only possible media of expression. <i>Id.</i> As originally drafted, the bill only referred to architectural works as embodied in buildings. H.R.Rep. No. 101-735, <i>reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6950. According to the legislative history for the AWCPA, \"there was concern that a defendant with access to the plans or drawings could construct an identical building but escape liability so long as the plans or drawings were not copied.\" <i>Id.</i> To close this potential gap, the bill was reworded to expand the definition of an architectural work to encompass a building design \"as embodied in any tangible medium of expression.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This more expansive definition means that the holder of a copyright in an architectural plan (such as Timberpeg) has two forms of protection, one under the provision for an \"architectural work\" under 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a)(8), and another under the provision for a \"pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work\" under 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a)(5). The legislative history confirms this point. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 101-735, <i>reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6950 (\"An individual creating an architectural work by depicting that work in plans or drawing will have two separate copyrights, one in the architectural work (section 102(a)(8)), the other in the plans or drawings (section 102(a)(5)).\"). The two avenues of protection are slightly different in scope, as discussed below. As Timberpeg made clear in its motion for reconsideration before the district court, its \"central theory\" is based on the protection afforded architectural works under &#167; 102(a)(8) rather than the protection afforded architectural plans under &#167; 102(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second component of the definition is that an architectural work \"includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design.\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101.

The legislative history provides examples of such individual standard features: \"common windows, doors, and other staple building components.\" H.R.Rep. No. 101-735, <i>reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6949. Non-standard individual features reflecting some amount of originality are not necessarily excluded from copyright protection. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, while individual standard features may not be individually copyrightable, as the quoted legislative history above confirms, the combination of such standard features may be copyrightable. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Copyright Act, architectural works are, in at least one sense, \"subject to a standard of copyrightability more generous than that accorded pictorial, graphic or sculptural works.\" Ginsburg, <i>supra,</i> at 491.

The requirement that the protectable elements of a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work be separated from the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the work under 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a)(5) is known as the \"separability test.\" By contrast, there is no separability test for an architectural work. In the AWCPA, Congress purposefully did not impose such a separability test for determining the copyrightability of architectural works. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 101-735, <i>reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6951 (\"[T]he copyrightability of architectural works shall not be evaluated under the separability test applicable to pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Senior,</i> 449 F.3d at 216. \"Summary judgment is proper only if the record, read favorably to the non-moving party, reflects no genuine issues of material fact and the undisputed facts indicate that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Hadfield v.

The district court, at least in its first order, also concluded that no reasonable jury could conclude that VTW had actually copied Timberpeg's plans. Since copying is a necessary element of a copyright infringement claim, <i>see Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 17-18, we would uphold summary judgment if the district court were correct on this ground, and we may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <i>see Senior,</i> 449 F.3d at 216. We briefly discuss the evidence of copying and conclude that the district court was not correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Actual Copying</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Copying may be proven through direct or circumstantial evidence. <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18. Timberpeg points both to direct and to circumstantial evidence of copying, sufficient to create a material issue of fact for a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For direct evidence, Timberpeg points to the letter from VTW's attorneys stating that Isbitski \"represented to [VTW] that he paid for and owned a set of plans, which he provided to [VTW] that were drawn by Timberpeg.\" Timberpeg argues that this letter is an admission by VTW that it relied on the registered preliminary plans. VTW, like the district court, rejects Timberpeg's reliance on the letters, arguing that the letters were not admissions, but to the contrary, state that VTW did not copy Timberpeg's plans. The letter from VTW's attorney does not say whether the plans referenced are the second, registered preliminary plans (about which there is a dispute as to whether VTW saw the plans) or the first, unregistered preliminary plans (which VTW acknowledges it received, but states it did not rely on). This is a factual dispute about the meaning of the admission by counsel, and that issue cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of direct evidence of copying &#8212; such direct evidence is rare, <i>see Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18 &#8212; one of the ways to indirectly establish that the defendant copied the plaintiff's work is to provide evidence that (1) the defendant \"enjoyed access to the copyrighted work,\" and so had the opportunity to copy the work, and (2) \"a sufficient degree of similarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work to give rise to an inference of actual copying.\" <i>Id.</i> The similarity inquiry used to indirectly establish copying is referred to as \"<i>probative</i> similarity\" and is \"somewhat akin to, but different than, the requirement of substantial similarity\" that must be shown to prove copyright infringement. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to access, Timberpeg argues that VTW had access to its registered preliminary plans both because Isbitski had made those plans public by filing them with the Town of Salisbury, and because VTW could have received the plans directly from Isbitski. A trier of fact may impute access when there is \"evidence that a third party with whom both the plaintiff and defendant were dealing had possession of plaintiff's work,\" and the \"plaintiff's and defendant's dealings took place concurrently.\" 4 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 13.02[A]. That is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to \"probative similarity\" &#8212; whether \"a sufficient degree of similarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work to give rise to an inference of actual copying\" &#8212; this analysis merges somewhat with the question of \"substantial similarity\" (although they are separate questions). We discuss below the similarities and dissimilarities between Timberpeg's registered plans and VTW's frame in the context of the substantial similarity inquiry. We conclude that a reasonable jury could find a sufficient degree of probative similarity exists between Timberpeg's architectural work and VTW's frame \"to give rise to an inference of actual copying\" for the same reasons a jury could find there is substantial similarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Substantial Similarity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial similarity inquiry \"entails proof that the copying was so extensive that it rendered the works so similar that the later work represented a wrongful appropriation of expression.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18. The inquiry focuses not on every aspect of the copyrighted work, but on those \"`aspects of the plaintiff's work [that] are protectible under copyright laws and whether whatever copying took place appropriated those [protected] elements.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 19 (second alteration in original) (quoting <i>Matthews v.

Summary judgment on substantial similarity is \"unusual\" but can be warranted on the right set of facts. <i>See Segrets,</i> 207 F.3d at 62. \"Summary judgment on [substantial similarity] is appropriate only when a rational factfinder, correctly applying the pertinent legal standards, would be compelled to conclude that no substantial similarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The copyrighted work at issue is Timberpeg's architectural work as embodied in the second preliminary plans. As for the allegedly infringing works, there are both VTW's shop drawings and the frame as actually erected by VTW. The parties have assumed that the frame as erected matches VTW's shop drawings. VTW's shop drawings also reflect certain other features that VTW did not actually build &#8212; the exterior walls and the actual staircase (although VTW did build the posts that define the stair bay). We include these features as part of the allegedly infringing work when conducting the similarity analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial similarity can be measured by the \"ordinary observer\" test. <i>Id.</i> Under that test, two works will be said to be substantially similar if a reasonable, ordinary observer, upon examination of the two works, would \"conclude that the defendant unlawfully appropriated the plaintiff's protectable expression.\" <i>Id.</i> The two works need not be exact copies to be substantially similar. Differences between the works have some effect on the inquiry, but the mere existence of differences is insufficient to end the matter in the defendant's favor. <i>Id.; see also Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc.,</i> 843 F.2d 600, 608 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Slight or trivial variations between works will not preclude a finding of infringement under the ordinary observer test.\"). \"If the points of dissimilarity not only exceed the points of similarity, but indicate that the remaining points of similarity are, within the context of plaintiff's work, of minimal importance, either quantitatively or qualitatively, then no infringement results.\" 4 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 13.03[B][1][a].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows the following similarities between VTW's shop drawings and Timberpeg's registered plans:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

VTW's shop drawings appeared to contemplate a further wing attached to the eastern wall of the timberframe; the shop drawings showed the location of exterior wall panels (which VTW would not erect but were nonetheless reflected in the drawings), and there were no such panels along the eastern side. The Timberpeg plans showed a separate stick-built wing attached to the eastern side of the timberframed portion of the home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW and the district court pointed to a number of differences shown in the record between VTW's shop drawings and Timberpeg's registered plans:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. VTW asserts that its frame was able to support any number of designs, depending on how the panels and walls were applied to the frame, while the Timberpeg design showed a particular internal floor plan and external features. Timberpeg acknowledges that the frame was not determinative, but points out that VTW's frame could accommodate Timberpeg's whole house design (if one chose to do so).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Timberpeg's registered plans did not show a complete timberframe design, while VTW's shop drawings showed only a timberframe, and VTW only erected a timberframe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The frame components that were shown in Timberpeg's second, registered preliminary plans reflected a certain framing style with common rafters and principal purlins,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> while VTW's shop drawings and frame were in a bent style.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. While Timberpeg's plans and VTW's frame both had 27 posts, there are differences. There were two posts in the VTW shop drawings without any corresponding equivalents in the Timberpeg design. Of the twenty-five equivalent posts, only two were identical in size, orientation, notching, and location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW argues that these differences \"preclude[] the existence of a material dispute on whether there was `substantial similarity.'\" Timberpeg argues that all of these differences are minimal, and are insufficient to overcome the similarities such that summary judgment for VTW is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeping in mind the definition of an \"architectural work\" as \"includ[ing] the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design,\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to substantial similarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred in failing to consider those similarities that went to the \"overall form\" of the building as well as the \"arrangement and composition of spaces and elements.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court found that the only similarities were in \"the idea of a twenty-eight by forty-four foot part of a house, with a stair bay located in a particular position\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and so found that no reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's shop drawings were substantially similar to Timberpeg's registered plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the relevant similarities here go beyond those recognized by the district court. At issue here is a particular combination of elements in Timberpeg's architectural work: a portion of a home featuring a timberframe with a backwards-L-shaped footprint, with a particular arrangement of posts, with certain dimensions and a bump-out along the western wall, featuring a central switchback staircase, with a lofted second floor of a certain floor area and in a certain location, with a certain roof pitch with certain dimensions, and certain wall heights. A reasonable jury, properly considering this combination of elements, could conclude that VTW's frame was substantially similar to Timberpeg's registered plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also concluded that the differences between VTW's frame and Timberpeg's registered plans were such that no reasonable jury could conclude there was substantial similarity. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court and VTW emphasized that VTW designed only a frame, while Timberpeg's plans did not contain a complete frame design. This emphasis wrongly assumes that the only question here is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's frame is substantially similar to Timberpeg's <i>frame design,</i> and that since Timberpeg never designed a complete frame, there can be no infringement. That is wrong. The question here is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's frame as drawn and built is substantially similar to Timberpeg's <i>architectural work</i> (which includes \"the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design\") as embodied in the second preliminary plans for the Isbitski house. This does not necessarily turn on whether Timberpeg created a complete frame design or not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to VTW's claim that it is a dispositive difference that the VTW frame could accommodate any number of internal layouts and external features other than those reflected in the architectural plans created by Timberpeg, this too stems from a misunderstanding of Timberpeg's claim. Copyright protection exists not only in the architectural work taken as a whole (which includes a particular floor plan and arrangement of external features), but also in protectable portions of the work. Timberpeg bases its claims here on a combination of elements, which, taken together, are protectable under the definition of an architectural work in 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101. As the legislative history for the AWCPA states, \"[t]he phrase `arrangement and composition of spaces and elements' recognizes that . . . creativity in architecture frequently takes the form of a selection, coordination, or arrangement of unprotectible elements into an original, protectible whole.\" H.R.Rep. No. 101-735, <i>reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6949. A jury could reasonably conclude that VTW's frame is substantially similar to these protectable elements of Timberpeg's architectural work. The fact that VTW's frame might not necessarily result in <i>other</i> elements being taken from Timberpeg's architectural work is not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW also considers the differences in the posts between Timberpeg's plan and VTW's frame to be dispositive. This is an argument that can be addressed to the jury, but is not itself dispositive on summary judgment. Timberpeg argues that differences in almost all of the posts are measured on the scale of inches rather than feet. VTW has not argued that Timberpeg is wrong on this point, and has not demonstrated that no reasonable jury would find the differences insignificant. VTW makes general statements that certain posts have a different size, orientation, or notching, but the actual measure of the differences is important to evaluating substantial similarity; a difference of a few feet obviously weighs more strongly against substantial similarity than a difference of a few inches. Both the magnitude and significance of any differences present disputed issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW also relies on the difference in the size of the kitchen bump-out and the fact that Timberpeg's second preliminary plan contemplated a common rafter style, whereas the VTW frame featured a bent style. While these differences may also weigh against a finding of substantial similarity by the fact finder, this is evidence for the jury to weigh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis alone requires reversal.

The district court rejected any reference to expert affidavits in the context of substantial similarity, citing our <i>Segrets</i> case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We have not, however, uniformly rejected the use of expert testimony on substantial similarity. <i>See Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 20 (noting that the plaintiff's \"burden of establishing both probative similarity . . . and substantial similarity . . . [are] dependent on three purported similarities (points one, two, and seven in Mr. John's [expert] report)\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Moreover, the need for expert testimony may be greater in cases involving complex subject matters where an ordinary observer may find it difficult to properly evaluate the similarity of two works without the aid of expert testimony. As Nimmer notes, \"[a] special challenge is posed in adjusting the traditional categories of substantial similarity to the burgeoning areas of technology protected by copyright.\" 4 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 13.03[E][4].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We leave to the district court the determination of whether this may be a case in which expert testimony would be helpful on the issue of substantial similarity. We also note that the district court did not determine whether the expert reports otherwise met applicable standards for admissibility, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702, 703, and we do not address this issue. If admissible, the conflicting reports indicate material issues of fact as to substantial similarity. Timberpeg's expert (who was also a Timberpeg employee) stated that \"the outline and design of the Isbitski house in the [VTW] drawings matches almost exactly the architectural design represented in Timberpeg's plans\" and that \"the overall dimensions are the same, the stair is the same design in the same location, and the area shown as a loft is the same size in the same location.\" VTW's expert report, by contrast, noted a number of differences, including the fact that the VTW frame was a bent frame rather than a frame using common rafters with purlins as in Timberpeg's plans. It also noted that the VTW posts were placed on basement \"footings\" that were already in place when the frame was constructed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether VTW's shop drawings and constructed frame were substantially similar to Timberpeg's architectural work as embodied in the second preliminary plans for the Isbitski home is one for a jury to decide after trial.

The predicates of this argument are shaky, but the more fundamental problem is that the statute does not require that the<i>infringing</i> work meet the definition of an architectural work. For instance, the AWCPA excludes from the scope of exclusive rights in architectural works \"the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.\" Pub.L.

The more common \"stick built\" home, by contrast, is framed using two-inch lumber rather than posts and beams. Isbitski dealt both with Timberpeg and with VTW, two companies that are, broadly speaking, in the timberframe business, but have different sorts of operations. Douglas Friant is one of the founders and co-owners of VTW, and is responsible for the drafting of timberframe shop drawings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for VTW. Isbitski's dealings with Timberpeg and VTW, and his own work on his house (he was acting as his own general contractor for the construction of the home), ran somewhat in parallel. We describe his dealings with each company separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Isbitski's Dealings with Timberpeg</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg markets and sells designs and its own brand of \"packages\" for the construction of timberframe homes. A Timberpeg package consists of the materials used for the construction of a home's timberframe and exterior building envelope (including windows, exterior doors, insulation, siding, exterior trim, and cedar roof shakes). Timberpeg does not erect the packages it sells; instead, a customer must hire a builder or contractor to assemble and erect the package.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg provides architectural design services for customers, and has a staff of architects and designers who can create all the necessary designs and architectural plans to build a home. Timberpeg's business model is not based on selling design services or architectural plans. Rather, Timberpeg makes its money on the sale of its packages of construction material based on its architectural plans. Timberpeg provides architectural design services as a way to facilitate the sale of its packages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1999 or perhaps earlier, Isbitski approached Timberpeg to consider the purchase of a Timberpeg package. Isbitski, working with a Timberpeg employee, filled out a \"design information sheet\" about what he wanted the house to look like. The actual design information sheet is not in the record. On November 15, 1999, Isbitski and Timberpeg entered into a \"Deposit Agreement for TIMBERPEG Preliminary Plans and Drawings.\" Under this deposit agreement, Isbitski paid a $2500 deposit to Timberpeg, in exchange for which Timberpeg would and did create preliminary architectural plans and construction plans for the house. The preliminary architectural plans would consist of a basement plan, floor plans, four elevations (external, vertical views of the house from different angles showing exterior features such as window and door locations, roof pitches, and ceiling heights), and a building cross section. After Isbitski's approval of the preliminary plans, Isbitski would receive construction plans, including foundation plans and details of Timberpeg's standard construction techniques. According to the contract, the construction plans could \"be used for planning the construction process, ordering materials, obtaining contractor bids, and securing a building permit.\" Final plans, which included the complete frame drawings, would not be prepared as part of the deposit agreement, but would be prepared as part of the final contract for the purchase of a Timberpeg package. Timberpeg, in all, provided Isbitski with two versions of the preliminary plans and then construction plans. No final plans were ever provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the contract, Isbitski represented to Timberpeg that \"any house plans, specifications, drawings or sketches of any kind (the `Drawings') provided to [Timberpeg were] the result of an original design (the `Design'),\" represented that he (Isbitski) was the \"sole owner of the Design and has exclusive rights, including copyright, in and to the Design as represented in the Drawings,\" and agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Timberpeg from use of the drawings and design. Timberpeg would own the copyright in the \"Preliminary Plans, Construction Plans, specifications, drawings, and other material (the `Plans').\" Isbitski could use the plans \"solely in connection with the evaluation and construction of one (1) Package purchased from [Timberpeg],\" and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ny other use of the Plans, including, but not limited to, the following, is an unauthorized appropriation of copyright by Customer and a breach of this Agreement: a) the copying of all or any part of the Plans; b) the utilization or partial utilization of the Plans for the construction of a similar building or structure; or c) any transfer or delivery of the Plans to another person without written authorization from [Timberpeg].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski was under no obligation to purchase a Timberpeg package after seeing the preliminary plans or even the construction plans. If he chose to purchase a package, the $2500 deposit would be credited against the price of the package. If he chose not to purchase a package, Isbitski would have to return the plans, and Timberpeg would return the deposit minus a fee for design time, billed at $49 per hour, and other incidental costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg created a first set of preliminary plans on December 29, 1999 and gave them to Isbitski. These plans showed the design of a house with a timberframed main portion and a wing that would be stick built. The record does not contain this first set of plans, and these plans were never registered with the Copyright Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, Isbitski met again with Timberpeg, saying that he was unsatisfied with the first set of preliminary plans. Timberpeg completed a new design for Isbitski on April 20, 2001 \"based on [its] interpretation of Mr. Isbitski's rough ideas and preferences.\" The plans were given to Isbitski. Timberpeg registered these plans with the Copyright Office on May 18, 2001. The registration certificate shows that these second preliminary plans were registered as an \"architectural work.\" It is only this second, registered set of preliminary plans that is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these plans, Isbitski applied for a building permit from the Town of Salisbury. As part of the permitting process, in April 2001, Isbitski submitted the second preliminary plans to the Town of Salisbury, where they were placed in a public file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of preliminary plans contained elevations and floor plans. The plans showed a two-floor main house connected via a covered breezeway to a three-car garage with a lofted space above it. The first floor of the main house was nine feet tall; the second floor was eight feet tall. The main house consisted, broadly speaking, of two major portions. One portion &#8212; the portion which would be timberframed &#8212; was backwards-L-shaped. A great room (with two-floor ceilings on the northern end of the house), kitchen, breakfast room, and dining room were on the first floor, and a den was on the lofted second floor (which occupied only the southern portion of the house). The plans for this portion of the house did not contain a complete design of the timberframe, but the floor plans did show where the vertical posts would connect to the foundation and the location of at least some of the internal horizontal beams. The timberframing in this portion of the house used a particular style featuring common rafters with principal purlins (horizontal timbers supporting the rafters). The roof in this portion was oriented north-to-south,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with a particular pitch (roof angle) referred to as a \"twelve-by-twelve\" pitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exact dimensions of the timberframed portion of the main house were 44 feet by 28 feet, with a 14-foot-by-8-foot section cut out in the northwest corner to form the L shape, where a screen porch would be located. There was also a \"bump-out\" in the kitchen on the western side of the house &#8212; an approximately eight-foot portion of the western wall containing windows that jutted out one foot beyond the rest of the wall. The timberframed portion of the house also featured a central switchback staircase located in the center of the timberframed portion of the home. In addition to labels denoting the various rooms, the floor plan showed the location of various fixtures, including a kitchen sink (located at the \"bump-out\"), a stove, and a fireplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second major component of the main house &#8212; containing bedrooms, bathrooms, and the foyer &#8212; was connected to the eastern side of the timberframed portion, and was to be stick-built. The roof in this portion of the house was oriented east-to-west, and had a pitch of nine-by-twelve.

He gave Timberpeg a picture clipped from a magazine showing a bent frame (this was the same picture he later gave to VTW). No modifications were undertaken until the construction plans were drafted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, in August 2001, Isbitski asked Timberpeg for a set of foundation plans showing the location of various support posts and steel girders, so he could start pouring the concrete foundation. Timberpeg agreed, but asked Isbitski to send in $1500 to cover past due and future design fees. Timberpeg asserts that it continued to assume that Isbitski would eventually buy a package from Timberpeg. On September 20, 2001, Timberpeg sent its \"construction plans,\" reflecting a timberframe in a bent-frame style (although not containing a complete frame design), and the foundation plan. This third set of plans, which reflected the bent frame, was never registered with the Copyright Office. Sometime thereafter, Isbitski poured the foundation of the home and also began construction of the three-car garage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Dealings with VTW</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2000, a year after Isbitski had seen the first preliminary Timberpeg plans but before Isbitski had asked Timberpeg for a second set of preliminary plans, Isbitski approached VTW. VTW is located in Vermont, and specializes in timberframing. It has no architects on staff, and does not design buildings or create architectural plans. Instead, it uses specifications provided by the customer to create shop drawings of the frame of the building. These specifications typically are in the form of architectural plans, but VTW also can draw frames based on rough sketches, as long as VTW receives information about the building's footprint (the outline of the building as it sits on the ground) and wall height. VTW also has an in-house frame assembly crew that actually erects the frame on site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to VTW, Isbitski stated that he had developed a layout for a house plan with his then-deceased wife. Isbitski stated that his plan was to have VTW draw and construct only the timberframe for the timberframed main portion of the home. Isbitski was going to act as the general contractor for the remainder of the home, subcontracting work to other people or companies as needed. Starting at the end of 2000, VTW began drawing a timberframe for Isbitski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that in his first meeting with VTW in December 2000, Isbitski provided VTW with a copy of the first, unregistered set of preliminary plans created by Timberpeg. VTW asserts that its personnel only saw this first set of preliminary plans, not the second, registered plans, on which the claim here is brought. VTW also claims that those first preliminary plans did not even factor into its creation of its timberframe for Isbitski's home because Isbitski said he was unhappy with the plans, and that VTW, in fact, asked Isbitski to consult an architect to develop floor plans and elevations for the home. This, VTW says, would not have been necessary had VTW been relying even on Timberpeg's first, unregistered plans. Timberpeg counters that VTW could have obtained the second, registered preliminary plans, either through Isbitski himself or through the Town of Salisbury. Timberpeg points to a letter written by VTW's attorney after litigation had commenced, which stated that Isbitski asked VTW \"to design a frame to fit a portion of the floor plans of his house\" and that Isbitski had \"represented to [VTW] that he paid for and owned a set of plans, which he provided to [VTW] that were drawn by Timberpeg.\" The letter does not say whether the plans referred to were the first set or the second set of plans created by Timberpeg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW's position is that it took its directions only from Isbitski and that Isbitski provided substantial guidance in determining VTW's shop drawings of the timberframe. According to Douglas Friant at VTW, Isbitski said that he had been \"planning this house for years and [was] working on the design for years.\" At the first meeting in December 2000, Isbitski provided the dimensions of his plan (although the record does not reveal the exact dimensions that he gave to VTW). He also brought pictures clipped from a magazine and a catalog (not from Timberpeg) showing how he wanted the frame to look. The pictures showed a bent-style frame. Friant stated that during the drafting process (starting from December 2000 until May 2002) Isbitski frequently would drop by or call VTW's shop unexpectedly, and would talk with Friant about his ideas about what he wanted for the timberframe. As an example, Friant testified at his deposition that Isbitski was \"very concerned about how the stairway looked\" and \"absolutely emphatic about . . . making sure that he was able to hang a chandelier in the stairway area,\" and this instruction required Friant to modify the shop drawings. According to VTW, some of Isbitski's instructions were very specific. Isbitski would tell VTW where to place posts within an eighth of an inch, and asked VTW to change the roof pitch in VTW's original designs to a precise pitch he provided. During the time VTW was working on its shop drawings, Isbitski received the second preliminary plans and the construction plans from Timberpeg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski agreed to purchase the VTW timberframe on March 8, 2002. By this time, Timberpeg's second preliminary plans, the registered plans, had been in his hands for nearly one year, and publicly available for about the same amount of time. Isbitski also had had possession of the construction drawings from Timberpeg for nearly six months. VTW completed final revisions to its shop drawings of the timberframe design in May 2002. The shop drawings showed a bent-style frame which was in some ways similar to, and in other ways different from, the timberframed portion of the main house in Timberpeg's registered preliminary plan. We consider these similarities and differences in detail below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By June 2002, Isbitski had completed the foundation and the three-car garage with the loft. VTW erected, on that foundation, the frame as provided for in the shop drawings. The parties assume that the erected frame reflected the shop drawings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2002, Isbitski informed Timberpeg that he was not going to be purchasing a Timberpeg package. According to Timberpeg, Isbitski said the reason was that he was going to build a stick-built, rather than a timberframed, house. Timberpeg in response asked for the remainder of the design fees due (which fees had, by that point, exceeded Isbitski's total deposit), amounting to approximately $1000. It is unclear whether Isbitski ever paid this amount. Soon thereafter, Timberpeg learned that Isbitski was building a house, using VTW's timberframe, that looked like the house it had designed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Aftermath</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isbitski never completed the home, apparently because he ran into financial difficulty. Isbitski had begun enclosing the timberframe built by VTW with exterior wall panels, but never completed that task, and the frame was left open to the elements. Timberpeg sold a license to its registered design to Sugar River Savings Bank in October 2003 in order to assist with the completion of construction of the home. Under the terms of the license, the bank was free to re-sell to any party other than Isbitski or VTW. Sometime in 2004, a representative from Timberpeg visited the Isbitski site. The property had been purchased by a Mr. Dupee, who had largely completed construction of the house in a manner which, according to Timberpeg, was similar to the design as reflected in the second set of preliminary plans created for Isbitski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg filed suit against VTW and Isbitski in the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire on October 23, 2003. Timberpeg asserted, inter alia, copyright infringement claims against VTW under 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 501 <i>et seq.</i> Timberpeg's claim against VTW was that the timberframe designed in shop drawings and built by VTW was \"substantially similar to the architectural work embodied in the\" second preliminary plans, which it had registered as an architectural work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 2005, the district court granted summary judgment to VTW on all counts. As to the copyright infringement claim, the district court first held, incorrectly relying on pre-AWCPA law, that VTW's constructed frame could not be a copy of an architectural plan under copyright law. The district court, considering only whether VTW's shop drawings were an infringing copy of Timberpeg's architectural work, as embodied in the second preliminary plans, held as a matter of law that VTW had not actually copied Timberpeg's plans, and even assuming copying, that VTW's shop drawings were not substantially similar to Timberpeg's architectural plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timberpeg moved for reconsideration, pointing out that its claim was based on the AWCPA. It argued that the district court's holding that a building could not be a copy of an architectural plan under copyright law was contrary to the AWCPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It also argued that there was at least a genuine issue of material fact as to unlawful copying. Timberpeg relied, in part, on the letter from VTW's counsel, which it argued contained an admission that the defendants had copied Timberpeg's plans. Timberpeg emphasized that its \"central theory . . . is that the timberframe, in the shop drawings and as constructed by the defendants[,] is an infringing copy of the architectural work reflected in Timberpeg's copyright[ed] architectural plans, as opposed to an infringing copy of the plans themselves\" and that the claim squarely fell under the AWCPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reconsidered, and on April 6, 2005, held that no reasonable jury could conclude that the timberframe as constructed according to VTW's shop drawings was substantially similar to the architectural work as embodied in Timberpeg's registered plans. In doing so, it rejected Timberpeg's reliance on the letters from VTW's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW moved for attorneys' fees under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 505. The district court granted VTW's motion for attorneys' fees and awarded $116,642.43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to the specific arguments on appeal, we discuss the governing framework of copyright law and the AWCPA. The AWCPA extended copyright protection to a class of works called \"architectural works,\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a)(8), which are defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the design of a building as embodied in any tangible medium of expression, including a building, architectural plans, or drawings. The work includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design, but does not include individual standard features.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">17 U.S.C. &#167; 101. Timberpeg argues that this definition is broad, and that VTW's timberframe (as reflected in the shop drawings and as constructed) infringes Timberpeg's copyright in the architectural work as embodied in its second, registered preliminary plans and including a particular configuration of elements which together form the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first briefly lay out the requirements of a claim of copyright infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Copyright Infringement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Copyright Act, \"[c]opyright protection subsists . . . in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a).

VTW, like the district court, rejects Timberpeg's reliance on the letters, arguing that the letters were not admissions, but to the contrary, state that VTW did not copy Timberpeg's plans. The letter from VTW's attorney does not say whether the plans referenced are the second, registered preliminary plans (about which there is a dispute as to whether VTW saw the plans) or the first, unregistered preliminary plans (which VTW acknowledges it received, but states it did not rely on). This is a factual dispute about the meaning of the admission by counsel, and that issue cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of direct evidence of copying &#8212; such direct evidence is rare, <i>see Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18 &#8212; one of the ways to indirectly establish that the defendant copied the plaintiff's work is to provide evidence that (1) the defendant \"enjoyed access to the copyrighted work,\" and so had the opportunity to copy the work, and (2) \"a sufficient degree of similarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing work to give rise to an inference of actual copying.\" <i>Id.</i> The similarity inquiry used to indirectly establish copying is referred to as \"<i>probative</i> similarity\" and is \"somewhat akin to, but different than, the requirement of substantial similarity\" that must be shown to prove copyright infringement. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to access, Timberpeg argues that VTW had access to its registered preliminary plans both because Isbitski had made those plans public by filing them with the Town of Salisbury, and because VTW could have received the plans directly from Isbitski. A trier of fact may impute access when there is \"evidence that a third party with whom both the plaintiff and defendant were dealing had possession of plaintiff's work,\" and the \"plaintiff's and defendant's dealings took place concurrently.\" 4 Nimmer &amp; Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 13.02[A].

We discuss below the similarities and dissimilarities between Timberpeg's registered plans and VTW's frame in the context of the substantial similarity inquiry. We conclude that a reasonable jury could find a sufficient degree of probative similarity exists between Timberpeg's architectural work and VTW's frame \"to give rise to an inference of actual copying\" for the same reasons a jury could find there is substantial similarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Substantial Similarity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial similarity inquiry \"entails proof that the copying was so extensive that it rendered the works so similar that the later work represented a wrongful appropriation of expression.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 18.

VTW's shop drawings also reflect certain other features that VTW did not actually build &#8212; the exterior walls and the actual staircase (although VTW did build the posts that define the stair bay).

VTW's shop drawings appeared to contemplate a further wing attached to the eastern wall of the timberframe; the shop drawings showed the location of exterior wall panels (which VTW would not erect but were nonetheless reflected in the drawings), and there were no such panels along the eastern side.

Timberpeg's registered plans did not show a complete timberframe design, while VTW's shop drawings showed only a timberframe, and VTW only erected a timberframe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The frame components that were shown in Timberpeg's second, registered preliminary plans reflected a certain framing style with common rafters and principal purlins,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> while VTW's shop drawings and frame were in a bent style.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. While Timberpeg's plans and VTW's frame both had 27 posts, there are differences. There were two posts in the VTW shop drawings without any corresponding equivalents in the Timberpeg design. Of the twenty-five equivalent posts, only two were identical in size, orientation, notching, and location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW argues that these differences \"preclude[] the existence of a material dispute on whether there was `substantial similarity.'\" Timberpeg argues that all of these differences are minimal, and are insufficient to overcome the similarities such that summary judgment for VTW is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeping in mind the definition of an \"architectural work\" as \"includ[ing] the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design,\" 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to substantial similarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred in failing to consider those similarities that went to the \"overall form\" of the building as well as the \"arrangement and composition of spaces and elements.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court found that the only similarities were in \"the idea of a twenty-eight by forty-four foot part of a house, with a stair bay located in a particular position\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and so found that no reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's shop drawings were substantially similar to Timberpeg's registered plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the relevant similarities here go beyond those recognized by the district court. At issue here is a particular combination of elements in Timberpeg's architectural work: a portion of a home featuring a timberframe with a backwards-L-shaped footprint, with a particular arrangement of posts, with certain dimensions and a bump-out along the western wall, featuring a central switchback staircase, with a lofted second floor of a certain floor area and in a certain location, with a certain roof pitch with certain dimensions, and certain wall heights. A reasonable jury, properly considering this combination of elements, could conclude that VTW's frame was substantially similar to Timberpeg's registered plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also concluded that the differences between VTW's frame and Timberpeg's registered plans were such that no reasonable jury could conclude there was substantial similarity. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court and VTW emphasized that VTW designed only a frame, while Timberpeg's plans did not contain a complete frame design. This emphasis wrongly assumes that the only question here is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's frame is substantially similar to Timberpeg's <i>frame design,</i> and that since Timberpeg never designed a complete frame, there can be no infringement. That is wrong. The question here is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that VTW's frame as drawn and built is substantially similar to Timberpeg's <i>architectural work</i> (which includes \"the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design\") as embodied in the second preliminary plans for the Isbitski house. This does not necessarily turn on whether Timberpeg created a complete frame design or not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to VTW's claim that it is a dispositive difference that the VTW frame could accommodate any number of internal layouts and external features other than those reflected in the architectural plans created by Timberpeg, this too stems from a misunderstanding of Timberpeg's claim. Copyright protection exists not only in the architectural work taken as a whole (which includes a particular floor plan and arrangement of external features), but also in protectable portions of the work. Timberpeg bases its claims here on a combination of elements, which, taken together, are protectable under the definition of an architectural work in 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101. As the legislative history for the AWCPA states, \"[t]he phrase `arrangement and composition of spaces and elements' recognizes that . . . creativity in architecture frequently takes the form of a selection, coordination, or arrangement of unprotectible elements into an original, protectible whole.\" H.R.Rep. No. 101-735, <i>reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6949. A jury could reasonably conclude that VTW's frame is substantially similar to these protectable elements of Timberpeg's architectural work. The fact that VTW's frame might not necessarily result in <i>other</i> elements being taken from Timberpeg's architectural work is not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW also considers the differences in the posts between Timberpeg's plan and VTW's frame to be dispositive. This is an argument that can be addressed to the jury, but is not itself dispositive on summary judgment. Timberpeg argues that differences in almost all of the posts are measured on the scale of inches rather than feet. VTW has not argued that Timberpeg is wrong on this point, and has not demonstrated that no reasonable jury would find the differences insignificant. VTW makes general statements that certain posts have a different size, orientation, or notching, but the actual measure of the differences is important to evaluating substantial similarity; a difference of a few feet obviously weighs more strongly against substantial similarity than a difference of a few inches. Both the magnitude and significance of any differences present disputed issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VTW also relies on the difference in the size of the kitchen bump-out and the fact that Timberpeg's second preliminary plan contemplated a common rafter style, whereas the VTW frame featured a bent style. While these differences may also weigh against a finding of substantial similarity by the fact finder, this is evidence for the jury to weigh.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis alone requires reversal.

The district court rejected any reference to expert affidavits in the context of substantial similarity, citing our <i>Segrets</i> case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We have not, however, uniformly rejected the use of expert testimony on substantial similarity. <i>See Johnson,</i> 409 F.3d at 20 (noting that the plaintiff's \"burden of establishing both probative similarity . . . and substantial similarity . . .

We also note that the district court did not determine whether the expert reports otherwise met applicable standards for admissibility, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702, 703, and we do not address this issue. If admissible, the conflicting reports indicate material issues of fact as to substantial similarity. Timberpeg's expert (who was also a Timberpeg employee) stated that \"the outline and design of the Isbitski house in the [VTW] drawings matches almost exactly the architectural design represented in Timberpeg's plans\" and that \"the overall dimensions are the same, the stair is the same design in the same location, and the area shown as a loft is the same size in the same location.\" VTW's expert report, by contrast, noted a number of differences, including the fact that the VTW frame was a bent frame rather than a frame using common rafters with purlins as in Timberpeg's plans.

The predicates of this argument are shaky, but the more fundamental problem is that the statute does not require that the<i>infringing</i> work meet the definition of an architectural work. For instance, the AWCPA excludes from the scope of exclusive rights in architectural works \"the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, paintings, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work, if the building in which the work is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.\" Pub.L.
