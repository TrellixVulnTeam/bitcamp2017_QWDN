Jose Roberto Duarte Lopes, of Cape\n\nVerde,    petitions    for   review    of    a   decision       of    the   Bureau   of\n\nImmigration Appeals upholding an Immigration Judge's order of\n\nremoval.    At issue is whether Lopes's particular conviction for\n\nassault    under    Rhode    Island    law,      R.I.    Gen.        Laws   §   11-5-3,\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 16(a).\n\n            We hold that the BIA did not err in concluding the crime\n\nwas a crime of violence and deny his petition.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Lopes was admitted to the United States on or about\n\nFebruary    18,    1988.     On    February      15,    1995,    he     pleaded    nolo\n\ncontendere to a charge in state court that he committed assault and\n\nbattery upon Kimberly Niles, his girlfriend, in violation of R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 11-5-3 and the state's Domestic Violence Prevention\n\nAct, R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5.         Lopes was sentenced to one year in\n\nprison, which was suspended, and one year of probation.\n\n            Lopes was served with a Notice to Appear on November 20,\n\n2001, which charged that, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)\n\nand § 1227(a)(2)(B)(I), he was removable on account of his 1995\n\nconviction for domestic assault as well as a 1996 state conviction\n\nfor   possession      of   cocaine    and    a   2000    state        conviction     for\n\npossession of marijuana.          On July 29, 2002, the IJ ordered Lopes's\n\nremoval on the basis that Lopes's assault conviction constituted an\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\faggravated   felony    within     the   meaning    of   8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because it qualified as a crime of violence\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 16(a).     In turn, 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) defines a\n\ncrime of violence as an offense \"that has as an element the use,\n\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\n\nperson or property of another.\"    The IJ also held that Lopes was\n\nsubject to removal on the basis of his 1996 drug conviction but not\n\nhis 2000 drug conviction, which had subsequently been vacated. The\n\nIJ further held that Lopes did not qualify for a waiver of removal\n\nunder § 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\").\n\n          Lopes appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. On December\n\n30, 2003, the BIA issued an order agreeing with the IJ that Lopes's\n\nassault conviction was for a crime of violence and therefore\n\nrendered him removable.    The BIA remanded the case, however, with\n\nrespect to whether Lopes was eligible for consideration of § 212(c)\n\nrelief, given that his conviction predated the restrictions imposed\n\nby the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and\n\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n\n1996.\n\n          On June 15, 2005, the government added another removal\n\ncharge based on Lopes's 1995 domestic assault conviction, which was\n\nbased on the same facts as the charge in the original Notice to\n\nAppear but cited to a different section of the INA.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f               On November 28, 2005, the IJ issued an oral opinion\n\nagreeing with the government that Lopes was ineligible for a\n\n§ 212(c) waiver, relying on two BIA cases decided after the IJ's\n\nfirst opinion.          In re Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec. 766, 773\n\n(B.I.A. 2005) (alien ineligible for § 212(c) waiver because the\n\ncrime of violence ground for removal has no statutory counterpart\n\nin the grounds of inadmissibility under § 212(a) of the INA); In re\n\nBlake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722, 728 (B.I.A. 2005) (alien ineligible for\n\n§ 212(c) waiver because the aggravated felony ground of removal\n\nwith       which   he   was   charged   has   no   statutory   counterpart   in\n\n§ 212(a)).         The IJ also rejected Lopes's argument that the record\n\nprovided by the government to prove his 1995 assault conviction is\n\nunreliable because it states that he was arrested on August 14,\n\n1995 and that his sentence began on February 15, 1995.                 The IJ\n\ncited a number of possible reasons for the apparent inconsistency,\n\nincluding a deliberate decision to backdate Lopes's sentence or\n\n\"1996\" mistakenly being entered as \"1995.\"\n\n               The BIA affirmed the IJ in an opinion issued on January\n\n30, 2007.          It again addressed the question of whether the 1995\n\nassault conviction was for a crime of violence.1                  Because the\n\nstatute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-3, does not define assault, the BIA\n\n\n       1\n          It is not clear to us why the BIA did not simply rely on\nits earlier affirmance, for purposes of the removal order, that the\n1995 assault conviction was for a crime of violence, and why that\nquestion was addressed anew by the IJ on remand. All parties have\ntreated the question as being an open one before the IJ on remand.\n\n                                        -4-\n\flooked to the state's case law.               The BIA noted that the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme Court has defined \"assault\" as an attempt to do a\n\nbodily harm to another person with \"force or violence.\"                  State v.\n\nMcLaughlin, 621 A.2d 170, 177 (R.I. 1993) (citing State v. Pope,\n\n414 A.2d 781 (R.I. 1980)).           The BIA also pointed out that threats\n\nto    injure    or   kill   alone,   without    force   or   violence,    do   not\n\nconstitute a crime under Rhode Island law.               State v. Torres, 787\n\nA.2d 1214, 1221 (R.I. 2002); State v. Pule, 453 A.2d 1095, 1097 &\n\nn.1 (R.I. 1982).       The BIA concluded that Lopes was convicted of a\n\ncrime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) because the crime\n\nfor which he was convicted, assault, involved the use or attempted\n\nuse    of   physical    force   against       another   person.    As     to   the\n\ndocumentary basis for proof of the conviction, the BIA found no\n\nerror in the IJ's use of the record of conviction provided by the\n\ngovernment, noting that Lopes had not challenged the existence of\n\nthe conviction or the statute itself, and \"what appears to be a\n\ntypographical error in the date of the conviction\" is \"irrelevant\"\n\nto the ultimate question of whether Lopes was convicted of a crime\n\nof violence.\n\n               Lopes seeks review of the BIA's decision in this court,\n\narguing that his conviction for assault does not qualify under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 16(a) as a crime of violence and that the BIA erred by\n\nallowing the IJ to rely on the record of conviction provided by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                                         II.\n\n            We review the BIA's legal conclusions de novo, Settenda\n\nv. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004), but give significant\n\ndeference to the BIA's factual findings under the substantial\n\nevidence standard, De Vega v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL\n\n2696489, at *2 (1st Cir. Sept. 17, 2007).             Under the substantial\n\nevidence standard, we uphold a decision \"unless any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\"                     Ouk v.\n\nGonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Three federal statutes provide the backdrop for the\n\ngovernment's removal action in this case.                 The first, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), provides that any alien who is convicted of\n\nan \"aggravated felony\" at any time after admission to the United\n\nStates   is       eligible    for   deportation.          In   turn,     8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(43)(F) defines the term \"aggravated felony\" to include a\n\n\"crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, but not\n\nincluding     a   purely     political   offense)   for    which   the       term   of\n\nimprisonment [sic] at least one year.\"          Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 16(a)\n\ndefines a \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that has as an element\n\nthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\n\nthe person or property of another.\"\n\n            The Rhode Island statute under which Lopes was convicted\n\nin 1995, section 11-5-3, is entitled \"Simple assault or battery\"\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fand provides that \"every person who shall make an assault or\n\nbattery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined\n\nnot exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.\"                   R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 11-5-3(a).          Lopes argues that the determination should be\n\nmade from the face of the statute and he should be considered to\n\nhave   committed      a    crime   of   violence    only    if   every    possible\n\napplication of section 11-5-3 involves a crime of violence. This\n\ncourt has already rejected both prongs of the argument.                  In Conteh\n\nv. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2006), this court affirmed the\n\nBIA's adoption of a modified categorical approach to removal\n\nproceedings in determining whether an alien's predicate offense\n\nqualifies   as   an       aggravated    felony,    but   cabined   somewhat    the\n\nmaterial which may be considered.              Id. at 50.    The test approved\n\nrepresents a modification of the approach adopted by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), in assessing\n\nwhether a defendant's prior convictions are for violent felonies\n\nunder the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), for\n\nsentencing purposes. That approach was extended to guilty pleas in\n\nShepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 19-20 (2005).\n\n            We have held that when \"the statute on which the prior\n\nconviction rests sweeps more broadly, the government . . . must\n\ndemonstrate, by reference only to facts that can be mined from the\n\nrecord of conviction, that the putative offense constitutes a crime\n\ndesignated as an aggravated felony.\"              Conteh, 461 F.3d at 56.      In\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fother   words,    this   court    will    consider       whether       the   crime   the\n\npetitioner actually committed -- as demonstrated by the record of\n\nconviction   --    constitutes     a     crime      of       violence,   rather      than\n\nhypothesize whether every conceivable conviction under a broad\n\nstatute would constitute a crime of violence.\n\n           Lopes argues that because the Rhode Island statute refers\n\nto both assault and battery, the BIA was required to consider the\n\nconviction as a \"battery.\"          He contends that a battery involves\n\nunintentional touching and so is not a form of violence.                       We need\n\nnot reach the question of whether a battery conviction under Rhode\n\nIsland law is a conviction for a crime of violence.                            The BIA\n\ncorrectly concluded that the appropriate documents of conviction\n\nestablished that Lopes committed an assault and that under Rhode\n\nIsland case law an assault is a crime of violence.\n\n           The documents that the government can use to prove a\n\ncriminal conviction in removal proceedings are described in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B).         These statutory provisions specifically\n\ninclude the two documents on which the BIA has adjudicated this\n\ncase: an official record of plea, verdict, and sentence, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1229a(c)(3)(B)(ii),     and    a     docket     entry       from   court   records\n\nindicating        the     existence            of        a       conviction,         id.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(3)(B)(iii).      The official record of plea, verdict, and\n\nsentence indicates that Lopes pled nolo contendere to a charge that\n\nhe \"commit[ted] assault and battery upon the body of Kimberly\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fNiles.\"       The criminal docket report states that a plea of nolo\n\ncontendere was entered on a count of \"simple assault -- domestic.\"\n\nOn the basis of these two documents, it is clear that Lopes was\n\nconvicted of assault.\n\n              Because section 11-5-3 does not provide a definition of\n\nassault, the BIA appropriately looked to Rhode Island case law to\n\ndetermine how the state defines the crime.        See State v. Jackson,\n\n752 A.2d 5, 9 (R.I. 2000) (\"Because statutory definitions are not\n\ngiven, the common law established by our cases has defined the\n\nterm[] 'assault' . . . .\").        The Rhode Island Supreme Court has\n\ndefined assault as \"an unlawful attempt or offer, with force or\n\nviolence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or\n\nwantonness.\"      McLaughlin, 621 A.2d at 177 (emphases added) (citing\n\nPope, 414 A.2d at 788).     Furthermore, as the BIA noted, under Rhode\n\nIsland law there can be no assault without the presence of physical\n\nforce.\n\n              Thus, a conviction for assault under Rhode Island law\n\nsatisfies the statutory definition of a crime of violence because\n\nit has as an element the \"attempted use, or threatened use of\n\nphysical force against the person or property of another.\"               18\n\nU.S.C.    §   16(a).    Rhode   Island's   definition   of   assault   also\n\ncontemplates a \"higher degree of intent than negligent or merely\n\naccidental conduct,\" as the Supreme Court has required.         Leocal v.\n\nAshcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9 (2004).       We therefore hold that Lopes is\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fsubject to deportation as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because the record of conviction establishes\n\nthat he was convicted of assault, which as defined by Rhode Island\n\nlaw constitutes a crime of violence.2\n\n          Finally, we turn to Lopes's claim that the record of\n\nconviction is unreliable.   Lopes argues that the discrepancy in\n\ndates in his record of conviction violates the requirement of\n\nWoodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276 (1966), that removal orders be based on\n\n\"clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\"3    Id. at 286.   We\n\ndisagree. The BIA's determination that the record of conviction is\n\nreliable is amply supported by the evidence.   As the BIA noted, the\n\ngovernment has provided certified copies of the conviction record;\n\nLopes has not challenged the existence of the conviction, the\n\n\n     2\n          Lopes also suggests that because his conviction could\nqualify as either an aggravated felony or a misdemeanor under the\nSentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2, an ambiguity exists and\nthe rule of lenity should apply. Because Lopes did not present\nthis argument to the BIA, we need not consider it here. Rumierz v.\nGonzales, 456 F.3d 31, 41 n.12 (1st Cir. 2006). Regardless, the\nargument is irrelevant.    The statutes at issue are immigration\nstatutes.\n     3\n          At oral argument, Lopes argued for the first time that\nhis record of conviction is also unreliable because the docket\nsheet states that he was convicted of \"simple assault -- domestic,\"\nwhich does not have a precise statutory counterpart. Because this\nargument was not presented before the BIA, the exhaustion doctrine\nbars its review in this court. Rumierz, 456 F.3d at 41 n.12. But\nin any event, the claim is not a winning one. \"Simple assault --\ndomestic\" is an accurate description of the crime to which Lopes\npled guilty.    The fact that a court officer uses language to\ndescribe a crime on a docket sheet that does not comport with the\nexact language of the corresponding criminal statute(s) does not\nrender the docket sheet unreliable.\n\n                               -10-\n\fstatute under which he was convicted, or the substance of the\n\nrecord of conviction; and the discrepancy in dates appears to be a\n\ntypographical error and has no bearing on any aspect of the\n\nconviction at issue in this case.     We add that the typographical\n\nerror on the docket sheet can readily be traced to poor handwriting\n\nindicating the year of sentencing on the record of plea, verdict,\n\nand sentence.\n\n          Lopes's petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Laws   §   11-5-3,\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 16(a).\n\n            We hold that the BIA did not err in concluding the crime\n\nwas a crime of violence and deny his petition.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Lopes was admitted to the United States on or about\n\nFebruary    18,    1988.     On    February      15,    1995,    he     pleaded    nolo\n\ncontendere to a charge in state court that he committed assault and\n\nbattery upon Kimberly Niles, his girlfriend, in violation of R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 11-5-3 and the state's Domestic Violence Prevention\n\nAct, R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5.         Lopes was sentenced to one year in\n\nprison, which was suspended, and one year of probation.\n\n            Lopes was served with a Notice to Appear on November 20,\n\n2001, which charged that, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)\n\nand § 1227(a)(2)(B)(I), he was removable on account of his 1995\n\nconviction for domestic assault as well as a 1996 state conviction\n\nfor   possession      of   cocaine    and    a   2000    state        conviction     for\n\npossession of marijuana.          On July 29, 2002, the IJ ordered Lopes's\n\nremoval on the basis that Lopes's assault conviction constituted an\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\faggravated   felony    within     the   meaning    of   8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because it qualified as a crime of violence\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 16(a).     In turn, 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) defines a\n\ncrime of violence as an offense \"that has as an element the use,\n\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\n\nperson or property of another.\"    The IJ also held that Lopes was\n\nsubject to removal on the basis of his 1996 drug conviction but not\n\nhis 2000 drug conviction, which had subsequently been vacated. The\n\nIJ further held that Lopes did not qualify for a waiver of removal\n\nunder § 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\").\n\n          Lopes appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA. On December\n\n30, 2003, the BIA issued an order agreeing with the IJ that Lopes's\n\nassault conviction was for a crime of violence and therefore\n\nrendered him removable.    The BIA remanded the case, however, with\n\nrespect to whether Lopes was eligible for consideration of § 212(c)\n\nrelief, given that his conviction predated the restrictions imposed\n\nby the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and\n\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n\n1996.\n\n          On June 15, 2005, the government added another removal\n\ncharge based on Lopes's 1995 domestic assault conviction, which was\n\nbased on the same facts as the charge in the original Notice to\n\nAppear but cited to a different section of the INA.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f               On November 28, 2005, the IJ issued an oral opinion\n\nagreeing with the government that Lopes was ineligible for a\n\n§ 212(c) waiver, relying on two BIA cases decided after the IJ's\n\nfirst opinion.          In re Brieva-Perez, 23 I. & N. Dec. 766, 773\n\n(B.I.A. 2005) (alien ineligible for § 212(c) waiver because the\n\ncrime of violence ground for removal has no statutory counterpart\n\nin the grounds of inadmissibility under § 212(a) of the INA); In re\n\nBlake, 23 I. & N. Dec. 722, 728 (B.I.A. 2005) (alien ineligible for\n\n§ 212(c) waiver because the aggravated felony ground of removal\n\nwith       which   he   was   charged   has   no   statutory   counterpart   in\n\n§ 212(a)).         The IJ also rejected Lopes's argument that the record\n\nprovided by the government to prove his 1995 assault conviction is\n\nunreliable because it states that he was arrested on August 14,\n\n1995 and that his sentence began on February 15, 1995.                 The IJ\n\ncited a number of possible reasons for the apparent inconsistency,\n\nincluding a deliberate decision to backdate Lopes's sentence or\n\n\"1996\" mistakenly being entered as \"1995.\"\n\n               The BIA affirmed the IJ in an opinion issued on January\n\n30, 2007.          It again addressed the question of whether the 1995\n\nassault conviction was for a crime of violence.1                  Because the\n\nstatute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-3, does not define assault, the BIA\n\n\n       1\n          It is not clear to us why the BIA did not simply rely on\nits earlier affirmance, for purposes of the removal order, that the\n1995 assault conviction was for a crime of violence, and why that\nquestion was addressed anew by the IJ on remand. All parties have\ntreated the question as being an open one before the IJ on remand.\n\n                                        -4-\n\flooked to the state's case law.

The BIA concluded that Lopes was convicted of a\n\ncrime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) because the crime\n\nfor which he was convicted, assault, involved the use or attempted\n\nuse    of   physical    force   against       another   person.    As     to   the\n\ndocumentary basis for proof of the conviction, the BIA found no\n\nerror in the IJ's use of the record of conviction provided by the\n\ngovernment, noting that Lopes had not challenged the existence of\n\nthe conviction or the statute itself, and \"what appears to be a\n\ntypographical error in the date of the conviction\" is \"irrelevant\"\n\nto the ultimate question of whether Lopes was convicted of a crime\n\nof violence.\n\n               Lopes seeks review of the BIA's decision in this court,\n\narguing that his conviction for assault does not qualify under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 16(a) as a crime of violence and that the BIA erred by\n\nallowing the IJ to rely on the record of conviction provided by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                                         II.\n\n            We review the BIA's legal conclusions de novo, Settenda\n\nv.

The first, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), provides that any alien who is convicted of\n\nan \"aggravated felony\" at any time after admission to the United\n\nStates   is       eligible    for   deportation.          In   turn,     8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(43)(F) defines the term \"aggravated felony\" to include a\n\n\"crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, but not\n\nincluding     a   purely     political   offense)   for    which   the       term   of\n\nimprisonment [sic] at least one year.\"          Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 16(a)\n\ndefines a \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that has as an element\n\nthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\n\nthe person or property of another.\"\n\n            The Rhode Island statute under which Lopes was convicted\n\nin 1995, section 11-5-3, is entitled \"Simple assault or battery\"\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fand provides that \"every person who shall make an assault or\n\nbattery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined\n\nnot exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.\"                   R.I.

In\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fother   words,    this   court    will    consider       whether       the   crime   the\n\npetitioner actually committed -- as demonstrated by the record of\n\nconviction   --    constitutes     a     crime      of       violence,   rather      than\n\nhypothesize whether every conceivable conviction under a broad\n\nstatute would constitute a crime of violence.\n\n           Lopes argues that because the Rhode Island statute refers\n\nto both assault and battery, the BIA was required to consider the\n\nconviction as a \"battery.\"          He contends that a battery involves\n\nunintentional touching and so is not a form of violence.                       We need\n\nnot reach the question of whether a battery conviction under Rhode\n\nIsland law is a conviction for a crime of violence.                            The BIA\n\ncorrectly concluded that the appropriate documents of conviction\n\nestablished that Lopes committed an assault and that under Rhode\n\nIsland case law an assault is a crime of violence.\n\n           The documents that the government can use to prove a\n\ncriminal conviction in removal proceedings are described in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B).         These statutory provisions specifically\n\ninclude the two documents on which the BIA has adjudicated this\n\ncase: an official record of plea, verdict, and sentence, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1229a(c)(3)(B)(ii),     and    a     docket     entry       from   court   records\n\nindicating        the     existence            of        a       conviction,         id.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(3)(B)(iii).      The official record of plea, verdict, and\n\nsentence indicates that Lopes pled nolo contendere to a charge that\n\nhe \"commit[ted] assault and battery upon the body of Kimberly\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fNiles.\"       The criminal docket report states that a plea of nolo\n\ncontendere was entered on a count of \"simple assault -- domestic.\"\n\nOn the basis of these two documents, it is clear that Lopes was\n\nconvicted of assault.\n\n              Because section 11-5-3 does not provide a definition of\n\nassault, the BIA appropriately looked to Rhode Island case law to\n\ndetermine how the state defines the crime.        See State v. Jackson,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2071155\"><a href=\"/opinion/2071155/state-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (R.I. 2000) (\"Because statutory definitions are not\n\ngiven, the common law established by our cases has defined the\n\nterm[] 'assault' . . . .\").        The Rhode Island Supreme Court has\n\ndefined assault as \"an unlawful attempt or offer, with force or\n\nviolence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or\n\nwantonness.\"      McLaughlin, 621 A.2d at 177 (emphases added) (citing\n\nPope, 414 A.2d at 788).     Furthermore, as the BIA noted, under Rhode\n\nIsland law there can be no assault without the presence of physical\n\nforce.\n\n              Thus, a conviction for assault under Rhode Island law\n\nsatisfies the statutory definition of a crime of violence because\n\nit has as an element the \"attempted use, or threatened use of\n\nphysical force against the person or property of another.\"               18\n\nU.S.C.    §   16(a).    Rhode   Island's   definition   of   assault   also\n\ncontemplates a \"higher degree of intent than negligent or merely\n\naccidental conduct,\" as the Supreme Court has required.

We therefore hold that Lopes is\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fsubject to deportation as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because the record of conviction establishes\n\nthat he was convicted of assault, which as defined by Rhode Island\n\nlaw constitutes a crime of violence.2\n\n          Finally, we turn to Lopes's claim that the record of\n\nconviction is unreliable.   Lopes argues that the discrepancy in\n\ndates in his record of conviction violates the requirement of\n\nWoodby v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107317\"><a href=\"/opinion/107317/woodby-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), that removal orders be based on\n\n\"clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\"3    Id. at 286.   We\n\ndisagree. The BIA's determination that the record of conviction is\n\nreliable is amply supported by the evidence.   As the BIA noted, the\n\ngovernment has provided certified copies of the conviction record;\n\nLopes has not challenged the existence of the conviction, the\n\n\n     2\n          Lopes also suggests that because his conviction could\nqualify as either an aggravated felony or a misdemeanor under the\nSentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2, an ambiguity exists and\nthe rule of lenity should apply. Because Lopes did not present\nthis argument to the BIA, we need not consider it here. Rumierz v.\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202336\"><a href=\"/opinion/202336/rumierz-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 n.12 (1st Cir. 2006). Regardless, the\nargument is irrelevant.    The statutes at issue are immigration\nstatutes.\n     3\n          At oral argument, Lopes argued for the first time that\nhis record of conviction is also unreliable because the docket\nsheet states that he was convicted of \"simple assault -- domestic,\"\nwhich does not have a precise statutory counterpart. Because this\nargument was not presented before the BIA, the exhaustion doctrine\nbars its review in this court. Rumierz, 456 F.3d at 41 n.12. But\nin any event, the claim is not a winning one. \"Simple assault --\ndomestic\" is an accurate description of the crime to which Lopes\npled guilty.    The fact that a court officer uses language to\ndescribe a crime on a docket sheet that does not comport with the\nexact language of the corresponding criminal statute(s) does not\nrender the docket sheet unreliable.\n\n                               -10-\n\fstatute under which he was convicted, or the substance of the\n\nrecord of conviction; and the discrepancy in dates appears to be a\n\ntypographical error and has no bearing on any aspect of the\n\nconviction at issue in this case.     We add that the typographical\n\nerror on the docket sheet can readily be traced to poor handwriting\n\nindicating the year of sentencing on the record of plea, verdict,\n\nand sentence.\n\n          Lopes's petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f</pre>",
