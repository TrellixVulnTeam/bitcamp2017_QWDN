Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Salvador Medina De La Cruz on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Robert J. Triba, Regional Chief\nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 16, 2003\n\f             Per Curiam.      Claimant Gilberto Figueroa-Perea appeals\n\nfrom the district court's judgment affirming the denial of Social\n\nSecurity disability benefits. The Commissioner of Social Security,\n\nin denying such benefits, first determined that although claimant\n\ncould not return to his past (heavy) work as a laborer, he\n\n(claimant) nonetheless retained the capacity for the full range of\n\nlight work.     Then, using the Medical Vocational Guidelines (the\n\n\"Grid\"), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, App. 2, as a framework, the\n\nCommissioner concluded that claimant was not disabled.               The only\n\nissue   on    appeal   is    whether,    given     claimant's   nonexertional\n\nimpairments -- pain and an adjustment disorder -- reliance on the\n\nGrid was appropriate.\n\n             1. As for his pain, claimant fails to make any developed\n\nargument concerning the decision of the administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ) that the pain did not amount to a significant nonexertional\n\nimpairment. As we have warned, \"issues averted to in a perfunctory\n\nmanner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\n\n[will be] deemed waived for purposes of appeal.\"                 F.D.I.C. v.\n\nLeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 820 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted).          In any event, the ALJ's decision is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n             That   is,     although    claimant    has   a   condition   that\n\nreasonably could be expected to produce some pain -- a herniated or\n\nprotruding disc at L5-S1 -- the record does not contain any\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fevidence that claimant has any neurological deficits or loss of\n\nstrength as the result of this condition.                  Further, claimant's\n\nmotor and sensory systems have remained intact, and, while one\n\ntreating     physician     noted   (unspecified)      muscle     atrophy,    the\n\nexamining    neurologist       found   that   claimant's     muscles   had   not\n\natrophied at all.        Finally, the primary limitation in claimant's\n\nrange of motion is that claimant has trouble with forward bending\n\ndue, in part, to his pain.         And, as for this limitation, the ALJ\n\ndid   credit      claimant's    complaints     of   pain     because   the   ALJ\n\nspecifically found that claimant was precluded from activities\n\nwhich involved constant bending.\n\n            2.     The issues concerning claimant's mental impairment\n\nare governed by our decision in Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services, 890 F.2d 520 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam), in which\n\nwe approved the use of the Grid in circumstances similar to the\n\ncase at hand.          In Ortiz, we held that the use of the Grid is\n\nappropriate so long as the claimant's mental impairment does not\n\n\"interfere more than marginally with the performance of the full\n\nrange of unskilled work.\" Id. at 526. This determination involves\n\ntwo distinct inquiries:        \"(1) whether a claimant can perform close\n\nto the full range of unskilled work, and (2) whether he can conform\n\nto the demands of a work setting, regardless of the skill level\n\ninvolved.\"       Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           The first inquiry concerns a claimant's abilities to (1)\n\ncope   with   simple    instructions,    (2)   deal     with   supervision,\n\ncoworkers, and usual work situations, and (3) respond to changes in\n\nthe work setting.         Id. (citing Social Security Ruling 85-15).\n\nHere, the mental residual functional capacity (RFC) assessment\n\nrated claimant as having no significant limitations in his capacity\n\n(1) to deal with simple instructions, (2) to sustain an ordinary\n\nroutine without special supervision, (3) to remember work-like\n\nprocedures, and (4) to get along with coworkers. And, although Dr.\n\nCotto, the consultative psychiatrist, rated claimant as being\n\nseverely limited in his ability to adapt to changes, the RFC\n\nassessment noted only moderate limits in this area. Such conflicts\n\nare for the Commissioner to resolve, not the courts. See Rodriguez\n\nv. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st\n\nCir. 1981).\n\n           This leaves claimant's capacity to respond to criticism\n\nfrom supervisors.      The clinical psychologist who completed the RFC\n\nassessment form checked the box on the form entitled \"Not Ratable\n\non Available Evidence.\"       However, claimant consistently has been\n\ndescribed as cooperative, and no evaluator has reported that\n\nclaimant   showed   any    difficulty   with   anger,   hostility,   or   in\n\naccepting directions from the evaluators -- difficulties which\n\nmight indicate problems with responding to supervision.           Thus, we\n\nthink that there is substantial evidence in the record to support\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fa finding that claimant's mental impairment has not resulted in a\n\nsubstantial loss of his capacity to perform the basic work-related\n\nactivities listed in Social Security Ruling 85-15.       See Ortiz, 890\n\nF.2d at 526 (only a \"substantial loss of ability to meet any of\n\nthese   basic   work-related   activities   would   severely   limit   the\n\npotential occupational base\").\n\n            In relation to the second inquiry, which involves \"a\n\nclaimant's ability to accommodate the demands of a work setting per\n\nse,\" the Commissioner has stated that \"the mentally impaired may\n\ncease to function effectively when facing such demands as getting\n\nto work regularly . . . and remaining in the workplace for a full\n\nday . . . .\"     Id. at 527 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).   Here, the mental RFC assessment indicates that claimant\n\nis moderately limited in (1) performing within a schedule, (2)\n\nkeeping up regular attendance, and (3) completing a normal work\n\nweek without interruptions and without an unreasonable number of\n\nrest periods; further, both the RFC assessment and Dr. Cotto's\n\nevaluation noted that claimant had moderate limitations in his\n\nability to maintain concentration for extended periods.          Because\n\nthe claimant in Ortiz also was moderately limited in all of the\n\nthese areas, see id. at 527, the record supports the finding that\n\nclaimant retained the capacity to accommodate to the demands of any\n\nwork setting, regardless of the skill level of the work involved.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f             Based   on   the   foregoing,    and    according    the   proper\n\ndeference to the Commissioner's decision, we conclude that reliance\n\non the Grid was permitted in this case.             That is, although both\n\nclaimant's pain and adjustment disorder imposed some limitations,\n\nthere   is   substantial    evidence   in    the    record   to   support   the\n\nCommissioner's decision that these limitations were not significant\n\nenough to require the testimony of a vocational expert.                     The\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
