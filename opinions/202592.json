R. 32.3\n\n             United States Court of Appeals\n                           For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 06-1800\n\n                          LOUIS VUITTON MALLETIER,\n\n                             Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                         v.\n\n               TITO MORALES d/b/a PARIS BAG COLLECTION,\n\n                            Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n             APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n           [Hon. Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                       Before\n\n                            Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Baldock,* and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Reichard & Calaf, P.S.C., Federico Calaf-Legrand, and Vicente\nA. Sequeda-Torres on brief, for appellee.\n     Julio E. Gil De Lamadrid for appellant.\n\n\n\n                               January 10, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.      This appeal derives from an action brought\n\nby appellee Louis Vuitton Malletier against a host of vendors in\n\nPuerto Rico, including appellant Tito Morales (d/b/a Paris Bags),\n\nalleging that the vendors were selling counterfeit Louis Vuitton\n\nmerchandise.     In due course, the district court entered judgment\n\nagainst Morales, enjoined him from violating appellee's trademark\n\nrights, and ordered that he pay $50,000 in damages.                       Morales\n\nappeals.\n\n            Morales's    arguments      merit   only    a   brief   discussion.\n\nFirst, Morales challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that\n\nappellee introduced to support its claim.              This argument fails to\n\ncomprehend that the district court entered a default judgment\n\nagainst him.     Thus, Morales was deemed to have conceded the truth\n\nof appellee's factual allegations, see In re Home Restaurants,\n\nInc., 285 F.3d 111, 114 (1st Cir. 2002), which were adequate to\n\nestablish liability. Second, Morales contends that appellee failed\n\nto establish actual damages.         But this contention is also beside\n\nthe point because the district court awarded appellee statutory\n\ndamages.    See 15 U.S.C. § 1117(c).        Lastly, Morales argues that the\n\ndistrict    court    never   acquired    personal      jurisdiction      over   him\n\nbecause appellee's amended complaint was never properly served upon\n\nhim.     This argument ignores the fact that Morales was initially\n\nserved    with   a   \"John   Doe\"   complaint    and    appeared    to    contest\n\nappellee's request for a preliminary injunction on the strength\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthereof.     Morales presents no coherent theory as to how the\n\nimproper service of a later filing (which, other than specifically\n\nidentifying prior \"John Does,\" was identical to the original\n\ncomplaint) divested the district court of personal jurisdiction\n\nover him.     And, in any event, Morales fails to question the\n\ndistrict court's alternative conclusion that any challenge to\n\npersonal jurisdiction was waived as untimely.    See Fed R. Civ. P.\n\n12(h).\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed. See Loc.\n\nR. 27(c).    Costs are awarded to appellee.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n In light of our conclusions, appellee's motion to file a\nsupplemental brief is denied.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
