Aldo Salazar, a native and citizen\n\nof Peru, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals's\n\ndenial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nCarmen Rodriguez Salazar, his wife and a native and citizen of\n\nVenezuela, is a derivative asylum applicant.                 Both Salazars were\n\nadmitted    to    the    United    States   as    visitors   for     pleasure    and\n\noverstayed.       The Salazars are apparently hardworking members of\n\ntheir     community;     they     have    many    supporters    and    present     a\n\nsympathetic case.         Whether that outweighs their illegal presence\n\nwas something the immigration authorities might have considered in\n\nthe exercise of their prosecutorial discretion as to whether to\n\nseek deportation.          A court, restricted in its review of the\n\ndecisions made by immigration authorities, has no such discretion.\n\n            The    agency's       determination     that   Salazar    was   \"firmly\n\nresettled\" in Venezuela, and so ineligible for asylum in the United\n\nStates, is supported by substantial evidence.                       INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13(c)(2)(1)(B),\n\n208.15.      We   must    deny     the   petition   for    review    because    firm\n\nresettlement in a third country is a mandatory bar to the granting\n\nof asylum.        This marks our first occasion to address the firm\n\nresettlement doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                   I.\n\n            The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found Salazar's testimony\n\ncredible.    We describe the historical facts as Salazar recounted\n\nthem at his hearing and in his application for asylum.\n\n            Salazar asserts that he would be in danger if returned to\n\nPeru because of the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso, or Shining\n\nPath, which has operated in Peru for over twenty years.                 The\n\nShining Path opposes landowners and seeks to destroy farm ownership\n\narrangements.   Its members, Salazar explained, \"do not want [those\n\nwho] have money to exist.\"\n\n            Salazar's father owned a 103 acre farm in San José, Peru\n\non which the family raised cattle for milking.            In 1984, the\n\nShining Path destroyed the nearest neighboring farm and damaged the\n\nSalazar farm.   In response to that attack and to the Shining Path's\n\nannouncement of its intent to \"destroy the rest of the people that\n\ncontinue    having   properties\"   and   \"redistribute   the   wealth    to\n\neverybody,\" Salazar's father \"sold a great piece of the land\" and\n\nsold many of the animals.      He also resigned in 1984 as a rural\n\njudge, a position that he had held for a few years.       No one else in\n\nthe Salazar family held any political or official positions.             In\n\n1986, the Shining Path stole many of the Salazars's remaining\n\nhorses, cows, and sheep, as well as most of their food supply.\n\nFrom that point, the Shining Path constantly harassed the Salazar\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffamily -- coming to the farm and disturbing them at all different\n\nhours and distributing their land to others.\n\n            As a result of the threat from the Shining Path, the\n\nSalazar family began to abandon the farm in 1989.     Gilmer Salazar,\n\npetitioner's older brother, did not leave the farm and was killed\n\nwhen the Shining Path dynamited the Salazar house in 1990.       The\n\nrest of the family scattered throughout Peru, and petitioner's\n\nparents moved to Trujillo, where they constantly changed their\n\nnames and tried not to go out in public.\n\n            Salazar himself traveled around Peru trying to stay far\n\naway from danger.      He first went to Lima for one year, then\n\ntraveled in the south of Peru for half a year because of terrorism\n\nin Lima, and then moved to the west of Peru.      He did not want to\n\nleave Peru and remained there until July or August 1992 when he\n\ndecided that he had to leave because of the danger.     He left Peru,\n\nentered Ecuador, and stayed for a very brief time.     He then moved\n\non to Colombia, where he stayed for two months and worked to have\n\nmoney to continue with his trip.      In October or November 1992, he\n\ntraveled to Venezuela and entered the country illegally.     He lived\n\nin Venezuela for at least fourteen months, worked there, and rented\n\nan apartment.\n\n            A Venezuelan passport was issued to Salazar on November\n\n29, 1993.    Salazar explained that he needed to be a Venezuelan\n\nresident to obtain a visa to the United States, and that \"I met a\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fman in Venezuela that told me that he could arrange [to have a\n\nresident stamp placed on my passport] for me if I paid him\n\nsomething.\"     Salazar paid, a resident stamp was placed in his\n\npassport, and in December 1993 he applied for and received a visa\n\nfrom the United States Embassy to enter this country as a visitor\n\nfor pleasure.    Salazar says that he had always planned to come to\n\nthe United States.   He did not make any effort to obtain a visa to\n\ncome to the United States from Peru.    He met Carmen, his now wife,\n\nin Maracaibo while on line at the United States Embassy to request\n\nthe visa, and they traveled together to the United States in\n\nFebruary 1994.    They were admitted as visitors for pleasure and\n\nauthorized to stay until August 1994.    Salazar never sought asylum\n\nin Ecuador, Colombia, or Venezuela.\n\n          Carmen and Aldo Salazar were married in the United\n\nStates.   Salazar's asylum application is dated April 13, 1994.\n\nSalazar and his wife left the United States twice after the\n\nsubmission of the application.        They traveled to Venezuela on\n\nAugust 11, 1994 and returned to the United States a day later.\n\nThey again traveled to Venezuela on February 10, 1995 and returned\n\nto the United States on February 26, 1995.    On both trips, Salazar\n\nwas readmitted to Venezuela as a Venezuelan resident. He testified\n\nthat he showed the authorities his passport and they admitted him\n\n\"with the residence that [he has].\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           In 1996, the Shining Path killed Salazar's uncle, Antonio\n\nSalazar Contreras, who was a farmer and who lived near what used to\n\nbe the Salazar family farm.     The evidence that Shining Path was\n\nresponsible for the murder, Salazar explained, was \"the way he died\n\nbecause he was tortured\" and strangled and \"[t]hey left some\n\npapers, warnings, saying that this is the way the people are going\n\nto die if they don't let, leave their properties.\"     Salazar said\n\nthat his uncle was killed \"[b]ecause he was there and he was still\n\nmaintaining his property.\"    Salazar believes that he would be in\n\ndanger in Peru \"because my family, my brothers and myself who were\n\ndeclared enemies of that Shining Path and we were threatened if we\n\nreturn.\"    The threats were made on a \"few occasions when we were\n\nthere.    Because we were in farm, we tried to defend ourselves and\n\nbecause of that, they put us in the black list.\"   Salazar believes\n\nthat the Shining Path declared his family to be enemies \"because we\n\n. . . did not want to leave our property and I think it was more\n\nbecause we always tried for the police to protect us.\"      Salazar\n\nsaid he had only one instance of personal contact with members of\n\nShining Path.    He testified, \"I was walking . . . and I saw armed\n\nmen and they asked me some things and that was it.\"\n\n            Salazar's parents and three of his siblings still reside\n\nin Peru.    His other four surviving siblings live in the United\n\nStates.    According to a year 2000 country condition report, the\n\nShining Path is still operating in Peru and is still responsible\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffor numerous murders.          The threat from the Shining Path has\n\ndeclined, though, and Salazar admitted that he was aware that\n\nPeru's government had captured a number of Shining Path leaders.\n\n           On August 31, 1999, the INS issued Aldo and Carmen\n\nSalazar notices to appear, charging them as deportable for having\n\nremained in the United States longer than authorized. The Salazars\n\nconceded   deportability      and   sought   asylum   and   withholding   of\n\ndeportation.        The IJ found that Salazar has the status of a\n\nresident in Venezuela and so was \"firmly resettled\" under 8 C.F.R.\n\n208.15 and ineligible for asylum.          The IJ also held that Salazar\n\nhad otherwise failed to establish asylum eligibility. The IJ found\n\nthat although Salazar was at one time a member of a landowning\n\nfamily targeted by the Shining Path, he had ceased to be within\n\nthat targeted social group when his family sold their property,\n\nmoved, and safely resided elsewhere in Peru.             Salazar's fear of\n\npersecution, the IJ determined, was not well-founded, and there was\n\nno basis for concluding that he would face a risk of harm in Peru\n\non   account   of    any   asylum-eligible   category.      The   IJ   denied\n\nSalazar's application and granted him voluntary departure.                The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed without opinion, and\n\nSalazar filed this petition for review.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an\n\nalien applicant \"if the Attorney General determines that such alien\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fis   a   refugee   within   the   meaning    of   [8   U.S.C.]   section\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1). An asylum applicant bears\n\nthe burden of establishing that he fits within the statutory\n\ndefinition of refugee, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a), a burden that involves\n\nproving \"persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion,\" 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(A); see\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b); Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n           Under 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(2)(1)(B), which applies to\n\nasylum applications filed before April 1, 1997, asylum may not be\n\ngranted to any applicant who \"[h]as been firmly resettled within\n\nthe meaning of [8 C.F.R.] § 208.15.\"        Section 208.15 states:\n\n           An alien is considered to be firmly resettled if, prior\n           to arrival in the United States, he or she entered into\n           another country with, or while in that country received,\n           an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or\n           some other type of permanent resettlement unless he or\n           she establishes:\n           (a)   That his or her entry into that country was a\n           necessary consequence of his or her flight from\n           persecution, that he or she remained in that country only\n           as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel, and\n           that he or she did not establish significant ties in that\n           country; or\n           (b) That the conditions of his or her residence in that\n           country were so substantially and consciously restricted\n           by the authority of the country of refuge that he or she\n           was not in fact resettled.        In making his or her\n           determination, the asylum officer or immigration judge\n           shall consider the conditions under which other residents\n           of the country live; the type of housing, whether\n           permanent or temporary, made available to the refugee;\n           the types and extent of employment available to the\n           refugee; and the extent to which the refugee received\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              permission to hold property and to enjoy other rights and\n              privileges, such as travel documentation that includes a\n              right of entry or reentry, education, public relief, or\n              naturalization, ordinarily available to others resident\n              in the country.\n\n\nIn   1996,    Congress    codified   the    rule       that   a   finding       of   firm\n\nresettlement operates as a mandatory bar1 to the grant of asylum.\n\n8    U.S.C.    §   1158(b)(2)(A)(vi);       see    8    C.F.R.         §   208.13(c)(1)\n\n(explaining that asylum applications filed on or after April 1,\n\n1997, the effective date of the 1996 codification, are subject to\n\nthe statutory firm resettlement rule).                 That codification is not\n\nretroactive, see Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 604(c), 110 Stat. 3009\n\n(1996), so it does not apply to petitioner.2                  The applicable firm\n\nresettlement       rule   is   the   one      contained           in       8   C.F.R.   §\n\n208.13(c)(2)(1)(B), and that regulation is entitled to deference.\n\nINS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424-25 (1999); Chevron\n\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844\n\n(1984); Costa v. INS, 233 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n      1\n          It was not always true that firm resettlement was a\nmandatory bar to asylum. See Abdille v. Ashcroft, 242 F.3d 477,\n483 n.4 (3d Cir. 2001).\n      2\n          Salazar filed his asylum application on April 13, 1994.\nThe IJ determined that Salazar abandoned that application by\nleaving the United States and traveling to Venezuela after filing\nit. The IJ decided that it was best to continue the proceedings\ndespite the abandonment and allowed the date of the asylum\napplication to be amended to February 26, 1995, the date of\nSalazar's return to the United States after his second trip to\nVenezuela.    The difference in the two application dates is\nimmaterial to our analysis.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f                 A finding of \"firm resettlement\" is reviewed under the\n\ndeferential substantial evidence standard. Mussie v. INS, 172 F.3d\n\n329,       331    (4th    Cir.      1999)    (applying     the   substantial      evidence\n\nstandard to the BIA's finding of firm resettlement); cf. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. at 481.                  The BIA's finding of firm resettlement\n\nmust be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary\n\nconclusion, but compels it. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 & n.1;\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                 There is a two part analysis under 8 C.F.R. § 208.15.\n\nFirst,       there       is   the    question     whether     the    alien   is    \"firmly\n\nresettled\" within the meaning of the regulation.                        See Mussie, 172\n\nF.3d at 331-32.               The government bears some initial burden of\n\nshowing firm resettlement.                  See id. at 331-32.       The case law treats\n\nthis showing made by the government as creating a rebuttable\n\npresumption,3 see id.; Cheo v. INS, 162 F.3d 1227, 1229-30 (9th\n\nCir. 1998); Abdalla v. INS, 43 F.3d 1397, 1399 (10th Cir. 1994),\n\nwhich       the    alien      can     overcome        on   showing    otherwise    \"by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\"                       8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(2)(ii).\n\nSecond, if the alien fails to rebut the presumption, there is the\n\nquestion whether the alien can show that he falls within either\n\n\n\n       3\n          Some case law, but not the regulations, calls the initial\nshowing of firm resettlement by the government a \"prima facie case\"\nthat shifts the burden to the applicant. See Abdille, 242 F.3d at\n486. Whether or not the prima facie case analogy is correct, there\nis burden shifting, and that shifting sensibly reflects the\ndifficulties of obtaining proof faced by the government.\n\n                                               -10-\n\fexception (a) or exception (b).       See Mussie, 172 F.3d at 332.          The\n\nalien bears the burden on both exceptions.          8 C.F.R. § 208.15; see\n\nMussie, 172 F.3d at 332.\n\n           We have not previously addressed the \"firm resettlement\"\n\nbar in § 208.15.     It seems clear that the government may make its\n\ninitial showing of firm resettlement by producing evidence that the\n\nresettling country's government formally and affirmatively offered\n\nthe alien permanent resettlement, a term which includes -- but is\n\npotentially   more   expansive   than      --   offers   of   citizenship    or\n\npermanent residence.4     In the instant case, the government readily\n\nmet its burden by pointing to a facially valid government offer of\n\npermanent residence: the Venezuelan residency stamp on the Salazar\n\npassports, as well as uncontroverted evidence that the Venezuelan\n\ngovernment twice honored that stamp when the Salazars made return\n\ntrips to Venezuela.\n\n           Since the government satisfied the requisite initial\n\nshowing,   the   burden   shifted    to     the   Salazars    to   rebut    the\n\n\n\n     4\n          There is a disagreement among courts concerning the\ndistinct issue as to whether the government may make its initial\nshowing exclusively by direct or circumstantial evidence of the\ngovernment's offer of permanent settlement, or whether it may do so\nthrough other \"non-offer-based elements,\" such as the alien's\nestablishment of significant familial or business ties or the\nprolonged duration of the alien's residence in the resettlement\ncountry without any government efforts to deport him. See, e.g.,\nAbdille v. Ashcroft, 242 F.3d 477, 487 (3d Cir. 2001). As the IJ\ndid not rely upon \"non-offer-based elements\" in holding that the\ngovernment satisfied its initial showing, we reserve that issue for\na future decision.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fpresumption created by the government's initial presentation of\n\nfirm    resettlement    and/or   to    accept   the   conclusion    of   firm\n\nresettlement but show he was within either of the two exceptions to\n\nthe \"firm resettlement\" bar set forth in § 208.15.\n\n              The IJ considered Salazar's testimony that he paid an\n\nunidentified person to obtain the resident stamp on his behalf.\n\nEven accepting the testimony, Salazar produced no evidence that,\n\nbeyond mere payment for the stamp, the stamp was not valid or that\n\nany irregularities would result in the eventual invalidation of the\n\nstamp by the Venezuelan government.          Thus, there was insufficient\n\nevidence to persuade -- let alone compel -- the IJ to discount the\n\nfacial validity of the resident stamp.\n\n              Similarly, the Salazars adduced no evidence of any \"non-\n\noffer-based elements\" which would compel a finding by the IJ that\n\nthey had rebutted the government's prima facie showing.                   The\n\nevidence shows that Salazar lived in Venezuela for more than a\n\nyear, obtained employment, and rented an apartment.             Further, Ms.\n\nSalazar's Venezuelan citizenship suggests that Salazar established\n\nenduring familial ties in Venezuela, an inference that is further\n\nconfirmed by the Salazars' two return trips to Venezuela.                Given\n\nthis record, it simply cannot be said that the IJ's decision that\n\nthere   was    firm   resettlement    was    unsupported   by   \"substantial\n\nevidence.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f          Next is the question whether petitioner has shown he is\n\nwithin either of the two exceptions, parts (a) and (b) of § 208.15.\n\nSee Mussie, 172 F.3d at 332.    To fit within the second exception,\n\nan alien must show that the conditions of his residence in the\n\nthird country \"were so substantially and consciously restricted by\n\nthe authority of [that] country\" that he was not in fact resettled.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.15(b).     There is no basis for concluding -- and\n\npetitioner's counsel does not argue otherwise -- that Salazar fits\n\nwithin this exception.\n\n          This leaves only the exception in (a). To fit within the\n\nfirst exception, an alien must satisfy each of three prongs.     The\n\nalien must show (1) that his entry into the third country was a\n\n\"necessary consequence of his . . . flight from persecution,\" (2)\n\nthat he remained there \"only as long as was necessary to arrange\n\nonward travel, and\" (3) that he \"did not establish significant ties\n\nin that country.\"    Id. § 208.15(a) (emphasis added).       Salazar\n\nplainly failed to provide any evidence to meet the second prong,\n\nthat he remained in Venezuela \"only as long as was necessary to\n\narrange onward travel.\"     Under the regulation, § 208.15, it was\n\nSalazar's burden to establish this point.   He did not.   Salazar did\n\nsay at the hearing that he stayed in Colombia for only two months\n\nand worked there in order to be able to continue with his trip.\n\nBut he did not offer a similar explanation for the fourteen months\n\nhe spent in Venezuela.    As a result, the IJ's holding that Salazar\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fwas firmly resettled in Venezuela, affirmed by the BIA, must stand.\n\nSince firm resettlement is a bar to asylum, we need not address\n\nwhether Salazar met the burden to prove past persecution in Peru\n\npursuant to § 208.13.\n\n                                 III.\n\n           Although firm resettlement is, by regulation, a bar to\n\nthe grant of asylum, we have found no statute or regulation that\n\nbars the relief of withholding of deportation on the basis of firm\n\nresettlement. While this omission may strike some as odd, the firm\n\nresettlement finding does have practical implications here.                  We\n\nconsider the withholding of deportation claim independently, as\n\nhave other circuits.      See Cheo, 162 F.3d at 1229-30; Vang v. INS,\n\n146 F.3d 1114, 1116-17 (9th Cir. 1997); Abdalla, 43 F.3d at 1399.\n\n           There are two salient distinctions between asylum and\n\nwithholding of deportation.       First, the alien must meet a higher\n\nstandard to show withholding of deportation.             He must show that,\n\nupon deportation, he is more likely than not to face persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.           INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407,\n\n424 (1984).   If a court upholds a denial of asylum, the application\n\nfor withholding of removal necessarily fails.            Second, even if the\n\ncriteria   for   asylum   are   met,    the   decision    as   to   relief   is\n\ndiscretionary.    But if the criteria for withholding of deportation\n\nare met, the grant of relief is mandatory.           Aguirre-Aguirre, 526\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fU.S. at 419-20.      We engage in substantial evidence review for\n\nwithholding of deportation, the same standard as for asylum.     We\n\nhave not in this case addressed the propriety of the denial of\n\nasylum based on grounds other than firm resettlement and do not do\n\nso now.\n\n          Here, the IJ ordered deportation to Peru, but also\n\npermitted voluntary departure.     The finding of firm resettlement\n\nmore than suggests that the Salazars may voluntarily depart to\n\nVenezuela, whose residence permit their passports bear.     Salazar\n\nhas not shown that he cannot return to Venezuela, much less that he\n\nwould more likely than not face persecution in Venezuela on one of\n\nthe five grounds.    Nor has he shown that Venezuela would forceably\n\nrepatriate him to Peru.   As such, the finding of firm resettlement\n\nprovided sufficient evidence to support the denial of withholding\n\nof removal.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Petitioner argues that it was improper for the BIA to\n\nadopt the IJ's decision without rendering its own opinion.      The\n\nargument is frivolous. It is well established that \"if the Board's\n\nview is that the IJ 'got it right,' the law does not demand that\n\nthe Board go through the idle motions of dressing the IJ's findings\n\nin its own prose.\"     Chen v. INS, 87 F.3d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(noting this court's agreement with eight other circuits that,\n\n\"having given individualized consideration to a particular case,\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f[the BIA] may simply state that it affirms the IJ's decision for\n\nthe reasons set forth in that decision\").\n\n                                   V.\n\n          The denial of petitioner's application for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal is affirmed.      The order granting voluntary\n\ndeparture stands.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f",

Carmen Rodriguez Salazar, his wife and a native and citizen of Venezuela, is a derivative asylum applicant. Both Salazars were admitted to the United States as visitors for pleasure and overstayed. The Salazars are apparently hardworking members of their community; they have many supporters and present a sympathetic case. Whether that outweighs their illegal presence was something the immigration authorities might have considered in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion as to whether to seek deportation. A court, restricted in its review of the decisions made by immigration authorities, has no such discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency's determination that Salazar was \"firmly resettled\" in Venezuela, and so ineligible for asylum in the United States, is supported by substantial evidence. <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 208.13(c)(2)(1)(B), 208.15. We must deny the petition for review because firm resettlement in a third country is a mandatory bar to the granting of asylum. This marks our first occasion to address the firm resettlement doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found Salazar's testimony credible. We describe the historical facts as Salazar recounted them at his hearing and in his application for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar asserts that he would be in danger if returned to Peru because of the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, which has operated in Peru for over twenty years. The Shining Path opposes landowners and seeks to destroy farm ownership arrangements. Its members, Salazar explained, \"do not want [those who] have money to exist.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar's father owned a 103 acre farm in San Jos&#233;, Peru on which the family raised cattle for milking. In 1984, the Shining Path destroyed the nearest neighboring farm and damaged the Salazar farm. In response to that attack and to the Shining Path's announcement of its intent to \"destroy the rest of the people that continue having properties\" and \"redistribute the wealth to everybody,\" Salazar's father \"sold a great piece of the land\" and sold many of the animals. He also resigned in 1984 as a rural judge, a position that he had held for a few years. No one else in the Salazar family held any political or official positions. In 1986, the Shining Path stole many of the Salazars's remaining horses, cows, and sheep, as well as most of their food supply. From that point, the Shining Path constantly harassed the Salazar family &#8212; coming to the farm and disturbing them at all different hours and distributing their land to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the threat from the Shining Path, the Salazar family began to abandon the farm in 1989. Gilmer Salazar, petitioner's older brother, did not leave the farm and was killed when the Shining Path dynamited the Salazar house in 1990. The rest of the family scattered throughout Peru, and petitioner's parents moved to Trujillo, where they constantly changed their names and tried not to go out in public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar himself traveled around Peru trying to stay far away from danger. He first went to Lima for one year, then traveled in the south of Peru for half a year because of terrorism in Lima, and then moved to the west of Peru. He did not want to leave Peru and remained there until July or August 1992 when he decided that he had to leave because of the danger. He left Peru, entered Ecuador, and stayed for a very brief time. He then moved on to Colombia, where he stayed for two months and worked to have money to continue with his trip. In October or November 1992, he traveled to Venezuela and entered the country illegally. He lived in Venezuela for at least fourteen months, worked there, and rented an apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Venezuelan passport was issued to Salazar on November 29, 1993. Salazar explained that he needed to be a Venezuelan resident to obtain a visa to the United States, and that \"I met a man in Venezuela that told me that he could arrange [to have a resident stamp placed on my passport] for me if I paid him something.\" Salazar paid, a resident stamp was placed in his passport, and in December 1993 he applied for and received a visa from the United States Embassy to enter this country as a visitor for pleasure. Salazar says that he had always planned to come to the United States. He did not make any effort to obtain a visa to come to the United States from Peru. He met Carmen, his now wife, in Maracaibo while on line at the United States Embassy to request the visa, and they traveled together to the United States in February 1994. They were admitted as visitors for pleasure and authorized to stay until August 1994. Salazar never sought asylum in Ecuador, Colombia, or Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carmen and Aldo Salazar were married in the United States. Salazar's asylum application is dated April 13, 1994. Salazar and his wife left the United States twice after the submission of the application. They traveled to Venezuela on August 11, 1994 and returned to the United States a day later. They again traveled to Venezuela on February 10, 1995 and returned to the United States on February 26, 1995. On both trips, Salazar was readmitted to Venezuela as a Venezuelan resident. He testified that he showed the authorities his passport and they admitted him \"with the residence that [he has].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, the Shining Path killed Salazar's uncle, Antonio Salazar Contreras, who was a farmer and who lived near what used to be the Salazar family farm. The evidence that Shining Path was responsible for the murder, Salazar explained, was \"the way he died because he was tortured\" and strangled and \"[t]hey left some papers, warnings, saying that this is the way the people are going to die if they don't let, leave their properties.\" Salazar said that his uncle was killed \"[b]ecause he was there and he was still maintaining his property.\" Salazar believes that he would be in danger in Peru \"because my family, my brothers and myself who were declared enemies of that Shining Path and we were threatened if we return.\" The threats were made on a \"few occasions when we were there. Because we were in farm, we tried to defend ourselves and because of that, they put us in the black list.\" Salazar believes that the Shining Path declared his family to be enemies \"because we ... did not want to leave our property and I think it was more because we always tried for the police to protect us.\" Salazar said he had only one instance of personal contact with members of Shining Path. He testified, \"I was walking ... and I saw armed men and they asked me some things and that was it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar's parents and three of his siblings still reside in Peru. His other four surviving siblings live in the United States. According to a year 2000 country condition report, the Shining Path is still operating in Peru and is still responsible for numerous murders. The threat from the Shining Path has declined, though, and Salazar admitted that he was aware that Peru's government had captured a number of Shining Path leaders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 31, 1999, the INS issued Aldo and Carmen Salazar notices to appear, charging them as deportable for having remained in the United States longer than authorized. The Salazars conceded deportability and sought asylum and withholding of deportation. The IJ found that Salazar has the status of a resident in Venezuela and so was \"firmly resettled\" under 8 C.F.R. 208.15 and ineligible for asylum. The IJ also held that Salazar had otherwise failed to establish asylum eligibility. The IJ found that although Salazar was at one time a member of a landowning family targeted by the Shining Path, he had ceased to be within that targeted social group when his family sold their property, moved, and safely resided elsewhere in Peru. Salazar's fear of persecution, the IJ determined, was not well-founded, and there was no basis for concluding that he would face a risk of harm in Peru on account of any asylum-eligible category. The IJ denied Salazar's application and granted him voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed without opinion, and Salazar filed this petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien applicant \"if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of [8 U.S.C.] section 1101(a)(42)(A).\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1).

First, there is the question whether the alien is \"firmly resettled\" within the meaning of the regulation. <i>See Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 331-32. The government bears some initial burden of showing firm resettlement. <i>See id.</i> at 331-32. The case law treats this showing made by the government as creating a rebuttable presumption,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>see id.; Cheo v. INS,</i> 162 F.3d 1227, 1229-30 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Abdalla v. INS,</i> 43 F.3d 1397, 1399 (10th Cir.1994), which the alien can overcome on showing otherwise \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(c)(2)(ii). Second, if the alien fails to rebut the presumption, there is the question whether the alien can show that he falls within either exception (a) or exception (b). <i>See Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 332. The alien bears the burden on both exceptions. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.15; <i>see Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not previously addressed the \"firm resettlement\" bar in &#167; 208.15. It seems clear that the government may make its initial showing of firm resettlement by producing evidence that the resettling country's government formally and affirmatively offered the alien permanent resettlement, a term which includes &#8212; but is potentially more expansive than &#8212; offers of citizenship or permanent residence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the instant case, the government readily met its burden by pointing to a facially valid government offer of permanent residence: the Venezuelan residency stamp on the Salazar passports, as well as uncontroverted evidence that the Venezuelan government twice honored that stamp when the Salazars made return trips to Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the government satisfied the requisite initial showing, the burden shifted to the Salazars to rebut the presumption created by the government's initial presentation of firm resettlement and/or to accept the conclusion of firm resettlement but show he was within either of the two exceptions to the \"firm resettlement\" bar set forth in &#167; 208.15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ considered Salazar's testimony that he paid an unidentified person to obtain the resident stamp on his behalf. Even accepting the testimony, Salazar produced no evidence that, beyond mere payment for the stamp, the stamp was not valid or that any irregularities would result in the eventual invalidation of the stamp by the Venezuelan government. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to persuade &#8212; let alone compel &#8212; the IJ to discount the facial validity of the resident stamp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Salazars adduced <i>no</i> evidence of any \"non-offer-based elements\" which would <i>compel</i> a finding by the IJ that they had rebutted the government's <i>prima facie</i> showing. The evidence shows that Salazar lived in Venezuela for more than a year, obtained employment, and rented an apartment. Further, Ms. Salazar's Venezuelan citizenship suggests that Salazar established enduring familial ties in Venezuela, an inference that is further confirmed by the Salazars' two return trips to Venezuela. Given this record, it simply cannot be said that the IJ's decision that there was firm resettlement was unsupported by \"substantial evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next is the question whether petitioner has shown he is within either of the two exceptions, parts (a) and (b) of &#167; 208.15. <i>See Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 332. To fit within the second exception, an alien must show that the conditions of his residence in the third country \"were so substantially and consciously restricted by the authority of [that] country\" that he was not in fact resettled. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.15(b). There is no basis for concluding &#8212; and petitioner's counsel does not argue otherwise &#8212; that Salazar fits within this exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only the exception in (a). To fit within the first exception, an alien must satisfy <i>each</i> of three prongs. The alien must show (1) that his entry into the third country was a \"necessary consequence of his ... flight from persecution,\" (2) that he remained there \"only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel, <i>and</i>\" (3) that he \"did not establish significant ties in that country.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 208.15(a) (emphasis added). Salazar plainly failed to provide any evidence to meet the second prong, that he remained in Venezuela \"only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel.\" Under the regulation, &#167; 208.15, it was Salazar's burden to establish this point. He did not. Salazar did say at the hearing that he stayed in Colombia for only two months and worked there in order to be able to continue with his trip. But he did not offer a similar explanation for the fourteen months he spent in Venezuela. As a result, the IJ's holding that Salazar was firmly resettled in Venezuela, affirmed by the BIA, must stand. Since firm resettlement is a bar to asylum, we need not address whether Salazar met the burden to prove past persecution in Peru pursuant to &#167; 208.13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although firm resettlement is, by regulation, a bar to the grant of asylum, we have found no statute or regulation that bars the relief of withholding of deportation on the basis of firm resettlement. While this omission may strike some as odd, the firm resettlement finding does have practical implications here. We consider the withholding of deportation claim independently, as have other circuits. <i>See Cheo,</i> 162 F.3d at 1229-30; <i>Vang v. INS,</i> 146 F.3d 1114, 1116-17 (9th Cir.1997); <i>Abdalla,</i> 43 F.3d at 1399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two salient distinctions between asylum and withholding of deportation. First, the alien must meet a higher standard to show withholding of deportation. He must show that, upon deportation, he is <i>more likely than not</i> to face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>INS v. Stevic,</i> 467 U.S. 407, 424, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). If a court upholds a denial of asylum, the application for withholding of removal necessarily fails. Second, even if the criteria for asylum are met, the decision as to relief is discretionary. But if the criteria for withholding of deportation are met, the grant of relief is mandatory. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 419-20, 119 S.Ct. 1439. We engage in substantial evidence review for withholding of deportation, the same standard as for asylum. We have not in this case addressed the propriety of the denial of asylum based on grounds other than firm resettlement and do not do so now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ ordered deportation to Peru, but also permitted voluntary departure. The finding of firm resettlement more than suggests that the Salazars may voluntarily depart to Venezuela, whose residence permit their passports bear. Salazar has not shown that he cannot return to Venezuela, much less that he would more likely than not face persecution in Venezuela on one of the five grounds. Nor has he shown that Venezuela would forceably repatriate him to Peru. As such, the finding of firm resettlement provided sufficient evidence to support the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner argues that it was improper for the BIA to adopt the IJ's decision without rendering its own opinion. The argument is frivolous. It is well established that \"if the Board's view is that the IJ `got it right,' the law does not demand that the Board go through the idle motions of dressing the IJ's findings in its own prose.\" <i>Chen v. INS,</i> 87 F.3d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir.1996) (noting this court's agreement with eight other circuits that, \"having given individualized consideration to a particular case, [the BIA] may simply state that it affirms the IJ's decision for the reasons set forth in that decision\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The denial of petitioner's application for asylum and withholding of removal is <i>affirmed.</i> The order granting voluntary departure stands.

The Salazars are apparently hardworking members of their community; they have many supporters and present a sympathetic case.

We must deny the petition for review because firm resettlement in a third country is a mandatory bar to the granting of asylum. This marks our first occasion to address the firm resettlement doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found Salazar's testimony credible. We describe the historical facts as Salazar recounted them at his hearing and in his application for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar asserts that he would be in danger if returned to Peru because of the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, which has operated in Peru for over twenty years. The Shining Path opposes landowners and seeks to destroy farm ownership arrangements. Its members, Salazar explained, \"do not want [those who] have money to exist.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar's father owned a 103 acre farm in San Jos&#233;, Peru on which the family raised cattle for milking. In 1984, the Shining Path destroyed the nearest neighboring farm and damaged the Salazar farm. In response to that attack and to the Shining Path's announcement of its intent to \"destroy the rest of the people that continue having properties\" and \"redistribute the wealth to everybody,\" Salazar's father \"sold a great piece of the land\" and sold many of the animals. He also resigned in 1984 as a rural judge, a position that he had held for a few years. No one else in the Salazar family held any political or official positions. In 1986, the Shining Path stole many of the Salazars's remaining horses, cows, and sheep, as well as most of their food supply. From that point, the Shining Path constantly harassed the Salazar family &#8212; coming to the farm and disturbing them at all different hours and distributing their land to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the threat from the Shining Path, the Salazar family began to abandon the farm in 1989. Gilmer Salazar, petitioner's older brother, did not leave the farm and was killed when the Shining Path dynamited the Salazar house in 1990. The rest of the family scattered throughout Peru, and petitioner's parents moved to Trujillo, where they constantly changed their names and tried not to go out in public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar himself traveled around Peru trying to stay far away from danger. He first went to Lima for one year, then traveled in the south of Peru for half a year because of terrorism in Lima, and then moved to the west of Peru. He did not want to leave Peru and remained there until July or August 1992 when he decided that he had to leave because of the danger. He left Peru, entered Ecuador, and stayed for a very brief time. He then moved on to Colombia, where he stayed for two months and worked to have money to continue with his trip. In October or November 1992, he traveled to Venezuela and entered the country illegally. He lived in Venezuela for at least fourteen months, worked there, and rented an apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Venezuelan passport was issued to Salazar on November 29, 1993. Salazar explained that he needed to be a Venezuelan resident to obtain a visa to the United States, and that \"I met a man in Venezuela that told me that he could arrange [to have a resident stamp placed on my passport] for me if I paid him something.\" Salazar paid, a resident stamp was placed in his passport, and in December 1993 he applied for and received a visa from the United States Embassy to enter this country as a visitor for pleasure. Salazar says that he had always planned to come to the United States. He did not make any effort to obtain a visa to come to the United States from Peru. He met Carmen, his now wife, in Maracaibo while on line at the United States Embassy to request the visa, and they traveled together to the United States in February 1994. They were admitted as visitors for pleasure and authorized to stay until August 1994. Salazar never sought asylum in Ecuador, Colombia, or Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carmen and Aldo Salazar were married in the United States. Salazar's asylum application is dated April 13, 1994. Salazar and his wife left the United States twice after the submission of the application. They traveled to Venezuela on August 11, 1994 and returned to the United States a day later. They again traveled to Venezuela on February 10, 1995 and returned to the United States on February 26, 1995. On both trips, Salazar was readmitted to Venezuela as a Venezuelan resident. He testified that he showed the authorities his passport and they admitted him \"with the residence that [he has].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, the Shining Path killed Salazar's uncle, Antonio Salazar Contreras, who was a farmer and who lived near what used to be the Salazar family farm. The evidence that Shining Path was responsible for the murder, Salazar explained, was \"the way he died because he was tortured\" and strangled and \"[t]hey left some papers, warnings, saying that this is the way the people are going to die if they don't let, leave their properties.\" Salazar said that his uncle was killed \"[b]ecause he was there and he was still maintaining his property.\" Salazar believes that he would be in danger in Peru \"because my family, my brothers and myself who were declared enemies of that Shining Path and we were threatened if we return.\" The threats were made on a \"few occasions when we were there. Because we were in farm, we tried to defend ourselves and because of that, they put us in the black list.\" Salazar believes that the Shining Path declared his family to be enemies \"because we ... did not want to leave our property and I think it was more because we always tried for the police to protect us.\" Salazar said he had only one instance of personal contact with members of Shining Path. He testified, \"I was walking ... and I saw armed men and they asked me some things and that was it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salazar's parents and three of his siblings still reside in Peru. His other four surviving siblings live in the United States. According to a year 2000 country condition report, the Shining Path is still operating in Peru and is still responsible for numerous murders. The threat from the Shining Path has declined, though, and Salazar admitted that he was aware that Peru's government had captured a number of Shining Path leaders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 31, 1999, the INS issued Aldo and Carmen Salazar notices to appear, charging them as deportable for having remained in the United States longer than authorized. The Salazars conceded deportability and sought asylum and withholding of deportation. The IJ found that Salazar has the status of a resident in Venezuela and so was \"firmly resettled\" under 8 C.F.R. 208.15 and ineligible for asylum. The IJ also held that Salazar had otherwise failed to establish asylum eligibility. The IJ found that although Salazar was at one time a member of a landowning family targeted by the Shining Path, he had ceased to be within that targeted social group when his family sold their property, moved, and safely resided elsewhere in Peru. Salazar's fear of persecution, the IJ determined, was not well-founded, and there was no basis for concluding that he would face a risk of harm in Peru on account of any asylum-eligible category. The IJ denied Salazar's application and granted him voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed without opinion, and Salazar filed this petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien applicant \"if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of [8 U.S.C.] section 1101(a)(42)(A).\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1).

Second, if the alien fails to rebut the presumption, there is the question whether the alien can show that he falls within either exception (a) or exception (b). <i>See Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 332. The alien bears the burden on both exceptions. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.15; <i>see Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not previously addressed the \"firm resettlement\" bar in &#167; 208.15. It seems clear that the government may make its initial showing of firm resettlement by producing evidence that the resettling country's government formally and affirmatively offered the alien permanent resettlement, a term which includes &#8212; but is potentially more expansive than &#8212; offers of citizenship or permanent residence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the instant case, the government readily met its burden by pointing to a facially valid government offer of permanent residence: the Venezuelan residency stamp on the Salazar passports, as well as uncontroverted evidence that the Venezuelan government twice honored that stamp when the Salazars made return trips to Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the government satisfied the requisite initial showing, the burden shifted to the Salazars to rebut the presumption created by the government's initial presentation of firm resettlement and/or to accept the conclusion of firm resettlement but show he was within either of the two exceptions to the \"firm resettlement\" bar set forth in &#167; 208.15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ considered Salazar's testimony that he paid an unidentified person to obtain the resident stamp on his behalf. Even accepting the testimony, Salazar produced no evidence that, beyond mere payment for the stamp, the stamp was not valid or that any irregularities would result in the eventual invalidation of the stamp by the Venezuelan government. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to persuade &#8212; let alone compel &#8212; the IJ to discount the facial validity of the resident stamp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Salazars adduced <i>no</i> evidence of any \"non-offer-based elements\" which would <i>compel</i> a finding by the IJ that they had rebutted the government's <i>prima facie</i> showing. The evidence shows that Salazar lived in Venezuela for more than a year, obtained employment, and rented an apartment. Further, Ms. Salazar's Venezuelan citizenship suggests that Salazar established enduring familial ties in Venezuela, an inference that is further confirmed by the Salazars' two return trips to Venezuela. Given this record, it simply cannot be said that the IJ's decision that there was firm resettlement was unsupported by \"substantial evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next is the question whether petitioner has shown he is within either of the two exceptions, parts (a) and (b) of &#167; 208.15. <i>See Mussie,</i> 172 F.3d at 332. To fit within the second exception, an alien must show that the conditions of his residence in the third country \"were so substantially and consciously restricted by the authority of [that] country\" that he was not in fact resettled. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.15(b). There is no basis for concluding &#8212; and petitioner's counsel does not argue otherwise &#8212; that Salazar fits within this exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves only the exception in (a). To fit within the first exception, an alien must satisfy <i>each</i> of three prongs. The alien must show (1) that his entry into the third country was a \"necessary consequence of his ... flight from persecution,\" (2) that he remained there \"only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel, <i>and</i>\" (3) that he \"did not establish significant ties in that country.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 208.15(a) (emphasis added). Salazar plainly failed to provide any evidence to meet the second prong, that he remained in Venezuela \"only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel.\" Under the regulation, &#167; 208.15, it was Salazar's burden to establish this point. He did not. Salazar did say at the hearing that he stayed in Colombia for only two months and worked there in order to be able to continue with his trip. But he did not offer a similar explanation for the fourteen months he spent in Venezuela. As a result, the IJ's holding that Salazar was firmly resettled in Venezuela, affirmed by the BIA, must stand. Since firm resettlement is a bar to asylum, we need not address whether Salazar met the burden to prove past persecution in Peru pursuant to &#167; 208.13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although firm resettlement is, by regulation, a bar to the grant of asylum, we have found no statute or regulation that bars the relief of withholding of deportation on the basis of firm resettlement. While this omission may strike some as odd, the firm resettlement finding does have practical implications here. We consider the withholding of deportation claim independently, as have other circuits. <i>See Cheo,</i> 162 F.3d at 1229-30; <i>Vang v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755345\"><a href=\"/opinion/755345/dao-vang-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span>, 1116-17 (9th Cir.1997); <i>Abdalla,</i> 43 F.3d at 1399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two salient distinctions between asylum and withholding of deportation. First, the alien must meet a higher standard to show withholding of deportation. He must show that, upon deportation, he is <i>more likely than not</i> to face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>INS v. Stevic,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111203\"><a href=\"/opinion/111203/ins-v-stevic/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>, 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111203\"><a href=\"/opinion/111203/ins-v-stevic/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span> (1984). If a court upholds a denial of asylum, the application for withholding of removal necessarily fails. Second, even if the criteria for asylum are met, the decision as to relief is discretionary. But if the criteria for withholding of deportation are met, the grant of relief is mandatory. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 419-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>. We engage in substantial evidence review for withholding of deportation, the same standard as for asylum. We have not in this case addressed the propriety of the denial of asylum based on grounds other than firm resettlement and do not do so now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ ordered deportation to Peru, but also permitted voluntary departure. The finding of firm resettlement more than suggests that the Salazars may voluntarily depart to Venezuela, whose residence permit their passports bear. Salazar has not shown that he cannot return to Venezuela, much less that he would more likely than not face persecution in Venezuela on one of the five grounds. Nor has he shown that Venezuela would forceably repatriate him to Peru. As such, the finding of firm resettlement provided sufficient evidence to support the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner argues that it was improper for the BIA to adopt the IJ's decision without rendering its own opinion. The argument is frivolous.
