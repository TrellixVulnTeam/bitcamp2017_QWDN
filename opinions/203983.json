Defendant-Appellant Jamont Dubose\n\nchallenges       the   district    court’s     denial     of    his   motion    to\n\nsuppress evidence found when he was stopped and frisked by\n\nthe police.         After the district court denied his motion to\n\nsuppress, Dubose pled guilty to being a felon in possession\n\nof a firearm, but preserved his right to appeal the denial\n\nof his motion to suppress.           This timely appeal followed.\n\n       Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\n\nwe AFFIRM.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       “We relate the facts ‘as the trial court found them,\n\nconsistent with record support.’”                 United States v. Am, 564\n\nF.3d    25,   27    (1st    Cir.   2009)    (quoting      United      States    v.\n\nRuidíaz, 529 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2008)).                  In the afternoon\n\nof February 22, 2007, two Boston Police Officers, Officers\n\nCanuto     and      Ryan,    witnessed     a      Camry   double-parked         on\n\nFairmount Street, near the corner with Washington Street.\n\nShortly thereafter, the officers observed Jamont Dubose walk\n\ndown    Washington      Street,     turn     on    Fairmount      Street,      and\n\napproach      the   Camry.     Dubose      then    leaned      into   the   front\n\ndriver’s side of the Camry and, with both hands and his\n\nupper torso inside the vehicle, had a brief encounter with\n\nits occupants.         He then turned around and walked back the\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\fway he came.          Because of the location of the car and the\n\nconfiguration of the streets, Dubose could not have seen the\n\nCamry    on    Fairmount         Street    from   where    he    was     walking    on\n\nWashington Street.              Therefore, Officer Canuto concluded that\n\nthis was a pre-arranged meeting.                   Given the brief nature of\n\nthe meeting, the fact that it appeared to have been pre-\n\narranged,       and       the     fact    that    this     encounter       fit     the\n\ndescription          of    drug     transactions         that    had     previously\n\noccurred in the area 1 , the officers thought that they may\n\nhave witnessed a drug transaction.\n\n    Their       suspicions         aroused,       Officers      Canuto    and    Ryan\n\ndecided to question Dubose.                 They turned their car around,\n\nparked at an angle facing the wrong way on the street, and\n\nwith their badges displayed, began walking towards Dubose.\n\nOfficer       Ryan    soon      became    sidetracked      speaking      with    some\n\npedestrian bystanders, so Officer Canuto approached Dubose\n\nalone.    Officer Canuto stated that, as he approached Dubose,\n\nwho was walking away with his right hand in his sweatshirt\n\npocket, he said, “Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you for a\n\nsecond?”       (Appx. at 10, 52, 95.)              Initially, Dubose ignored\n\n\n    1\n       Although brief pre-arranged drug transactions were\nfairly common in this area, the district court explicitly\nfound that this area was not a “hot spot” of criminal\nactivity at that time.      However, Officer Canuto had\npreviously made arrests in the area and a shooting had\noccurred there about four months before the events leading\nto this case.\n\n                                          - 3 -\n\fhim    and    kept    walking.         However,      after    Officer   Canuto\n\nrepeated the question in an increasingly loud voice a few\n\nmore    times,      Dubose,     with   his     right   hand    still    in    his\n\nsweatshirt pocket, turned around and faced Officer Canuto.\n\nConcerned that Dubose might have a firearm in his pocket,\n\nOfficer Canuto told him to remove his hand from his pocket.\n\nDubose initially refused to do so but, after Canuto repeated\n\nhis order a number of times, Dubose “reluctantly complied”\n\nwith Officer Canuto’s demands.                 (Appx. at 11.)      Because of\n\nDubose’s reluctance to remove his hand from his pocket, his\n\nnervous demeanor, and Officer Canuto’s prior experience with\n\ndrug dealers who often carry weapons, Officer Canuto decided\n\nto conduct a pat-frisk of Dubose’s sweatshirt pockets.\n\n       As    he    patted     Dubose’s     sweatshirt,        Officer   Canuto\n\nimmediately noticed a hard object that he suspected might be\n\na firearm and asked, “What is this?”                   (Id. at 69.)     Dubose\n\nresponded,        “It’s   not   mine.”       (Id.)     Officer   Canuto      then\n\nreached into the pocket and retrieved a loaded .22 caliber\n\nrevolver.         Officer Canuto alerted Officer Ryan that he had\n\nretrieved a firearm.            Dubose then attempted to flee and,\n\nafter a brief foot chase, the officers subdued him.                     As the\n\nofficers were arresting him, Dubose stated, “I just found it\n\nand picked it up.”          (Id. at 11.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 4 -\n\f    In   September      2007,    a    grand    jury    indicted      Dubose   for\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   922(g)(1),    and       charged   that,       if    convicted,   his\n\nfirearm would be subject to the forfeiture provisions of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(d) and 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c).                         Dubose filed a\n\nmotion to suppress the evidence found during his encounter\n\nwith the police, arguing that the search and seizure that\n\nled to the recovery of the firearm in his possession were\n\nconducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United\n\nStates   Constitution     and    Article       14     of   the    Massachusetts\n\nDeclaration of Rights. 2         In March 2008, the district court\n\nissued   a    written     opinion       denying       Dubose’s       motion    to\n\nsuppress.     In June 2008, Dubose notified the court of his\n\nintent to enter a conditional plea of guilty to Count I of\n\nthe indictment, expressly preserving his ability to appeal\n\nthe district court’s denial of his motion to suppress.                        See\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).              On October 2, 2008, the court\n\n\n\n    2\n       Although Dubose also mentions the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights in his opening brief, he fails to\nactually quote the Declaration or any cases interpreting the\nrelevant portion of that document. Instead, the substantive\nportions of his brief are focused exclusively on his federal\nconstitutional  challenge   to  the  admissibility   of  the\nevidence in this case. Following Dubose’s lead, this court\nwill address only the federal constitutional issues in this\ncase.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990) (stating that, on appeal, “issues adverted to in\na perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived”).\n\n                                      - 5 -\n\fentered     judgment       against        Dubose        on        Count   I   of     the\n\nindictment, and sentenced him to 180 months’ imprisonment.\n\nThis timely appeal, challenging the order denying his motion\n\nto suppress as well as the judgment and sentence, was filed\n\non October 8, 2008.\n\nII.

[This] court reviews\n\na     district     court’s        findings       of     fact       and    credibility\n\ndeterminations on a suppression motion for clear error and\n\nits conclusions of law de novo.”                  United States v. Andrade,\n\n551 F.3d 103, 109 (1st Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).                                “We\n\nrecount    the     facts     in    the    light        most       favorable   to     the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling on the motion to suppress, but only\n\nto the extent that they have support in the record and are\n\nnot clearly erroneous.”             United States v. Holloway, 499 F.3d\n\n114, 115 (1st Cir. 2007); see also United States v. Cook,\n\n277 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2002) (“We construe the record in\n\nthe light most favorable to the district court’s ruling,\n\ndrawing reasonable inferences in the government’s favor.”);\n\nUnited    States     v.

Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nB.   Dubose Was Seized\n\n     A    person    is    seized   when     the    police      restrain   that\n\nperson’s liberty.         Holloway, 499 F.3d at 117.             The Supreme\n\nCourt has distinguished two kinds of restraint: physical or\n\na verbal “show of authority” that would compel a reasonable\n\nperson to comply.         California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621,\n\n626 (1991).        Physical force alone is a seizure.                  Id. at\n\n624-25.      But   when    an   officer    makes    a   show    of   authority\n\ninstead, the person is not seized until the person submits\n\nto the show of authority by complying with the officer’s\n\ninstruction.       Id.; Holloway, 499 F.3d at 117.                    Once the\n\nperson complies, his liberty has been restrained and he is\n\nseized under the Fourth Amendment.            United States v. Sealey,\n\n30 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n     When Officer Canuto first approached Dubose, he said,\n\n“Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you for a second?”                       (Appx.\n\nat 10, 52, 95.)           Initially, Dubose ignored him and kept\n\nwalking, but after Officer Canuto repeated the question in\n\nan increasingly loud voice, Dubose, with his hand in his\n\nsweatshirt    pocket,      stopped    and    turned      to    face    Officer\n\n\n                                   - 7 -\n\fCanuto.     Office Canuto several times ordered Dubose to take\n\nhis hand out of his pocket because the officer feared Dubose\n\nmight have a gun.          Dubose initially refused to comply, but\n\nafter several such commands by Officer Canuto, eventually he\n\ncomplied.\n\n    We need not get excessively embroiled in whether the\n\nseizure occurred when Dubose stopped walking and turned to\n\nface Officer Canuto or whether it occurred a few seconds\n\nlater    when    he    removed   his     hand    from    his   sweatshirt      in\n\nresponse to Officer Canuto’s command.                    Only a few seconds\n\nelapsed during this interaction which is best analyzed as a\n\nsingle ongoing encounter that should be viewed holistically,\n\nrather than bifurcated into artificially small increments.\n\n    We have no difficulty concluding that by the time Dubose\n\nhad complied with Officer Canuto’s demand that he stop and\n\nremove his hand from his sweatshirt pocket, there had been\n\na seizure.\n\nC.    Dubose’s Seizure Was Justified by the Officers’\nReasonable and Articulable Suspicion of Criminal Activity\n\n    “A     law   enforcement      officer       ordinarily     may   not   stop\n\nsomeone and restrain his freedom to walk away unless the\n\nofficer    has     a    reasonable     and      articulable    suspicion       of\n\ncriminal     activity.”          Cook,    277     F.3d    at   85    (internal\n\nquotations omitted).         The seizure in this case was justified\n\nbecause,    when       Officer   Canuto      seized     Dubose,     he   had   “a\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\freasonable       and     articulable        suspicion”              that       Dubose     had\n\nengaged in criminal activity.\n\n    Officer Canuto testified that he became suspicious of\n\nDubose because of the brief nature of his meeting with the\n\noccupants of the Camry, the fact that their meeting appeared\n\nto be pre-arranged, the fact that Dubose leaned his entire\n\nupper body into the car during the interaction, and that\n\nDubose’s    conduct      was     similar       to       the    conduct         involved    in\n\nother drug transactions in the area.                           While there may have\n\nbeen an entirely innocent explanation for Dubose’s conduct,\n\nOfficer Canuto is a six-year veteran of the Boston Police\n\nDepartment,       and    we    owe   a    measure             of    deference        to   his\n\nexpertise    in    interpreting          the   events          in    this      case.      See\n\nRuidíaz, 529 F.3d at 29 (stating that the determination of\n\nreasonable       suspicion       “requires          a    practical,            commonsense\n\ndetermination—a         determination          that       entails          a    measurable\n\ndegree of deference to the perceptions of experienced law\n\nenforcement officers”) (citation omitted); United States v.\n\nTrullo,    809    F.2d    108,    112     (1st      Cir.       1987)      (deferring       to\n\npolice     officer’s       conclusion          that       defendant            was   acting\n\nsuspiciously when he sat in his car, engaged in a brief\n\nconversation       with       another      individual               who     subsequently\n\nentered the defendant’s car, then drove with this individual\n\nto a nearby deserted side street where they engaged in a\n\n\n                                         - 9 -\n\ffurther    conversation,           and   the    individual          then   exited    the\n\ndefendant’s car and went back in the direction the defendant\n\nhad just driven). 3\n\n     Further, Dubose’s initial refusal to remove his hand\n\nfrom his pocket after having been ordered to do so provided\n\nadditional       substantiation          of    Officer     Canuto’s        suspicion.\n\nThere    is     no    doubt    that      Officer       Canuto        had   reasonable\n\nsuspicion to seize Dubose.\n\nD.   Officer Canuto’s Search of Dubose Was Appropriate\n\n     After Officer Canuto succeeded in seizing Dubose, he\n\ndecided    to    conduct       a   pat-down       search       of    Dubose’s   outer\n\nclothing.       Officer Canuto’s limited search of Dubose’s outer\n\nclothing      was     justified       by      legitimate       concerns      for     his\n\nsafety.\n\n     Officer Canuto testified that after Dubose turned around\n\nwith his hand still in his pocket, he became fearful that\n\nDubose was carrying a weapon.                   He stated that drug dealers\n\noften    carry       weapons   concealed          in   their    waistbands,         and,\n\n\n\n     3\n      Of course, we will not blindly adhere to an officer’s\nassertion that certain conduct appeared suspicious.      See\nRivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 264 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting\nthat relying exclusively on a police officer’s experience to\ndetermine whether a seizure was justified by reasonable\nsuspicion “would effectively transform the police officer\ninto a judge, and the court into a rubber stamp”). However,\nan officer’s expertise in interpreting criminal conduct is\ncertainly a factor in this court’s determination of\nreasonable suspicion.\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\fbecause that is not a very secure position for a gun, they\n\noften keep their hands in their pockets to ensure the gun\n\ndoes not fall down.          Officer Canuto’s concerns were further\n\ncompounded by Dubose’s initial refusal to remove his hand\n\nfrom    his     pocket,     and    Dubose’s      nervousness        during      this\n\nencounter.       The combination of Dubose’s interaction with the\n\nCamry’s    occupants,       his    initial       refusal       to   heed   Officer\n\nCanuto’s order to remove his hand from his pocket, and his\n\nnervousness       during     his    encounter          with    Officer     Canuto,\n\ntogether with Officer Canuto’s experience in dealing with\n\ndrug transactions that often involve guns, were sufficient\n\nto    justify    a   pat-down      of    Dubose’s      outer    clothing.        See\n\nTrullo, 809 F.2d at 113-14 (holding that protective frisk\n\nwas justified when officers had reasonable suspicion that\n\ndefendant had engaged in an illegal drug transaction, the\n\nofficers’     experience      showed      that       people   engaging     in   drug\n\ncrimes often carried firearms, and the officers noticed a\n\nbulge in the defendant’s pocket); United States v. Harris,\n\n313 F.3d 1228, 1236 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that officer\n\nwas    justified       in    conducting          a     protective      frisk      of\n\ndefendant’s clothing primarily because “[d]efendant refused\n\nto take his hands out of his pockets after [police officer]\n\nrequested that he do so”); see also United States v.

After the district court denied his motion to suppress, Dubose pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, but preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p>Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>\"We relate the facts `as the trial court found them, consistent with record support.'\" <i>United States v. Am,</i> 564 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2008)). In the afternoon of February 22, 2007, two Boston Police Officers, Officers Canuto and Ryan, witnessed a Camry double-parked on Fairmount Street, near the corner with Washington Street. Shortly thereafter, the officers observed Jamont Dubose walk down Washington Street, turn on Fairmount Street, and approach the Camry. Dubose then leaned into the front driver's side of the Camry and, with both hands and his upper torso inside the vehicle, had a brief encounter with its occupants. He then turned around and walked back the way he came. Because of the location of the car and the configuration of the streets, Dubose could not have seen the Camry on Fairmount Street from where he was walking on Washington Street. Therefore, Officer Canuto concluded that this was a pre-arranged meeting. Given the brief nature of the meeting, the fact that it appeared to have been pre-arranged, and the fact that this encounter fit the description of drug transactions that had previously occurred in the area<sup>[1]</sup>, the officers thought that they may have witnessed a drug transaction.</p>\n<p>Their suspicions aroused, Officers Canuto and Ryan decided to question Dubose. They turned their car around, parked at an angle facing the wrong way on the street, and with their badges displayed, began walking towards Dubose. Officer Ryan soon became sidetracked speaking with some pedestrian bystanders, so Officer Canuto approached Dubose alone. Officer Canuto stated that, as he approached Dubose, who was walking away with his right hand in his sweatshirt pocket, he said, \"Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you for a second?\" (Appx. at 10, 52, 95.) Initially, Dubose ignored him and kept walking. However, after Officer Canuto repeated the question in an increasingly loud voice a few more times, Dubose, with his right hand still in his sweatshirt pocket, turned around and faced Officer Canuto. Concerned that Dubose might have a firearm in his pocket, Officer Canuto told him to remove his hand from his pocket. Dubose initially refused to do so but, after Canuto repeated his order a number of times, Dubose \"reluctantly complied\" with Officer Canuto's demands. (Appx. at 11.) Because of Dubose's reluctance to remove his hand from his pocket, his nervous demeanor, and Officer Canuto's prior experience with drug dealers who often carry weapons, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> Officer Canuto decided to conduct a pat-frisk of Dubose's sweatshirt pockets.</p>\n<p>As he patted Dubose's sweatshirt, Officer Canuto immediately noticed a hard object that he suspected might be a firearm and asked, \"What is this?\" (<i>Id.</i> at 69.) Dubose responded, \"It's not mine.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Officer Canuto then reached into the pocket and retrieved a loaded .22 caliber revolver. Officer Canuto alerted Officer Ryan that he had retrieved a firearm. Dubose then attempted to flee and, after a brief foot chase, the officers subdued him. As the officers were arresting him, Dubose stated, \"I just found it and picked it up.\" (<i>Id.</i> at 11.)</p>\n<p>In September 2007, a grand jury indicted Dubose for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and charged that, if convicted, his firearm would be subject to the forfeiture provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(d) and 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c). Dubose filed a motion to suppress the evidence found during his encounter with the police, arguing that the search and seizure that led to the recovery of the firearm in his possession were conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<sup>[2]</sup> In March 2008, the district court issued a written opinion denying Dubose's motion to suppress. In June 2008, Dubose notified the court of his intent to enter a conditional plea of guilty to Count I of the indictment, expressly preserving his ability to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). On October 2, 2008, the court entered judgment against Dubose on Count I of the indictment, and sentenced him to 180 months' imprisonment. This timely appeal, challenging the order denying his motion to suppress as well as the judgment and sentence, was filed on October 8, 2008.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>\"This court applies a mixed standard of review for orders granting or denying suppression. [This] court reviews a district court's findings of fact and credibility determinations on a suppression motion for clear error and its conclusions of law <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>United States v. Andrade,</i> 551 F.3d 103, 109 (1st Cir.2008) (citation omitted). \"We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's ruling on the motion to suppress, but only to the extent that they have support in the record and are not clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Holloway,</i> 499 F.3d 114, 115 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir.2002) (\"We construe the record in the light most favorable to the district court's ruling, drawing reasonable inferences in the government's favor.\"); <i>United States v. Nee,</i> 261 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir.2001) (explaining that \"[t]his deferential standard requires that an appellate court exhibit great respect for the presider's opportunity to hear the testimony, observe the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand\") (quoting <i>United States v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Dubose Was Seized</h2>\n<p>A person is seized when the police restrain that person's liberty. <i>Holloway,</i> 499 F.3d at 117. The Supreme Court has distinguished two kinds of restraint: physical or a verbal \"show of authority\" that would compel a reasonable person to comply. <i>California v. Hodari D.,</i> 499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991). Physical force alone is a seizure. <i>Id.</i> at 624-25, 111 S.Ct. 1547. But when an officer makes a show of authority instead, the person is not seized until the person submits to the show of authority by complying with the officer's instruction. <i>Id.; </i><i>Holloway,</i> 499 F.3d at 117. Once the person complies, his liberty has been restrained and he is seized under the Fourth Amendment. <i>United States v. Sealey,</i> 30 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>When Officer Canuto first approached Dubose, he said, \"Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you for a second?\" (Appx. at 10, 52, 95.) Initially, Dubose ignored him and kept walking, but after Officer Canuto repeated the question in an increasingly loud voice, Dubose, with his hand in his sweatshirt pocket, stopped and turned to face Officer Canuto. Office Canuto several times ordered Dubose to take his hand out of his pocket because the officer feared Dubose might have a gun. Dubose initially refused to comply, but after several such commands by Officer Canuto, eventually he complied.</p>\n<p>We need not get excessively embroiled in whether the seizure occurred when Dubose stopped walking and turned to face Officer Canuto or whether it occurred a few seconds later when he removed his hand from his sweatshirt in response to Officer Canuto's command. Only a few seconds elapsed during this interaction which is best analyzed as a single ongoing encounter that should be viewed holistically, rather than bifurcated into artificially small increments.</p>\n<p>We have no difficulty concluding that by the time Dubose had complied with Officer Canuto's demand that he stop and remove his hand from his sweatshirt pocket, there had been a seizure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Dubose's Seizure Was Justified by the Officers' Reasonable and Articulable Suspicion of Criminal Activity</h2>\n<p>\"A law enforcement officer ordinarily may not stop someone and restrain his freedom to walk away unless the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.\" <i>Cook,</i> 277 F.3d at 85 (internal quotations omitted). The seizure in this case was justified because, when Officer Canuto seized Dubose, he had \"a reasonable and articulable suspicion\" that Dubose had engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Officer Canuto testified that he became suspicious of Dubose because of the brief nature of his meeting with the occupants of the Camry, the fact that their meeting appeared to be pre-arranged, the fact that Dubose leaned his entire upper body into the car during the interaction, and that Dubose's conduct was similar to the conduct involved in other drug transactions in the area. While there may have been an entirely innocent explanation for Dubose's conduct, Officer Canuto is a six-year veteran of the Boston Police Department, and we owe a measure of deference to his expertise in interpreting the events in this case. <i>See </i><i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 29 (stating that the determination of reasonable suspicion \"requires a practical, commonsense determinationa determination that entails a measurable degree of deference to the perceptions of experienced law enforcement officers\") (citation omitted); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> <i>United States v. Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d 108, 112 (1st Cir.1987) (deferring to police officer's conclusion that defendant was acting suspiciously when he sat in his car, engaged in a brief conversation with another individual who subsequently entered the defendant's car, then drove with this individual to a nearby deserted side street where they engaged in a further conversation, and the individual then exited the defendant's car and went back in the direction the defendant had just driven).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Further, Dubose's initial refusal to remove his hand from his pocket after having been ordered to do so provided additional substantiation of Officer Canuto's suspicion. There is no doubt that Officer Canuto had reasonable suspicion to seize Dubose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Officer Canuto's Search of Dubose Was Appropriate</h2>\n<p>After Officer Canuto succeeded in seizing Dubose, he decided to conduct a pat-down search of Dubose's outer clothing. Officer Canuto's limited search of Dubose's outer clothing was justified by legitimate concerns for his safety.</p>\n<p>Officer Canuto testified that after Dubose turned around with his hand still in his pocket, he became fearful that Dubose was carrying a weapon. He stated that drug dealers often carry weapons concealed in their waistbands, and, because that is not a very secure position for a gun, they often keep their hands in their pockets to ensure the gun does not fall down. Officer Canuto's concerns were further compounded by Dubose's initial refusal to remove his hand from his pocket, and Dubose's nervousness during this encounter. The combination of Dubose's interaction with the Camry's occupants, his initial refusal to heed Officer Canuto's order to remove his hand from his pocket, and his nervousness during his encounter with Officer Canuto, together with Officer Canuto's experience in dealing with drug transactions that often involve guns, were sufficient to justify a pat-down of Dubose's outer clothing. <i>See </i><i>Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 113-14 (holding that protective frisk was justified when officers had reasonable suspicion that defendant had engaged in an illegal drug transaction, the officers' experience showed that people engaging in drug crimes often carried firearms, and the officers noticed a bulge in the defendant's pocket); <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 313 F.3d 1228, 1236 (10th Cir.2002) (holding that officer was justified in conducting a protective frisk of defendant's clothing primarily because \"[d]efendant refused to take his hands out of his pockets after [police officer] requested that he do so\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Aitoro,</i> 446 F.3d 246, 253 (1st Cir.2006) (\"When an officer sees a bulge in a detainee's clothing and reasonably believes that bulge to be a concealed weapon, under the right circumstances the officer will have license to search the detainee.\").</p>\n<p>During the pat-down of Dubose's outer garments, Officer Canuto felt a hard object that he thought might be a firearm. He asked Dubose, \"What is this?\" (Appx. at 69.) Not exactly answering the question, Dubose responded, \"It's not mine.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Officer Canuto then reached into the pocket and retrieved a loaded .22 caliber revolver.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> Officer Canuto's decision to reach into Dubose's pocket was justified by his reasonable belief that the object he felt was a firearm. As we said in <i>Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 114,</p>\n<blockquote>Once the \"pat down\" confirmed that the article in appellant's pocket had the characteristics of a weapon, the officer was justified in reaching into the pocket and seizing it. The officer had reasonable grounds to believe that appellant was armed and dangerous. It was therefore imperative, for the safety of the officers and the general public, that the officer take the action that he did. We hold that such conduct clearly was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p>Officer Canuto's justifiable belief that he had detected a firearm in Dubose's sweatshirt pocket, in combination with Dubose's strange response to Officer Canuto's question about the object in his pocket, clearly justified his decision to reach in and retrieve the firearm in Dubose's pocket.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of Dubose's motion to suppress.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, \"sitting by designation\".</p>\n<p>[1]  Although brief pre-arranged drug transactions were fairly common in this area, the district court explicitly found that this area was not a \"hot spot\" of criminal activity at that time. However, Officer Canuto had previously made arrests in the area and a shooting had occurred there about four months before the events leading to this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although Dubose also mentions the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in his opening brief, he fails to actually quote the Declaration or any cases interpreting the relevant portion of that document. Instead, the substantive portions of his brief are focused exclusively on his federal constitutional challenge to the admissibility of the evidence in this case. Following Dubose's lead, this court will address only the federal constitutional issues in this case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that, on appeal, \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Of course, we will not blindly adhere to an officer's assertion that certain conduct appeared suspicious. <i>See </i><i>Rivera v. Murphy,</i> 979 F.2d 259, 264 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that relying exclusively on a police officer's experience to determine whether a seizure was justified by reasonable suspicion \"would effectively transform the police officer into a judge, and the court into a rubber stamp\"). However, an officer's expertise in interpreting criminal conduct is certainly a factor in this court's determination of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n\n</div>",

But when an officer makes a show of authority instead, the person is not seized until the person submits to the show of authority by complying with the officer's instruction. <i>Id.; </i><i>Holloway,</i> 499 F.3d at 117. Once the person complies, his liberty has been restrained and he is seized under the Fourth Amendment. <i>United States v. Sealey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195505\"><a href=\"/opinion/195505/united-states-v-sealey/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>When Officer Canuto first approached Dubose, he said, \"Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you for a second?\" (Appx. at 10, 52, 95.) Initially, Dubose ignored him and kept walking, but after Officer Canuto repeated the question in an increasingly loud voice, Dubose, with his hand in his sweatshirt pocket, stopped and turned to face Officer Canuto. Office Canuto several times ordered Dubose to take his hand out of his pocket because the officer feared Dubose might have a gun. Dubose initially refused to comply, but after several such commands by Officer Canuto, eventually he complied.</p>\n<p>We need not get excessively embroiled in whether the seizure occurred when Dubose stopped walking and turned to face Officer Canuto or whether it occurred a few seconds later when he removed his hand from his sweatshirt in response to Officer Canuto's command. Only a few seconds elapsed during this interaction which is best analyzed as a single ongoing encounter that should be viewed holistically, rather than bifurcated into artificially small increments.</p>\n<p>We have no difficulty concluding that by the time Dubose had complied with Officer Canuto's demand that he stop and remove his hand from his sweatshirt pocket, there had been a seizure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Dubose's Seizure Was Justified by the Officers' Reasonable and Articulable Suspicion of Criminal Activity</h2>\n<p>\"A law enforcement officer ordinarily may not stop someone and restrain his freedom to walk away unless the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.\" <i>Cook,</i> 277 F.3d at 85 (internal quotations omitted). The seizure in this case was justified because, when Officer Canuto seized Dubose, he had \"a reasonable and articulable suspicion\" that Dubose had engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Officer Canuto testified that he became suspicious of Dubose because of the brief nature of his meeting with the occupants of the Camry, the fact that their meeting appeared to be pre-arranged, the fact that Dubose leaned his entire upper body into the car during the interaction, and that Dubose's conduct was similar to the conduct involved in other drug transactions in the area. While there may have been an entirely innocent explanation for Dubose's conduct, Officer Canuto is a six-year veteran of the Boston Police Department, and we owe a measure of deference to his expertise in interpreting the events in this case. <i>See </i><i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 29 (stating that the determination of reasonable suspicion \"requires a practical, commonsense determinationa determination that entails a measurable degree of deference to the perceptions of experienced law enforcement officers\") (citation omitted); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*122</span> <i>United States v. Trullo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481633\"><a href=\"/opinion/481633/united-states-v-john-f-trullo/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1987) (deferring to police officer's conclusion that defendant was acting suspiciously when he sat in his car, engaged in a brief conversation with another individual who subsequently entered the defendant's car, then drove with this individual to a nearby deserted side street where they engaged in a further conversation, and the individual then exited the defendant's car and went back in the direction the defendant had just driven).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Further, Dubose's initial refusal to remove his hand from his pocket after having been ordered to do so provided additional substantiation of Officer Canuto's suspicion. There is no doubt that Officer Canuto had reasonable suspicion to seize Dubose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Officer Canuto's Search of Dubose Was Appropriate</h2>\n<p>After Officer Canuto succeeded in seizing Dubose, he decided to conduct a pat-down search of Dubose's outer clothing. Officer Canuto's limited search of Dubose's outer clothing was justified by legitimate concerns for his safety.</p>\n<p>Officer Canuto testified that after Dubose turned around with his hand still in his pocket, he became fearful that Dubose was carrying a weapon. He stated that drug dealers often carry weapons concealed in their waistbands, and, because that is not a very secure position for a gun, they often keep their hands in their pockets to ensure the gun does not fall down. Officer Canuto's concerns were further compounded by Dubose's initial refusal to remove his hand from his pocket, and Dubose's nervousness during this encounter. The combination of Dubose's interaction with the Camry's occupants, his initial refusal to heed Officer Canuto's order to remove his hand from his pocket, and his nervousness during his encounter with Officer Canuto, together with Officer Canuto's experience in dealing with drug transactions that often involve guns, were sufficient to justify a pat-down of Dubose's outer clothing. <i>See </i><i>Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 113-14 (holding that protective frisk was justified when officers had reasonable suspicion that defendant had engaged in an illegal drug transaction, the officers' experience showed that people engaging in drug crimes often carried firearms, and the officers noticed a bulge in the defendant's pocket); <i>United States v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780224\"><a href=\"/opinion/780224/united-states-v-michael-a-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></a></span>, 1236 (10th Cir.2002) (holding that officer was justified in conducting a protective frisk of defendant's clothing primarily because \"[d]efendant refused to take his hands out of his pockets after [police officer] requested that he do so\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Aitoro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202211\"><a href=\"/opinion/202211/united-states-v-aitoro/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 253 (1st Cir.2006) (\"When an officer sees a bulge in a detainee's clothing and reasonably believes that bulge to be a concealed weapon, under the right circumstances the officer will have license to search the detainee.\").</p>\n<p>During the pat-down of Dubose's outer garments, Officer Canuto felt a hard object that he thought might be a firearm. He asked Dubose, \"What is this?\" (Appx. at 69.) Not exactly answering the question, Dubose responded, \"It's not mine.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Officer Canuto then reached into the pocket and retrieved a loaded .22 caliber revolver.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*123</span> Officer Canuto's decision to reach into Dubose's pocket was justified by his reasonable belief that the object he felt was a firearm. As we said in <i>Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 114,</p>\n<blockquote>Once the \"pat down\" confirmed that the article in appellant's pocket had the characteristics of a weapon, the officer was justified in reaching into the pocket and seizing it. The officer had reasonable grounds to believe that appellant was armed and dangerous. It was therefore imperative, for the safety of the officers and the general public, that the officer take the action that he did. We hold that such conduct clearly was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p>Officer Canuto's justifiable belief that he had detected a firearm in Dubose's sweatshirt pocket, in combination with Dubose's strange response to Officer Canuto's question about the object in his pocket, clearly justified his decision to reach in and retrieve the firearm in Dubose's pocket.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of Dubose's motion to suppress.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, \"sitting by designation\".</p>\n<p>[1]  Although brief pre-arranged drug transactions were fairly common in this area, the district court explicitly found that this area was not a \"hot spot\" of criminal activity at that time. However, Officer Canuto had previously made arrests in the area and a shooting had occurred there about four months before the events leading to this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although Dubose also mentions the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in his opening brief, he fails to actually quote the Declaration or any cases interpreting the relevant portion of that document. Instead, the substantive portions of his brief are focused exclusively on his federal constitutional challenge to the admissibility of the evidence in this case. Following Dubose's lead, this court will address only the federal constitutional issues in this case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that, on appeal, \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Of course, we will not blindly adhere to an officer's assertion that certain conduct appeared suspicious. <i>See </i><i>Rivera v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594699\"><a href=\"/opinion/594699/emma-rivera-v-paul-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 264 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that relying exclusively on a police officer's experience to determine whether a seizure was justified by reasonable suspicion \"would effectively transform the police officer into a judge, and the court into a rubber stamp\"). However, an officer's expertise in interpreting criminal conduct is certainly a factor in this court's determination of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n\n</div>",
