As the government argues, claimant's attempt to\n\nrecover interest on funds and property which the government had\n\nseized    when    claimant   was   arrested   but   which   were   ultimately\n\nreturned to him is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity as\n\nexplained in a decision issued during the pendency of this appeal.\n\nLarson v.

The version of the statute in effect when this\n\nproceeding was commenced did not permit an award of any interest.\n\nId. at 647.      Although a new version of the statute now provides for\n\nthe recovery of interest, the new version applies prospectively\n\nonly.    Id.\n\n        Claimant's argument that we previously mandated an award of\n\ninterest to him when we remanded the matter to the district court\n\nis based on a misapprehension of the remand order (which permitted\n\nthe district court to explore anew the question of interest) and a\n\nmisunderstanding of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.                Since\n\nsovereign immunity deprives the federal court of jurisdiction, it\n\nmay be raised at any time during the proceedings regardless of\n\nprior orders in the case and regardless of a party's failure to\n\nobject on that ground.       Id. at 648.\n\n     Claimant's arguments regarding his motion for the return of an\n\nautomobile which was not registered in his name, and his attempt to\n\nobtain sanctions against the government are frivolous.\n\n     The judgment is affirmed for the reasons stated above.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f",
