Defendant Angel Antonio Quirindongo-Martínez\n\n(\"Quirindongo\") appeals from his sentence for escape, imposed\n\nshortly after the Supreme Court's decision in United States v.\n\nBooker,    543   U.S.   220   (2005),     which      rendered   the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines advisory rather than mandatory.              On appeal, Quirindongo\n\nchallenges the reasonableness of his sentence on the grounds that\n\nthe district court failed to take into account his proffered\n\nmitigating circumstances--i.e., that the escape was committed under\n\nduress--and failed to explain the reasons for the sentence imposed.\n\nAfter careful review of the record, we affirm the sentence because\n\nthe sentencing court's reasons, although not expressly stated, can\n\nbe   inferred    from   the   record.         See   United   States   v.   Navedo-\n\nConcepción, 450 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).                   In\n\nreaching this result, we are cognizant that the sentencing in this\n\ncase occurred only a few weeks after the Supreme Court's decision\n\nin Booker and without the benefit of our subsequent guidance as to\n\nthe appropriate post-Booker sentencing protocol.                \"[I]n the future\n\nthe main factors ought to be identified by the district court\n\nitself.\"    Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d at 58.\n\n            While   imprisoned     after        being    convicted     for   drug\n\ntrafficking, Quirindongo escaped.             After being recaptured several\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fmonths later,1 he pled guilty to escape, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 751(a).\n\n            At his sentencing, Quirindongo requested either that his\n\nescape sentence be imposed to run concurrently with the remainder\n\nof his drug trafficking sentence or that any consecutive sentence\n\n\"be   reduced    from   the      suggested    guideline     range.\"2     Those\n\nalternative     requests   amounted     to    the    same   thing   since,   as\n\nQuirindongo acknowledges on appeal, the guidelines provide that,\n\n\"[i]f the instant offense was committed while the defendant was\n\nserving a term of imprisonment . . ., the sentence for the instant\n\noffense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged\n\nterm of imprisonment.\"        U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(a) (Nov. 2004).\n\n            In support of that request, Quirindongo relied solely on\n\nhis   contention   that    his    escape     was    committed   under   duress.\n\nSpecifically,    defense   counsel     argued      that   Quirindongo   escaped\n\n\n      1\n      Quirindongo escaped on February 15, 2004. The precise date\nof his recapture is unclear from the record.       The presentence\nreport, which the district court adopted without objection from\neither party, states that he was arrested on May 13, 2004.\nHowever, at the change of plea hearing, the government stated,\nwithout objection, that he was arrested on April 13, 2004. The\nlatter date is also contained in the Marshal's affidavit in support\nof the criminal complaint, which issued on May 13, 2004.\n      2\n      Defense counsel's use of the word \"suggested\" indicates that\nhe was seeking a variance from an advisory guidelines sentence\nrather than a downward departure within the guidelines. However,\nso soon after Booker, such distinctions were not common parlance.\nTo the extent that he was seeking a downward departure, the\ngovernment is correct that the district court's failure to grant\none is generally not reviewable, even after Booker. United States\nv. Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fbecause he did not want to participate in an impending violent\n\nconfrontation between two rival gangs, which, in fact, took place\n\nshortly after his escape.   He further feared that, if he reported\n\nthe prospect of such a confrontation to authorities, other inmates\n\nwould retaliate against him.       So, he sought a transfer without\n\ndisclosing his reason for doing so, and when that request was\n\ndenied, he escaped.   Quirindongo himself told a somewhat different\n\nstory.3   In response, the government argued, albeit cryptically,\n\nthat Quirindongo's failure to report voluntarily to authorities\n\nimmediately after his escape was inconsistent with his claim of\n\nduress4 and that the two descriptions of the circumstances leading\n\nup to the escape did not \"match.\"\n\n           After hearing those arguments, the court properly began\n\nits   sentencing   determination    by   calculating   the   applicable\n\nguidelines range, Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518, of 27 to 33\n\nmonths.   In so doing, the court recognized that it was not bound to\n\n\n      3\n      In his allocution, Quirindongo stated that he had felt\n\"pressured\" since he arrived at the institution a few months\nearlier because, when he was unable to produce papers requested by\nprison officials, he was told that if he did not produce them in 15\ndays, \"something was going to happen to [him].\"      He then tried\nthree times to seek a transfer to another institution but was\nunable to see a counselor. Since he \"already knew that something\nwas going to happen,\" when he heard about the impending gang\nconfrontation, he escaped to avoid injury to himself or others.\n      4\n      Some courts have held that duress, as a defense to escape,\nrequires that the escapee report to the proper authorities as soon\nas he has reached a safe place. See Sarlund v. Anderson, 205 F.3d\n973, 976 (7th Cir. 2000); Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Substantive Criminal\nLaw § 9.7(b) at 75 & n.24 (2d ed. 2003).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fsentence within that range by stating that those calculations would\n\ngovern \"[i]f the Court were to apply the guidelines in this case.\"\n\nThe court then proceeded to announce the sentence--33 months to be\n\nserved consecutively to the drug trafficking sentence that he was\n\nserving when he escaped.     Other than state that it had \"reviewed\n\nthe presentence report, the defendant's prior record and personal\n\nbackground and his involvement in the instant offense,\" the court\n\ngave no reasons for rejecting Quirindongo's duress argument or for\n\nimposing this particular sentence.      However, we infer that the\n\ncourt was not persuaded by the duress claim for the reasons argued\n\nby the government, and we find nothing unreasonable in that result.\n\nWe further infer that, in choosing to impose a 33-month consecutive\n\nsentence, the court gave substantial weight to the guidelines,\n\nwhich is also appropriate.    Id. at 518.   Moreover, apart from the\n\nguidelines, it is obvious that if an escape sentence were to run\n\nconcurrently with the sentence for the underlying crime, such a\n\nsentence would provide no deterrence to escape; the prisoner would\n\nhave nothing to lose.   Finally, as the district court's prefatory\n\ncomments suggest, the length of the sentence may have been driven,\n\nin part, by Quirindongo's lengthy criminal record, which included\n\nan instance of absconding while on parole, for which an arrest\n\nwarrant is still outstanding.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            We find that implicit reasoning to be plausible and the\n\nresult defensible.   See id. at 519.   Accordingly, the sentence is\n\naffirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
