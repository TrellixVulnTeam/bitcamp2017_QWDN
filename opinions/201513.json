This appeal raises exceptionally\n\nimportant questions of justiciability and sovereignty, emblematic\n\nof unsettled political conditions that have plagued the Middle East\n\nfor many years.       In it, the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the\n\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) ask us to countermand the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to dismiss the action against them.            They\n\ncontend that the case hinges on a nonjusticiable political question\n\nand that, at any rate, the defendants enjoy sovereign immunity. In\n\nthe event that these arguments do not carry the day, the defendants\n\nseek vacation of two $116,000,000-plus default judgments, one\n\nentered against each of them, on the ground that they were entitled\n\nto   a   binding    determination   of     sovereign   immunity   (including\n\nappellate review of any unfavorable decision) before being forced\n\nto bear the burdens of litigation.\n\n            After    careful   consideration      of   the   relevant   legal\n\nauthorities    and   perscrutation    of    an   amplitudinous    record,   we\n\nconclude that this case is justiciable; that the defendants have\n\nnot established an entitlement to sovereign immunity; and that the\n\ndefendants' strategic litigation choices undercut their arguments\n\nas to the sequencing of the litigation.            Consequently, we affirm\n\nthe judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            This case had its genesis in a terrorist attack that\n\noccurred in Israel on June 9, 1996.          On that date, Yaron Ungar (a\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcitizen of the United States), his wife Efrat, and their infant son\n\nYishai were driving home from a wedding.    Near Beit Shemesh, a car\n\napproached the Ungars' vehicle and loosed a salvo of machine-gun\n\nfire, killing both Yaron and Efrat.      The three occupants of the\n\nattacking vehicle were all members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance\n\nMovement (Hamas), a group designated as a terrorist organization by\n\nthe United States Department of State.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1189;\n\nRedesignation of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, 68 Fed. Reg.\n\n56,860, 56,861 (Oct. 2, 2003).      The authorities apprehended the\n\nthree assailants and, soon after, arrested a fourth Hamas member as\n\nan accessory.   An Israeli court convicted all four men.\n\n          David Strachman was appointed as the administrator of the\n\nestates of Yaron and Efrat Ungar.    On March 13, 2000, Strachman and\n\nother plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Rhode Island pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act\n\n(ATA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2331-2338.      That statute provides a cause of\n\naction in favor of any \"national of the United States injured in\n\nhis or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of\n\ninternational terrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or\n\nheirs.\"   Id. § 2333(a).   Venue for such an action may be laid in,\n\ninter alia, \"any district where any plaintiff resides,\" id. §\n\n2334(a), and the plaintiff(s) may recover treble damages, costs,\n\nand attorneys' fees, id. § 2333(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           The original complaint set forth both ATA and state law\n\nclaims.   It was brought by numerous plaintiffs against numerous\n\ndefendants. We need not call the roll; for all practical purposes,\n\nthe case boils down to a suit involving the estate and heirs of\n\nYaron Ungar as plaintiffs and the PA and the PLO as defendants.1\n\nThe centerpiece      of   the   complaint      was   an    allegation   that    the\n\ndefendants     had   engaged    in   international        terrorism   within    the\n\npurview of the ATA.       See id. § 2331(1).\n\n           On an ensuing motion to dismiss, the district court\n\nrejected an assertion that the PA and the PLO were immune from\n\nservice   of   process.        Estates    of   Ungar   ex    rel.   Strachman   v.\n\nPalestinian Auth., 153 F. Supp. 2d 76, 90-91 (D.R.I. 2001) (Ungar\n\nI).   However, the court dismissed the state law claims, finding\n\nthat Rhode Island choice-of-law principles favored the application\n\nof Israeli law.      Id. at 98-99.\n\n           The plaintiffs served an amended complaint on August 23,\n\n2001, asserting one claim under the ATA and three Israeli law\n\nclaims, all on behalf of the estate and heirs of Yaron Ungar.                   The\n\n\n      1\n      On the plaintiffs' side, the claims brought by the estate and\nheirs of Efrat Ungar were dismissed because she was not a United\nStates national. Estates of Ungar ex rel. Strachman v. Palestinian\nAuth., 153 F. Supp. 2d 76, 97 (D.R.I. 2001). On the defendants'\nside, a number of Hamas defendants were sued, but none of them\nentered an appearance and, accordingly, the district court\ndefaulted them. See id. at 85 n.2. The court dismissed the action\nas to several other defendants for want of in personam\njurisdiction.    Id. at 95.      For present purposes, then, it\nsimplifies matters to think of this case as a suit by Yaron Ungar's\nestate and heirs against the PA and the PLO.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fPA   and     the    PLO   moved    to   dismiss   the     amended    complaint   on\n\nessentially the same grounds as previously urged, adding only that\n\nthe claims were nonjusticiable. Alternatively, they sought to have\n\nthe district court certify, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b),2\n\nvarious      questions,     including     a    question    as   to   whether     the\n\ndefendants were entitled to a non-specific \"functional\" immunity\n\n\"arising from the peculiar status of the PA as a functioning\n\ngovernmental entity.\"             At that point, the defendants were not\n\nclaiming statehood; they argued only that the policy considerations\n\nunderlying the ATA's recognition of immunity for foreign states\n\n\"appl[ied] equally\" to them.\n\n              The PA and the PLO later changed their position.                    On\n\nJanuary 30, 2002 — during the pendency of their motion to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint — they jointly moved for \"leave to assert\n\ndefenses.\"         In the memorandum accompanying that motion, they for\n\nthe first time claimed an immunity from suit based on sovereignty.\n\n\n      2\n          This statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n           When a district judge, in making in a civil action\n      an order not otherwise appealable . . ., shall be of the\n      opinion that such order involves a controlling question\n      of law as to which there is substantial ground for\n      difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from\n      the order may materially advance the ultimate termination\n      of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such\n      order. The Court of Appeals . . . may thereupon, in its\n      discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order,\n      if application is made to it within ten days after the\n      entry of the order . . . .\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n                                         -5-\n\fThey explained that they initially had chosen not to seek immunity\n\non the basis of statehood and suggested that emergent political\n\nevents in their region had caused a change of plan.               The motion for\n\nleave to assert defenses was a curiosity — the defendants had not\n\nyet answered the amended complaint and were free to assert, by\n\nmotion to dismiss or otherwise, any colorable defense — and the\n\ndistrict court never acted on it.\n\n            In the same time frame, the defendants moved for a stay\n\nof discovery and the plaintiffs moved for an order compelling\n\ndiscovery. The court granted the requested stay pending resolution\n\nof the motion to dismiss the amended complaint.                   On November 4,\n\n2002, the district court denied the dismissal motion and dissolved\n\nthe    stay.          The   court     flatly     rejected        the   claim   of\n\nnonjusticiability.          Estates    of    Ungar   ex    rel.    Strachman   v.\n\nPalestinian Auth., 228 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44-47 (D.R.I. 2002) (Ungar\n\nII).   It also determined that the amended complaint stated claims\n\nupon which relief could be granted both under the ATA and under\n\nIsraeli law.         Id. at 47-48.     Finally, the court reiterated its\n\nearlier rejection of the defendants' claim of immunity from service\n\nof process and added that the PA, as a governmental entity, was not\n\na sovereign state immune from suit under the ATA.                  Id. at 48-49.\n\nFinally, the court declined the defendants' invitation to certify\n\nquestions      for    interlocutory    review.       Id.    at    49-51   (citing\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fKlinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro, 937 F.2d 44, 47-49 (2d Cir.\n\n1991)).\n\n            The PA and the PLO moved for reconsideration and again\n\nasked for a stay.         Some two months later, the district court\n\ngranted the plaintiffs' outstanding motion to compel discovery,\n\ngiving the defendants additional time to respond due to their\n\noverseas     location.         The   defendants      nonetheless      moved      for\n\nreconsideration of the discovery order and submitted a letter from\n\nPalestine's permanent observer at the United Nations, which stated\n\nthat the defendants could not be expected to respond to discovery\n\ndue   to   the   unremitting    violence     in    the   region.      The   letter\n\nsuggested that the defendants should be allowed to wait until there\n\nwas a final decision on the jurisdictional question before being\n\nforced to attend to the discovery requests.\n\n            On February 7, 2003, the plaintiffs moved for an entry of\n\ndefault based on the defendants' failure to answer the amended\n\ncomplaint.       Six   weeks    later,     the    district   court    denied     the\n\ndefendants' pending motion to reconsider the order compelling\n\ndiscovery.       On    April   11,   the   court     held    a   hearing    on   the\n\ndefendants' outstanding motion to reconsider its decision in Ungar\n\nII.   The court indicated from the bench that it would deny both\n\nthat motion and the concomitant request for a stay, but it did not\n\nactually enter such an order until April 22, 2003.                   Meanwhile, a\n\nmagistrate judge entered the requested default, concluding that the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fdefendants' failure to answer the amended complaint and their\n\nrefusal to participate in discovery were the result of a deliberate\n\nstrategic choice.         The default was posted on the docket on April\n\n21, 2003.\n\n              The defendants filed a notice of appeal to this court on\n\nApril 23, 2003, in which they sought interlocutory review of both\n\nthe lower court's decision in Ungar II and that court's refusal to\n\nreconsider that decision. They averred that they had been deprived\n\nof the opportunity to make a showing of sovereign immunity because\n\nthe district court failed to take action on their motion for leave\n\nto assert a sovereign immunity defense, yet proceeded to determine\n\nthat the defendants had no entitlement to immunity.                     We summarily\n\naffirmed the orders appealed from, noting that the defendants had\n\nneither moved to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity nor\n\nattempted, in the lower court, to make the evidentiary showing\n\nrequired    to    sustain    such    a    defense.       Ungar     v.   Palestinian\n\nLiberation Org., No. 03-1544, 2003 WL 21254790, at *1 (1st Cir. May\n\n27,   2003)      (per   curiam)     (unpublished).           We   added    that   the\n\ndefendants'      motion    for    leave   to    assert   a   defense      was   wholly\n\ngratuitous, as they did not need the court's permission to raise\n\nthe sovereign immunity issue at that stage of the case.                     See id.\n\n              We issued our order without prejudice to the defendants'\n\nfuture efforts to press their newly asserted sovereign immunity\n\ndefense in an appropriate fashion.              See id. (admonishing that the\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fdefendants \"must adhere to the rules that govern all litigants\").\n\nThe next pleading, however, came from the plaintiffs, who moved for\n\na default judgment. The defendants responded by filing their third\n\nmotion to dismiss.      This time, they predicated the motion on three\n\nbases, namely, (i) that the case centered around nonjusticiable\n\npolitical questions; (ii) that the defendants were entitled to\n\nsovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\n\n(FSIA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1602-1611; and (iii) that section 2337(2) of\n\nthe ATA, which provides that a suit under section 2333 may not be\n\nmaintained against \"a foreign state [or] an agency of a foreign\n\nstate,\" independently divested the district court of jurisdiction.\n\n            The    parties    were   like   ships   passing   in    the   night.\n\nPursuing the plaintiffs' path, the magistrate judge, on March 31,\n\n2004, recommended the entry of default judgments against the PA and\n\nthe   PLO   in    amounts    exceeding   $116,000,000.3       The   defendants\n\ninterposed timely objections to the report and recommendation,\n\nreasserting their nonjusticiability and sovereign immunity points\n\nand contending, for the first time, that they were entitled to a\n\nfinal determination on sovereign immunity (including appellate\n\nreview) before being required either to answer the complaint or to\n\nsubmit to discovery.\n\n\n\n      3\n      The amounts differed slightly.    The recommended judgment\nagainst the PA was for $116,421,048 and the recommended judgment\nagainst the PLO was for $116,415,468. The reasons for this minor\ndisparity are not material to the issues on appeal.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f           Meanwhile, the district court had been pursuing the\n\ncourse charted by the defendants.          On April 23, 2004, it denied the\n\ndefendants'   renewed      motion   to    dismiss      the   amended   complaint.\n\nEstates of Ungar v. Palestinian Auth., 315 F. Supp. 2d 164, 187\n\n(D.R.I.   2004)   (Ungar    III).        The   court    hewed   to   its   earlier\n\nrejection of the defendants' nonjusticiability thesis.                 See id. at\n\n173-74 (referencing Ungar II, 228 F. Supp. 2d at 44-47).                Next, the\n\ncourt held that the FSIA and section 2337(2) of the ATA were two\n\nsides of the same coin with respect to sovereign immunity.                  Id. at\n\n174-75.   This left only a single question:             \"whether the PA and/or\n\nthe PLO represent or constitute a foreign State and are thus\n\nentitled to sovereign immunity.\"           Id. at 175.       The court answered\n\nthat question in the negative.             Id. at 176-87.        The plaintiffs\n\nimmediately moved to amend the court's order pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 59(e), arguing that the sovereign immunity defense had been\n\nwaived.   The defendants did nothing.\n\n           On July 12, 2004, the district court went down the\n\nplaintiffs' path.       It adopted the magistrate judge's \"default\n\njudgment\" report and recommendation in its totality, overruled the\n\ndefendants' objections thereto, and denied the plaintiffs' motion\n\nto amend Ungar III.     See Estates of Ungar & Ungar ex rel. Strachman\n\nv. Palestinian Auth., 325 F. Supp. 2d 15, 21-22, 26-28 (D.R.I.\n\n2004) (Ungar IV).       In the course of that decision, the court\n\nrebuffed the defendants' claim that they were entitled to a full\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\freview of their sovereign immunity defense before being required to\n\nanswer the complaint or proceed further.                 Id. at 23-24.               The court\n\nthen   ordered    judgment       for      the    plaintiffs     in       the    recommended\n\namounts.    Id. at 28.         This appeal ensued.\n\nII.    JUSTICIABILITY\n\n            The defendants maintain that the complaint against them\n\nshould have been dismissed because it presents a non-justiciable\n\npolitical question.        We find this argument unconvincing.\n\n            In Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the Supreme Court\n\nprovided    guidance      as    to     the      attributes    of     a    nonjusticiable\n\npolitical     question.          The      Court     explained      that        \"it    is   the\n\nrelationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of\n\nthe Federal Government . . . which gives rise to the 'political\n\nquestion.'\"      Id. at 210.         Withal, not \"every case or controversy\n\nwhich touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.\"\n\nId. at 211.      Determining justiciability requires an \"analysis of\n\nthe particular question posed, in terms of the history of its\n\nmanagement by the political branches, of its susceptibility to\n\njudicial handling in light of its nature and posture in the\n\nspecific    case,   and    of       the    possible    consequences            of    judicial\n\naction.\"     Id. at 211-12.               The Court then set forth six tests\n\ndesigned    to   confirm       or    negate      the   existence         of    a    political\n\nquestion:\n\n            [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional\n            commitment of the issue to a coordinate\n\n                                             -11-\n\f           political department; or [2] a lack of\n           judicially    discoverable    and    manageable\n           standards for resolving it; or [3] the\n           impossibility of deciding without an initial\n           policy determination of a kind clearly for\n           nonjudicial    discretion;     or    [4]    the\n           impossibility   of   a   court's    undertaking\n           independent resolution without expressing lack\n           of the respect due coordinate branches of\n           government; or [5] an unusual need for\n           unquestioning   adherence   to    a   political\n           decision already made; or [6] the potentiality\n           of    embarrassment      from     multifarious\n           pronouncements by various departments on one\n           question.\n\nId. at 217.    The Court explained, in a later case, that \"[t]hese\n\ntests are probably listed in descending order of both importance\n\nand certainty.\"      Vieth v. Jubelirer, 124 S. Ct. 1769, 1776 (2004).\n\n           The defendants assert with little elaboration that the\n\ncentral issue in this case fails each of the six tests.            Most of\n\ntheir argumentation presumes that the district court intruded into\n\nforbidden territory when it interpreted an array of United Nations\n\nresolutions    and     Israeli-PLO      agreements     in   a   politically\n\ncontroversial manner.      To this they add that the default judgment\n\nentered by the district court was so huge that it amounted to a\n\npolitical statement.\n\n           The defendants' position rests on a misunderstanding of\n\nthe fundamental nature of this action.       This is a tort suit brought\n\nunder a legislative scheme that Congress enacted for the express\n\npurpose   of   providing    a   legal   remedy   for   injuries   or   death\n\noccasioned by acts of international terrorism.          The defendants are\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\forganizations that allegedly violated the statute.        They have\n\nattempted to avoid liability by wrapping themselves in the cloak of\n\nsovereign immunity.    The question we must answer, then, is whether\n\nthe defendants have set forth sufficient evidence to support their\n\nclaim of immunity — no more and no less.\n\n          On this view of the case, the plaintiffs easily clear the\n\nsix Baker hurdles.    To begin, the lower court's immunity decision\n\nneither signaled an official position on behalf of the United\n\nStates with respect to the political recognition of Palestine nor\n\namounted to the usurpation of a power committed to some other\n\nbranch of government. After all, Congress enacted the ATA, and the\n\nPresident signed it.    The very purpose of the law is to allow the\n\ncourts to determine questions of sovereign immunity under a legal,\n\nas opposed to a political, regime.4       Seen in this light, the\n\ndistrict court's decision denying immunity did not impede the\n\nconstitutional prerogatives of the political branches over foreign\n\npolicy.   See generally Baker, 369 U.S. at 211 & n.31 (noting that\n\n\n\n     4\n      The FSIA operates in the same fashion. See 28 U.S.C. § 1602\n(\"The Congress finds that the determination by United States courts\nof the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction\nof such courts would serve the interests of justice and would\nprotect the rights of both foreign states and litigants in United\nStates courts.\"); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 7 (1976), reprinted in\n1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6606 (\"A principle purpose of [the FSIA] is\nto transfer the determination of sovereign immunity from the\nexecutive branch to the judicial branch, thereby reducing the\nforeign policy implications of immunity determinations and assuring\nlitigants that these often crucial decisions are made on purely\nlegal grounds . . . .\").\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe Constitution commits foreign relations to the executive and\n\nlegislative branches, thus permitting them to determine what \"may\n\nbe done in the exercise of this political power\").\n\n            The second and third Baker hurdles present no insuperable\n\nobstacles here.      The district court had access to judicially\n\nmanageable standards for resolving the issue before it, see infra\n\nPart III(A), and those standards did not require the court to make\n\nnonjudicial policy determinations.            Both sides agreed that the\n\ndefinition of a \"state\" under the relevant statutes was informed by\n\nan objective test rooted in international law and articulated in\n\nthe   Restatement    (Third)    of   Foreign      Relations.      Under   these\n\ncircumstances, the determination of whether the defendants have\n\nadduced     sufficient   evidence    to     satisfy      that   definition   is\n\nquintessentially appropriate for a judicial body.                See Kadic v.\n\nKaradzic, 70 F.3d 232, 249 (2d Cir. 1995)\n\n            The final three hurdles need not concern us. These tests\n\nare \"relevant only if judicial resolution of a question would\n\ncontradict prior decisions taken by a political branch in those\n\nlimited contexts where such contradiction would seriously interfere\n\nwith important governmental interests.\"            Id.    Here, the political\n\nbranches have enacted a law that leaves undiminished their ability\n\neither to recognize or withhold recognition from foreign states,\n\nwhile leaving to the courts the responsibility of determining the\n\nexistence    vel   non   of   statehood     for   jurisdictional     purposes.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fMoreover, the district court's resolution of that question is not\n\nincompatible      with    any    formal    position      thus    far   taken   by   the\n\npolitical branches. By the same token, its jurisdictional decision\n\ndoes not turn a blind eye to any position expressed by those\n\nresponsible for conducting the nation's foreign relations.                          Cf.\n\nRepublic of Austria v. Altmann, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 2255 (2004)\n\n(noting that the State Department has retained authority to file\n\n\"statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise\n\njurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign\n\nimmunity\").       As a result, the decision did not signify a lack of\n\nrespect    for,    or    conflict     with,      the   wishes    of    the   political\n\nbranches.     No more is exigible for this purpose.                    See Baker, 369\n\nU.S. at 212-13 (endorsing judicial competence in matters touching\n\non foreign relations in the absence of any \"conclusive governmental\n\naction\" or \"recognizedly authoritative executive declaration\")\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The defendants make a number of specific arguments, but\n\nthese are largely derivative of their disagreement with the result\n\nreached     by     the     district       court.         Their     unhappiness       is\n\nunderstandable, but legally irrelevant.                  The reality is that, in\n\nthese tempestuous times, any decision of a United States court on\n\nmatters relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will engender\n\nstrong feelings.         Be that as it may, the capacity to stir emotions\n\nis   not    enough       to     render    an     issue    nonjusticiable.           For\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fjurisdictional purposes, courts must be careful to distinguish\n\nbetween political questions and cases having political overtones.\n\nSee Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 49.\n\n            The one remaining argument that warrants particularized\n\nattention is the defendants' assertion that the district court made\n\na political statement in calibrating the size of the award.                       That\n\nassertion    is   wholly    unsupported.       The    judgment         reflects    the\n\nwrongful death of a youthful man and includes a trebling of damages\n\nas mandated by law.         See 18 U.S.C. § 2333(a).             It also includes\n\nattorneys' fees.         See id.      The defendants have not challenged\n\neither the measure of damages utilized by the lower court or the\n\nintegrity of its mathematical computations. We add, moreover, that\n\neven if the court erred on the side of generosity — a matter on\n\nwhich we take no view — a mere error in the calculation of a\n\ndamages award would not implicate the propriety of federal subject\n\nmatter     jurisdiction.        We    therefore      reject      the    defendants'\n\n\"political statement\" assertion as meritless.\n\n            To    say    more   on   this   aspect    of   the    case    would     be\n\nsupererogatory.         The short of it is that the political question\n\ndoctrine does not preclude judicial resolution of the plaintiffs'\n\ncase.    We turn, therefore, to the merits of the sovereign immunity\n\ndefense.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fIII.   SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY\n\n           We divide our discussion of the defendants' sovereign\n\nimmunity defense into segments, starting with the legal framework\n\nand historical background.     We then proceed to the merits.\n\n                      A.    The Legal Landscape.\n\n          The FSIA, with exceptions not relevant here, provides\n\nthat \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourts of the United States.\"      28 U.S.C. § 1604.    Although the\n\nstatute does not define the term \"foreign state,\" it makes pellucid\n\nthat the term includes \"a political subdivision of a foreign state\n\nor an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.\"      Id. § 1603\n\n(a). It also defines what constitutes an agency or instrumentality\n\nof a foreign state.   Id. § 1603(b).\n\n          The ATA contains analogous language. It provides that no\n\ncivil action thereunder may be maintained against \"a foreign state,\n\nan agency of a foreign state, or an officer or employee of a\n\nforeign state or an agency thereof acting within his or her\n\nofficial capacity or under color of legal authority.\"    18 U.S.C. §\n\n2337(2). Like the FSIA, the ATA contains no definition of the term\n\n\"foreign state.\"\n\n           Because the two statutory regimes use language that is\n\nsimilar but not identical, the first — and most obvious — question\n\nis whether there are substantive differences in the meaning of the\n\nterm \"foreign state\" as used in the FSIA and the ATA, respectively.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fThe district court concluded that the two statutes were to be read\n\nin pari materia.   See Ungar III, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 175.    We agree\n\nwith that conclusion.\n\n          We recognize, of course, that even identical terms can\n\nhave divergent meanings when used in different statutes.        See,\n\ne.g., Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States, 880 F.2d 1503, 1504 (1st\n\nCir. 1989); United States v. Sterling Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 494\n\nF.2d 919, 923 (2d Cir. 1974).    Generally speaking, however, that\n\nphenomenon occurs only when the purpose, history, and structure of\n\nthe statutes make manifest a principled basis for interpreting the\n\nwords differently.   See, e.g., Perez-Arellano v. Smith, 279 F.3d\n\n791, 794 (9th Cir. 2002).    Here, however, the Supreme Court has\n\nobserved that \"the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate\n\nCongress' intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining\n\njurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.\"           Argentine\n\nRepublic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434 (1989).\n\nNothing in either the language or legislative history of the ATA\n\ngives any indication that Congress intended the newer statute to\n\nsupercede, rather than to mirror, the detailed jurisdictional\n\nframework described in the FSIA.       To cinch matters, the Supreme\n\nCourt, in a post-ATA case, recently repeated its admonition that\n\n\"courts should decide claims of sovereign immunity in conformity\n\nwith the [FSIA's] principles.\"         Altmann, 124 S. Ct. at 2249.\n\nConsequently, we regard an assertion of sovereign immunity under\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fthe ATA, 18 U.S.C. § 2337(2), as being functionally equivalent to\n\nan assertion of sovereign immunity under the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1604.\n\n             This brings a second question into focus.           Since neither\n\nthe FSIA nor the ATA define the term \"foreign state\" as it relates\n\nto a sovereign power, we must determine the intended meaning of\n\nthat term.    There is no controlling precedent in this circuit as to\n\nthe essential     attributes    of   statehood      in   this   context.       The\n\nparties, however, find common ground in their shared conviction\n\nthat the     definition   should     be   derived   by   application      of   the\n\nstandard set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations.\n\nThis standard deems a state to be \"an entity that has a defined\n\nterritory and a permanent population, under the control of its own\n\ngovernment, and that engages in, or has the capacity to engage in,\n\nformal relations with other such entities.\" Restatement (Third) of\n\nForeign Relations § 201 (1987).           Under the Restatement standard,\n\npolitical     recognition   —   typically     thought      of   as   \"a    formal\n\nacknowledgment by a nation that another entity possesses the\n\nqualifications for nationhood,\" N.Y. Chinese TV Programs, Inc. v.\n\nU.E. Enters., Inc., 954 F.2d 847, 853 (2d Cir. 1992) — is not a\n\nprerequisite to a finding of statehood. See Restatement (Third) of\n\nForeign Relations § 202 cmt. b (explaining that \"[a]n entity that\n\nsatisfies the requirements of § 201 is a state whether or not its\n\nstatehood is formally recognized by other states\").\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f              Using the Restatement standard as the rule of decision is\n\na colorable position.          In this regard, the Restatement tracks the\n\nhistorical        standard    found     in   international     law.    See   Nat'l\n\nPetrochem. Co. of Iran v. M/T Stolt Sheaf, 860 F.2d 551, 553 (2d\n\nCir. 1988); see also Convention on Rights and Duties of States\n\n(Montevideo Convention), Dec. 26, 1933, art. 1, 49 Stat. 3097,\n\n3100, 165 L.N.T.S. 19, 25.5             In addition, the FSIA's legislative\n\nhistory      is    itself     replete    with    congressional    references    to\n\nsovereign immunity's roots in international law.                 See, e.g., H.R.\n\nRep. No. 94-1487, at 7 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604,\n\n6605 (noting that the objective of the bill was to codify sovereign\n\nimmunity doctrine as recognized by international law and to ensure\n\nthat this international standard would be applied in federal\n\nlitigation).        The legislative history goes on to recount that the\n\nvery       foundation    of    foreign       sovereign    immunity    in   federal\n\njurisprudence rests on the Supreme Court's recognition of that\n\ndoctrine in The Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch)\n\n116 (1812).        There, the Court established that the federal courts\n\ngenerally      have     no   jurisdiction       over   suits   involving   foreign\n\nsovereigns with whom the United States is at peace, deriving such\n\nan immunity from the custom and practice of international law. Id.\n\nat 135-46.\n\n\n       5\n      The Montevideo Convention is still in effect and the United\nStates is a party to it.      See United States Dep't of State,\nTreaties in Force 480 (2004).\n\n                                         -20-\n\f           Over time, the federal courts came to rely less on\n\ninternational law and more on the actions of the State Department\n\nin determining whether to grant immunity in individual cases. H.R.\n\nRep. No. 94-1487, at 8, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6606.\n\nThe committee report that accompanied the FSIA noted that this\n\npractice was generally at odds with the views of the international\n\ncommunity; indeed, in \"virtually every country . . . sovereign\n\nimmunity is a question of international law to be determined by the\n\ncourts.\"   Id. at 9, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6607-08.           To\n\nthat end, Congress endeavored to bring the United States back into\n\nconformity with the world community by taking immunity decisions\n\nout of the hands of the executive branch and depositing them in the\n\njudicial branch.      Id. at 12, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n\n6610.   The committee report unequivocally restates the \"central\n\npremise of the bill\" as being that \"decisions on claims by foreign\n\nstates to sovereign immunity are best made by the judiciary on the\n\nbasis of a statutory regime which incorporates standards recognized\n\nunder   international    law.\"     Id.   at   14,    reprinted     in   1976\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6613 (emphasis supplied).\n\n           This legislative history offers strong support for the\n\nproposition   that   courts   should   look   to   international    law   to\n\ndetermine statehood for purposes of the FSIA.          The case law that\n\nhas evolved in the lower federal courts, while scanty, pushes in\n\nthe same direction.     See, e.g., Morgan Guar. Trust Co. v. Republic\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fof Palau, 924 F.2d 1237, 1243-47 (2d Cir. 1991) (using Restatement\n\nstandard to determine whether Palau qualified as a foreign state);\n\nKlinghoffer,    937    F.2d   at   47-49    (same   with   respect   to   PLO).\n\nConsequently, for purposes of this case, we accept the parties'\n\nagreement that the Restatement standard controls the statehood\n\nquestion.6\n\n                      B.   The Historical Background.\n\n             Following World War I, the League of Nations placed the\n\nregion of Palestine, formerly a part of the Ottoman Empire, under\n\na mandate.     The mandate system grew out of the idea that some\n\nformer colonies of nations defeated in World War I were \"not yet\n\nable to stand by themselves\" and should be placed under the\n\ntutelage of \"advanced nations.\"            League of Nations Covenant art.\n\n22, paras. 1, 2.       Palestine was among those territories deemed to\n\n\"have reached a stage of development where their existence as\n\n\n     6\n      We caution that the Restatement standard, though embraced by\nboth sides in this case, is not inevitably correct.      It may be\nargued that a foreign state, for purposes of the FSIA, is an entity\nthat has been recognized as a sovereign by the United States\ngovernment.   See, e.g., Ungar III, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 186-87\n(alternate holding); cf. 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller,\n& Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure § 3604 (2d ed.\n1984) (noting that for purposes of former 28 U.S.C. §\n1332(a)(2)(1970) — a statute modified by the FSIA — federal courts\ngenerally had held that a foreign state was one that had been\nrecognized as such by the United States government, in either a de\njure or de facto capacity (collecting cases)). Here, however, all\nroads lead to Rome. The defendants' sovereign immunity defense\nfails the Restatement test. See infra Part III(C). If recognition\nwere the test, the result would be the same. After all, the United\nStates has not recognized Palestine as a sovereign nation. Thus,\nwe need not probe the point too deeply.\n\n                                     -22-\n\findependent nations [could] be provisionally recognized,\" subject\n\nto   \"administrative        advice    and    assistance\"        from    more   mature\n\ngovernments.      Id. at para. 4.         The United Kingdom held the mandate\n\nover Palestine.         Rather than \"advice and assistance,\" however, the\n\npowers conferred were more akin to rule.                   Subject to implicit\n\nlimitations not relevant here, the mandate gave the United Kingdom\n\n\"full powers of legislation and of administration\" over the region,\n\nas   well   as    \"control    of    the   foreign    relations     of    Palestine.\"\n\nMandate for Palestine arts. 1, 12, League of Nations Doc. C.529\n\nM.314 1922 VI (1922).          The mandate also made the United Kingdom\n\nresponsible       for    \"placing     [Palestine]       under    such     political,\n\nadministrative       and     economic      conditions    as     will    secure    the\n\nestablishment of the Jewish national home.\"                Id. art. 2.\n\n            Heavy Jewish immigration to the region followed, owing in\n\nlarge part to the persecution of Jews in Europe.                  Tension between\n\nthe Jewish and Arab populations led to violence and civil unrest.\n\nSee United Nations Dep't of Pub. Info., The Question of Palestine\n\n& The United Nations at 3, U.N. Doc. DPI/2276, U.N. Sales No.\n\n04.I.15 (2003) (Question of Palestine).                   By 1947, the United\n\nKingdom's patience had worn thin.                It took steps to divest itself\n\nof the mandate and dump the problem into the lap of the United\n\nNations.    Id.\n\n            The United Nations rose to the occasion.                   It formulated\n\na plan that involved the creation of two independent states within\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fthe mandate territory:        one Jewish, the other Arab.            This plan also\n\npurposed to make Jerusalem an international enclave administered by\n\nthe United Nations.        See Future Gov't of Palestine, G.A. Res.\n\n181(II), U.N. GAOR, 2d Sess., at 131, U.N. Doc. A/519 (1947).                        The\n\nplan delineated the boundaries of the two states and the Jerusalem\n\nenclave, id. at 142-46; established a timetable for the withdrawal\n\nof British forces; and proposed to end the existing mandate no\n\nlater than August 1, 1948.              Id. at 132-33.              As the British\n\nwithdrew,    power    would     temporarily     vest    in     a    United      Nations\n\ncommission pending the establishment of provisional governments by\n\neach of the two putative states.            Id. at 133.        At that point, the\n\nprovisional       governments     would     \"progressively           receive\"      full\n\nadministrative responsibility.          Id. at 134.      When the independence\n\nof a state had \"become effective,\" that state would be accorded\n\n\"sympathetic consideration\" for admission to the United Nations.\n\nId. at 142.\n\n            The plan never took effect.               Although Jewish leaders\n\naccepted    it,    Palestinian    leaders      did   not.          See    Question    of\n\nPalestine at 10.      The Palestinians, still representing two-thirds\n\nof the population of the affected territory, argued vociferously\n\nagainst    partition.      Id.    at   7,     10.      Faced       with    a   steadily\n\ndeteriorating situation, the British abandoned the mandate and\n\nwithdrew from the region.         Id. at 11.        On the same date — May 14,\n\n1948 — Jewish leaders announced the establishment of the State of\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fIsrael, using the territorial boundaries delineated in G.A. Res.\n\n181(II) to demarcate its borders.         Id.\n\n             The next day, armed forces of the surrounding Arab states\n\nentered the former mandate territory.            Id.   The Arab League\n\nnotified the U.N.'s Secretary-General that they intended to fill\n\nthe vacuum left by the abrupt departure of the British forces and\n\nto restore law and order in the region.         See United Nations, The\n\nOrigins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem 137-38 (1990).\n\n             The Arab invasion precipitated the first Arab-Israeli\n\nwar.   Question of Palestine at 11.         During the conflict, nearly\n\nthree-quarters of a million Palestinian refugees fled Israeli-\n\ncontrolled territory.      Id. at 81.      By the time of the eventual\n\narmistice, Egypt had taken control of the Gaza Strip, Jordan was in\n\ncontrol of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), and Israel had\n\ntaken control of the remainder of the former mandate territory.\n\nId. at 12.\n\n             This division persisted until 1967, when war again broke\n\nout between Israel, on the one hand, and Egypt, Jordan, and Syria,\n\non the other hand.       Id. at 18.       Israel prevailed.   Its spoils\n\nincluded occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, as well as\n\nthe Sinai peninsula (previously under Egyptian rule) and the Golan\n\nHeights region of Syria.     Id.\n\n             The U.N.'s Security Council attempted to undo these gains\n\nby diplomatic means.     It issued a resolution that called for the\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f\"[w]ithdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in\n\nthe recent conflict\" and beseeched the protagonists to respect and\n\nacknowledge \"the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\n\nindependence of every State in the area.\"                 S.C.

The document did not directly address the\n\nquestion of Palestine.         The PLO, which had been formed in 1964,\n\nstrongly criticized the resolution for that reason.                   Question of\n\nPalestine at 19.\n\n            In   1968,   the    PLO     declared   that    the   international\n\ncommunity had failed to secure the rights of Palestinian Arabs and\n\nvowed to take up the struggle.          Id. at 31.      In 1973, a third Arab-\n\nIsraeli   war    led   the   Security    Council   to    renew   its    call    for\n\nimplementation of the terms of Resolution 242.              See S.C. Res. 338,\n\nU.N. SCOR, 28th Sess., Resolutions and Decisions, at 10, U.N. Doc.\n\nS/INF/29 (1973).       The following year, the United Nations General\n\nAssembly adopted two resolutions:             one affirming the rights of\n\nPalestinians to \"self-determination without external interference\"\n\nand to \"national independence, and sovereignty,\" and the other\n\ngranting the PLO observer status at the United Nations.

Question of Palestine at\n\n26-28.\n\n               On July 31, 1988, Jordan gave up its claims to the West\n\nBank.

Within a few weeks thereafter, the PLO, speaking from\n\nexile in Algeria, issued a \"Declaration of Independence\" that\n\nproclaimed the \"establishment of the State of Palestine in the land\n\nof Palestine with its capital at Jerusalem.\"               Palestine Nat'l\n\nCouncil:       Political Communique & Decl. of Indep., 27 I.L.M. 1660,\n\n1670 (1988).       In response, the United Nations decided to use the\n\nterm \"Palestine\" instead of \"Palestine Liberation Organization\"\n\nwithin the United Nations system, but expressly stated that this\n\nredesignation did not enhance the group's observer status.

Doc.\n\nA/43/49 (1988).\n\n               In 1993, the United States helped to broker the first\n\nagreement between Israel and the PLO.           Under its terms, Israel\n\naccepted the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people\n\nand the PLO acknowledged Israel's statehood. Question of Palestine\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fat 47.    This rapprochement culminated in the signing of the first\n\nof the Oslo Accords:         the Declaration of Principles on Interim\n\nSelf-Government Arrangements (DOP), Sept. 19, 1993, Isr.-P.L.O., 32\n\nI.L.M. 1525.      The DOP's stated purposes included the establishment\n\nof a Palestinian interim self-governing authority (the PA) as a\n\nprecursor to a permanent arrangement based on Security Council\n\nResolutions 242 and 338.       Id. art. I, 32 I.L.M. at 1527.        The DOP\n\ntreated the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a single territorial\n\nunit and stated that, when certain conditions had been achieved,\n\nIsrael    would   transfer   authority     over   \"education   and   culture,\n\nhealth, social welfare, direct taxation, and tourism\" in those\n\nareas to the PA.     Id. art. VI, 32 I.L.M. at 1529.      The DOP also set\n\nforth a framework for negotiating the structure of the PA.               Id.\n\nart. VII, 32 I.L.M. at 1530-31.       And, it specified that while the\n\nPA, when created, would be responsible for self-policing, Israel\n\nwould remain responsible for external security (including the\n\noverall safety of Israelis), in the affected territory.              Id. art.\n\nVIII, 32 I.L.M. at 1531.\n\n            The protagonists reached agreement as to the structure of\n\nthe PA in 1994, and the PA then became a reality.         See Agreement on\n\nthe Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area, May 4, 1994, Isr.-PLO, art.\n\nIV, 33 I.L.M. 622, 628.       On September 28, 1995, Israel and the PLO\n\nsigned the interim agreement called for in the DOP, aspiring to\n\nreach a    permanent    agreement   within    five   years.     See Interim\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fAgreement on the West Bank & the Gaza Strip, Sept. 28, 1995, Isr.-\n\nP.L.O.,      pmbl.,       36   I.L.M.      551,   558.        The    interim     agreement\n\nenumerated those powers and responsibilities to be transferred to\n\nthe PA. For example, it granted executive responsibility to the PA\n\nwith respect to \"all matters within its jurisdiction,\" including\n\nthe formulation of policies, the issuance of rules and regulations,\n\nand the making of contracts.                 Id. art. IX, 36 I.L.M. at 560-61.\n\nThe PA was, however, denied authority over foreign relations,\n\nincluding the establishment of embassies, the hiring of diplomatic\n\nstaff, and the exercise of diplomatic functions.7                          Id.   Moreover,\n\nthe    interim         agreement    took    pains      to    note   that    Israel   would\n\n\"continue         to    exercise     powers       and       responsibilities      not   so\n\ntransferred.\"           Id. art. I, 36 I.L.M. at 558.\n\n                 The drafters of the interim agreement considered the West\n\nBank       and    the     Gaza     Strip     as    a    single      territorial      unit.\n\nNevertheless, they subdivided the land within that unit into three\n\nmain zones, each under a different level of PA control.                           Id. art.\n\nXI, 36 I.L.M. at 561-62.             The overall framework required the PA to\n\npolice       the        Palestinian        populace         but     continued      Israeli\n\nresponsibility over external threats and border defense. Id. arts.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      The interim agreement permitted the PLO to conduct limited\nforeign affairs activities on behalf of the PA. Those activities\npertained only to economic, cultural, scientific, and educational\nmatters. Interim Agreement on the West Bank & the Gaza Strip art.\nIX, 36 I.L.M. at 560-61.\n\n                                            -29-\n\fXII-XIV, 36 I.L.M. at 562-63.           Israel also retained jurisdiction\n\nover all Israeli settlers living in the territory.                 Id.\n\n             The PA's legislative powers were similarly restricted.\n\nThe interim agreement specified that any law that \"amends or\n\nabrogates existing laws or military orders, which exceeds the\n\njurisdiction of the Council or which is otherwise inconsistent with\n\nthe    provisions    of   the   DOP,   this   Agreement,     or    of    any   other\n\nagreement that may be reached between the two sides during the\n\ninterim period, shall have no effect and shall be void ab initio.\"\n\nId. art. XVIII, 36 I.L.M. at 564-65.\n\n             In January of 1996, the PA held an election. Question of\n\nPalestine at 51.          Negotiations on a permanent settlement began\n\nshortly thereafter, but terrorist attacks stalled the process. Id.\n\nat 51-52.    The events giving rise to this case occurred during this\n\nperiod.\n\n             In August of 1998, the United Nations enhanced the PLO's\n\nobserver status, granting it the right to participate in General\n\nAssembly debate, albeit without a vote.              G.A. Res. 52/250, U.N.\n\nGAOR, 52d Sess., Supp. No. 49, at 4, U.N. Doc. A/52/49 (1998).\n\nThat October, Israel and the PLO signed the Wye River Memorandum (a\n\ndocument expressly subject to the terms of both the DOP and the\n\ninterim agreement).        See Wye River Memorandum (Interim Agreement),\n\nOct.   23,   1998,   Isr.-P.L.O.,      37   I.L.M.   1251.        This   marked   a\n\nrestarting of the peace process.            The following year, the parties\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fnegotiated a similar sort of interim agreement.                        See Sharm El-\n\nSheikh Memorandum, Sept. 4, 1999, Isr.-P.L.O., 38 I.L.M. 1465.                       In\n\n2000, however, the two sides failed in an effort to reach a final\n\nagreement.      Question      of   Palestine        at   54.       A    firestorm    of\n\nPalestinian attacks and Israeli reprisals ensued.                      Id. at 55.\n\n           In   2003,      the     Quartet      —    a     group       comprised     of\n\nrepresentatives of the United States, the European Union, the\n\nRussian Federation, and the United Nations — presented a \"road map\"\n\nsetting forth a series of aspirational steps designed to break the\n\nimpasse and move toward a permanent two-state solution in the\n\nregion.    See Letter Dated 7 May 2003 from the Secretary-General\n\nAddressed to the President of the Security Council, U.N. Doc.\n\nS/2003/529 (2003).\n\n           To date, Israel and the PLO have not traveled down the\n\nnewly mapped road.      Peace negotiations have been virtually non-\n\nexistent since    2000,    and     the   violence        continues.        There    is,\n\nhowever, a glimmer of hope:              the recent election of a new PA\n\npresident has thawed relations between the two sides and created a\n\nsense of anticipation that a meaningful peace process will resume.\n\nSee Steven Erlanger, Abbas Declares War With Israel Effectively\n\nOver, N.Y. Times, Feb. 14, 2005, at A1.\n\n                              C.   The Merits.\n\n           We   now   reach      the   merits   of       the   sovereign     immunity\n\ndefense.     In scrutinizing a district court's resolution of a\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fforeign sovereign immunity issue, we review factual findings for\n\nclear error and legal conclusions de novo.            Karaha Bodas Co. v.\n\nPerusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 313 F.3d 70, 80\n\n(2d Cir. 2002).   Here, the defendants' claim to sovereign immunity\n\nderives from their assertion that Palestine is a state, and the\n\nevidence presented    to   the   district     court   in   support    of   that\n\nassertion     consisted    entirely      of       indisputably       authentic\n\ninternational legal documents.     The district court's determination\n\nthat Palestine was not a state was premised on a legal conclusion:\n\nthe court determined that the defendants' documentary proffer did\n\nnot satisfy the legal standard derived from international law. Our\n\nreview of that decision is de novo.         Id.\n\n            International law defines a state as \"an entity that has\n\na defined territory and a permanent population, under the control\n\nof its own government, and that engages in, or has the capacity to\n\nengage in, formal relations with other such entities.\" Restatement\n\n(Third) of Foreign Relations § 201.         This definition derives from\n\nthe Montevideo Convention of 1933.            See supra Part III(A).        In\n\napplying this definition, some courts have subdivided the analysis\n\ninto four parts, asking whether the putative state (i) has a\n\ndefined territory and (ii) a permanent population, which (iii) is\n\nunder the control of its own government, and (iv) has the capacity\n\nto engage in foreign relations.       See, e.g., Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d\n\nat 47-48.\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\f          In practice, the third element is the most salient factor\n\nin the statehood calculus.          See Knox v. PLO, 306 F. Supp. 2d 424,\n\n434 (S.D.N.Y. 2004); see also James Crawford, The Creation of\n\nStates in International Law 42 (1979) (Creation of States).                  The\n\nRestatement's explanation of this element is rather sparse; it\n\nnotes only that \"[a] state need not have any particular form of\n\ngovernment,     but   there    must     be    some    authority     exercising\n\ngovernmental    functions     and    able    to   represent   the   entity    in\n\ninternational relations.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations\n\n§ 201 cmt. d.    To satisfy these requirements, a state's government\n\nmust, at a bare minimum, be independent and in general control of\n\nits territory, maintaining at least a modicum of law and order.8\n\nSee Creation of States at 45-46; see also Nii Lante Wallace-Bruce,\n\nClaims to Statehood in International Law 54 (1994) (explaining that\n\nwhat is required \"is a coherent system of authority structures\n\nregulating . . . the territory under that government's control\").\n\nIn short, the existence of a state demands a community integrated\n\nand organized as a political unit.           See 1 Robert Jennings & Arthur\n\nWatts, Oppenheim's International Law 122 (9th ed. 1992).                     Its\n\ngovernment must speak for the state as a whole; the mere presence\n\nof independent tribes or factions within a territory, lacking\n\n\n     8\n      Of course, if statehood exists at a finite point in time, it\nis not terminated by belligerent occupation, without more. See\nRestatement (Third) of Foreign Relations § 201, reporter's note 3\n(explaining that \"[m]ilitary occupation, whether during war or\nafter an armistice, does not terminate statehood\").\n\n                                      -33-\n\fcommon institutions, cannot constitute a government in control.\n\nSee Western Sahara, 1975 I.C.J. 12, 63 (Oct. 16).\n\n            The first, second, and fourth elements are dependent on\n\n(or, sometimes, subsumed by) the third.           As to the first — defined\n\nterritory — the \"only requirement is that the State must consist of\n\na certain coherent territory effectively governed.\"               Creation of\n\nStates at 40.      As such, this element is merely a function of\n\nindependence and governmental control.             Id.     So too the second\n\nelement, which typically is satisfied by showing a permanent\n\npopulation within the defined territory.            See id. at 40-42.       The\n\nrelationships    of    these   elements    with   the    all-important   third\n\nelement is readily evident.        As one court put it, the question is\n\nessentially whether the entity claiming statehood has a \"defined\n\nterritory under its control\" and a \"permanent population under its\n\ncontrol.\"    Knox, 306 F. Supp. 2d at 434 (emphasis in original).\n\n            The fourth element — \"capacity to engage in foreign\n\nrelations\"   —   focuses   on    \"competence,     within    [a   state's]   own\n\nconstitutional system, to conduct international relations with\n\nother states, as well as the political, technical, and financial\n\ncapabilities to do so.\"        Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations\n\n§ 201 cmt. e.         Again, this is a function of independence and\n\neffective government control. See Creation of States at 47-48. In\n\nthat sense, then, it too is dependent on the third element.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\f              We add that the party who alleges sovereign immunity has\n\nthe burden of proving that status.              See Drexel Burnham Lambert\n\nGroup, Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers, 12 F.3d 317, 325 (2d Cir. 1993);\n\nAlberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense de la Carne, 705 F.2d 250, 253 (7th\n\nCir. 1983).         With this in mind, we move from the general to the\n\nspecific.\n\n              The defendants argue that the state of Palestine exists;\n\nthat they      constitute     core   elements   of   that    state;   and   that,\n\ntherefore, they are immune from suit under the FSIA (and, thus,\n\nunder the ATA).        This argument has a quicksilver quality:             it is\n\nhard to pin down exactly when or how the defendants assert that\n\nPalestine achieved statehood.          At various points in their briefs,\n\nthey   hint    at    three   possibilities:      (i)   the   period   from    the\n\nbeginning of the mandate through the 1967 Arab-Israeli war; (ii)\n\nthe period from the end of that war up until the creation of the\n\nPalestinian Authority (1994); and (iii) the period from 1994\n\nforward.      In an abundance of caution, we consider whether the\n\ndefendants have made a prima facie showing of statehood at any such\n\njuncture.\n\n              For each of the three periods, the defendants' proffer is\n\nmuch the same anent the first and second elements of the test for\n\nstatehood.     With respect to the first, the defendants consistently\n\nclaim that Palestine comprises the territory defined by Security\n\nCouncil Resolution 242, that is, those portions of the once and\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fformer mandate territory occupied by Israel during the 1967 war\n\n(including the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem).\n\nWith respect to the second element, the defendants asseverate that\n\nthis territory has had a permanent population from time immemorial\n\n(and, thus, that it had such a population throughout the three\n\nperiods with which we are concerned).            Assuming, arguendo, the\n\naccuracy of these averments, the focus shifts to the third prong of\n\nthe test for statehood.        At that stage, the question becomes\n\nwhether the defendants have shown that the identified territory and\n\npopulation are self-governing. In answering this question, we look\n\nseparately at each period.\n\n          1.    The Initial Period.        As to the pre-1967 period, the\n\ndefendants' argument seems to be that the territory that comprised\n\nthe Palestinian portion of the mandate was a state prior to,\n\nduring, and after the mandate.        Their support for this thesis is\n\nvery weak; they assert only that throughout this interval there\n\nwere local governmental institutions in place that catered to the\n\nPalestinian populace.\n\n          This assertion is manifestly insufficient to make the\n\ndefendants' prima facie case of statehood.          The third element of\n\nthe test requires governmental independence and control of a\n\ndefined territory.      That element plainly was not satisfied while\n\nthe defined territory was part of the Ottoman Empire; even if the\n\nPalestinian    people   exercised    operating    control   over   domestic\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\fgovernmental functions in the region — and the defendants offer\n\nnothing to support such a claim — that would not be sufficient to\n\nshow the existence of an independent political unit that controlled\n\nthe territory.\n\n              The same is true for the latter portions of the period.\n\nDuring the currency of the mandate, the United Kingdom exercised\n\nsuzerainty     over     the   administration            and   laws    of   the    defined\n\nterritory.      See Klausner v. Levy, 83 F. Supp. 599, 600 (E.D. Va.\n\n1949).      Following the United Kingdom's relinquishment of the\n\nmandate and the onset of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Israelis\n\noccupied much of the land designated for a future Arab state, and\n\nthe Egyptians and Jordanians seized the rest.                        The net result is\n\nthat, at all times, other states had control over the defined\n\nterritory.\n\n              The   defendants     resist         the   obvious      conclusion.       In\n\nparticular,      they    rely    upon    United         Nations      General     Assembly\n\nResolution 181(II), noting that it called for an independent Arab\n\nstate to come into existence no later than October 1, 1948, and\n\nthat   this    became    a    reality        in   the    sense    that     \"Palestinian\n\ngovernment institutions continued to function under Egyptian and\n\nJordanian      occupation       much    as    they      had   under     the    Mandate.\"\n\nAppellants' Br. at 21.          These assertions are insufficient to show\n\nthat a political unit was in control of the defined territory and\n\npopulace.      The mere fact that the United Nations conceived an\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\faspirational plan for Palestinian statehood does not establish the\n\nexistence of a state.     Nor does the fact that the Egyptians and\n\nJordanians occupied and controlled a significant portion of the\n\ndefined territory immediately following the end of the mandate aid\n\nthe defendants' cause.      To the contrary, the fact is a stark\n\nreminder that no state of Palestine could have come into being at\n\nthat time.     See Knox, 306 F. Supp. 2d at 437 (noting that under\n\n\"international law, a state will maintain its statehood during a\n\nbelligerent occupation . . . but it would be anomalous indeed to\n\nhold that a state may achieve sufficient independence and statehood\n\nin the first instance while subject to and laboring under the\n\nhostile military occupation of a separate sovereign\").\n\n          2.     The Middle Period.    The interval following the\n\noccupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by Israel in 1967 is\n\nno more promising.   With respect to this time span, the defendants\n\nrely heavily on Security Council Resolution 242 and its hortatory\n\ncall for Israeli withdrawal from \"territories occupied in the\n\nrecent conflict\" and for all states to respect and acknowledge \"the\n\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of\n\nevery State in the area.\"    That reliance is mislaid.   There is a\n\nvast difference between what should be and what is; the fact that\n\nsome political leaders recognize that particular territory should\n\ncomprise a state does not make that territory a state under the\n\nprevailing principles of international law.\n\n\n                                -38-\n\f             What counts is that the defendants have not presented any\n\nevidence     indicating       that   Palestine     actually     became   a   state\n\nfollowing Israel's conquest of the lands previously occupied by\n\nJordan and Egypt.        The one circumstance to which the defendants\n\nadvert — that the Israelis did not dismantle the local governmental\n\ninstitutions in the region — is wholly inadequate to show that\n\nthere was a Palestinian state underlying the Israeli occupation.\n\nThe territory went directly from Jordanian/Egyptian control to\n\nIsraeli     control,    thus     undermining      the     defendants'    statehood\n\nargument.     See id.\n\n             To be sure, the defendants point proudly to the U.N.'s\n\n1974 recognition of the PLO.               We do not minimize the political\n\nsignificance of that event.                The fact remains, however, that\n\nneither political recognition of the PLO nor United Nations support\n\nfor self-governance is sufficient to signify that the Restatement's\n\nconditions for statehood have been met.                 See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d\n\nat   48    (noting   that     the    PLO   did    not    satisfy   the   objective\n\nrequirements for statehood despite its political recognition by\n\nsome foreign states).\n\n             3. The Most Recent Period. The defendants' argument for\n\ncurrent statehood posits that Palestine's changing status over the\n\nlast decade marked the emergence of the defined territory from\n\nIsraeli control and the establishment of a Palestinian government\n\nin   its    place.      The    PLO's   1988      declaration    of   independence\n\n\n                                       -39-\n\fadumbrated    the    inception    of   this   period.     The   period    itself\n\ncommenced, however, in 1994, the signal event being the creation of\n\nthe PA as an entity having some lawful authority in the West Bank\n\nand Gaza.    The defendants suggest that this development signified\n\nthe birth of a government sufficiently in control of the defined\n\nterritory to satisfy the third element of the Restatement test. We\n\nreject the suggestion.\n\n             Undoubtedly,   the    agreements    to     which   the   defendants\n\nallude vested some autonomy in the newly created PA.                     But the\n\nauthority so transferred was limited and, during and after that\n\ntransition, Israel explicitly reserved control over all matters not\n\ntransferred.        See Interim Agreement art. I, 36 I.L.M. at 558.\n\nSeveral of these reserved powers are incompatible with the notion\n\nthat the PA had independent governmental control over the defined\n\nterritory.    To illustrate, the interim agreement expressly denied\n\nthe PA the right to conduct foreign relations, id. art. IX, 36\n\nI.L.M. at 561; left Israel with an undiminished ability to defend\n\nand control the territorial borders, id. art. XII, 36 I.L.M. at\n\n562; denied the PA the right to create or maintain either an army\n\nor a navy,9 id. art. XIV, 36 I.L.M. at 563; retained Israeli\n\ncontrol over the territorial airspace, id. at Annex I, art. XIII,\n\n\n\n     9\n      The PA was permitted to organize a police force, but this\nforce had no jurisdiction over Israeli citizens within the\nterritory. See Interim Agreement at Annex I, art. XI, 36 I.L.M. at\n585.\n\n                                       -40-\n\f36 I.L.M. at 586; and placed severe restrictions on the PA's\n\nlawmaking ability (declaring, inter alia, that any laws passed in\n\ncontravention of the DOP would be void ab initio), id. art. XVIII,\n\n36 I.L.M. at 565.    These restrictions remain in effect.      It is,\n\ntherefore, transparently clear that the PA has not yet exercised\n\nsufficient governmental control over Palestine to satisfy the third\n\nelement of the Restatement test.     See Geoffrey R. Watson, The Oslo\n\nAccords 68-72 (2000) (concluding that \"there was no Palestinian\n\nstate at the time of the signing of the Interim Agreement\"); D.J.\n\nHarris, Cases and Materials on International Law 226 (5th ed. 1998)\n\n(concluding   that   the   interim   agreement   \"fall[s]   short   of\n\n[achieving] statehood for the Palestinian people\"); United Nations\n\nComm'n on Human Rights, Question of the Violation of Human Rights\n\nin the Occupied Arab Territories, Including Palestine at 12, U.N.\n\nDoc. E/Cn.4/2001/121 (2001) (noting that, as of 2001, Palestine\n\n\"still falls short of the accepted criteria of statehood\").10\n\n          The defendants do not deny that these limitations are\n\nincompatible with statehood, but, rather, contend that they were\n\nimposed by force and that the Israeli occupation is all that is\n\n\n     10\n       Indeed, this conclusion dovetails with the conclusion reached\nby a prominent legal advisor to the PLO during the 1999-2000 peace\ntalks.    See Omar M. Dajani, Stalled Between Seasons:           The\nInternational Legal Status of Palestine During the Interim Period,\n26 Denv. J. Int'l L. & Pol'y 27, 86 (1997) (remarking that \"the\ninterim character and extraordinarily limited powers of the PA make\nit impossible to characterize that body as the 'effective\ngovernment' of the [territory]\"; see also Omar Dajani, On a Better\nRoad This Time in the Mideast?, Wash. Post, May 4, 2003, at B1.\n\n                                -41-\n\fpreventing the full exercise of the prerogatives of statehood. The\n\nproblem with this contention is that it presupposes that Palestine\n\nwas a state before the Israeli occupation — and the defendants have\n\nnot shown that it was.       See Knox, 306 F. Supp. 2d at 437.\n\n            We   recognize     that   the    status      of   the   Palestinian\n\nterritories is in many ways sui generis.                  Here, however, the\n\ndefendants have not carried their burden of showing that Palestine\n\nsatisfied the requirements for statehood under the applicable\n\nprinciples of international law at any point in time.                In view of\n\nthe unmistakable legislative command that sovereign immunity shall\n\nonly be accorded to states — a command reflected in both the FSIA\n\nand the ATA — the defendants' sovereign immunity defense must fail.\n\nIV.    THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT\n\n            We come now to the defendants' protest that they were\n\nentitled    to   a   final   determination    on   the    sovereign    immunity\n\nquestion (including appellate review) before they could be required\n\nto bear any of the burdens of litigation.                     In mounting this\n\nprotest, the defendants place great weight on In re Papandreou, 139\n\nF.3d 247 (D.C. Cir. 1998).       There, the Greek governmental entities\n\nand officials moved to dismiss claims against them on grounds of\n\nlack   of   in   personam    jurisdiction,    forum   non      conveniens,   and\n\nsovereign immunity.      Id. at 249.     The plaintiffs sought discovery\n\nfor the limited purpose of determining whether FSIA's \"commercial\n\nactivity\" exemption applied.          See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2).            The\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fdefendants objected and asked the district court to adjudicate\n\ntheir   other        non-merits-based       defenses        before    allowing       any\n\ndiscovery.         Papandreou, 139 F.3d at 254.                  The district court\n\nauthorized the jurisdictional discovery, including the depositions\n\nof several Greek cabinet ministers.                 Id. at 249.       The defendants\n\npetitioned for a writ of mandamus and the court of appeals obliged.\n\nThe   court    held       (i)    that   there    were     less   intrusive    ways    of\n\ndetermining the applicability of the FSIA exemption, and (ii) that\n\nthe trial court should have grappled with the non-merits-based\n\ndefenses      before      subjecting      the    defendants      to   jurisdictional\n\ndiscovery.         Id. at 254.\n\n              We     do    not    lightly       dismiss    the    reasoning    behind\n\nPapandreou. Had the defendants in this case raised their sovereign\n\nimmunity defense in a timely manner, their argument that they were\n\nentitled to adjudication of that defense before proceeding with the\n\nmerits of the litigation might have some force.                        After all, a\n\ndistrict court's denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint on the\n\nground of foreign sovereign immunity is immediately appealable\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine.                      See Price v. Socialist\n\nPeople's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 389 F.3d 192, 196 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2004); S & Davis Int'l, Inc. v. Republic of Yemen, 218 F.3d 1292,\n\n1295 (11th Cir. 2000); Transatlantic Shiffahrtskontor GmbH v.\n\nShanghai Foreign Trade Corp., 204 F.3d 384, 387 (2d Cir. 2000);\n\nJungquist v. Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, 115 F.3d 1020,\n\n\n                                          -43-\n\f1025 (D.C. Cir. 1997).   And such an appeal ordinarily divests the\n\ndistrict court of jurisdiction to proceed with the litigation\n\npending its resolution. See Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez, 341 F.3d\n\n86, 93 (1st Cir. 2003); Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F.2d 1335, 1338\n\n(7th Cir. 1989); see also Eckert Int'l, Inc. v. Gov't of Sovereign\n\nDemocratic Republic of Fiji, 834 F. Supp. 167, 175 (E.D. Va. 1993)\n\n(noting that foreign state's non-frivolous interlocutory sovereign\n\nimmunity appeal divests district court of jurisdiction).\n\n          These principles are not absolute.     None of the cited\n\ncases stand for the proposition that sovereign immunity is a trump\n\ncard that may be held in reserve until a defendant sees fit to play\n\nit, thus enabling the defendant to stop the litigation in its\n\ntracks at a time of its choosing.   That is simply not the law.   As\n\nwe have explained in a related context, \"in exchange for the\n\ndefendant's right to interrupt the judicial process, the court may\n\nexpect a reasonable modicum of diligence in the exercise of that\n\nright.\"   Guzmán-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 98 F.3d 664, 668-69 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (quoting Kennedy v. City of Cleveland, 797 F.2d 297, 301\n\n(6th Cir. 1986)). Demanding such diligence is \"virtually essential\n\nto orderly judicial management of the vexing procedural problems\"\n\n\n\n\n                               -44-\n\fthat accompany assertions of immunity.11   Fisichelli v. City Known\n\nas Town of Methuen, 884 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            The defendants, for whatever reason, elected not to\n\nassert sovereign immunity in either of their first two motions to\n\ndismiss.    By the time that the district court ordered the entry of\n\na default, the defendants still had not moved to dismiss on the\n\nground of sovereign immunity.    The district court found, and the\n\ndefendants' own words appear to confirm, that this recalcitrance\n\nwas intentional and designed to accomplish some obscure strategic\n\naim.    See Ungar IV, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 23-24.\n\n            Given this sequence of events, the defendants' arguments\n\nare unpersuasive.    Here, as contemplated in Papandreou, discovery\n\nwas stayed until the defendants had a full determination of the\n\nnon-merits-based defenses that they initially chose to assert\n\n(including insufficiency of process, forum non conveniens, and lack\n\nof in personam jurisdiction).    After rejecting those defenses and\n\ndenying two motions to dismiss, the district court in effect\n\n\n       11\n      Of course, an entity alleging an entitlement to sovereign\nimmunity may choose to ignore an action or court order directed at\nit, accept a default, and then assert its immunity at a later state\nof the litigation. But such a choice represents a rather risky\ngamble. If the assertion of immunity is valid, the defendant wins\nthe entire pot (i.e., it walks away from the suit unscathed) but if\nthe assertion of immunity fails, the defendant loses outright\n(i.e., it must live with the default). There is no need to engage\nin such high-stakes wagering.       A defendant may both assert\nsovereign immunity and defend on the merits. See MCI Telecomm.\nCorp. v. Alhadhood, 82 F.3d 658, 662 (5th Cir. 1996); Practical\nConcepts, Inc. v. Republic of Bolivia, 811 F.2d 1543, 1547 (D.C.\nCir. 1987).\n\n                                -45-\n\fordered the litigation to proceed.       The defendants — who to that\n\npoint had not raised a sovereign immunity defense — nonetheless\n\nrefused either to answer the amended complaint or to comply with\n\nthe court's discovery orders.    In view of this history, we believe\n\nthat the district court acted well within the encincture of its\n\ndiscretion in entering the default.       See Compania Interamericana\n\nExport-Import, S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviacion, 88 F.3d\n\n948, 951-52 (11th Cir. 1996) (permitting entry of default against\n\nforeign state due to its willful failure to comply with court\n\norders).    The   defendants   deliberately   chose   to   hold   off   on\n\nasserting a sovereign immunity defense — and they must live with\n\nthe consequences of that choice.12\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.       The defendants have not shown\n\nthat this case involves nonjusticiable political questions.             By\n\nlike token, they have not shown that Palestine is a state and, as\n\na consequence, they do not have available to them the buckler of\n\nsovereign immunity.     Consequently, they cannot set aside the\n\n\n     12\n      We recognize, of course, that the existence vel non of\nforeign sovereign immunity implicates federal subject matter\njurisdiction. Thus, the failure to raise the defense in a timely\nmanner cannot result in a waiver. See, e.g., Haven v. Polska, 215\nF.3d 727, 733 (7th Cir. 2000). Nevertheless, a failure of that\nkind can appropriately affect the trial court's management of the\nlitigation. See, e.g., Bolduc v. United States, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n(1st Cir. 2005) [No. 03-2081, slip op. at 9] (explaining that \"the\nbelated filing of a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter\njurisdiction can have consequences in terms of a court's case-\nmanagement decisions\"). That is the situation here.\n\n                                 -46-\n\fjudgment on that ground.   And, finally, they have failed to show\n\nthat the district court acted precipitously either in entering a\n\ndefault or in reducing the default to judgment.   Accordingly, we\n\nreject their appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -47-\n\f",

In it, the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) ask us to countermand the district court's refusal to dismiss the action against them. They contend that the case hinges on a nonjusticiable political question and that, at any rate, the defendants enjoy sovereign immunity. In the event that these arguments do not carry the day, the defendants seek vacation of two $116,000,000-plus default judgments, one entered against each of them, on the ground that they were entitled to a binding determination of sovereign immunity (including appellate review of any unfavorable decision) before being forced to bear the burdens of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration of the relevant legal authorities and perscrutation of an amplitudinous record, we conclude that this case is justiciable; that the defendants have not established an entitlement to sovereign immunity; and that the defendants' strategic litigation choices undercut their arguments as to the sequencing of the litigation.

On that date, Yaron Ungar (a citizen of the United States), his wife Efrat, and their infant son Yishai were driving home from a wedding. Near Beit Shemesh, a car approached the Ungars' vehicle and loosed a salvo of machine-gun fire, killing both Yaron and Efrat. The three occupants of the attacking vehicle were all members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States Department of State. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1189; Redesignation of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, 68 Fed.Reg. 56,860, 56,861 (Oct. 2, 2003).

We need not call the roll; for all practical purposes, the case boils down to a suit involving the estate and heirs of Yaron Ungar as plaintiffs and the PA and the PLO as defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The centerpiece of the complaint was an allegation that the defendants had engaged in international terrorism within the purview of the ATA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2331(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an ensuing motion to dismiss, the district court rejected an assertion that the PA and the PLO were immune from service of process. <i>Estates of Ungar ex rel. Strachman v. Palestinian Auth.,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d 76, 90-91 (D.R.I.2001) (<i>Ungar I</i>). However, the court dismissed the state law claims, finding that Rhode Island choice-of-law principles favored the application of Israeli law. <i>Id.</i> at 98-99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs served an amended complaint on August 23, 2001, asserting one claim under the ATA and three Israeli law claims, all on behalf of the estate and heirs of Yaron Ungar. The PA and the PLO moved to dismiss the amended complaint on essentially the same grounds as previously urged, adding only that the claims were nonjusticiable. Alternatively, they sought to have the district court certify, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> various questions, including a question as to whether the defendants were entitled to a non-specific \"functional\" immunity \"arising from the peculiar status of the PA as a functioning governmental entity.\" At that point, the defendants were not claiming statehood; they argued only that the policy considerations underlying the ATA's recognition of immunity for foreign states \"appl[ied] equally\" to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PA and the PLO later changed their position. On January 30, 2002 &#8212; during the pendency of their motion to dismiss the amended complaint &#8212; they jointly moved for \"leave to assert defenses.\" In the memorandum accompanying that motion, they for the first time claimed an immunity from suit based on sovereignty. They explained that they initially had chosen not to seek immunity on the basis of statehood and suggested that emergent political events in their region had caused a change of plan. The motion for leave to assert defenses was a curiosity &#8212; the defendants had not yet answered the amended complaint and were free to assert, by motion to dismiss or otherwise, any colorable defense &#8212; and the district court never acted on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same time frame, the defendants moved for a stay of discovery and the plaintiffs moved for an order compelling discovery. The court granted the requested stay pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On November 4, 2002, the district court denied the dismissal motion and dissolved the stay. The court flatly rejected the claim of nonjusticiability. <i>Estates of Ungar ex rel. Strachman v. Palestinian Auth.,</i> 228 F.Supp.2d 40, 44-47 (D.R.I.2002) (<i>Ungar II</i>). It also determined that the amended complaint stated claims upon which relief could be granted both under the ATA and under Israeli law. <i>Id.</i> at 47-48. Finally, the court reiterated its earlier rejection of the defendants' claim of immunity from service of process and added that the PA, as a governmental entity, was not a sovereign state immune from suit under the ATA. <i>Id.</i> at 48-49. Finally, the court declined the defendants' invitation to certify questions for interlocutory review. <i>Id.</i> at 49-51 (citing <i>Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro,</i> 937 F.2d 44, 47-49 (2d Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PA and the PLO moved for reconsideration and again asked for a stay. Some two months later, the district court granted the plaintiffs' outstanding motion to compel discovery, giving the defendants additional time to respond due to their overseas location. The defendants nonetheless moved for reconsideration of the discovery order and submitted a letter from Palestine's permanent observer at the United Nations, which stated that the defendants could not be expected to respond to discovery due to the unremitting violence in the region. The letter suggested that the defendants should be allowed to wait until there was a final decision on the jurisdictional question before being forced to attend to the discovery requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 2003, the plaintiffs moved for an entry of default based on the defendants' failure to answer the amended complaint. Six weeks later, the district court denied the defendants' pending motion to reconsider the order compelling discovery. On April 11, the court held a hearing on the defendants' outstanding motion to reconsider its decision in <i>Ungar II.</i> The court indicated from the bench that it would deny both that motion and the concomitant request for a stay, but it did not actually enter such an order until April 22, 2003. Meanwhile, a magistrate judge entered the requested default, concluding that the defendants' failure to answer the amended complaint and their refusal to participate in discovery were the result of a deliberate strategic choice. The default was posted on the docket on April 21, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed a notice of appeal to this court on April 23, 2003, in which they sought interlocutory review of both the lower court's decision in <i>Ungar II</i> and that court's refusal to reconsider that decision. They averred that they had been deprived of the opportunity to make a showing of sovereign immunity because the district court failed to take action on their motion for leave to assert a sovereign immunity defense, yet proceeded to determine that the defendants had no entitlement to immunity. We summarily affirmed the orders appealed from, noting that the defendants had neither moved to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity nor attempted, in the lower court, to make the evidentiary showing required to sustain such a defense. <i>Ungar v. Palestinian Liberation Org.,</i> No. 03-1544, 2003 WL 21254790, at *1 (1st Cir. May 27, 2003) (per curiam) (unpublished). We added that the defendants' motion for leave to assert a defense was wholly gratuitous, as they did not need the court's permission to raise the sovereign immunity issue at that stage of the case. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We issued our order without prejudice to the defendants' future efforts to press their newly asserted sovereign immunity defense in an appropriate fashion. <i>See id.</i> (admonishing that the defendants \"must adhere to the rules that govern all litigants\"). The next pleading, however, came from the plaintiffs, who moved for a default judgment. The defendants responded by filing their third motion to dismiss. This time, they predicated the motion on three bases, namely, (i) that the case centered around nonjusticiable political questions; (ii) that the defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1602-1611; and (iii) that section 2337(2) of the ATA, which provides that a suit under section 2333 may not be maintained against \"a foreign state [or] an agency of a foreign state,\" independently divested the district court of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties were like ships passing in the night. Pursuing the plaintiffs' path, the magistrate judge, on March 31, 2004, recommended the entry of default judgments against the PA and the PLO in amounts exceeding $116,000,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The defendants interposed timely objections to the report and recommendation, reasserting their nonjusticiability and sovereign immunity points and contending, for the first time, that they were entitled to a final determination on sovereign immunity (including appellate review) before being required either to answer the complaint or to submit to discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the district court had been pursuing the course charted by the defendants. On April 23, 2004, it denied the defendants' renewed motion to dismiss the amended complaint. <i>Estates of Ungar v. Palestinian Auth.,</i> 315 F.Supp.2d 164, 187 (D.R.I.2004) (<i>Ungar III</i>). The court hewed to its earlier rejection of the defendants' nonjusticiability thesis. <i>See id.</i> at 173-74 (referencing <i>Ungar II,</i> 228 F.Supp.2d at 44-47). Next, the court held that the FSIA and section 2337(2) of the ATA were two sides of the same coin with respect to sovereign immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 174-75. This left only a single question: \"whether the PA and/or the PLO represent or constitute a foreign State and are thus entitled to sovereign immunity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 175. The court answered that question in the negative. <i>Id.</i> at 176-87. The plaintiffs immediately moved to amend the court's order pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), arguing that the sovereign immunity defense had been waived. The defendants did nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 2004, the district court went down the plaintiffs' path. It adopted the magistrate judge's \"default judgment\" report and recommendation in its totality, overruled the defendants' objections thereto, and denied the plaintiffs' motion to amend <i>Ungar III. See Estates of Ungar &amp; Ungar ex rel. Strachman v. Palestinian Auth.,</i> 325 F.Supp.2d 15, 21-22, 26-28 (D.R.I.2004) (<i>Ungar IV</i>). In the course of that decision, the court rebuffed the defendants' claim that they were entitled to a full review of their sovereign immunity defense before being required to answer the complaint or proceed further. <i>Id.</i> at 23-24. The court then ordered judgment for the plaintiffs in the recommended amounts. <i>Id.</i> at 28. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants maintain that the complaint against them should have been dismissed because it presents a non-justiciable political question. We find this argument unconvincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Baker v. Carr,</i> 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), the Supreme Court provided guidance as to the attributes of a nonjusticiable political question. The Court explained that \"it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government ... which gives rise to the `political question.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 210, 82 S.Ct. 691. Withal, not \"every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 211, 82 S.Ct. 691. Determining justiciability requires an \"analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences of judicial action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 211-12, 82 S.Ct. 691. The Court then set forth six tests designed to confirm or negate the existence of a political question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 217, 82 S.Ct. 691. The Court explained, in a later case, that \"[t]hese tests are probably listed in descending order of both importance and certainty.\" <i>Vieth v. Jubelirer,</i> 541 U.S. 267, 124 S.Ct. 1769, 1776, 158 L.Ed.2d 546 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants assert with little elaboration that the central issue in this case fails each of the six tests. Most of their argumentation presumes that the district court intruded into forbidden territory when it interpreted an array of United Nations resolutions and Israeli-PLO agreements in a politically controversial manner. To this they add that the default judgment entered by the district court was so huge that it amounted to a political statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' position rests on a misunderstanding of the fundamental nature of this action. This is a tort suit brought under a legislative scheme that Congress enacted for the express purpose of providing a legal remedy for injuries or death occasioned by acts of international terrorism. The defendants are organizations that allegedly violated the statute. They have attempted to avoid liability by wrapping themselves in the cloak of sovereign immunity. The question we must answer, then, is whether the defendants have set forth sufficient evidence to support their claim of immunity &#8212; no more and no less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this view of the case, the plaintiffs easily clear the six <i>Baker</i> hurdles. To begin, the lower court's immunity decision neither signaled an official position on behalf of the United States with respect to the political recognition of Palestine nor amounted to the usurpation of a power committed to some other branch of government. After all, Congress enacted the ATA, and the President signed it. The very purpose of the law is to allow the courts to determine questions of sovereign immunity under a legal, as opposed to a political, regime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Seen in this light, the district court's decision denying immunity did not impede the constitutional prerogatives of the political branches over foreign policy. <i>See generally Baker,</i> 369 U.S. at 211 &amp; n. 31, 82 S.Ct. 691 (noting that the Constitution commits foreign relations to the executive and legislative branches, thus permitting them to determine what \"may be done in the exercise of this political power\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third <i>Baker</i> hurdles present no insuperable obstacles here. The district court had access to judicially manageable standards for resolving the issue before it, <i>see infra</i> Part III(A), and those standards did not require the court to make nonjudicial policy determinations. Both sides agreed that the definition of a \"state\" under the relevant statutes was informed by an objective test rooted in international law and articulated in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations. Under these circumstances, the determination of whether the defendants have adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy that definition is quintessentially appropriate for a judicial body. <i>See Kadic v. Karadzic,</i> 70 F.3d 232, 249 (2d Cir.1995)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final three hurdles need not concern us. These tests are \"relevant only if judicial resolution of a question would contradict prior decisions taken by a political branch in those limited contexts where such contradiction would seriously interfere with important governmental interests.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the political branches have enacted a law that leaves undiminished their ability either to recognize or withhold recognition from foreign states, while leaving to the courts the responsibility of determining the existence vel non of statehood for jurisdictional purposes. Moreover, the district court's resolution of that question is not incompatible with any formal position thus far taken by the political branches. By the same token, its jurisdictional decision does not turn a blind eye to any position expressed by those responsible for conducting the nation's foreign relations. <i>Cf. Republic of Austria v. Altmann,</i> 541 U.S. 677, 124 S.Ct. 2240, 2255, 159 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004) (noting that the State Department has retained authority to file \"statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity\"). As a result, the decision did not signify a lack of respect for, or conflict with, the wishes of the political branches. No more is exigible for this purpose. <i>See Baker,</i> 369 U.S. at 212-13, 82 S.Ct. 691 (endorsing judicial competence in matters touching on foreign relations in the absence of any \"conclusive governmental action\" or \"recognizedly authoritative executive declaration\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants make a number of specific arguments, but these are largely derivative of their disagreement with the result reached by the district court. Their unhappiness is understandable, but legally irrelevant. The reality is that, in these tempestuous times, any decision of a United States court on matters relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will engender strong feelings. Be that as it may, the capacity to stir emotions is not enough to render an issue nonjusticiable. For jurisdictional purposes, courts must be careful to distinguish between political questions and cases having political overtones. <i>See Klinghoffer,</i> 937 F.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one remaining argument that warrants particularized attention is the defendants' assertion that the district court made a political statement in calibrating the size of the award. That assertion is wholly unsupported. The judgment reflects the wrongful death of a youthful man and includes a trebling of damages as mandated by law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2333(a). It also includes attorneys' fees. <i>See id.</i> The defendants have not challenged either the measure of damages utilized by the lower court or the integrity of its mathematical computations. We add, moreover, that even if the court erred on the side of generosity &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; a mere error in the calculation of a damages award would not implicate the propriety of federal subject matter jurisdiction. We therefore reject the defendants'\"political statement\" assertion as meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this aspect of the case would be supererogatory. The short of it is that the political question doctrine does not preclude judicial resolution of the plaintiffs' case. We turn, therefore, to the merits of the sovereign immunity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the defendants' sovereign immunity defense into segments, starting with the legal framework and historical background. We then proceed to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FSIA, with exceptions not relevant here, provides that \"a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1604. Although the statute does not define the term \"foreign state,\" it makes pellucid that the term includes \"a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1603(a). It also defines what constitutes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1603(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ATA contains analogous language. It provides that no civil action thereunder may be maintained against \"a foreign state, an agency of a foreign state, or an officer or employee of a foreign state or an agency thereof acting within his or her official capacity or under color of legal authority.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2337(2). Like the FSIA, the ATA contains no definition of the term \"foreign state.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the two statutory regimes use language that is similar but not identical, the first &#8212; and most obvious &#8212; question is whether there are substantive differences in the meaning of the term \"foreign state\" as used in the FSIA and the ATA, respectively. The district court concluded that the two statutes were to be read in pari materia. <i>See Ungar III,</i> 315 F.Supp.2d at 175. We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, of course, that even identical terms can have divergent meanings when used in different statutes. <i>See, e.g., Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States,</i> 880 F.2d 1503, 1504 (1st Cir.1989); <i>United States v. Sterling Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 494 F.2d 919, 923 (2d Cir.1974). Generally speaking, however, that phenomenon occurs only when the purpose, history, and structure of the statutes make manifest a principled basis for interpreting the words differently. <i>See, e.g., Perez-Arellano v. Smith,</i> 279 F.3d 791, 794 (9th Cir.2002). Here, however, the Supreme Court has observed that \"the text and structure of the FSIA demonstrate Congress' intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.\" <i>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.,</i> 488 U.S. 428, 434, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). Nothing in either the language or legislative history of the ATA gives any indication that Congress intended the newer statute to supercede, rather than to mirror, the detailed jurisdictional framework described in the FSIA. To cinch matters, the Supreme Court, in a post-ATA case, recently repeated its admonition that \"courts should decide claims of sovereign immunity in conformity with the [FSIA's] principles.\" <i>Altmann,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2249. Consequently, we regard an assertion of sovereign immunity under the ATA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2337(2), as being functionally equivalent to an assertion of sovereign immunity under the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings a second question into focus. Since neither the FSIA nor the ATA define the term \"foreign state\" as it relates to a sovereign power, we must determine the intended meaning of that term. There is no controlling precedent in this circuit as to the essential attributes of statehood in this context. The parties, however, find common ground in their shared conviction that the definition should be derived by application of the standard set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations. This standard deems a state to be \"an entity that has a defined territory and a permanent population, under the control of its own government, and that engages in, or has the capacity to engage in, formal relations with other such entities.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201 (1987). Under the Restatement standard, political recognition &#8212; typically thought of as \"a formal acknowledgment by a nation that another entity possesses the qualifications for nationhood,\" <i>N.Y. Chinese TV Programs, Inc. v. U.E. Enters., Inc.,</i> 954 F.2d 847, 853 (2d Cir.1992) &#8212; is not a prerequisite to a finding of statehood. <i>See</i> Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 202 cmt. b (explaining that \"[a]n entity that satisfies the requirements of &#167; 201 is a state whether or not its statehood is formally recognized by other states\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using the Restatement standard as the rule of decision is a colorable position. In this regard, the Restatement tracks the historical standard found in international law. <i>See Nat'l Petrochem. Co. of Iran v. M/T Stolt Sheaf,</i> 860 F.2d 551, 553 (2d Cir.1988); <i>see also</i> Convention on Rights and Duties of States (Montevideo Convention), Dec. 26, 1933, art. 1, 49 Stat. 3097, 3100, 165 L.N.T.S. 19, 25.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In addition, the FSIA's legislative history is itself replete with congressional references to sovereign immunity's roots in international law. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 7 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6605 (noting that the objective of the bill was to codify sovereign immunity doctrine as recognized by international law and to ensure that this international standard would be applied in federal litigation). The legislative history goes on to recount that the very foundation of foreign sovereign immunity in federal jurisprudence rests on the Supreme Court's recognition of that doctrine in <i>The Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,</i> 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 116, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812). There, the Court established that the federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over suits involving foreign sovereigns with whom the United States is at peace, deriving such an immunity from the custom and practice of international law. <i>Id.</i> at 135-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, the federal courts came to rely less on international law and more on the actions of the State Department in determining whether to grant immunity in individual cases. H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 8, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6606.

The mandate system grew out of the idea that some former colonies of nations defeated in World War I were \"not yet able to stand by themselves\" and should be placed under the tutelage of \"advanced nations.\" League of Nations Covenant art. 22, paras. 1, 2. Palestine was among those territories deemed to \"have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations [could] be provisionally recognized,\" subject to \"administrative advice and assistance\" from more mature governments. <i>Id.</i> at para. 4. The United Kingdom held the mandate over Palestine. Rather than \"advice and assistance,\" however, the powers conferred were more akin to rule.

Here, the defendants' claim to sovereign immunity derives from their assertion that Palestine is a state, and the evidence presented to the district court in support of that assertion consisted entirely of indisputably authentic international legal documents. The district court's determination that Palestine was not a state was premised on a legal conclusion: the court determined that the defendants' documentary proffer did not satisfy the legal standard derived from international law. Our review of that decision is de novo. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">International law defines a state as \"an entity that has a defined territory and a permanent population, under the control of its own government, and that engages in, or has the capacity to engage in, formal relations with other such entities.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201. This definition derives from the Montevideo Convention of 1933. <i>See supra</i> Part III(A). In applying this definition, some courts have subdivided the analysis into four parts, asking whether the putative state (i) has a defined territory and (ii) a permanent population, which (iii) is under the control of its own government, and (iv) has the capacity to engage in foreign relations. <i>See, e.g., Klinghoffer,</i> 937 F.2d at 47-48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In practice, the third element is the most salient factor in the statehood calculus. <i>See Knox v.

The Restatement's explanation of this element is rather sparse; it notes only that \"[a] state need not have any particular form of government, but there must be some authority exercising governmental functions and able to represent the entity in international relations.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201 cmt. d. To satisfy these requirements, a state's government must, at a bare minimum, be independent and in general control of its territory, maintaining at least a modicum of law and order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See</i> Creation of States at 45-46; <i>see also</i> Nii Lante Wallace-Bruce, Claims to Statehood in International Law 54 (1994) (explaining that what is required \"is a coherent system of authority structures regulating ... the territory under that government's control\"). In short, the existence of a state demands a community integrated and organized as a political unit. <i>See</i> 1 Robert Jennings &amp; Arthur Watts, Oppenheim's International Law 122 (9th ed.1992). Its government must speak for the state as a whole; the mere presence of independent tribes or factions within a territory, lacking common institutions, cannot constitute a government in control. <i>See Western Sahara,</i> 1975 I.C.J. 12, 63 (Oct. 16).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first, second, and fourth elements are dependent on (or, sometimes, subsumed by) the third.

As such, this element is merely a function of independence and governmental control. <i>Id.</i> So too the second element, which typically is satisfied by showing a permanent population within the defined territory. <i>See id.</i> at 40-42. The relationships of these elements with the all-important third element is readily evident. As one court put it, the question is essentially whether the entity claiming statehood has a \"defined territory <i>under its control</i>\" and a \"permanent population <i>under its control.</i>\" <i>Knox,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 434 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth element &#8212; \"capacity to engage in foreign relations\" &#8212; focuses on \"competence, within [a state's] own constitutional system, to conduct international relations with other states, as well as the political, technical, and financial capabilities to do so.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201 cmt. e. Again, this is a function of independence and effective government control. <i>See</i> Creation of States at 47-48. In that sense, then, it too is dependent on the third element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that the party who alleges sovereign immunity has the burden of proving that status. <i>See Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers,</i> 12 F.3d 317, 325 (2d Cir.1993); <i>Alberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense de la Carne,</i> 705 F.2d 250, 253 (7th Cir.1983). With this in mind, we move from the general to the specific.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the state of Palestine exists; that they constitute core elements of that state; and that, therefore, they are immune from suit under the FSIA (and, thus, under the ATA). This argument has a quicksilver quality: it is hard to pin down exactly when or how the defendants assert that Palestine achieved statehood. At various points in their briefs, they hint at three possibilities: (i) the period from the beginning of the mandate through the 1967 Arab-Israeli war; (ii) the period from the end of that war up until the creation of the Palestinian Authority (1994); and (iii) the period from 1994 forward. In an abundance of caution, we consider whether the defendants have made a prima facie showing of statehood at any such juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For each of the three periods, the defendants' proffer is much the same anent the first and second elements of the test for statehood. With respect to the first, the defendants consistently claim that Palestine comprises the territory defined by Security Council Resolution 242, that is, those portions of the once and former mandate territory occupied by Israel during the 1967 war (including the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem). With respect to the second element, the defendants asseverate that this territory has had a permanent population from time immemorial (and, thus, that it had such a population throughout the three periods with which we are concerned). Assuming, arguendo, the accuracy of these averments, the focus shifts to the third prong of the test for statehood. At that stage, the question becomes whether the defendants have shown that the identified territory and population are self-governing. In answering this question, we look separately at each period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Initial Period.</i> As to the pre-1967 period, the defendants' argument seems to be that the territory that comprised the Palestinian portion of the mandate was a state prior to, during, and after the mandate. Their support for this thesis is very weak; they assert only that throughout this interval there were local governmental institutions in place that catered to the Palestinian populace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion is manifestly insufficient to make the defendants' prima facie case of statehood. The third element of the test requires governmental independence and control of a defined territory. That element plainly was not satisfied while the defined territory was part of the Ottoman Empire; even if the Palestinian people exercised operating control over domestic governmental functions in the region &#8212; and the defendants offer nothing to support such a claim &#8212; that would not be sufficient to show the existence of an independent political unit that <i>controlled</i> the territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true for the latter portions of the period. During the currency of the mandate, the United Kingdom exercised suzerainty over the administration and laws of the defined territory. <i>See Klausner v. Levy,</i> 83 F.Supp. 599, 600 (E.D.Va.1949). Following the United Kingdom's relinquishment of the mandate and the onset of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Israelis occupied much of the land designated for a future Arab state, and the Egyptians and Jordanians seized the rest. The net result is that, at all times, other states had control over the defined territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants resist the obvious conclusion. In particular, they rely upon United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181(II), noting that it called for an independent Arab state to come into existence no later than October 1, 1948, and that this became a reality in the sense that \"Palestinian government institutions continued to function under Egyptian and Jordanian occupation much as they had under the Mandate.\" Appellants' Br. at 21. These assertions are insufficient to show that a political unit was in control of the defined territory and populace. The mere fact that the United Nations conceived an aspirational plan for Palestinian statehood does not establish the existence of a state. Nor does the fact that the Egyptians and Jordanians occupied and controlled a significant portion of the defined territory immediately following the end of the mandate aid the defendants' cause. To the contrary, the fact is a stark reminder that no state of Palestine could have come into being at that time. <i>See Knox,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 437 (noting that under \"international law, a state will <i>maintain</i> its statehood during a belligerent occupation ... but it would be anomalous indeed to hold that a state may <i>achieve</i> sufficient independence and statehood in the first instance while subject to and laboring under the hostile military occupation of a separate sovereign\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Middle Period.</i> The interval following the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by Israel in 1967 is no more promising. With respect to this time span, the defendants rely heavily on Security Council Resolution 242 and its hortatory call for Israeli withdrawal from \"territories occupied in the recent conflict\" and for all states to respect and acknowledge \"the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area.\" That reliance is mislaid. There is a vast difference between what should be and what is; the fact that some political leaders recognize that particular territory should comprise a state does not make that territory a state under the prevailing principles of international law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What counts is that the defendants have not presented <i>any</i> evidence indicating that Palestine actually became a state following Israel's conquest of the lands previously occupied by Jordan and Egypt. The one circumstance to which the defendants advert &#8212; that the Israelis did not dismantle the local governmental institutions in the region &#8212; is wholly inadequate to show that there was a Palestinian state underlying the Israeli occupation. The territory went directly from Jordanian/Egyptian control to Israeli control, thus undermining the defendants' statehood argument. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the defendants point proudly to the U.N.'s 1974 recognition of the PLO. We do not minimize the political significance of that event. The fact remains, however, that neither political recognition of the PLO nor United Nations support for self-governance is sufficient to signify that the Restatement's conditions for statehood have been met. <i>See Klinghoffer,</i> 937 F.2d at 48 (noting that the PLO did not satisfy the objective requirements for statehood despite its political recognition by some foreign states).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Most Recent Period.</i> The defendants' argument for current statehood posits that Palestine's changing status over the last decade marked the emergence of the defined territory from Israeli control and the establishment of a Palestinian government in its place. The PLO's 1988 declaration of independence adumbrated the inception of this period. The period itself commenced, however, in 1994, the signal event being the creation of the PA as an entity having some lawful authority in the West Bank and Gaza. The defendants suggest that this development signified the birth of a government sufficiently in control of the defined territory to satisfy the third element of the Restatement test. We reject the suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undoubtedly, the agreements to which the defendants allude vested some autonomy in the newly created PA. But the authority so transferred was limited and, during and after that transition, Israel explicitly reserved control over all matters not transferred. <i>See</i> Interim Agreement art. I, 36 I.L.M. at 558. Several of these reserved powers are incompatible with the notion that the PA had independent governmental control over the defined territory. To illustrate, the interim agreement expressly denied the PA the right to conduct foreign relations, <i>id.</i> art. IX, 36 I.L.M. at 561; left Israel with an undiminished ability to defend and control the territorial borders, <i>id.</i> art. XII, 36 I.L.M. at 562; denied the PA the right to create or maintain either an army or a navy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>id.</i> art. XIV, 36 I.L.M. at 563; retained Israeli control over the territorial airspace, <i>id.</i> at Annex I, art. XIII, 36 I.L.M. at 586; and placed severe restrictions on the PA's lawmaking ability (declaring, inter alia, that any laws passed in contravention of the DOP would be void ab initio), <i>id.</i> art. XVIII, 36 I.L.M. at 565. These restrictions remain in effect. It is, therefore, transparently clear that the PA has not yet exercised sufficient governmental control over Palestine to satisfy the third element of the Restatement test. <i>See</i> Geoffrey R. Watson, The Oslo Accords 68-72 (2000) (concluding that \"there was no Palestinian state at the time of the signing of the Interim Agreement\"); D.J. Harris, Cases and Materials on International Law 226 (5th ed.1998) (concluding that the interim agreement \"fall[s] short of [achieving] statehood for the Palestinian people\"); United Nations Comm'n on Human Rights, <i>Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, Including Palestine</i> at 12, U.N. Doc. E/Cn.4/2001/121 (2001) (noting that, as of 2001, Palestine \"still falls short of the accepted criteria of statehood\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants do not deny that these limitations are incompatible with statehood, but, rather, contend that they were imposed by force and that the Israeli occupation is all that is preventing the full exercise of the prerogatives of statehood. The problem with this contention is that it presupposes that Palestine was a state <i>before</i> the Israeli occupation &#8212; and the defendants have not shown that it was. <i>See Knox,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 437.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the status of the Palestinian territories is in many ways sui generis. Here, however, the defendants have not carried their burden of showing that Palestine satisfied the requirements for statehood under the applicable principles of international law at any point in time. In view of the unmistakable legislative command that sovereign immunity shall only be accorded to states &#8212; a command reflected in both the FSIA and the ATA &#8212; the defendants' sovereign immunity defense must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come now to the defendants' protest that they were entitled to a final determination on the sovereign immunity question (including appellate review) before they could be required to bear any of the burdens of litigation. In mounting this protest, the defendants place great weight on <i>In re Papandreou,</i> 139 F.3d 247 (D.C.Cir.1998). There, the Greek governmental entities and officials moved to dismiss claims against them on grounds of lack of in personam jurisdiction, forum non conveniens, and sovereign immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 249. The plaintiffs sought discovery for the limited purpose of determining whether FSIA's \"commercial activity\" exemption applied. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(2). The defendants objected and asked the district court to adjudicate their other non-merits-based defenses before allowing any discovery. <i>Papandreou,</i> 139 F.3d at 254. The district court authorized the jurisdictional discovery, including the depositions of several Greek cabinet ministers. <i>Id.</i> at 249. The defendants petitioned for a writ of mandamus and the court of appeals obliged. The court held (i) that there were less intrusive ways of determining the applicability of the FSIA exemption, and (ii) that the trial court should have grappled with the non-merits-based defenses before subjecting the defendants to jurisdictional discovery. <i>Id.</i> at 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lightly dismiss the reasoning behind <i>Papandreou.</i> Had the defendants in this case raised their sovereign immunity defense in a timely manner, their argument that they were entitled to adjudication of that defense before proceeding with the merits of the litigation might have some force. After all, a district court's denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint on the ground of foreign sovereign immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <i>See Price v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,</i> 389 F.3d 192, 196 (D.C.Cir.2004); <i>S &amp; Davis Int'l, Inc. v. Republic of Yemen,</i> 218 F.3d 1292, 1295 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Transatlantic Shiffahrtskontor GmbH v. Shanghai Foreign Trade Corp.,</i> 204 F.3d 384, 387 (2d Cir.2000); <i>Jungquist v. Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan,</i> 115 F.3d 1020, 1025 (D.C.Cir.1997). And such an appeal ordinarily divests the district court of jurisdiction to proceed with the litigation pending its resolution. <i>See Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Apostol v. Gallion,</i> 870 F.2d 1335, 1338 (7th Cir.1989); <i>see also Eckert Int'l, Inc. v. Gov't of Sovereign Democratic Republic of Fiji,</i> 834 F.Supp. 167, 175 (E.D.Va.1993) (noting that foreign state's non-frivolous interlocutory sovereign immunity appeal divests district court of jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles are not absolute. None of the cited cases stand for the proposition that sovereign immunity is a trump card that may be held in reserve until a defendant sees fit to play it, thus enabling the defendant to stop the litigation in its tracks at a time of its choosing. That is simply not the law. As we have explained in a related context, \"in exchange for the defendant's right to interrupt the judicial process, the court may expect a reasonable modicum of diligence in the exercise of that right.\" <i>Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 98 F.3d 664, 668-69 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Kennedy v. City of Cleveland,</i> 797 F.2d 297, 301 (6th Cir.1986)). Demanding such diligence is \"virtually essential to orderly judicial management of the vexing procedural problems\" that accompany assertions of immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> <i>Fisichelli v. City Known as Town of Methuen,</i> 884 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, for whatever reason, elected not to assert sovereign immunity in either of their first two motions to dismiss. By the time that the district court ordered the entry of a default, the defendants still had not moved to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity. The district court found, and the defendants' own words appear to confirm, that this recalcitrance was intentional and designed to accomplish some obscure strategic aim. <i>See Ungar IV,</i> 325 F.Supp.2d at 23-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this sequence of events, the defendants' arguments are unpersuasive. Here, as contemplated in <i>Papandreou,</i> discovery was stayed until the defendants had a full determination of the non-merits-based defenses that they initially chose to assert (including insufficiency of process, forum non conveniens, and lack of in personam jurisdiction). After rejecting those defenses and denying two motions to dismiss, the district court in effect ordered the litigation to proceed. The defendants &#8212; who to that point had not raised a sovereign immunity defense &#8212; nonetheless refused either to answer the amended complaint or to comply with the court's discovery orders. In view of this history, we believe that the district court acted well within the encincture of its discretion in entering the default. <i>See Compania Interamericana Export-Import, S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviacion,</i> 88 F.3d 948, 951-52 (11th Cir.1996) (permitting entry of default against foreign state due to its willful failure to comply with court orders). The defendants deliberately chose to hold off on asserting a sovereign immunity defense &#8212; and they must live with the consequences of that choice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The defendants have not shown that this case involves nonjusticiable political questions. By like token, they have not shown that Palestine is a state and, as a consequence, they do not have available to them the buckler of sovereign immunity. Consequently, they cannot set aside the judgment on that ground. And, finally, they have failed to show that the district court acted precipitously either in entering a default or in reducing the default to judgment. Accordingly, we reject their appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On the plaintiffs' side, the claims brought by the estate and heirs of Efrat Ungar were dismissed because she was not a United States national<i>Estates of Ungar ex rel.

It may be argued that a foreign state, for purposes of the FSIA, is an entity that has been recognized as a sovereign by the United States government<i>See, e.g., Ungar III,</i> 315 F.Supp.2d at 186-87 (alternate holding); <i>cf.</i> 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Here, however, all roads lead to Rome. The defendants' sovereign immunity defense fails the Restatement test. <i>See infra</i> Part III(C). If recognition were the test, the result would be the same.

But such a choice represents a rather risky gamble. If the assertion of immunity is valid, the defendant wins the entire pot (i.e., it walks away from the suit unscathed) but if the assertion of immunity fails, the defendant loses outright (i.e., it must live with the default). There is no need to engage in such high-stakes wagering. A defendant may both assert sovereign immunity and defend on the merits<i>See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v.

They contend that the case hinges on a nonjusticiable political question and that, at any rate, the defendants enjoy sovereign immunity. In the event that these arguments do not carry the day, the defendants seek vacation of two $116,000,000-plus default judgments, one entered against each of them, on the ground that they were entitled to a binding determination of sovereign immunity (including appellate review of any unfavorable decision) before being forced to bear the burdens of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration of the relevant legal authorities and perscrutation of an amplitudinous record, we conclude that this case is justiciable; that the defendants have not established an entitlement to sovereign immunity; and that the defendants' strategic litigation choices undercut their arguments as to the sequencing of the litigation.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case had its genesis in a terrorist attack that occurred in Israel on June 9, 1996. On that date, Yaron Ungar (a citizen of the United States), his wife Efrat, and their infant son Yishai were driving home from a wedding. Near Beit Shemesh, a car approached the Ungars' vehicle and loosed a salvo of machine-gun fire, killing both Yaron and Efrat. The three occupants of the attacking vehicle were all members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States Department of State. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1189; Redesignation of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, 68 Fed.Reg. 56,860, 56,861 (Oct. 2, 2003). The authorities apprehended the three assailants and, soon after, arrested a fourth Hamas member as an accessory. An Israeli court convicted all four men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Strachman was appointed as the administrator of the estates of Yaron and Efrat Ungar. On March 13, 2000, Strachman and other plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2331-2338. That statute provides a cause of action in favor of any \"national of the United States injured in his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or heirs.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2333(a).

The PA and the PLO moved to dismiss the amended complaint on essentially the same grounds as previously urged, adding only that the claims were nonjusticiable. Alternatively, they sought to have the district court certify, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> various questions, including a question as to whether the defendants were entitled to a non-specific \"functional\" immunity \"arising from the peculiar status of the PA as a functioning governmental entity.\" At that point, the defendants were not claiming statehood; they argued only that the policy considerations underlying the ATA's recognition of immunity for foreign states \"appl[ied] equally\" to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PA and the PLO later changed their position.

They explained that they initially had chosen not to seek immunity on the basis of statehood and suggested that emergent political events in their region had caused a change of plan. The motion for leave to assert defenses was a curiosity &#8212; the defendants had not yet answered the amended complaint and were free to assert, by motion to dismiss or otherwise, any colorable defense &#8212; and the district court never acted on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same time frame, the defendants moved for a stay of discovery and the plaintiffs moved for an order compelling discovery.

Some two months later, the district court granted the plaintiffs' outstanding motion to compel discovery, giving the defendants additional time to respond due to their overseas location. The defendants nonetheless moved for reconsideration of the discovery order and submitted a letter from Palestine's permanent observer at the United Nations, which stated that the defendants could not be expected to respond to discovery due to the unremitting violence in the region.

Six weeks later, the district court denied the defendants' pending motion to reconsider the order compelling discovery. On April 11, the court held a hearing on the defendants' outstanding motion to reconsider its decision in <i>Ungar II.</i> The court indicated from the bench that it would deny both that motion and the concomitant request for a stay, but it did not actually enter such an order until April 22, 2003. Meanwhile, a magistrate judge entered the requested default, concluding that the defendants' failure to answer the amended complaint and their refusal to participate in discovery were the result of a deliberate strategic choice.

They averred that they had been deprived of the opportunity to make a showing of sovereign immunity because the district court failed to take action on their motion for leave to assert a sovereign immunity defense, yet proceeded to determine that the defendants had no entitlement to immunity. We summarily affirmed the orders appealed from, noting that the defendants had neither moved to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity nor attempted, in the lower court, to make the evidentiary showing required to sustain such a defense. <i>Ungar v.

The next pleading, however, came from the plaintiffs, who moved for a default judgment. The defendants responded by filing their third motion to dismiss. This time, they predicated the motion on three bases, namely, (i) that the case centered around nonjusticiable political questions; (ii) that the defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1602-1611; and (iii) that section 2337(2) of the ATA, which provides that a suit under section 2333 may not be maintained against \"a foreign state [or] an agency of a foreign state,\" independently divested the district court of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties were like ships passing in the night.

The court hewed to its earlier rejection of the defendants' nonjusticiability thesis. <i>See id.</i> at 173-74 (referencing <i>Ungar II,</i> 228 F.Supp.2d at 44-47). Next, the court held that the FSIA and section 2337(2) of the ATA were two sides of the same coin with respect to sovereign immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 174-75. This left only a single question: \"whether the PA and/or the PLO represent or constitute a foreign State and are thus entitled to sovereign immunity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 175. The court answered that question in the negative. <i>Id.</i> at 176-87.

Most of their argumentation presumes that the district court intruded into forbidden territory when it interpreted an array of United Nations resolutions and Israeli-PLO agreements in a politically controversial manner. To this they add that the default judgment entered by the district court was so huge that it amounted to a political statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' position rests on a misunderstanding of the fundamental nature of this action. This is a tort suit brought under a legislative scheme that Congress enacted for the express purpose of providing a legal remedy for injuries or death occasioned by acts of international terrorism. The defendants are organizations that allegedly violated the statute. They have attempted to avoid liability by wrapping themselves in the cloak of sovereign immunity. The question we must answer, then, is whether the defendants have set forth sufficient evidence to support their claim of immunity &#8212; no more and no less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this view of the case, the plaintiffs easily clear the six <i>Baker</i> hurdles. To begin, the lower court's immunity decision neither signaled an official position on behalf of the United States with respect to the political recognition of Palestine nor amounted to the usurpation of a power committed to some other branch of government. After all, Congress enacted the ATA, and the President signed it. The very purpose of the law is to allow the courts to determine questions of sovereign immunity under a legal, as opposed to a political, regime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Seen in this light, the district court's decision denying immunity did not impede the constitutional prerogatives of the political branches over foreign policy. <i>See generally Baker,</i> 369 U.S. at 211 &amp; n. 31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106366\"><a href=\"/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span> (noting that the Constitution commits foreign relations to the executive and legislative branches, thus permitting them to determine what \"may be done in the exercise of this political power\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third <i>Baker</i> hurdles present no insuperable obstacles here. The district court had access to judicially manageable standards for resolving the issue before it, <i>see infra</i> Part III(A), and those standards did not require the court to make nonjudicial policy determinations. Both sides agreed that the definition of a \"state\" under the relevant statutes was informed by an objective test rooted in international law and articulated in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations. Under these circumstances, the determination of whether the defendants have adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy that definition is quintessentially appropriate for a judicial body. <i>See Kadic v. Karadzic,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708054\"><a href=\"/opinion/708054/s-kadic-on-her-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-her-infant-sons-benjamin-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 249 (2d Cir.1995)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final three hurdles need not concern us. These tests are \"relevant only if judicial resolution of a question would contradict prior decisions taken by a political branch in those limited contexts where such contradiction would seriously interfere with important governmental interests.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the political branches have enacted a law that leaves undiminished their ability either to recognize or withhold recognition from foreign states, while leaving to the courts the responsibility of determining the existence vel non of statehood for jurisdictional purposes. Moreover, the district court's resolution of that question is not incompatible with any formal position thus far taken by the political branches. By the same token, its jurisdictional decision does not turn a blind eye to any position expressed by those responsible for conducting the nation's foreign relations. <i>Cf. Republic of Austria v. Altmann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134749\"><a href=\"/opinion/134749/republicof-austria-v-altmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134749\"><a href=\"/opinion/134749/republicof-austria-v-altmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As a result, the decision did not signify a lack of respect for, or conflict with, the wishes of the political branches. No more is exigible for this purpose. <i>See Baker,</i> 369 U.S. at 212-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106366\"><a href=\"/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Their unhappiness is understandable, but legally irrelevant. The reality is that, in these tempestuous times, any decision of a United States court on matters relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will engender strong feelings. Be that as it may, the capacity to stir emotions is not enough to render an issue nonjusticiable. For jurisdictional purposes, courts must be careful to distinguish between political questions and cases having political overtones. <i>See Klinghoffer,</i> 937 F.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one remaining argument that warrants particularized attention is the defendants' assertion that the district court made a political statement in calibrating the size of the award. That assertion is wholly unsupported. The judgment reflects the wrongful death of a youthful man and includes a trebling of damages as mandated by law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2333(a). It also includes attorneys' fees. <i>See id.</i> The defendants have not challenged either the measure of damages utilized by the lower court or the integrity of its mathematical computations. We add, moreover, that even if the court erred on the side of generosity &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; a mere error in the calculation of a damages award would not implicate the propriety of federal subject matter jurisdiction. We therefore reject the defendants'\"political statement\" assertion as meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this aspect of the case would be supererogatory. The short of it is that the political question doctrine does not preclude judicial resolution of the plaintiffs' case. We turn, therefore, to the merits of the sovereign immunity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the defendants' sovereign immunity defense into segments, starting with the legal framework and historical background.

Although the statute does not define the term \"foreign state,\" it makes pellucid that the term includes \"a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1603(a). It also defines what constitutes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1603(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ATA contains analogous language. It provides that no civil action thereunder may be maintained against \"a foreign state, an agency of a foreign state, or an officer or employee of a foreign state or an agency thereof acting within his or her official capacity or under color of legal authority.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2337(2). Like the FSIA, the ATA contains no definition of the term \"foreign state.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the two statutory regimes use language that is similar but not identical, the first &#8212; and most obvious &#8212; question is whether there are substantive differences in the meaning of the term \"foreign state\" as used in the FSIA and the ATA, respectively. The district court concluded that the two statutes were to be read in pari materia. <i>See Ungar III,</i> 315 F.Supp.2d at 175.

Nothing in either the language or legislative history of the ATA gives any indication that Congress intended the newer statute to supercede, rather than to mirror, the detailed jurisdictional framework described in the FSIA. To cinch matters, the Supreme Court, in a post-ATA case, recently repeated its admonition that \"courts should decide claims of sovereign immunity in conformity with the [FSIA's] principles.\" <i>Altmann,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2249. Consequently, we regard an assertion of sovereign immunity under the ATA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2337(2), as being functionally equivalent to an assertion of sovereign immunity under the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings a second question into focus. Since neither the FSIA nor the ATA define the term \"foreign state\" as it relates to a sovereign power, we must determine the intended meaning of that term. There is no controlling precedent in this circuit as to the essential attributes of statehood in this context. The parties, however, find common ground in their shared conviction that the definition should be derived by application of the standard set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations. This standard deems a state to be \"an entity that has a defined territory and a permanent population, under the control of its own government, and that engages in, or has the capacity to engage in, formal relations with other such entities.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201 (1987).

Palestine was among those territories deemed to \"have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations [could] be provisionally recognized,\" subject to \"administrative advice and assistance\" from more mature governments. <i>Id.</i> at para. 4. The United Kingdom held the mandate over Palestine. Rather than \"advice and assistance,\" however, the powers conferred were more akin to rule.

In applying this definition, some courts have subdivided the analysis into four parts, asking whether the putative state (i) has a defined territory and (ii) a permanent population, which (iii) is under the control of its own government, and (iv) has the capacity to engage in foreign relations. <i>See, e.g., Klinghoffer,</i> 937 F.2d at 47-48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In practice, the third element is the most salient factor in the statehood calculus. <i>See Knox v. PLO,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2525751\"><a href=\"/opinion/2525751/knox-v-palestine-liberation-organization/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Restatement's explanation of this element is rather sparse; it notes only that \"[a] state need not have any particular form of government, but there must be some authority exercising governmental functions and able to represent the entity in international relations.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201 cmt. d. To satisfy these requirements, a state's government must, at a bare minimum, be independent and in general control of its territory, maintaining at least a modicum of law and order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See</i> Creation of States at 45-46; <i>see also</i> Nii Lante Wallace-Bruce, Claims to Statehood in International Law 54 (1994) (explaining that what is required \"is a coherent system of authority structures regulating ... the territory under that government's control\"). In short, the existence of a state demands a community integrated and organized as a political unit. <i>See</i> 1 Robert Jennings &amp; Arthur Watts, Oppenheim's International Law 122 (9th ed.1992). Its government must speak for the state as a whole; the mere presence of independent tribes or factions within a territory, lacking common institutions, cannot constitute a government in control. <i>See Western Sahara,</i> 1975 I.C.J. 12, 63 (Oct. 16).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first, second, and fourth elements are dependent on (or, sometimes, subsumed by) the third. As to the first &#8212; defined territory &#8212; the \"only requirement is that the State must consist of a certain coherent territory effectively governed.\" Creation of States at 40. As such, this element is merely a function of independence and governmental control. <i>Id.</i> So too the second element, which typically is satisfied by showing a permanent population within the defined territory. <i>See id.</i> at 40-42. The relationships of these elements with the all-important third element is readily evident. As one court put it, the question is essentially whether the entity claiming statehood has a \"defined territory <i>under its control</i>\" and a \"permanent population <i>under its control.</i>\" <i>Knox,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 434 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth element &#8212; \"capacity to engage in foreign relations\" &#8212; focuses on \"competence, within [a state's] own constitutional system, to conduct international relations with other states, as well as the political, technical, and financial capabilities to do so.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations &#167; 201 cmt. e. Again, this is a function of independence and effective government control. <i>See</i> Creation of States at 47-48. In that sense, then, it too is dependent on the third element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that the party who alleges sovereign immunity has the burden of proving that status. <i>See Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659319\"><a href=\"/opinion/659319/the-drexel-burnham-lambert-group-inc-and-refco-inc-v-the-committee-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 325 (2d Cir.1993); <i>Alberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense de la Carne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416949\"><a href=\"/opinion/416949/lawrence-r-alberti-and-alberti-international-inc-v-empresa-nicaraguense/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 253 (7th Cir.1983). With this in mind, we move from the general to the specific.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the state of Palestine exists; that they constitute core elements of that state; and that, therefore, they are immune from suit under the FSIA (and, thus, under the ATA). This argument has a quicksilver quality: it is hard to pin down exactly when or how the defendants assert that Palestine achieved statehood. At various points in their briefs, they hint at three possibilities: (i) the period from the beginning of the mandate through the 1967 Arab-Israeli war; (ii) the period from the end of that war up until the creation of the Palestinian Authority (1994); and (iii) the period from 1994 forward. In an abundance of caution, we consider whether the defendants have made a prima facie showing of statehood at any such juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For each of the three periods, the defendants' proffer is much the same anent the first and second elements of the test for statehood. With respect to the first, the defendants consistently claim that Palestine comprises the territory defined by Security Council Resolution 242, that is, those portions of the once and former mandate territory occupied by Israel during the 1967 war (including the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem). With respect to the second element, the defendants asseverate that this territory has had a permanent population from time immemorial (and, thus, that it had such a population throughout the three periods with which we are concerned). Assuming, arguendo, the accuracy of these averments, the focus shifts to the third prong of the test for statehood. At that stage, the question becomes whether the defendants have shown that the identified territory and population are self-governing. In answering this question, we look separately at each period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Initial Period.</i> As to the pre-1967 period, the defendants' argument seems to be that the territory that comprised the Palestinian portion of the mandate was a state prior to, during, and after the mandate. Their support for this thesis is very weak; they assert only that throughout this interval there were local governmental institutions in place that catered to the Palestinian populace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion is manifestly insufficient to make the defendants' prima facie case of statehood. The third element of the test requires governmental independence and control of a defined territory. That element plainly was not satisfied while the defined territory was part of the Ottoman Empire; even if the Palestinian people exercised operating control over domestic governmental functions in the region &#8212; and the defendants offer nothing to support such a claim &#8212; that would not be sufficient to show the existence of an independent political unit that <i>controlled</i> the territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true for the latter portions of the period. During the currency of the mandate, the United Kingdom exercised suzerainty over the administration and laws of the defined territory. <i>See Klausner v. Levy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1430739\"><a href=\"/opinion/1430739/klausner-v-levy/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span>, 600 (E.D.Va.1949). Following the United Kingdom's relinquishment of the mandate and the onset of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Israelis occupied much of the land designated for a future Arab state, and the Egyptians and Jordanians seized the rest. The net result is that, at all times, other states had control over the defined territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants resist the obvious conclusion. In particular, they rely upon United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181(II), noting that it called for an independent Arab state to come into existence no later than October 1, 1948, and that this became a reality in the sense that \"Palestinian government institutions continued to function under Egyptian and Jordanian occupation much as they had under the Mandate.\" Appellants' Br. at 21. These assertions are insufficient to show that a political unit was in control of the defined territory and populace. The mere fact that the United Nations conceived an aspirational plan for Palestinian statehood does not establish the existence of a state. Nor does the fact that the Egyptians and Jordanians occupied and controlled a significant portion of the defined territory immediately following the end of the mandate aid the defendants' cause. To the contrary, the fact is a stark reminder that no state of Palestine could have come into being at that time. <i>See Knox,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 437 (noting that under \"international law, a state will <i>maintain</i> its statehood during a belligerent occupation ... but it would be anomalous indeed to hold that a state may <i>achieve</i> sufficient independence and statehood in the first instance while subject to and laboring under the hostile military occupation of a separate sovereign\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Middle Period.</i> The interval following the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by Israel in 1967 is no more promising. With respect to this time span, the defendants rely heavily on Security Council Resolution 242 and its hortatory call for Israeli withdrawal from \"territories occupied in the recent conflict\" and for all states to respect and acknowledge \"the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area.\" That reliance is mislaid. There is a vast difference between what should be and what is; the fact that some political leaders recognize that particular territory should comprise a state does not make that territory a state under the prevailing principles of international law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What counts is that the defendants have not presented <i>any</i> evidence indicating that Palestine actually became a state following Israel's conquest of the lands previously occupied by Jordan and Egypt. The one circumstance to which the defendants advert &#8212; that the Israelis did not dismantle the local governmental institutions in the region &#8212; is wholly inadequate to show that there was a Palestinian state underlying the Israeli occupation. The territory went directly from Jordanian/Egyptian control to Israeli control, thus undermining the defendants' statehood argument. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the defendants point proudly to the U.N.'s 1974 recognition of the PLO. We do not minimize the political significance of that event. The fact remains, however, that neither political recognition of the PLO nor United Nations support for self-governance is sufficient to signify that the Restatement's conditions for statehood have been met. <i>See Klinghoffer,</i> 937 F.2d at 48 (noting that the PLO did not satisfy the objective requirements for statehood despite its political recognition by some foreign states).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Most Recent Period.</i> The defendants' argument for current statehood posits that Palestine's changing status over the last decade marked the emergence of the defined territory from Israeli control and the establishment of a Palestinian government in its place. The PLO's 1988 declaration of independence adumbrated the inception of this period. The period itself commenced, however, in 1994, the signal event being the creation of the PA as an entity having some lawful authority in the West Bank and Gaza. The defendants suggest that this development signified the birth of a government sufficiently in control of the defined territory to satisfy the third element of the Restatement test. We reject the suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undoubtedly, the agreements to which the defendants allude vested some autonomy in the newly created PA. But the authority so transferred was limited and, during and after that transition, Israel explicitly reserved control over all matters not transferred. <i>See</i> Interim Agreement art. I, 36 I.L.M. at 558. Several of these reserved powers are incompatible with the notion that the PA had independent governmental control over the defined territory. To illustrate, the interim agreement expressly denied the PA the right to conduct foreign relations, <i>id.</i> art. IX, 36 I.L.M. at 561; left Israel with an undiminished ability to defend and control the territorial borders, <i>id.</i> art. XII, 36 I.L.M. at 562; denied the PA the right to create or maintain either an army or a navy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>id.</i> art. XIV, 36 I.L.M. at 563; retained Israeli control over the territorial airspace, <i>id.</i> at Annex I, art. XIII, 36 I.L.M. at 586; and placed severe restrictions on the PA's lawmaking ability (declaring, inter alia, that any laws passed in contravention of the DOP would be void ab initio), <i>id.</i> art. XVIII, 36 I.L.M. at 565. These restrictions remain in effect. It is, therefore, transparently clear that the PA has not yet exercised sufficient governmental control over Palestine to satisfy the third element of the Restatement test. <i>See</i> Geoffrey R. Watson, The Oslo Accords 68-72 (2000) (concluding that \"there was no Palestinian state at the time of the signing of the Interim Agreement\"); D.J. Harris, Cases and Materials on International Law 226 (5th ed.1998) (concluding that the interim agreement \"fall[s] short of [achieving] statehood for the Palestinian people\"); United Nations Comm'n on Human Rights, <i>Question of the Violation of Human Rights in the Occupied Arab Territories, Including Palestine</i> at 12, U.N. Doc. E/Cn.4/2001/121 (2001) (noting that, as of 2001, Palestine \"still falls short of the accepted criteria of statehood\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants do not deny that these limitations are incompatible with statehood, but, rather, contend that they were imposed by force and that the Israeli occupation is all that is preventing the full exercise of the prerogatives of statehood. The problem with this contention is that it presupposes that Palestine was a state <i>before</i> the Israeli occupation &#8212; and the defendants have not shown that it was. <i>See Knox,</i> 306 F.Supp.2d at 437.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the status of the Palestinian territories is in many ways sui generis. Here, however, the defendants have not carried their burden of showing that Palestine satisfied the requirements for statehood under the applicable principles of international law at any point in time. In view of the unmistakable legislative command that sovereign immunity shall only be accorded to states &#8212; a command reflected in both the FSIA and the ATA &#8212; the defendants' sovereign immunity defense must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come now to the defendants' protest that they were entitled to a final determination on the sovereign immunity question (including appellate review) before they could be required to bear any of the burdens of litigation. In mounting this protest, the defendants place great weight on <i>In re Papandreou,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184503\"><a href=\"/opinion/184503/in-re-mnstr-papandr/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1998). There, the Greek governmental entities and officials moved to dismiss claims against them on grounds of lack of in personam jurisdiction, forum non conveniens, and sovereign immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 249. The plaintiffs sought discovery for the limited purpose of determining whether FSIA's \"commercial activity\" exemption applied. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1605(a)(2). The defendants objected and asked the district court to adjudicate their other non-merits-based defenses before allowing any discovery. <i>Papandreou,</i> 139 F.3d at 254. The district court authorized the jurisdictional discovery, including the depositions of several Greek cabinet ministers. <i>Id.</i> at 249. The defendants petitioned for a writ of mandamus and the court of appeals obliged. The court held (i) that there were less intrusive ways of determining the applicability of the FSIA exemption, and (ii) that the trial court should have grappled with the non-merits-based defenses before subjecting the defendants to jurisdictional discovery. <i>Id.</i> at 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lightly dismiss the reasoning behind <i>Papandreou.</i> Had the defendants in this case raised their sovereign immunity defense in a timely manner, their argument that they were entitled to adjudication of that defense before proceeding with the merits of the litigation might have some force. After all, a district court's denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint on the ground of foreign sovereign immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <i>See Price v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186314\"><a href=\"/opinion/186314/price-michael-h-v-sclst-peoples-libyan/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 196 (D.C.Cir.2004); <i>S &amp; Davis Int'l, Inc. v.

None of the cited cases stand for the proposition that sovereign immunity is a trump card that may be held in reserve until a defendant sees fit to play it, thus enabling the defendant to stop the litigation in its tracks at a time of its choosing.

By the time that the district court ordered the entry of a default, the defendants still had not moved to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity. The district court found, and the defendants' own words appear to confirm, that this recalcitrance was intentional and designed to accomplish some obscure strategic aim. <i>See Ungar IV,</i> 325 F.Supp.2d at 23-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this sequence of events, the defendants' arguments are unpersuasive. Here, as contemplated in <i>Papandreou,</i> discovery was stayed until the defendants had a full determination of the non-merits-based defenses that they initially chose to assert (including insufficiency of process, forum non conveniens, and lack of in personam jurisdiction). After rejecting those defenses and denying two motions to dismiss, the district court in effect ordered the litigation to proceed. The defendants &#8212; who to that point had not raised a sovereign immunity defense &#8212; nonetheless refused either to answer the amended complaint or to comply with the court's discovery orders. In view of this history, we believe that the district court acted well within the encincture of its discretion in entering the default. <i>See Compania Interamericana Export-Import, S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviacion,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71033\"><a href=\"/opinion/71033/co-interamer-v-co-dominicana/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, 951-52 (11th Cir.1996) (permitting entry of default against foreign state due to its willful failure to comply with court orders). The defendants deliberately chose to hold off on asserting a sovereign immunity defense &#8212; and they must live with the consequences of that choice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The defendants have not shown that this case involves nonjusticiable political questions. By like token, they have not shown that Palestine is a state and, as a consequence, they do not have available to them the buckler of sovereign immunity. Consequently, they cannot set aside the judgment on that ground. And, finally, they have failed to show that the district court acted precipitously either in entering a default or in reducing the default to judgment.

For present purposes, then, it simplifies matters to think of this case as a suit by Yaron Ungar's estate and heirs against the PA and the PLO.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable ..., shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order.

No. 94-1487, at 7 (1976), <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6606 (\"A principle purpose of [the FSIA] is to transfer the determination of sovereign immunity from the executive branch to the judicial branch, thereby reducing the foreign policy implications of immunity determinations and assuring litigants that these often crucial decisions are made on purely legal grounds....\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Montevideo Convention is still in effect and the United States is a party to it<i>See</i> United States Dep't of State, <i>Treaties in Force</i> 480 (2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We caution that the Restatement standard, though embraced by both sides in this case, is not inevitably correct. It may be argued that a foreign state, for purposes of the FSIA, is an entity that has been recognized as a sovereign by the United States government<i>See, e.g., Ungar III,</i> 315 F.Supp.2d at 186-87 (alternate holding); <i>cf.</i> 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 3604 (2d ed.1984) (noting that for purposes of former 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(2)(1970) &#8212; a statute modified by the FSIA &#8212; federal courts generally had held that a foreign state was one that had been recognized as such by the United States government, in either a de jure or de facto capacity (collecting cases)). Here, however, all roads lead to Rome. The defendants' sovereign immunity defense fails the Restatement test. <i>See infra</i> Part III(C). If recognition were the test, the result would be the same. After all, the United States has not recognized Palestine as a sovereign nation. Thus, we need not probe the point too deeply.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The interim agreement permitted the PLO to conduct limited foreign affairs activities on behalf of the PA.

Dajani, <i>Stalled Between Seasons: The International Legal Status of Palestine During the Interim Period,</i> 26 Denv. J. Int'l L. &amp; Pol'y 27, 86 (1997) (remarking that \"the interim character and extraordinarily limited powers of the PA make it impossible to characterize that body as the `effective government' of the [territory]\"); <i>see also</i> Omar Dajani, <i>On a Better Road This Time in the Mideast?,</i> Wash.

But such a choice represents a rather risky gamble. If the assertion of immunity is valid, the defendant wins the entire pot (i.e., it walks away from the suit unscathed) but if the assertion of immunity fails, the defendant loses outright (i.e., it must live with the default). There is no need to engage in such high-stakes wagering. A defendant may both assert sovereign immunity and defend on the merits<i>See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Alhadhood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717483\"><a href=\"/opinion/717483/mci-telecommunications-corporation-v-subhi-alhadhood-captain-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 662 (5th Cir.1996); <i>Practical Concepts, Inc. v.

Thus, the failure to raise the defense in a timely manner cannot result in a waiver<i>See, e.g., Haven v. Polska,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769082\"><a href=\"/opinion/769082/edward-haven-and-allen-welbel-v-rzeczpospolita-polska-skarb-panstwa/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 733 (7th Cir.2000). Nevertheless, a failure of that kind can appropriately affect the trial court's management of the litigation. <i>See, e.g., Bolduc v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201496\"><a href=\"/opinion/201496/bolduc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2005) [slip op. at 9] (explaining that \"the belated filing of a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction can have consequences in terms of a court's case-management decisions\").
