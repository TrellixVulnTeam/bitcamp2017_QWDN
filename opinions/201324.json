Garcia, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 5, 2004\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          The three defendants in this drug\n\nconspiracy case played key roles in a smuggling ring that imported\n\nlarge amounts of cocaine and marijuana into Puerto Rico between\n\n1992 and 1996.    After a trial that spanned nearly four weeks and\n\ninvolved more than forty witnesses for the government, a jury found\n\neach defendant guilty of a series of crimes, including the drug\n\nconspiracy and aiding and abetting murder.                The district court\n\nsentenced each defendant to multiple life sentences.\n\n           The defendants raise a number of challenges to their\n\nconvictions. In the end, we find that one challenge is meritorious\n\n-- the argument of Omar Genao-Sanchez that the district court erred\n\nin admitting testimonial hearsay against him in violation of the\n\nrecent Supreme Court decision in Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct.\n\n1354 (2004), a case decided after the completion of this trial.\n\nAlthough we affirm Genao-Sanchez's drug conspiracy conviction, we\n\nconclude that the erroneous admission of the hearsay testimony was\n\nnot harmless with respect to his convictions for conspiracy to\n\ncommit murder and for aiding and abetting murder.             Accordingly, we\n\nvacate those convictions.         We affirm the convictions and sentences\n\nof the other defendants.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           We present facts here in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict to convey the background of the case.             See United States v.\n\nReeder,   170   F.3d   93,   97    (1st   Cir.   1999).      We   will   provide\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fadditional facts where they are pertinent to the legal analysis of\n\nspecific issues.\n\nA.   The Conspiracy\n\n            As   noted,   the    defendants    were   members   of   a   drug\n\nconspiracy that smuggled large amounts of cocaine and marijuana\n\nfrom South America into southwestern Puerto Rico for itself and\n\nother organizations.      The drugs were dropped from airplanes at sea\n\nand retrieved by the defendants or transferred directly by boat\n\nfrom the defendants' foreign suppliers.            The conspirators used a\n\nbroad array of radios, global positioning system (GPS) receivers,\n\nnight vision glasses, police scanners, modified cellphones and\n\npowerful    speedboats    to    protect    their   shipments.    They    also\n\nstationed lookouts at various points on the water and near an\n\nairport used by the United States Customs Service to protect the\n\nloads from raids by law enforcement and rival drug gangs.\n\n            After the defendants brought the drugs on shore, the\n\ndrugs were shipped by truck either to a secure storage location\n\n(frequently one of the conspirators' farms) or directly to the\n\nindividual or organization who had hired the defendants.                  The\n\nindividual conspirators received cash or a portion of the drug\n\nshipment as payment for their participation, and they distributed\n\nthe drugs they received to local dealers at drug points throughout\n\nthe area.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fB.   The Co-Conspirators\n\n                  Raul Santodomingo-Romero (\"Santodomingo\") led the drug\n\norganization until he was arrested on money laundering charges in\n\n1994;       his    second-in-command,     Victor       M.   Valle-Lassalle,     a/k/a\n\n\"Manolo\" (\"Valle-Lassalle\"), then took over.1                  Defendant-appellant\n\nLuis Roldan-Cortes, a/k/a \"Wisi\" (\"Roldan\"), was Valle-Lassalle's\n\nright hand man and the godfather to his daughter.                     The two owned a\n\ndrug       distribution    point,     giving    them    the    exclusive     right   to\n\ndistribute         drugs   in   the   Ducos    housing      project    in   Aguadilla.\n\nAlthough Valle-Lassalle eventually ended this partnership because\n\nhe thought that Roldan was unfairly excluding him from some of the\n\nside deals that Roldan was arranging, they continued to cooperate\n\ntogether in their smuggling venture.               Roldan negotiated at least\n\none drug shipment in the Dominican Republic and participated in the\n\nexecution of a number of others.                His specific responsibilities\n\nincluded loading and unloading and captaining the drug boats,\n\ncoordinating \"security\" for the shipments, and inventorying and\n\nselling drugs to small distributors. He also helped to arrange the\n\nmurder of a government informant, James Martin-Rodriguez, a/k/a\n\n\"Kiri\" (\"Martin\"), who was a member of the conspiracy until he\n\nbegan cooperating with federal investigators.\n\n\n\n       1\n      We have included a roster of individuals important for an\nunderstanding of this case in the Appendix to this opinion. We\nrefer to the individuals in this case according to the naming\nscheme that was adopted by the government in its brief.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f              Defendant-appellant     Omar   Genao-Sanchez,     a/k/a   \"Omi\"\n\n(\"Genao\"), was a drug courier for one of the conspirators, David\n\nRafael Ramos-Rivera, a/k/a \"Pecas\" (\"Ramos\"), when he (Genao) was\n\nsixteen years old.        He later became a member of the conspiracy\n\nhimself after meeting the other members at Santodomingo's farm.\n\nGenao attended meetings at which Valle-Lassalle negotiated drug\n\nshipments, helped to bring loads to shore, and, according to the\n\ngovernment, participated in the murder of Carlos Roberto Rodriguez\n\nTorres, a/k/a \"Robert Caballo\" (\"Caballo\").            Although Caballo was\n\nan   active    member   of    the   conspiracy,    having    participated   in\n\nsmuggling operations, Valle-Lassalle decided to kill him when\n\nCaballo threatened to tell members of a Colombian drug cartel that\n\nValle-Lassalle had stolen cocaine from them.\n\n              José Rodriguez-Marrero, a/k/a \"Zurdo\" (\"Rodriguez\"), the\n\nlast of the three appellants, joined the conspiracy when Valle-\n\nLassalle offered to let him participate in some drug shipments if\n\nhe helped to murder Edward Llaurador Rodriguez (\"Llaurador\"),\n\nanother co-conspirator turned government informant.             Although the\n\ngovernment did not introduce evidence that Rodriguez participated\n\nin any shipments, its witnesses testified that Rodriguez was\n\npresent when Valle-Lassalle negotiated shipments and that he would\n\nhave   participated      in   two   shipments     if   the   police   had   not\n\nforestalled them.       The first of these shipments was supposed to be\n\na two thousand pound load of cocaine that Valle-Lassalle negotiated\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fin May 1997 with another smuggler, Angela Ayala. This shipment was\n\ncanceled when Ayala was arrested.         The second involved six hundred\n\nkilograms of cocaine that were supposed to have been smuggled on\n\nbehalf of another smuggler, Henry Pamias, a/k/a \"Macho from Cataño\"\n\n(\"Pamias\").   That shipment was canceled because Valle-Lassalle was\n\narrested on weapons charges.\n\n            Javier E. Soto-Alarcon, a/k/a \"Chester\" (\"Soto\"), was a\n\nmid-level leader in the conspiracy who joined the drug gang after\n\nhe started dating Valle-Lassalle's sister.         Soto participated in a\n\nnumber of drug loads and in Llaurador's murder.         After Soto's wife\n\n(he had since ended his relationship with Valle-Lassalle's sister)\n\nwas shot in a drug-related attack, Soto decided to turn himself in\n\nto the authorities.     He agreed to cooperate with the government,\n\nallowing it to record his conversations, helping government agents\n\nto infiltrate the organization, and testifying against the others\n\nat trial.\n\n            Ramos was a member of the conspiracy before he was\n\narrested and decided to become a government informant.           He helped\n\nto smuggle a number of large loads of marijuana and cocaine and\n\nsold some of the cocaine at a drug point in the Montana housing\n\nproject in Aguadilla.     He also participated in Martin's murder.\n\n            Other   members   of   the   drug   conspiracy   included   José\n\nHernandez-Jimenez, a/k/a \"Chelo\" (\"Hernandez\"), who was murdered by\n\na rival drug gang, and Nicholas Peña Gonzalez (\"Peña\") and Anibal\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fPagan-Cerezo, a/k/a \"El Cojo\" (\"Pagan\"), who were indicted along\n\nwith the defendants here and pled guilty.\n\nC.   Murders Undertaken in Furtherance of the Conspiracy\n\n           The drug gang protected its distribution empire with\n\nforce, killing or seriously wounding suspected informants and rival\n\ngang members. Three of those murders played important roles in the\n\nconspiracy trial because they were charged as substantive crimes\n\nand as overt acts in furtherance of the drug conspiracy.\n\n1.   Martin's Murder\n\n           On November 16, 1992, Martin was arrested with fifteen\n\nbales of cocaine belonging to the drug ring.   This was the second\n\ntime that he was arrested for a drug crime, and he agreed to\n\ncooperate with the United States Customs Service.    Suspecting that\n\nMartin had become an informant, Santodomingo and Valle-Lassalle\n\ndecided to have him murdered in a parking lot at the Ducos housing\n\nproject. On May 20, 1993, after receiving a phone call from Roldan\n\nalerting him to Martin's arrival at the scene, Santodomingo dropped\n\nRamos off at the housing project, where Ramos joined Roldan and\n\nPagan. Roldan identified Martin as the intended murder victim, and\n\ntold Ramos and Pagan that Martin was at the housing project that\n\nday because he was expecting to pick up some money owed to him for\n\ndrugs. Martin approached the group, and Ramos and Pagan walked off\n\nto a corner of the parking lot.   After speaking with Roldan for a\n\nshort while, Martin walked back to his automobile.   As he was about\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fto put the keys in the door, Pagan walked up and shot him three\n\ntimes. Ramos then joined the attack, and the two shot Martin until\n\nPagan ran out of bullets.       The coroner's report stated that Martin\n\nhad seventeen bullet wounds in his body.\n\n2.   Caballo's Murder\n\n           In February, 1996, five members of the drug organization\n\nstole approximately thirty kilograms of cocaine that they were\n\nsmuggling into Puerto Rico on behalf of a Colombian drug operation.\n\nBelieving that Caballo had threatened to inform the Colombians\n\nabout the theft, Valle-Lassalle arranged to have him killed.\n\nAccording to the government, Genao and another member of the drug\n\nring, Nicholas Peña Gonzalez, picked Caballo up at his house on\n\nJuly 15, 1996, with help from Llaurador.            Peña shot Caballo in a\n\nremote   area   near   Yauco,   Puerto    Rico.     The   group   then   threw\n\nCaballo's body in the back of his truck.          They planned to drive the\n\ntruck to Valle-Lassalle's farm to dismember and dispose of the body\n\n(and to disassemble the truck) when the truck became stuck in a\n\nmuddy ditch and they were forced to abandon it on the side of the\n\nroad.    As they were abandoning the truck, Caballo tried to get up\n\nand asked Peña why he shot him.          Peña answered, \"Because you're a\n\nmother fucker,\" and shot him two more times.          The police found the\n\ntruck and Caballo's body the next morning.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f3.   Llaurador's Murder\n\n            Later that month, Llaurador told local authorities in\n\nPonce about Caballo's murder, and provided sworn statements to the\n\nprosecutor regarding the murder on July 31 and September 13 of that\n\nyear (1996).     He also became a confidential informant for the\n\nfederal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") on September 3,\n\n1996.     The local police arrested Genao and Valle-Lassalle for\n\nCaballo's murder based on Llaurador's statements.     They issued a\n\nwarrant for Peña's arrest, but he fled before they could apprehend\n\nhim.    The criminal complaint, which was given to both Genao and\n\nValle-Lassalle when they were arrested, identified Llaurador as an\n\ninformant.\n\n            Valle-Lassalle was released on bail subsequent to his\n\narrest.    Having seen Llaurador's name on the criminal complaint,\n\nValle-Lassalle knew that Llaurador had “snitched\" to the police\n\nabout Caballo's murder.     Telling Soto that Llaurador would likely\n\n\"snitch\" on all of them, he recruited Soto, Rodriguez, and two\n\nother members of the conspiracy to find Llaurador and murder him.\n\nThe men found him on October 13, 1996 and bound him with wire.\n\nRodriguez proceeded to behead Llaurador with a machete while he was\n\nstill alive.   They dismembered his body, placed the various parts\n\nin plastic garbage bags, and threw the bags over a cliff at an\n\nabandoned dump site.      Valle-Lassalle watched the murder and told\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhis co-conspirators that if they told anyone about it, they would\n\nmeet the same fate.           He promised to repay Rodriguez for murdering\n\nLlaurador by allowing him to participate in one of the upcoming\n\nsmuggling operations.\n\nD.   Arrests and District Court Proceedings\n\n                On December 17, 1997, the government unsealed a two count\n\nindictment against Genao, Rodriguez, Valle-Lassalle, Peña, and four\n\nothers.         Roldan was not charged in that initial indictment.              The\n\ngovernment obtained a twelve count second superseding indictment on\n\nJuly       6,   2000   against   Genao,    Rodriguez,        Valle-Lassalle,   Peña,\n\nRoldan, Pagan, and six others.2            The twelve defendants were charged\n\nwith: (1) conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine and multi-hundred pound quantities\n\nof marijuana; (2) conspiracy to commit firearms murder in relation\n\nto a drug trafficking offense (Caballo); (3) aiding and abetting\n\nfirearms        murder   in    relation    to    a    drug    trafficking   offense\n\n(Caballo); (4) aiding and abetting the murder of a witness or\n\ninformant        (Llaurador);    (5)   aiding        and   abetting   murder   while\n\n\n\n       2\n      The government had previously obtained a six count first\nsuperseding indictment on July 15, 1998, charging Valle-Lassalle,\nRodriguez, Peña, Genao, Pamias, Santodomingo, and four others with\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five\nkilograms of cocaine and multi-hundred pound quantities of\nmarijuana; conspiracy to commit firearms murder in relation to a\ndrug trafficking offense (Caballo); firearms murder in relation to\na drug trafficking offense (Caballo); murder of a witness or\ninformant (Llaurador); murder while engaging in a drug trafficking\noffense (Llaurador); and witness tampering.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fengaging in a drug trafficking offense (Llaurador); (6) witness\n\ntampering (Soto); (7) aiding and abetting firearms murder in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking offense (Martin); (8) aiding and\n\nabetting the murder of a witness or informant (Martin); (9) aiding\n\nand abetting murder while engaging in a drug trafficking offense\n\n(Martin); (10) aiding and abetting solicitation of a crime of\n\nviolence; (11) misprision of felony; and (12) possession with\n\nintent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine.     The\n\nappellants here were charged as follows:\n\nCount                 Summary                     Appellant(s)\n  1     The drug conspiracy                    Genao, Rodriguez,\n                                               and Roldan\n  2     Conspiracy to commit firearms murder   Genao\n        in furtherance of a drug crime\n        (Caballo)\n  3     Aiding and abetting firearms murder    Genao\n        in furtherance of a drug crime\n        (Caballo)\n  4     Aiding and abetting murder of a        Rodriguez\n        witness (Llaurador)\n  5     Aiding and abetting murder in          Rodriguez\n        furtherance of a drug crime\n        (Llaurador)\n  7     Aiding and abetting firearms murder    Roldan\n        in furtherance of a drug crime\n        (Martin)\n  8     Aiding and abetting murder of a        Roldan\n        witness (Martin)\n  9     Aiding and abetting murder while       Roldan\n        engaging in a drug crime (Martin)\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f              After having been arraigned on the first indictment on\n\nDecember      22,    1997,    Rodriguez         was     arraigned     on     the    second\n\nsuperseding indictment on July 18, 2000.                      Similarly, Genao was\n\narraigned on the first superseding indictment on December 27, 1999\n\nand the second on July 20, 2000.               Roldan was only indicted once, on\n\nJuly 18, 2000.        The government certified the defendants as being\n\neligible for the death penalty shortly after their arraignment and\n\nmaintained     that       position     until    the    day   before    the    trial    was\n\nscheduled to begin.\n\nE.    The Trial\n\n              Of    the    twelve      indicted       defendants,     only    the    three\n\nappellants here pled not guilty and proceeded to trial.                        The trial\n\nbegan on      September      7,    2000.        Roldan's     and   Genao's     attorneys\n\nrepeatedly informed the court on the first day of trial that they\n\nwere unprepared to try the case, and both requested continuances.\n\nThe court denied their motions.\n\n              The government presented testimony from more than forty\n\nwitnesses, including Commonwealth investigators, police officers,\n\nfederal agents, eyewitnesses, and technical experts.                         The core of\n\nits    case    was    built       by   two     co-conspirators        and    cooperating\n\nwitnesses, Soto and Ramos, each of whom testified for the greater\n\npart of a week.           Soto began his testimony with a detailed first-\n\nhand   account       of    Llaurador's       murder,     highlighting        Rodriguez's\n\nparticipation in the killing and Valle-Lassalle's promise to reward\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fRodriguez for his participation. Soto then recounted how he joined\n\nthe conspiracy and the manner in which he met each of the co-\n\nconspirators.    The first time that he visited a farm owned by\n\nValle-Lassalle, he helped to inventory six to seven thousand pounds\n\nof marijuana.   He also described the planning and execution of the\n\norganization's narcotics shipments and the roles played by Genao,\n\nRodriguez, and Roldan.    He provided the details regarding a seven\n\nhundred kilogram load of cocaine that the group smuggled in May or\n\nJune 1994, and discussed a trip that he took to Ayala's house in\n\nthe summer of 1997 with Valle-Lassalle, Rodriguez, and Hernandez to\n\nnegotiate a shipment of two thousand kilograms of cocaine.         Valle-\n\nLassalle   negotiated   with   Ayala   while   Rodriguez   and   Hernandez\n\nlistened to music and played pool.       Ayala was arrested before that\n\nshipment could take place, but Valle-Lassalle negotiated another\n\nshipment later that summer.      The second shipment was interrupted\n\nwhen Valle-Lassalle was arrested on Commonwealth weapons charges\n\nstemming from a shootout that he had with members of a rival drug\n\ngang.   Soto also briefly recounted Valle-Lassalle's explanation of\n\nCaballo's murder. Finally, he described how he became a government\n\ninformant and the terms of his plea agreement.\n\n           Ramos began his testimony by providing a first-person\n\naccount of Martin's murder.     He then named some of the key members\n\nof the conspiracy, explained how he knew them, and described their\n\nroles in the organization.     He provided details on a number of the\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcocaine and marijuana shipments that he helped to smuggle.               These\n\nincluded a six to seven thousand pound shipment of marijuana in the\n\nsummer of 1993, which Roldan helped to inventory; six hundred\n\nkilogram shipments in late December 1993 and late December 1994,\n\nwhich Roldan helped to transport; a nine hundred to one thousand\n\nkilogram shipment in the fall of 1995 on behalf of Ayala, which\n\nGenao helped to transport; and a shipment of cocaine in February\n\n1996, which Genao also helped to transport.        Caballo later learned\n\nthat Valle-Lassalle had stolen thirty kilograms of cocaine from\n\nthis shipment. Ramos described his unsuccessful efforts to prevent\n\nValle-Lassalle from killing Caballo to cover up that theft and\n\nessentially repeated Genao's description of Caballo's murder.               He\n\nnoted that after Genao was arrested for Caballo's murder, Genao\n\nwrote to him requesting a loan for bail money.              Ramos forwarded\n\nthat request to Valle-Lassalle who instructed Ramos to tell Genao\n\nnot to worry because he would be out soon.             Nine days later,\n\nLlaurador -- the chief witness against Genao in the murder case --\n\nwas killed, and Genao was released for lack of evidence.                 Valle-\n\nLassalle told Ramos that \"he had taken care of the problem because\n\nthe guy who was snitching had been killed.\"\n\n           Ramos   also   testified      about   the   methods      of     drug\n\ndistribution that he employed.      He managed the drug point in the\n\nMontana housing project and sold the drugs that he bought or\n\nreceived   as   payment   from   Valle-Lassalle.       He    said   that     he\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\ffrequently used Genao as a courier to pick up drugs for Ramos to\n\nsell. Finally, Ramos testified that he was arrested for attempting\n\nto introduce drugs into the country on August 24, 1998.                       He pled\n\nguilty and began cooperating in approximately April 1999.\n\n            On   October       10,    2000,    the     jury   convicted     the   three\n\ndefendants on all counts.             On March 28, 2001, the district court\n\nsentenced Rodriguez to two life sentences for his two murder\n\nconvictions, aiding and abetting murder of a witness (Llaurador)\n\nand aiding and abetting murder in furtherance of a drug crime\n\n(Llaurador).      See U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, cmt. 1 (\"The Commission has\n\nconcluded    that     in   the       absence      of   capital    punishment,       life\n\nimprisonment     is      the   appropriate         punishment     for     premeditated\n\nkilling.\").      The court applied the murder cross reference to his\n\ndrug conspiracy conviction to sentence him to life in prison on\n\nthat conviction as well.             See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d)(1) (instructing\n\ncourts to apply the first degree murder sentencing guideline when\n\nconsidering the appropriate sentencing range for a drug conviction\n\nif a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute\n\nmurder   under      18     U.S.C.      §    1111);      see      United    States    v.\n\nReyes-Echevarria, 345 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding the\n\nsentencing court's application of the murder cross reference to the\n\ndefendant's drug conspiracy conviction after the sentencing judge\n\nconcluded by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had\n\nmurdered a rival drug dealer).\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f            On March 18, 2002, the court sentenced Genao to two life\n\nsentences for his two murder convictions, conspiracy to commit\n\nfirearms murder in furtherance of a drug crime (Caballo) and aiding\n\nand abetting     firearms     murder     in    furtherance   of   a   drug   crime\n\n(Caballo), and applied the murder cross reference to his drug\n\nconspiracy conviction, sentencing him to a total of three life\n\nsentences.     On the same day, the court sentenced Roldan to three\n\nlife    sentences   for   his    three    murder      convictions,    aiding   and\n\nabetting firearms murder in furtherance of a drug crime (Martin),\n\naiding and abetting murder of a witness (Martin), and aiding and\n\nabetting murder while engaging in a drug crime (Martin).                 It also\n\napplied the murder cross reference to Roldan's drug conspiracy\n\nconviction, resulting in a total of four life sentences. Genao and\n\nRoldan filed multiple motions for new trials based on newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence, which the district court denied.\n\n                                         II.\n\nA.     Rodriguez's Claims\n\n1.     Specificity of the Indictment\n\n             Arguing   that     count    four    of   the   second    superseding\n\nindictment (murder of a witness) did not provide sufficient details\n\nregarding the federal nexus of Llaurador's murder, Rodriguez argues\n\nthat his conviction should be vacated.                   The Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure generally require defendants to raise objections\n\nto indictments prior to trial.            See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B)\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f(stating that \"a motion alleging a defect in the indictment or\n\ninformation\" \"must be raised before trial\").               Failure to do so\n\nconstitutes waiver.      See    Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e) (\"A party waives\n\nany Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request not raised by the\n\ndeadline the court sets under Rule 12(c) or by any extension the\n\ncourt    provides.\").     Although      Rule   12   creates    exceptions     for\n\nobjections challenging a court's jurisdiction and those claiming\n\nthat the indictment did not actually charge the crime for which the\n\ndefendant was tried, Rodriguez's objection to the specificity of\n\ncount four does not fall under these exceptions. See United States\n\nv. Crowley, 318 F.3d 401, 420 (2d Cir. 2003).              In the absence of\n\nany indication    in    the    record   that   Rodriguez      objected   to   the\n\nspecificity of the indictment before trial, we conclude that he\n\nwaived this argument.3\n\n2.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Rodriguez argues that the government failed to introduce\n\nsufficient evidence to support two counts of his conviction, the\n\ndrug conspiracy charge (count one) and the aiding and abetting\n\nmurder of a witness charge (count four).4           We review a sufficiency\n\nof the evidence claim de novo, \"eschewing credibility judgments and\n\n\n\n     3\n      While Rule 12(e) allows a reviewing court to grant relief\nfrom this waiver for good cause, we see no basis for doing so here.\n     4\n      Rodriguez did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\nregarding his conviction on count five, aiding and abetting the\nmurder (of Llaurador) in furtherance of a drug crime.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to\n\nascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government\n\nproved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\na.   Conspiracy\n\n            \"To prove the elements of the crime of conspiracy, the\n\nGovernment must show the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's\n\nknowledge    of   the    conspiracy,    and    the    defendant's    voluntary\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy.\"             United States v. Llinas, 373\n\nF.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nProof of the defendant's participation in the conspiracy must\n\ninclude proof that he intended to commit the underlying substantive\n\noffense.    Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1173.         \"Such proof may consist of\n\ncircumstantial evidence, including inferences from surrounding\n\ncircumstances,    such    as   acts   committed      by   the   defendant   that\n\nfurthered the conspiracy's purposes. The government need not prove\n\nthat a co-conspirator knew all of the details or participated in\n\nall of the objectives of the plan.\"               Llinas, 373 F.3d at 30\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              Since Rodriguez does not\n\ncontest the existence of a drug conspiracy, we need only consider\n\nwhether the government proved his participation in the conspiracy.\n\n            Rodriguez claims that the only evidence linking him to\n\nthe drug conspiracy was Soto's testimony that Rodriguez was present\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fat the May 1997 meeting with Angela Ayala, when she and Valle-\n\nLassalle negotiated the details of a two thousand kilogram cocaine\n\nshipment.      He argues that while he was at her house during the\n\nmeeting, he played pool, listened to music, and did not participate\n\nin that meeting.\n\n             This argument reflects a highly misleading view of the\n\nevidence adduced at trial.                 In fact, Soto testified that Valle-\n\nLassalle     offered     to    allow       Rodriguez      to    participate    in    this\n\nparticular drug smuggling operation if he murdered Llaurador.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Soto told Rodriguez that Rodriguez's share of\n\nthat drug shipment could be twenty to thirty thousand dollars, and\n\nRodriguez remarked that he expected to receive \"a good position\" in\n\nthe drug organization for committing the murder. His claim that he\n\nwas innocently playing pool at Ayala's house without knowledge that\n\na    major   narcotics    deal       was    being   negotiated      simply    does    not\n\nwithstand scrutiny.           Given this testimony, we have no difficulty\n\nconcluding that a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Rodriguez was part of the drug conspiracy.\n\nb.    Aiding and Abetting Murder of a Witness\n\n             Rodriguez        also    claims       that   the    evidence     that    the\n\ngovernment introduced to prove that he murdered Llaurador was\n\ninsufficient to establish a violation of the Witness Protection\n\nAct, which states:\n\n             [W]hoever kills . . . another person, with\n             intent to (A) prevent the attendance or\n\n                                            -20-\n\f          testimony of any person in an official\n          proceeding [or] . . . (C) prevent the\n          communication   by   any  person   to  a   law\n          enforcement officer or judge of the United\n          States   of   information  relating   to   the\n          commission or possible commission of a Federal\n          offense . . . shall be punished . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1512(a)(1).       The government argues that Rodriguez\n\nkilled Llaurador to prevent him from communicating with authorities\n\nregarding federal offenses.\n\n          To establish a crime under the \"law enforcement officer\"\n\nsection of the Act, the government must prove that:\n\n          (1) the defendant killed or attempted to kill\n          a person; (2) the defendant was motivated by a\n          desire to prevent the communication between\n          any person and law enforcement authorities\n          concerning   the    commission   or   possible\n          commission of an offense; (3) that offense was\n          actually a federal offense; and (4) the\n          defendant believed that the person in (2)\n          above might communicate with the federal\n          authorities.\n\nUnited States v. Stansfield, 101 F.3d 909, 918 (3d Cir. 1996).   The\n\nAct explicitly relieves the government from having to prove that\n\nthe defendant suspected that the witness would communicate to\n\nfederal, as opposed to state, officials regarding the crime, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1512(g) (stating that \"[i]n a prosecution for an offense\n\nunder this section, no state of mind need be proved with respect to\n\nthe circumstance . . . that the law enforcement officer is an\n\nofficer or employee of the Federal Government\"); therefore, the\n\nfourth prong may be proven, among other ways, by demonstrating that\n\nthe underlying offense was a federal offense and that the federal\n\n                                 -21-\n\fauthorities had begun an investigation prior to the informant's\n\nmurder or attempted murder.         United States v. Bell, 113 F.3d 1345,\n\n1349-50 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n             The government easily met its burden here.               Although\n\nRodriguez repeatedly refers to Caballo's murder as a Commonwealth\n\noffense, the second superseding indictment lists the murder as a\n\ncharged offense and identifies it as an overt act in furtherance of\n\nthe federal drug conspiracy.           The federal government, through the\n\nDEA, had opened an investigation into this conspiracy and had\n\ninterviewed Llaurador prior to his murder.            Rodriguez's claim that\n\nhe did not realize that he was helping to conceal a federal crime\n\nby   murdering   Llaurador     is   irrelevant.       See United     States   v.\n\nApplewhaite, 195 F.3d 679, 687 (3d Cir. 1999) (\"All that [a\n\nparallel provision in the Witness Protection Act] requires is that\n\nthe government establish that the defendants had the intent to\n\ninfluence an investigation that happened to be federal.\").\n\nB.   Genao's Claims\n\n1.   Newly Discovered Evidence\n\n             Genao first complains that the district court should have\n\ngranted him a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 based on his\n\npost-trial discovery of exculpatory evidence.              Rule 33 allows a\n\ncourt   to   grant   a   new   trial    \"if   the   interest   of   justice   so\n\nrequires.\"     Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a).          We will only overturn the\n\ncourt's refusal to do so upon a showing that it manifestly abused\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fits discretion.      United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 160 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n          Genao      claimed    in   his   Rule   33    motion      that    two    co-\n\ndefendants,     Peña   and      Valle-Lassalle,        each       proffered    sworn\n\nstatements after the trial claiming that Genao did not participate\n\nin Caballo's murder.     He also claimed that a private investigator,\n\nBenny   Soto,    had   interviewed       Santodomingo,        a    leader     of   the\n\nconspiracy, who had been arrested for money laundering in 1994 and\n\nlater pled guilty to drug trafficking charges arising out of the\n\nfirst superseding indictment in this case.                        The investigator\n\nreported that Santodomingo would testify that Genao had not been\n\ninvolved in the drug conspiracy. The district court denied Genao's\n\nmotion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing.\n\nUpon receiving Genao's motion for reconsideration, the court held\n\na   hearing     to   consider     it,    and   Peña,     Valle-Lassalle,           and\n\nSantodomingo testified.          Citing Genao's lack of diligence in\n\nseeking this evidence prior to trial and the witnesses' lack of\n\ncredibility, the court again denied his motion for a new trial.\n\n           \"A motion for new trial on the basis of newly discovered\n\nevidence will ordinarily not be granted unless the moving party can\n\ndemonstrate that: (1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable to\n\nthe defendant at the time of trial; (2) failure to learn of the\n\nevidence was not due to lack of diligence by the defendant; (3) the\n\nevidence is material, and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f(4) it will probably result in an acquittal upon retrial of the\n\ndefendant.\" United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir.\n\n1980). \"The defendant must meet all four prongs of the Wright test\n\nin order to succeed on a Rule 33 motion.    A defendant's new trial\n\nmotion must be denied if he fails to meet any one of these\n\nfactors.\"    United States v. Colon-Munoz, 318 F.3d 348, 360 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Peña testified that he was the triggerman in Caballo's\n\nmurder and that Genao was not present at the murder scene.       In\n\nfact, he testified that he did not meet Genao until the two were\n\nimprisoned together prior to their federal trial.      When Genao's\n\nlawyer asked him why he had failed to present this testimony\n\nearlier, he answered:\n\n            Well,   I  was   in  negotiation   [with   the\n            government]. I mean, at one point in time, I\n            was thinking of fighting my case, you know, of\n            going to trial in my case, but then I started\n            to think a lot about Genao and the fact that\n            he had nothing to do with [Caballo]'s death.\n            Because I really had never met Genao out in\n            the street at all. I never saw him.\n\n            So when I finally made my agreement and I was\n            already sentenced, I said, Well, I'm going to\n            help him out because he really had nothing to\n            do with any of this killing, because I was the\n            one who killed [Caballo], and the ones\n            involved in [Caballo]'s murder, the ones who\n            were there for [Caballo]'s murder, was me and\n            [Llaurador], and we were the only ones who\n            were there at the lake when [Caballo] was\n            killed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fOn cross-examination, Peña admitted that, as part of his plea\n\nagreement, he accepted as true and correct the version of facts in\n\ncounts one and three of the second superseding indictment, which\n\nstated that Genao participated in Caballo's murder.                However, he\n\nclaimed that he thought that this affirmation meant that he was\n\nadmitting to the accusations in the indictment relating to his own\n\nactions   and    culpability,    not   necessarily      to   the    facts   and\n\naccusations relating to his co-conspirators.\n\n           Valle-Lassalle said that Genao never assisted with any of\n\nthe drug loads and that Genao had nothing to do with Caballo's\n\nmurder.   Even though Genao asked him in jail to say that he was not\n\nguilty, Valle-Lassalle said that he did not come forward with this\n\nevidence earlier because he was awaiting trial.               Valle-Lassalle\n\nrepeatedly refused to implicate some of his co-conspirators in the\n\nmurders and drug smuggling operations, prompting the government to\n\nask: \"It goes against every grain of your being to testify and\n\nimplicate anyone that's not a cooperator or a dead person in\n\ncriminal conduct; isn't that correct?\"         Valle-Lassalle answered\n\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n\n           Santodomingo's testimony was less detailed.              He stated\n\nthat he met Genao through Ramos and that Genao did not do any drug\n\nwork for him.\n\n           We     have   previously     characterized        post-sentencing\n\nexculpatory     testimony   of   co-conspirators   as    being     \"inherently\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fsuspect.\"         United States v. Montilla-Rivera, 171 F.3d 37, 42 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).         Such witnesses have little to lose by fabricating\n\nstories designed to free their comrades, especially when, as here,\n\nthe stories do not run the risk of implicating the witnesses in\n\nother criminal acts.5        United States v. Simmons, 714 F.2d 29, 31-32\n\n(5th       Cir.    1983)   (\"[O]nce     sentence   has    been   imposed     on    a\n\nco-defendant, '. . . there is very little to deter the . . .\n\nco-defendant from untruthfully swearing out an affidavit in which\n\nhe purports to shoulder the entire blame.'\") (citation omitted;\n\nellipses in original). Valle-Lassalle's admission that he was only\n\nwilling       to    inculpate   dead     people    and   informants,   and        the\n\ncontradictions between Peña's testimony at the evidentiary hearing\n\nand    the    facts    recounted   in    his    plea   agreement,   capture       the\n\nlimitations of the post-trial testimony of all three witnesses\n\nproduced at the evidentiary hearing.                   Having presided at the\n\nlengthy trial of Genao and the co-defendants, and having heard the\n\ntestimony of the co-conspirators produced at the hearing on the\n\nmotion for a new trial, the district court did not remotely abuse\n\nits discretion in rejecting the argument that the testimony from\n\nGenao's co-conspirators \"will probably result in an acquittal upon\n\n\n\n       5\n      Santodomingo is serving a 276 month sentence after being\nindicted in the first superseding indictment and pleading guilty to\nnarcotics trafficking. The record does not identify the crimes to\nwhich the other two witnesses pled guilty; however, Valle-Lassalle\nadmitted that he is serving a life sentence and Peña admitted that\nhe is serving a thirty year sentence.\n\n                                         -26-\n\fretrial.\"    Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.\n\n2.   Confrontation Clause\n\n            At trial, the government called Edgar Delgado García, a\n\nPuerto Rico Commonwealth judge who was the local prosecutor when\n\nLlaurador started cooperating with authorities prior to his murder.\n\nJudge Delgado read two sworn statements that Llaurador had given to\n\nthe police in the summer of 1996 regarding Caballo's murder.            In\n\nthe first statement, Llaurador provided a detailed account of the\n\nnight of the murder, including the plan that Genao and Peña\n\ndeveloped to trap Caballo; the manner in which they killed him; and\n\nthe way in which Caballo's truck got stuck on the side of the road\n\nafter the murder.      In the second statement, Llaurador explained\n\nthat Valle-Lassalle told him that he had given the order for\n\nCaballo's death because Caballo was going to tell the Colombians\n\nabout the cocaine theft.      Genao objected to the admission of this\n\nhearsay testimony against him immediately before Judge Delgado\n\ntestified.\n\n            The   argument   over   the    admissibility   of   Llaurador's\n\nstatements principally involved the application of the forfeiture\n\nby wrongdoing doctrine,6 which, as embodied in Rule 804(b)(6) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence, creates an exception to the general\n\n\n\n     6\n      The government also argued that Llaurador's statements\ncontained sufficient indicia of reliability to be admissible under\nthe catch-all provision in the hearsay rules. See Fed. R. Evid.\n807.\n\n                                    -27-\n\fprohibition on the admission of hearsay testimony for \"statement[s]\n\noffered   against    a    party       that   has       engaged    or    acquiesced         in\n\nwrongdoing    that       was     intended        to,     and     did,     procure         the\n\nunavailability of the declarant as a witness.\"                    Genao claimed that\n\nhe was in jail awaiting trial for Caballo's murder when Llaurador\n\nwas murdered; therefore, he had nothing to do with the killing.\n\nNoting that Rule 804(b)(6) allows the admission of evidence against\n\ndefendants who acquiesced in a hearsay declarant's murder, the\n\ngovernment responded that the mere fact that Genao did not directly\n\nparticipate   in    the   murder       was   immaterial.          According          to   the\n\ngovernment, a portion of Ramos's testimony demonstrated that Genao\n\nknew that Llaurador was going to be murdered and that Genao\n\nacquiesced in the murder.             Specifically, Ramos had testified that\n\nGenao asked him for bail money when the two were imprisoned; when\n\nRamos called Valle-Lassalle to tell him about this request, Valle-\n\nLassalle told him to tell Genao that he should not be worried\n\nbecause he would be out soon.              Nine days later, according to the\n\ngovernment,   Llaurador         was    murdered        and   Genao      was    set    free.\n\nTherefore,    according        to   the   government,          Genao    acquiesced        in\n\nLlaurador's murder.            Apparently agreeing with the government's\n\ntheory of acquiescence (the court did not elaborate on its ruling),\n\nthe   court    admitted        Llaurador's         statements        to       the    former\n\nCommonwealth prosecutor as evidence against Genao.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fa.   Crawford v. Washington\n\n            As we recently noted, the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nCrawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004), \"changed the legal\n\nlandscape for determining whether the admission of certain hearsay\n\nstatements violates the accused's right to confront witnesses.\"7\n\nHorton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 83 (1st Cir. 2004).                 Overturning\n\nearlier   precedent   that   allowed    a    court   to    consider       hearsay\n\ntestimony against a criminal defendant if that testimony \"bore\n\nparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\" see, e.g., Ohio v.\n\nRoberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980), the Crawford Court held that,\n\nabsent other grounds for admissibility, the Confrontation Clause\n\ncategorically bars the admission of testimonial hearsay unless the\n\ndeclarant   is   unavailable   and     the   accused      has   had   a    prior\n\nopportunity to cross-examine the declarant.            Crawford, 124 S. Ct.\n\nat 1374 (\"Where testimonial evidence is at issue . . . the Sixth\n\nAmendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and\n\na prior opportunity for cross-examination.\").             Although the Court\n\nleft for another day a comprehensive definition of \"testimonial\"\n\nhearsay, it stated that \"[w]hatever else the term covers, it\n\n\n      7\n      Genao filed a Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) letter, pro se, on March\n30, 2004, citing Crawford. The government never filed a Rule 28(j)\nletter regarding that case. We heard oral argument in this case on\nMarch 2, 2004, and Crawford was published on March 8, 2004.\nAlthough Crawford was decided after Genao was convicted, we must\napply this new precedent in his appeal.     See, e.g., Hamling v.\nUnited States, 418 U.S. 87, 102 (1974) (\"[A] change in the law\noccurring after a relevant event in a case will be given effect\nwhile the case is on direct review.\").\n\n                                 -29-\n\fapplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,\n\nbefore   a   grand   jury,     or   at    a     former     trial;   and     to   police\n\ninterrogations,\" or other \"extrajudicial statements . . . contained\n\nin   formalized      testimonial         materials,        such     as     affidavits,\n\ndepositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\"                       Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n             We conclude that Llaurador's signed confession, presented\n\nunder oath to the prosecutor in Puerto Rico, is testimonial hearsay\n\nwithin the meaning given by the Supreme Court.                    See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 228 (2d Cir. 2004) (discussing the\n\nparameters of \"testimonial hearsay\" in light of Crawford).                         Since\n\nGenao did not have the prior opportunity to confront Llaurador\n\nregarding his statements, we conclude that, absent some independent\n\nground for admissibility, it was a constitutional error for the\n\ncourt to admit Llaurador's statements against Genao.\n\nb.   Forfeiture by Wrongdoing\n\n             As noted, the government drew upon the forfeiture by\n\nwrongdoing     doctrine   in    arguing         to   the    district       court    that\n\nLlaurador's    hearsay    statements          were   admissible      against       Genao\n\nbecause he had acquiesced in Llaurador's murder.                         Forfeiture by\n\nwrongdoing is an independent ground for the admissibility of\n\nhearsay testimony that survives Crawford. See Crawford, 124 S. Ct.\n\nat 1370.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\f             Curiously, on appeal, the government essentially abandons\n\nthe forfeiture by wrongdoing argument, limiting itself to this one\n\nstatement in its brief: \"Genao was aware of the order to kill\n\nLlaurador because he had been informed by Victor Manuel Valle\n\nLassalle, a/k/a 'Manolo,' through David Ramos-Rivera, a/k/a 'Pecas'\n\nnot to worry.\"       Instead, it simply argues that both of Llaurador's\n\nstatements were admissible because they were declarations against\n\npenal interest and were otherwise reliable.           See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n804(b)(3).     Crawford makes these traditional hearsay arguments\n\nirrelevant.     According to Crawford, Genao had a constitutional\n\nright to confront Llaurador that, as to testimonial hearsay, could\n\nnot be overridden merely by showing indicia of reliability.\n\n             Under    appropriate   circumstances,   the   forfeiture   by\n\nwrongdoing doctrine can provide an exception to the Confrontation\n\nClause.   See Crawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1370.            But the glancing\n\nreference to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing in the\n\ngovernment's brief does not give us any assistance in addressing\n\nthis difficult waiver issue.8        \"We believe it is apodictic that\n\n\n     8\n      Without purporting to resolve anything, we suggest some of\nthe difficulties involved in determining whether a defendant has\n\"acquiesced\" in wrongdoing that would forfeit his confrontation\nrights. The Seventh and Tenth Circuits have held that the scope of\nimputed responsibility for procuring the unavailability of a\nwitness, under both Rule 804(b)(6) and the Confrontation Clause, is\ncoextensive with conspiratorial liability under Pinkerton v. United\nStates, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). See United States v. Cherry, 217 F.3d\n811 (10th Cir. 2000); accord United States v. Thompson, 286 F.3d\n950 (7th Cir. 2002) (adopting Cherry). Under Cherry, the hearsay\nand Confrontation Clause exceptions are met if \"the wrongful\n\n                                    -31-\n\f'issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\n\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.'\"                  United\n\nStates v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 393 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).                    This\n\nrule, though most commonly applied to defendant-appellants, may be\n\n\"applie[d] with undiminished vigor when, as now, a prosecutor\n\nattempts     to    rely    on   fleeting    references   to    unsubstantiated\n\nconclusions in lieu of structured argumentation.\"              Caraballo-Cruz,\n\n52 F.3d at 393.           Although in certain circumstances we have the\n\ndiscretion    to    overlook     waiver    by   inadequate    argument   by    the\n\ngovernment in a criminal case, see United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d\n\n1408, 1414 (1st Cir. 1997) (court of appeals has discretion to\n\noverlook government's waiver of harmless error argument), it would\n\nbe inappropriate in this case to make the government's argument for\n\nit on an issue both factually and legally complex.\n\n\n\n\nprocurement [of the witness's unavailability] was in furtherance,\nwithin the scope, and reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or\nnatural consequence of an ongoing conspiracy.\" 217 F.3d at 820.\nHowever, Cherry requires the district court to determine the\nfactors supporting conspiratorial liability at an evidentiary\nhearing conducted outside the jury's presence. Id. at 815.\n     Here, the district court did not make any factual findings on\nthe applicability of conspiratorial liability, let alone conduct a\nseparate hearing outside the presence of the jury. While Cherry\nmay represent a sensible rule of law, the government's failure to\nargue it means that we lack the benefit of arguments on whether to\napply Cherry to this case, either in its substantive (scope of\nliability) or procedural (determination of liability by separate\nhearing) aspects. These difficulties highlight the necessity of\nfully developed arguments on the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine.\n\n                                      -32-\n\fc.   Harmless Error\n\n           Although the government argued wrongly that Llaurador's\n\nstatements were admissible as declarations against penal interest,\n\nit failed to argue in the alternative that, if the statements were\n\nerroneously admitted, the error was harmless.   See generally Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 52(a) (\"Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance\n\nthat does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\");\n\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986) (holding that\n\nharmless error review applies to Confrontation Clause violations);\n\nUnited States v. Reyes-Echevarria, 345 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(\"We review challenges to the admissibility of evidence under the\n\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause for harmless error.\").\n\n           Because the government has not argued harmless error, we\n\ncould simply deem the issue waived, as we did for the forfeiture by\n\nwrongdoing issue, and vacate the relevant convictions of Genao.\n\nHowever, as noted, we have discretion \"to overlook the government's\n\nfailure to argue that the admission of the challenged evidence, if\n\nerror, was harmless, and that [we] may therefore consider the issue\n\nof harmlessness sua sponte.\"   Rose, 104 F.3d at 1414.   Exercising\n\nthis discretion \"involves the balancing of many elements.\"   Id. at\n\n1415.   If our sua sponte harmless error analysis led us to affirm\n\nGenao's conviction, we would have to engage in a nuanced analysis\n\nof the appropriateness of that sua sponte review.    Here, for the\n\nsake of completeness, and in light of our decision to vacate the\n\n\n                               -33-\n\fconvictions for the serious crimes under review, we choose to\n\nexplain why admission of Llaurador's statements cannot be deemed\n\nharmless.\n\n            \"The government, not the defendants, bears the burden of\n\nestablishing harmlessness.\"       United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104,\n\n121 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied sub nom. Segui-Rodriguez v.\n\nUnited States, 124 S. Ct. 2405 (2004).               The analysis is case-\n\nspecific, considering, \"among other things, the centrality of the\n\ntainted material, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the uses\n\nto which it was put during the trial, the relative strengths of the\n\nparties' cases,     and   any   telltales     that   furnish     clues    to   the\n\nlikelihood that the error affected the factfinder's resolution of\n\na material issue.\"    Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1182.\n\n            We begin our harmless error analysis by describing the\n\nevidence implicating Genao in the murder of Caballo apart from\n\nLlaurador's hearsay statements.         Ramos, the co-conspirator turned\n\ninformant, described a conversation that he had with Genao in which\n\nGenao explained the course of events on the night of Caballo's\n\nmurder.   Genao explained to Ramos that Caballo wanted Peña to kill\n\nLlaurador because Caballo suspected Llaurador of stealing his all\n\nterrain   vehicle   (\"ATV\").      Genao     joined    Peña   and   Caballo      in\n\nCaballo's white pickup truck to hunt for Llaurador.                     When they\n\nfinally   found   Llaurador,    Genao   got    in    the   car   with    him   and\n\nexplained that Caballo wanted to kill him but that he should not\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fworry because Genao and Peña were planning on killing Caballo\n\ninstead.     They drove to a remote location with Caballo's white\n\npickup following behind and then disembarked.             When Caballo told\n\nPeña to kill Llaurador, Peña shot Caballo instead.            The three then\n\nloaded Caballo's body into the back of the pickup truck and were\n\nplanning to dismember the body at Valle-Lassalle's when the truck\n\nbecame stuck.    They were forced to abandon the truck and the body\n\non the side of the road.\n\n            The government offered some corroboration of Ramos's\n\ntestimony    implicating   Genao   in   the   murder    of   Caballo.    Soto\n\ntestified that Valle-Lassalle \"told [him] what had happened with\n\n[Caballo], that it had been [Genao] and [Peña], and that he had to\n\ndo it because of the Colombian thing.\"                 Caballo's girlfriend\n\ntestified that the last time that she saw Caballo was when he left\n\nher house with Peña and Genao on the night of his murder.                 She\n\nconfirmed that Caballo's ATV had vanished and that the men brought\n\nweapons with them in Caballo's white pickup truck to search for\n\nLlaurador.    Finally, Puerto Rico Police Agent Jorge Nazario Torres\n\ntestified that he found Caballo's body in his pickup truck, which\n\nwas stuck on the side of the road.\n\n            There is certainly some force to this evidence.             If the\n\nissue before us was the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury's finding that Genao engaged in a conspiracy to murder Caballo\n\nor that he aided and abetted the murder of Caballo, we would\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fconclude    that     the   evidence   was    sufficient    to   support    those\n\nconvictions.        However, the issue before us is not the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence.           Instead, we must decide whether there is a\n\nreasonable possibility that the error at issue (the admission of\n\nLlaurador's statements) influenced the jury in finding Genao guilty\n\nof these murder-related charges.        Before stating our conclusion on\n\nthat issue, we summarize the statements of Llaurador that were\n\npresented to the jury by Judge (and former prosecutor) Delgado.\n\n              Delgado testified that he put Llaurador under oath and\n\nasked him to tell him everything that he knew about Caballo's\n\nmurder.       Llaurador responded in detail.          He said that he saw\n\nCaballo's truck stopped near his home at 2:00 AM on July 15, 2000.\n\nKnowing that Caballo was mad at him for stealing the ATV, Llaurador\n\nthought that Caballo was either looking for the ATV or was on his\n\nway   to   visit     Llaurador's   girlfriend.        So   he   drove     to   his\n\ngirlfriend's house to see if Caballo was there.                   He was not;\n\nhowever, Caballo eventually drove near the house, and Genao got out\n\nof Caballo's truck and asked Llaurador to take him to buy gasoline.\n\nWhile they were driving in Llaurador's truck, Genao explained that\n\nCaballo wanted Genao and Peña to kill him for stealing the ATV but\n\nthat they were planning on killing Caballo instead because Caballo\n\nwas   going    to    \"snitch\"   regarding     the   cocaine     theft.     Genao\n\nrepeatedly reassured Llaurador that nothing was going to happen to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fhim, and he told him to drive toward the cockfighting arena to meet\n\nCaballo and Peña.\n\n            After meeting the other two at the arena, Genao and\n\nLlaurador drove to a lake with Peña and Caballo following behind in\n\nCaballo's truck.    Genao continued to reassure Llaurador that they\n\nwere not planning to kill him.   Peña and Genao switched trucks when\n\nthey arrived at the lake.      Llaurador then implored, \"if you're\n\ngoing to kill me, kill me here and just leave me here.\"         Peña\n\nresponded: \"Are you going to keep up with this?    Just take it easy,\n\nwe're not going to do anything to you.\"           Llaurador followed\n\nCaballo's truck a little further up a path, and then all four men\n\ngot out of their vehicles.       Caballo grabbed Llaurador's shirt,\n\npushed him up against one of the trucks, and told Peña to \"[p]ump\n\nfour shots into [his] face.\"     Raising his arm, Peña said that he\n\nwas going to pump four shots into Caballo's face and shot him in\n\nthe face.    Genao and Peña then began to argue about whether they\n\nshould leave Caballo's body there or take it with them.         They\n\ndecided to put the body in the back of Caballo's truck, and\n\nLlaurador, driving alone in his truck, led the group away from the\n\nlake, with Peña and Genao quickly following in Caballo's truck. At\n\nsome point, Llaurador noticed that the truck was not behind him\n\nanymore, and he turned back and found it stuck in a ditch on the\n\nside of the road.    He heard two shots as he was backing up and,\n\nupon reaching the truck, was told that Peña shot Caballo two more\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\ftimes because he got up and asked why Peña had shot him.              Peña\n\nanswered, \"[b]ecause you're a mother fucker.\" Llaurador then drove\n\nGenao to his car and drove Peña to a public housing complex in\n\nAguadilla.     As they were driving, Genao told Llaurador that the\n\noriginal plan was to make Caballo \"disappear\" so that Genao could\n\nkeep the truck.\n\n             Delgado   testified    that    Llaurador   provided   another\n\nstatement on September 13, in which he discussed Valle-Lassalle's\n\nrelationship to the murder.        Llaurador said that Genao told him on\n\nthe way to the cockfighting arena that Valle-Lassalle told them to\n\nkill Caballo because he was going to \"snitch\" about the cocaine and\n\nthat they were planning on taking the body back to Valle-Lassalle's\n\nafterward to \"chop him up and make him disappear.\"           That is why\n\nthey took the body with them after the murder.           Genao also told\n\nLlaurador that he was planning to dismantle the truck.\n\n             Llaurador added that he saw Valle-Lassalle a week after\n\nthe murder, and the gangleader explained his rationale for killing\n\nCaballo and said that Peña had left the country.           Valle-Lassalle\n\nalso mentioned another death9 at a parking lot of the Ducos housing\n\nproject.     Llaurador presciently noted to prosecutor Delgado that\n\nValle-Lassalle would kill him if he found out about the statements\n\nhe was then making and that he omitted the leader's involvement in\n\nhis earlier statement \"because Manolo is the one who orders the\n\n\n     9\n         We take this to be a reference to Martin's murder.\n\n                                     -38-\n\fkillings.\"       Finally, he said that he had not seen Peña since the\n\nmurder and that he had not seen Genao since the two attended\n\nCaballo's wake.\n\n             These detailed statements of Llaurador, so similar in\n\nsome of their details to the testimony of Ramos, are powerfully\n\ncorroborative      of   the     testimony       offered    by   Ramos   and     others\n\nimplicating Genao in the murder of Caballo. To treat these hearsay\n\nstatements of Llaurador as merely cumulative (the harmless side of\n\ncorroborative) would be unrealistic.                Moreover, these statements\n\nwere read into the record by a Commonwealth judge who was so\n\nidentified to the jury.             That association inevitably added to the\n\nweight of the hearsay testimony being offered, particularly since\n\nthe principal non-hearsay evidence consisted of testimony by a co-\n\nconspirator      (Ramos)      and    a   cooperator    (Soto),     both    of    whose\n\nintegrity might be more open to question than Llaurador's.                       Under\n\nthese circumstances, we cannot exclude the reasonable possibility\n\nthat   the   constitutional          error    at   issue   in   the   admission     of\n\nLlaurador's statements influenced the jury in reaching its verdict\n\nthat Genao was guilty of participating in a conspiracy to murder\n\nCaballo and that he aided and abetted that murder.                    Therefore, we\n\nmust vacate those convictions.\n\n             We reach a different conclusion regarding the impact of\n\nthe    court's    error    on    the     jury's    consideration      of   the    drug\n\nconspiracy (count one) charge.               Focusing almost exclusively on the\n\n\n                                          -39-\n\fevents   surrounding   Caballo's   murder,   Llaurador's   erroneously-\n\nadmitted statements say little about Genao's involvement in the\n\ndrug smuggling work of the conspiracy.       Moreover, the testimony of\n\nthe two cooperating witnesses firmly established his participation\n\nin those activities.    Ramos testified that Genao worked as a drug\n\ncourier for him before Genao became a member of the conspiracy,\n\ndelivering pounds of marijuana for Ramos to sell at the Montana\n\nhousing complex.   He described Genao's participation in two large\n\ndrug shipments, a nine hundred to one thousand kilogram shipment in\n\nthe fall of 1995 that the group smuggled on behalf of Ayala; and a\n\nshipment of cocaine in February 1996, which Genao also helped to\n\ntransport and from which the conspirators stole kilos.             Soto\n\ntestified that Genao participated in an aborted effort to smuggle\n\na large load of marijuana in June 1996.          Genao was one of the\n\ncaptains of the boats and was supposed to be paid between fifty\n\nthousand and sixty thousand dollars, but they were never able to\n\nconnect with their supplier.\n\n           On the basis of this evidence, we readily conclude that\n\nthe district court's erroneous admission of Llaurador's statements\n\nwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in securing convictions on\n\ncount one of the second superseding indictment.

The three defendants in this drug\n\nconspiracy case played key roles in a smuggling ring that imported\n\nlarge amounts of cocaine and marijuana into Puerto Rico between\n\n1992 and 1996.    After a trial that spanned nearly four weeks and\n\ninvolved more than forty witnesses for the government, a jury found\n\neach defendant guilty of a series of crimes, including the drug\n\nconspiracy and aiding and abetting murder.                The district court\n\nsentenced each defendant to multiple life sentences.\n\n           The defendants raise a number of challenges to their\n\nconvictions.

We   will   provide\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fadditional facts where they are pertinent to the legal analysis of\n\nspecific issues.\n\nA.   The Conspiracy\n\n            As   noted,   the    defendants    were   members   of   a   drug\n\nconspiracy that smuggled large amounts of cocaine and marijuana\n\nfrom South America into southwestern Puerto Rico for itself and\n\nother organizations.      The drugs were dropped from airplanes at sea\n\nand retrieved by the defendants or transferred directly by boat\n\nfrom the defendants' foreign suppliers.            The conspirators used a\n\nbroad array of radios, global positioning system (GPS) receivers,\n\nnight vision glasses, police scanners, modified cellphones and\n\npowerful    speedboats    to    protect    their   shipments.    They    also\n\nstationed lookouts at various points on the water and near an\n\nairport used by the United States Customs Service to protect the\n\nloads from raids by law enforcement and rival drug gangs.\n\n            After the defendants brought the drugs on shore, the\n\ndrugs were shipped by truck either to a secure storage location\n\n(frequently one of the conspirators' farms) or directly to the\n\nindividual or organization who had hired the defendants.                  The\n\nindividual conspirators received cash or a portion of the drug\n\nshipment as payment for their participation, and they distributed\n\nthe drugs they received to local dealers at drug points throughout\n\nthe area.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fB.   The Co-Conspirators\n\n                  Raul Santodomingo-Romero (\"Santodomingo\") led the drug\n\norganization until he was arrested on money laundering charges in\n\n1994;       his    second-in-command,     Victor       M.   Valle-Lassalle,     a/k/a\n\n\"Manolo\" (\"Valle-Lassalle\"), then took over.1                  Defendant-appellant\n\nLuis Roldan-Cortes, a/k/a \"Wisi\" (\"Roldan\"), was Valle-Lassalle's\n\nright hand man and the godfather to his daughter.                     The two owned a\n\ndrug       distribution    point,     giving    them    the    exclusive     right   to\n\ndistribute         drugs   in   the   Ducos    housing      project    in   Aguadilla.\n\nAlthough Valle-Lassalle eventually ended this partnership because\n\nhe thought that Roldan was unfairly excluding him from some of the\n\nside deals that Roldan was arranging, they continued to cooperate\n\ntogether in their smuggling venture.               Roldan negotiated at least\n\none drug shipment in the Dominican Republic and participated in the\n\nexecution of a number of others.                His specific responsibilities\n\nincluded loading and unloading and captaining the drug boats,\n\ncoordinating \"security\" for the shipments, and inventorying and\n\nselling drugs to small distributors. He also helped to arrange the\n\nmurder of a government informant, James Martin-Rodriguez, a/k/a\n\n\"Kiri\" (\"Martin\"), who was a member of the conspiracy until he\n\nbegan cooperating with federal investigators.\n\n\n\n       1\n      We have included a roster of individuals important for an\nunderstanding of this case in the Appendix to this opinion. We\nrefer to the individuals in this case according to the naming\nscheme that was adopted by the government in its brief.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f              Defendant-appellant     Omar   Genao-Sanchez,     a/k/a   \"Omi\"\n\n(\"Genao\"), was a drug courier for one of the conspirators, David\n\nRafael Ramos-Rivera, a/k/a \"Pecas\" (\"Ramos\"), when he (Genao) was\n\nsixteen years old.        He later became a member of the conspiracy\n\nhimself after meeting the other members at Santodomingo's farm.\n\nGenao attended meetings at which Valle-Lassalle negotiated drug\n\nshipments, helped to bring loads to shore, and, according to the\n\ngovernment, participated in the murder of Carlos Roberto Rodriguez\n\nTorres, a/k/a \"Robert Caballo\" (\"Caballo\").            Although Caballo was\n\nan   active    member   of    the   conspiracy,    having    participated   in\n\nsmuggling operations, Valle-Lassalle decided to kill him when\n\nCaballo threatened to tell members of a Colombian drug cartel that\n\nValle-Lassalle had stolen cocaine from them.\n\n              José Rodriguez-Marrero, a/k/a \"Zurdo\" (\"Rodriguez\"), the\n\nlast of the three appellants, joined the conspiracy when Valle-\n\nLassalle offered to let him participate in some drug shipments if\n\nhe helped to murder Edward Llaurador Rodriguez (\"Llaurador\"),\n\nanother co-conspirator turned government informant.             Although the\n\ngovernment did not introduce evidence that Rodriguez participated\n\nin any shipments, its witnesses testified that Rodriguez was\n\npresent when Valle-Lassalle negotiated shipments and that he would\n\nhave   participated      in   two   shipments     if   the   police   had   not\n\nforestalled them.       The first of these shipments was supposed to be\n\na two thousand pound load of cocaine that Valle-Lassalle negotiated\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fin May 1997 with another smuggler, Angela Ayala. This shipment was\n\ncanceled when Ayala was arrested.         The second involved six hundred\n\nkilograms of cocaine that were supposed to have been smuggled on\n\nbehalf of another smuggler, Henry Pamias, a/k/a \"Macho from Cataño\"\n\n(\"Pamias\").   That shipment was canceled because Valle-Lassalle was\n\narrested on weapons charges.\n\n            Javier E. Soto-Alarcon, a/k/a \"Chester\" (\"Soto\"), was a\n\nmid-level leader in the conspiracy who joined the drug gang after\n\nhe started dating Valle-Lassalle's sister.         Soto participated in a\n\nnumber of drug loads and in Llaurador's murder.         After Soto's wife\n\n(he had since ended his relationship with Valle-Lassalle's sister)\n\nwas shot in a drug-related attack, Soto decided to turn himself in\n\nto the authorities.     He agreed to cooperate with the government,\n\nallowing it to record his conversations, helping government agents\n\nto infiltrate the organization, and testifying against the others\n\nat trial.\n\n            Ramos was a member of the conspiracy before he was\n\narrested and decided to become a government informant.           He helped\n\nto smuggle a number of large loads of marijuana and cocaine and\n\nsold some of the cocaine at a drug point in the Montana housing\n\nproject in Aguadilla.     He also participated in Martin's murder.\n\n            Other   members   of   the   drug   conspiracy   included   José\n\nHernandez-Jimenez, a/k/a \"Chelo\" (\"Hernandez\"), who was murdered by\n\na rival drug gang, and Nicholas Peña Gonzalez (\"Peña\") and Anibal\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fPagan-Cerezo, a/k/a \"El Cojo\" (\"Pagan\"), who were indicted along\n\nwith the defendants here and pled guilty.\n\nC.   Murders Undertaken in Furtherance of the Conspiracy\n\n           The drug gang protected its distribution empire with\n\nforce, killing or seriously wounding suspected informants and rival\n\ngang members. Three of those murders played important roles in the\n\nconspiracy trial because they were charged as substantive crimes\n\nand as overt acts in furtherance of the drug conspiracy.\n\n1.   Martin's Murder\n\n           On November 16, 1992, Martin was arrested with fifteen\n\nbales of cocaine belonging to the drug ring.   This was the second\n\ntime that he was arrested for a drug crime, and he agreed to\n\ncooperate with the United States Customs Service.    Suspecting that\n\nMartin had become an informant, Santodomingo and Valle-Lassalle\n\ndecided to have him murdered in a parking lot at the Ducos housing\n\nproject. On May 20, 1993, after receiving a phone call from Roldan\n\nalerting him to Martin's arrival at the scene, Santodomingo dropped\n\nRamos off at the housing project, where Ramos joined Roldan and\n\nPagan. Roldan identified Martin as the intended murder victim, and\n\ntold Ramos and Pagan that Martin was at the housing project that\n\nday because he was expecting to pick up some money owed to him for\n\ndrugs. Martin approached the group, and Ramos and Pagan walked off\n\nto a corner of the parking lot.   After speaking with Roldan for a\n\nshort while, Martin walked back to his automobile.   As he was about\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fto put the keys in the door, Pagan walked up and shot him three\n\ntimes. Ramos then joined the attack, and the two shot Martin until\n\nPagan ran out of bullets.       The coroner's report stated that Martin\n\nhad seventeen bullet wounds in his body.\n\n2.   Caballo's Murder\n\n           In February, 1996, five members of the drug organization\n\nstole approximately thirty kilograms of cocaine that they were\n\nsmuggling into Puerto Rico on behalf of a Colombian drug operation.\n\nBelieving that Caballo had threatened to inform the Colombians\n\nabout the theft, Valle-Lassalle arranged to have him killed.\n\nAccording to the government, Genao and another member of the drug\n\nring, Nicholas Peña Gonzalez, picked Caballo up at his house on\n\nJuly 15, 1996, with help from Llaurador.            Peña shot Caballo in a\n\nremote   area   near   Yauco,   Puerto    Rico.     The   group   then   threw\n\nCaballo's body in the back of his truck.          They planned to drive the\n\ntruck to Valle-Lassalle's farm to dismember and dispose of the body\n\n(and to disassemble the truck) when the truck became stuck in a\n\nmuddy ditch and they were forced to abandon it on the side of the\n\nroad.    As they were abandoning the truck, Caballo tried to get up\n\nand asked Peña why he shot him.          Peña answered, \"Because you're a\n\nmother fucker,\" and shot him two more times.          The police found the\n\ntruck and Caballo's body the next morning.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f3.   Llaurador's Murder\n\n            Later that month, Llaurador told local authorities in\n\nPonce about Caballo's murder, and provided sworn statements to the\n\nprosecutor regarding the murder on July 31 and September 13 of that\n\nyear (1996).     He also became a confidential informant for the\n\nfederal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") on September 3,\n\n1996.     The local police arrested Genao and Valle-Lassalle for\n\nCaballo's murder based on Llaurador's statements.     They issued a\n\nwarrant for Peña's arrest, but he fled before they could apprehend\n\nhim.    The criminal complaint, which was given to both Genao and\n\nValle-Lassalle when they were arrested, identified Llaurador as an\n\ninformant.\n\n            Valle-Lassalle was released on bail subsequent to his\n\narrest.    Having seen Llaurador's name on the criminal complaint,\n\nValle-Lassalle knew that Llaurador had “snitched\" to the police\n\nabout Caballo's murder.     Telling Soto that Llaurador would likely\n\n\"snitch\" on all of them, he recruited Soto, Rodriguez, and two\n\nother members of the conspiracy to find Llaurador and murder him.\n\nThe men found him on October 13, 1996 and bound him with wire.\n\nRodriguez proceeded to behead Llaurador with a machete while he was\n\nstill alive.   They dismembered his body, placed the various parts\n\nin plastic garbage bags, and threw the bags over a cliff at an\n\nabandoned dump site.      Valle-Lassalle watched the murder and told\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fhis co-conspirators that if they told anyone about it, they would\n\nmeet the same fate.           He promised to repay Rodriguez for murdering\n\nLlaurador by allowing him to participate in one of the upcoming\n\nsmuggling operations.\n\nD.   Arrests and District Court Proceedings\n\n                On December 17, 1997, the government unsealed a two count\n\nindictment against Genao, Rodriguez, Valle-Lassalle, Peña, and four\n\nothers.         Roldan was not charged in that initial indictment.              The\n\ngovernment obtained a twelve count second superseding indictment on\n\nJuly       6,   2000   against   Genao,    Rodriguez,        Valle-Lassalle,   Peña,\n\nRoldan, Pagan, and six others.2            The twelve defendants were charged\n\nwith: (1) conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine and multi-hundred pound quantities\n\nof marijuana; (2) conspiracy to commit firearms murder in relation\n\nto a drug trafficking offense (Caballo); (3) aiding and abetting\n\nfirearms        murder   in    relation    to    a    drug    trafficking   offense\n\n(Caballo); (4) aiding and abetting the murder of a witness or\n\ninformant        (Llaurador);    (5)   aiding        and   abetting   murder   while\n\n\n\n       2\n      The government had previously obtained a six count first\nsuperseding indictment on July 15, 1998, charging Valle-Lassalle,\nRodriguez, Peña, Genao, Pamias, Santodomingo, and four others with\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five\nkilograms of cocaine and multi-hundred pound quantities of\nmarijuana; conspiracy to commit firearms murder in relation to a\ndrug trafficking offense (Caballo); firearms murder in relation to\na drug trafficking offense (Caballo); murder of a witness or\ninformant (Llaurador); murder while engaging in a drug trafficking\noffense (Llaurador); and witness tampering.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fengaging in a drug trafficking offense (Llaurador); (6) witness\n\ntampering (Soto); (7) aiding and abetting firearms murder in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking offense (Martin); (8) aiding and\n\nabetting the murder of a witness or informant (Martin); (9) aiding\n\nand abetting murder while engaging in a drug trafficking offense\n\n(Martin); (10) aiding and abetting solicitation of a crime of\n\nviolence; (11) misprision of felony; and (12) possession with\n\nintent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine.

Similarly, Genao was\n\narraigned on the first superseding indictment on December 27, 1999\n\nand the second on July 20, 2000.               Roldan was only indicted once, on\n\nJuly 18, 2000.        The government certified the defendants as being\n\neligible for the death penalty shortly after their arraignment and\n\nmaintained     that       position     until    the    day   before    the    trial    was\n\nscheduled to begin.\n\nE.    The Trial\n\n              Of    the    twelve      indicted       defendants,     only    the    three\n\nappellants here pled not guilty and proceeded to trial.                        The trial\n\nbegan on      September      7,    2000.        Roldan's     and   Genao's     attorneys\n\nrepeatedly informed the court on the first day of trial that they\n\nwere unprepared to try the case, and both requested continuances.\n\nThe court denied their motions.\n\n              The government presented testimony from more than forty\n\nwitnesses, including Commonwealth investigators, police officers,\n\nfederal agents, eyewitnesses, and technical experts.                         The core of\n\nits    case    was    built       by   two     co-conspirators        and    cooperating\n\nwitnesses, Soto and Ramos, each of whom testified for the greater\n\npart of a week.           Soto began his testimony with a detailed first-\n\nhand   account       of    Llaurador's       murder,     highlighting        Rodriguez's\n\nparticipation in the killing and Valle-Lassalle's promise to reward\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fRodriguez for his participation. Soto then recounted how he joined\n\nthe conspiracy and the manner in which he met each of the co-\n\nconspirators.    The first time that he visited a farm owned by\n\nValle-Lassalle, he helped to inventory six to seven thousand pounds\n\nof marijuana.   He also described the planning and execution of the\n\norganization's narcotics shipments and the roles played by Genao,\n\nRodriguez, and Roldan.    He provided the details regarding a seven\n\nhundred kilogram load of cocaine that the group smuggled in May or\n\nJune 1994, and discussed a trip that he took to Ayala's house in\n\nthe summer of 1997 with Valle-Lassalle, Rodriguez, and Hernandez to\n\nnegotiate a shipment of two thousand kilograms of cocaine.         Valle-\n\nLassalle   negotiated   with   Ayala   while   Rodriguez   and   Hernandez\n\nlistened to music and played pool.       Ayala was arrested before that\n\nshipment could take place, but Valle-Lassalle negotiated another\n\nshipment later that summer.      The second shipment was interrupted\n\nwhen Valle-Lassalle was arrested on Commonwealth weapons charges\n\nstemming from a shootout that he had with members of a rival drug\n\ngang.   Soto also briefly recounted Valle-Lassalle's explanation of\n\nCaballo's murder. Finally, he described how he became a government\n\ninformant and the terms of his plea agreement.\n\n           Ramos began his testimony by providing a first-person\n\naccount of Martin's murder.     He then named some of the key members\n\nof the conspiracy, explained how he knew them, and described their\n\nroles in the organization.     He provided details on a number of the\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcocaine and marijuana shipments that he helped to smuggle.               These\n\nincluded a six to seven thousand pound shipment of marijuana in the\n\nsummer of 1993, which Roldan helped to inventory; six hundred\n\nkilogram shipments in late December 1993 and late December 1994,\n\nwhich Roldan helped to transport; a nine hundred to one thousand\n\nkilogram shipment in the fall of 1995 on behalf of Ayala, which\n\nGenao helped to transport; and a shipment of cocaine in February\n\n1996, which Genao also helped to transport.        Caballo later learned\n\nthat Valle-Lassalle had stolen thirty kilograms of cocaine from\n\nthis shipment. Ramos described his unsuccessful efforts to prevent\n\nValle-Lassalle from killing Caballo to cover up that theft and\n\nessentially repeated Genao's description of Caballo's murder.               He\n\nnoted that after Genao was arrested for Caballo's murder, Genao\n\nwrote to him requesting a loan for bail money.              Ramos forwarded\n\nthat request to Valle-Lassalle who instructed Ramos to tell Genao\n\nnot to worry because he would be out soon.             Nine days later,\n\nLlaurador -- the chief witness against Genao in the murder case --\n\nwas killed, and Genao was released for lack of evidence.                 Valle-\n\nLassalle told Ramos that \"he had taken care of the problem because\n\nthe guy who was snitching had been killed.\"\n\n           Ramos   also   testified      about   the   methods      of     drug\n\ndistribution that he employed.      He managed the drug point in the\n\nMontana housing project and sold the drugs that he bought or\n\nreceived   as   payment   from   Valle-Lassalle.       He    said   that     he\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\ffrequently used Genao as a courier to pick up drugs for Ramos to\n\nsell. Finally, Ramos testified that he was arrested for attempting\n\nto introduce drugs into the country on August 24, 1998.                       He pled\n\nguilty and began cooperating in approximately April 1999.\n\n            On   October       10,    2000,    the     jury   convicted     the   three\n\ndefendants on all counts.             On March 28, 2001, the district court\n\nsentenced Rodriguez to two life sentences for his two murder\n\nconvictions, aiding and abetting murder of a witness (Llaurador)\n\nand aiding and abetting murder in furtherance of a drug crime\n\n(Llaurador).      See U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, cmt. 1 (\"The Commission has\n\nconcluded    that     in   the       absence      of   capital    punishment,       life\n\nimprisonment     is      the   appropriate         punishment     for     premeditated\n\nkilling.\").      The court applied the murder cross reference to his\n\ndrug conspiracy conviction to sentence him to life in prison on\n\nthat conviction as well.             See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d)(1) (instructing\n\ncourts to apply the first degree murder sentencing guideline when\n\nconsidering the appropriate sentencing range for a drug conviction\n\nif a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute\n\nmurder   under      18     U.S.C.      §    1111);      see      United    States    v.\n\nReyes-Echevarria, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200656\"><a href=\"/opinion/200656/united-states-v-reyes-echevarria/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding the\n\nsentencing court's application of the murder cross reference to the\n\ndefendant's drug conspiracy conviction after the sentencing judge\n\nconcluded by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had\n\nmurdered a rival drug dealer).\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f            On March 18, 2002, the court sentenced Genao to two life\n\nsentences for his two murder convictions, conspiracy to commit\n\nfirearms murder in furtherance of a drug crime (Caballo) and aiding\n\nand abetting     firearms     murder     in    furtherance   of   a   drug   crime\n\n(Caballo), and applied the murder cross reference to his drug\n\nconspiracy conviction, sentencing him to a total of three life\n\nsentences.     On the same day, the court sentenced Roldan to three\n\nlife    sentences   for   his    three    murder      convictions,    aiding   and\n\nabetting firearms murder in furtherance of a drug crime (Martin),\n\naiding and abetting murder of a witness (Martin), and aiding and\n\nabetting murder while engaging in a drug crime (Martin).                 It also\n\napplied the murder cross reference to Roldan's drug conspiracy\n\nconviction, resulting in a total of four life sentences. Genao and\n\nRoldan filed multiple motions for new trials based on newly-\n\ndiscovered evidence, which the district court denied.\n\n                                         II.\n\nA.     Rodriguez's Claims\n\n1.     Specificity of the Indictment\n\n             Arguing   that     count    four    of   the   second    superseding\n\nindictment (murder of a witness) did not provide sufficient details\n\nregarding the federal nexus of Llaurador's murder, Rodriguez argues\n\nthat his conviction should be vacated.                   The Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure generally require defendants to raise objections\n\nto indictments prior to trial.            See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B)\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f(stating that \"a motion alleging a defect in the indictment or\n\ninformation\" \"must be raised before trial\").               Failure to do so\n\nconstitutes waiver.      See    Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e) (\"A party waives\n\nany Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request not raised by the\n\ndeadline the court sets under Rule 12(c) or by any extension the\n\ncourt    provides.\").     Although      Rule   12   creates    exceptions     for\n\nobjections challenging a court's jurisdiction and those claiming\n\nthat the indictment did not actually charge the crime for which the\n\ndefendant was tried, Rodriguez's objection to the specificity of\n\ncount four does not fall under these exceptions. See United States\n\nv. Crowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780714\"><a href=\"/opinion/780714/united-states-v-francis-crowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (2d Cir. 2003).              In the absence of\n\nany indication    in    the    record   that   Rodriguez      objected   to   the\n\nspecificity of the indictment before trial, we conclude that he\n\nwaived this argument.3\n\n2.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Rodriguez argues that the government failed to introduce\n\nsufficient evidence to support two counts of his conviction, the\n\ndrug conspiracy charge (count one) and the aiding and abetting\n\nmurder of a witness charge (count four).4           We review a sufficiency\n\nof the evidence claim de novo, \"eschewing credibility judgments and\n\n\n\n     3\n      While Rule 12(e) allows a reviewing court to grant relief\nfrom this waiver for good cause, we see no basis for doing so here.\n     4\n      Rodriguez did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\nregarding his conviction on count five, aiding and abetting the\nmurder (of Llaurador) in furtherance of a drug crime.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to\n\nascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government\n\nproved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nUnited States v.

Conspiracy\n\n            \"To prove the elements of the crime of conspiracy, the\n\nGovernment must show the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's\n\nknowledge    of   the    conspiracy,    and    the    defendant's    voluntary\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy.\"             United States v.

Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1173.         \"Such proof may consist of\n\ncircumstantial evidence, including inferences from surrounding\n\ncircumstances,    such    as   acts   committed      by   the   defendant   that\n\nfurthered the conspiracy's purposes. The government need not prove\n\nthat a co-conspirator knew all of the details or participated in\n\nall of the objectives of the plan.\"               Llinas, 373 F.3d at 30\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              Since Rodriguez does not\n\ncontest the existence of a drug conspiracy, we need only consider\n\nwhether the government proved his participation in the conspiracy.\n\n            Rodriguez claims that the only evidence linking him to\n\nthe drug conspiracy was Soto's testimony that Rodriguez was present\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fat the May 1997 meeting with Angela Ayala, when she and Valle-\n\nLassalle negotiated the details of a two thousand kilogram cocaine\n\nshipment.      He argues that while he was at her house during the\n\nmeeting, he played pool, listened to music, and did not participate\n\nin that meeting.\n\n             This argument reflects a highly misleading view of the\n\nevidence adduced at trial.                 In fact, Soto testified that Valle-\n\nLassalle     offered     to    allow       Rodriguez      to    participate    in    this\n\nparticular drug smuggling operation if he murdered Llaurador.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Soto told Rodriguez that Rodriguez's share of\n\nthat drug shipment could be twenty to thirty thousand dollars, and\n\nRodriguez remarked that he expected to receive \"a good position\" in\n\nthe drug organization for committing the murder. His claim that he\n\nwas innocently playing pool at Ayala's house without knowledge that\n\na    major   narcotics    deal       was    being   negotiated      simply    does    not\n\nwithstand scrutiny.           Given this testimony, we have no difficulty\n\nconcluding that a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Rodriguez was part of the drug conspiracy.\n\nb.    Aiding and Abetting Murder of a Witness\n\n             Rodriguez        also    claims       that   the    evidence     that    the\n\ngovernment introduced to prove that he murdered Llaurador was\n\ninsufficient to establish a violation of the Witness Protection\n\nAct, which states:\n\n             [W]hoever kills . . . another person, with\n             intent to (A) prevent the attendance or\n\n                                            -20-\n\f          testimony of any person in an official\n          proceeding [or] . . .

The government argues that Rodriguez\n\nkilled Llaurador to prevent him from communicating with authorities\n\nregarding federal offenses.\n\n          To establish a crime under the \"law enforcement officer\"\n\nsection of the Act, the government must prove that:\n\n          (1) the defendant killed or attempted to kill\n          a person; (2) the defendant was motivated by a\n          desire to prevent the communication between\n          any person and law enforcement authorities\n          concerning   the    commission   or   possible\n          commission of an offense; (3) that offense was\n          actually a federal offense; and (4) the\n          defendant believed that the person in (2)\n          above might communicate with the federal\n          authorities.\n\nUnited States v.

The\n\nAct explicitly relieves the government from having to prove that\n\nthe defendant suspected that the witness would communicate to\n\nfederal, as opposed to state, officials regarding the crime, see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1512(g) (stating that \"[i]n a prosecution for an offense\n\nunder this section, no state of mind need be proved with respect to\n\nthe circumstance . . . that the law enforcement officer is an\n\nofficer or employee of the Federal Government\"); therefore, the\n\nfourth prong may be proven, among other ways, by demonstrating that\n\nthe underlying offense was a federal offense and that the federal\n\n                                 -21-\n\fauthorities had begun an investigation prior to the informant's\n\nmurder or attempted murder.

Although\n\nRodriguez repeatedly refers to Caballo's murder as a Commonwealth\n\noffense, the second superseding indictment lists the murder as a\n\ncharged offense and identifies it as an overt act in furtherance of\n\nthe federal drug conspiracy.           The federal government, through the\n\nDEA, had opened an investigation into this conspiracy and had\n\ninterviewed Llaurador prior to his murder.            Rodriguez's claim that\n\nhe did not realize that he was helping to conceal a federal crime\n\nby   murdering   Llaurador     is   irrelevant.

In\n\nfact, he testified that he did not meet Genao until the two were\n\nimprisoned together prior to their federal trial.      When Genao's\n\nlawyer asked him why he had failed to present this testimony\n\nearlier, he answered:\n\n            Well,   I  was   in  negotiation   [with   the\n            government]. I mean, at one point in time, I\n            was thinking of fighting my case, you know, of\n            going to trial in my case, but then I started\n            to think a lot about Genao and the fact that\n            he had nothing to do with [Caballo]'s death.\n            Because I really had never met Genao out in\n            the street at all.

However, he\n\nclaimed that he thought that this affirmation meant that he was\n\nadmitting to the accusations in the indictment relating to his own\n\nactions   and    culpability,    not   necessarily      to   the    facts   and\n\naccusations relating to his co-conspirators.\n\n           Valle-Lassalle said that Genao never assisted with any of\n\nthe drug loads and that Genao had nothing to do with Caballo's\n\nmurder.   Even though Genao asked him in jail to say that he was not\n\nguilty, Valle-Lassalle said that he did not come forward with this\n\nevidence earlier because he was awaiting trial.               Valle-Lassalle\n\nrepeatedly refused to implicate some of his co-conspirators in the\n\nmurders and drug smuggling operations, prompting the government to\n\nask: \"It goes against every grain of your being to testify and\n\nimplicate anyone that's not a cooperator or a dead person in\n\ncriminal conduct; isn't that correct?\"         Valle-Lassalle answered\n\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n\n           Santodomingo's testimony was less detailed.

Confrontation Clause\n\n            At trial, the government called Edgar Delgado García, a\n\nPuerto Rico Commonwealth judge who was the local prosecutor when\n\nLlaurador started cooperating with authorities prior to his murder.\n\nJudge Delgado read two sworn statements that Llaurador had given to\n\nthe police in the summer of 1996 regarding Caballo's murder.            In\n\nthe first statement, Llaurador provided a detailed account of the\n\nnight of the murder, including the plan that Genao and Peña\n\ndeveloped to trap Caballo; the manner in which they killed him; and\n\nthe way in which Caballo's truck got stuck on the side of the road\n\nafter the murder.      In the second statement, Llaurador explained\n\nthat Valle-Lassalle told him that he had given the order for\n\nCaballo's death because Caballo was going to tell the Colombians\n\nabout the cocaine theft.      Genao objected to the admission of this\n\nhearsay testimony against him immediately before Judge Delgado\n\ntestified.\n\n            The   argument   over   the    admissibility   of   Llaurador's\n\nstatements principally involved the application of the forfeiture\n\nby wrongdoing doctrine,6 which, as embodied in Rule 804(b)(6) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence, creates an exception to the general\n\n\n\n     6\n      The government also argued that Llaurador's statements\ncontained sufficient indicia of reliability to be admissible under\nthe catch-all provision in the hearsay rules.

According          to   the\n\ngovernment, a portion of Ramos's testimony demonstrated that Genao\n\nknew that Llaurador was going to be murdered and that Genao\n\nacquiesced in the murder.             Specifically, Ramos had testified that\n\nGenao asked him for bail money when the two were imprisoned; when\n\nRamos called Valle-Lassalle to tell him about this request, Valle-\n\nLassalle told him to tell Genao that he should not be worried\n\nbecause he would be out soon.              Nine days later, according to the\n\ngovernment,   Llaurador         was    murdered        and   Genao      was    set    free.\n\nTherefore,    according        to   the   government,          Genao    acquiesced        in\n\nLlaurador's murder.            Apparently agreeing with the government's\n\ntheory of acquiescence (the court did not elaborate on its ruling),\n\nthe   court    admitted        Llaurador's         statements        to       the    former\n\nCommonwealth prosecutor as evidence against Genao.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fa.

We heard oral argument in this case on\nMarch 2, 2004, and Crawford was published on March 8, 2004.\nAlthough Crawford was decided after Genao was convicted, we must\napply this new precedent in his appeal.

See, e.g., United\n\nStates v.

Since\n\nGenao did not have the prior opportunity to confront Llaurador\n\nregarding his statements, we conclude that, absent some independent\n\nground for admissibility, it was a constitutional error for the\n\ncourt to admit Llaurador's statements against Genao.\n\nb.   Forfeiture by Wrongdoing\n\n             As noted, the government drew upon the forfeiture by\n\nwrongdoing     doctrine   in    arguing         to   the    district       court    that\n\nLlaurador's    hearsay    statements          were   admissible      against       Genao\n\nbecause he had acquiesced in Llaurador's murder.                         Forfeiture by\n\nwrongdoing is an independent ground for the admissibility of\n\nhearsay testimony that survives Crawford. See Crawford, 124 S. Ct.\n\nat 1370.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\f             Curiously, on appeal, the government essentially abandons\n\nthe forfeiture by wrongdoing argument, limiting itself to this one\n\nstatement in its brief: \"Genao was aware of the order to kill\n\nLlaurador because he had been informed by Victor Manuel Valle\n\nLassalle, a/k/a 'Manolo,' through David Ramos-Rivera, a/k/a 'Pecas'\n\nnot to worry.\"       Instead, it simply argues that both of Llaurador's\n\nstatements were admissible because they were declarations against\n\npenal interest and were otherwise reliable.           See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n804(b)(3).     Crawford makes these traditional hearsay arguments\n\nirrelevant.     According to Crawford, Genao had a constitutional\n\nright to confront Llaurador that, as to testimonial hearsay, could\n\nnot be overridden merely by showing indicia of reliability.\n\n             Under    appropriate   circumstances,   the   forfeiture   by\n\nwrongdoing doctrine can provide an exception to the Confrontation\n\nClause.   See Crawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1370.            But the glancing\n\nreference to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing in the\n\ngovernment's brief does not give us any assistance in addressing\n\nthis difficult waiver issue.8        \"We believe it is apodictic that\n\n\n     8\n      Without purporting to resolve anything, we suggest some of\nthe difficulties involved in determining whether a defendant has\n\"acquiesced\" in wrongdoing that would forfeit his confrontation\nrights.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).               The analysis is case-\n\nspecific, considering, \"among other things, the centrality of the\n\ntainted material, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the uses\n\nto which it was put during the trial, the relative strengths of the\n\nparties' cases,     and   any   telltales     that   furnish     clues    to   the\n\nlikelihood that the error affected the factfinder's resolution of\n\na material issue.\"    Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1182.\n\n            We begin our harmless error analysis by describing the\n\nevidence implicating Genao in the murder of Caballo apart from\n\nLlaurador's hearsay statements.         Ramos, the co-conspirator turned\n\ninformant, described a conversation that he had with Genao in which\n\nGenao explained the course of events on the night of Caballo's\n\nmurder.   Genao explained to Ramos that Caballo wanted Peña to kill\n\nLlaurador because Caballo suspected Llaurador of stealing his all\n\nterrain   vehicle   (\"ATV\").      Genao     joined    Peña   and   Caballo      in\n\nCaballo's white pickup truck to hunt for Llaurador.                     When they\n\nfinally   found   Llaurador,    Genao   got    in    the   car   with    him   and\n\nexplained that Caballo wanted to kill him but that he should not\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fworry because Genao and Peña were planning on killing Caballo\n\ninstead.     They drove to a remote location with Caballo's white\n\npickup following behind and then disembarked.             When Caballo told\n\nPeña to kill Llaurador, Peña shot Caballo instead.            The three then\n\nloaded Caballo's body into the back of the pickup truck and were\n\nplanning to dismember the body at Valle-Lassalle's when the truck\n\nbecame stuck.    They were forced to abandon the truck and the body\n\non the side of the road.\n\n            The government offered some corroboration of Ramos's\n\ntestimony    implicating   Genao   in   the   murder    of   Caballo.    Soto\n\ntestified that Valle-Lassalle \"told [him] what had happened with\n\n[Caballo], that it had been [Genao] and [Peña], and that he had to\n\ndo it because of the Colombian thing.\"                 Caballo's girlfriend\n\ntestified that the last time that she saw Caballo was when he left\n\nher house with Peña and Genao on the night of his murder.                 She\n\nconfirmed that Caballo's ATV had vanished and that the men brought\n\nweapons with them in Caballo's white pickup truck to search for\n\nLlaurador.    Finally, Puerto Rico Police Agent Jorge Nazario Torres\n\ntestified that he found Caballo's body in his pickup truck, which\n\nwas stuck on the side of the road.\n\n            There is certainly some force to this evidence.             If the\n\nissue before us was the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury's finding that Genao engaged in a conspiracy to murder Caballo\n\nor that he aided and abetted the murder of Caballo, we would\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fconclude    that     the   evidence   was    sufficient    to   support    those\n\nconvictions.        However, the issue before us is not the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence.           Instead, we must decide whether there is a\n\nreasonable possibility that the error at issue (the admission of\n\nLlaurador's statements) influenced the jury in finding Genao guilty\n\nof these murder-related charges.        Before stating our conclusion on\n\nthat issue, we summarize the statements of Llaurador that were\n\npresented to the jury by Judge (and former prosecutor) Delgado.\n\n              Delgado testified that he put Llaurador under oath and\n\nasked him to tell him everything that he knew about Caballo's\n\nmurder.       Llaurador responded in detail.          He said that he saw\n\nCaballo's truck stopped near his home at 2:00 AM on July 15, 2000.\n\nKnowing that Caballo was mad at him for stealing the ATV, Llaurador\n\nthought that Caballo was either looking for the ATV or was on his\n\nway   to   visit     Llaurador's   girlfriend.        So   he   drove     to   his\n\ngirlfriend's house to see if Caballo was there.                   He was not;\n\nhowever, Caballo eventually drove near the house, and Genao got out\n\nof Caballo's truck and asked Llaurador to take him to buy gasoline.\n\nWhile they were driving in Llaurador's truck, Genao explained that\n\nCaballo wanted Genao and Peña to kill him for stealing the ATV but\n\nthat they were planning on killing Caballo instead because Caballo\n\nwas   going    to    \"snitch\"   regarding     the   cocaine     theft.     Genao\n\nrepeatedly reassured Llaurador that nothing was going to happen to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fhim, and he told him to drive toward the cockfighting arena to meet\n\nCaballo and Peña.\n\n            After meeting the other two at the arena, Genao and\n\nLlaurador drove to a lake with Peña and Caballo following behind in\n\nCaballo's truck.    Genao continued to reassure Llaurador that they\n\nwere not planning to kill him.   Peña and Genao switched trucks when\n\nthey arrived at the lake.      Llaurador then implored, \"if you're\n\ngoing to kill me, kill me here and just leave me here.\"         Peña\n\nresponded: \"Are you going to keep up with this?    Just take it easy,\n\nwe're not going to do anything to you.\"           Llaurador followed\n\nCaballo's truck a little further up a path, and then all four men\n\ngot out of their vehicles.       Caballo grabbed Llaurador's shirt,\n\npushed him up against one of the trucks, and told Peña to \"[p]ump\n\nfour shots into [his] face.\"     Raising his arm, Peña said that he\n\nwas going to pump four shots into Caballo's face and shot him in\n\nthe face.    Genao and Peña then began to argue about whether they\n\nshould leave Caballo's body there or take it with them.         They\n\ndecided to put the body in the back of Caballo's truck, and\n\nLlaurador, driving alone in his truck, led the group away from the\n\nlake, with Peña and Genao quickly following in Caballo's truck. At\n\nsome point, Llaurador noticed that the truck was not behind him\n\nanymore, and he turned back and found it stuck in a ditch on the\n\nside of the road.    He heard two shots as he was backing up and,\n\nupon reaching the truck, was told that Peña shot Caballo two more\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\ftimes because he got up and asked why Peña had shot him.              Peña\n\nanswered, \"[b]ecause you're a mother fucker.\" Llaurador then drove\n\nGenao to his car and drove Peña to a public housing complex in\n\nAguadilla.     As they were driving, Genao told Llaurador that the\n\noriginal plan was to make Caballo \"disappear\" so that Genao could\n\nkeep the truck.\n\n             Delgado   testified    that    Llaurador   provided   another\n\nstatement on September 13, in which he discussed Valle-Lassalle's\n\nrelationship to the murder.        Llaurador said that Genao told him on\n\nthe way to the cockfighting arena that Valle-Lassalle told them to\n\nkill Caballo because he was going to \"snitch\" about the cocaine and\n\nthat they were planning on taking the body back to Valle-Lassalle's\n\nafterward to \"chop him up and make him disappear.\"           That is why\n\nthey took the body with them after the murder.           Genao also told\n\nLlaurador that he was planning to dismantle the truck.\n\n             Llaurador added that he saw Valle-Lassalle a week after\n\nthe murder, and the gangleader explained his rationale for killing\n\nCaballo and said that Peña had left the country.           Valle-Lassalle\n\nalso mentioned another death9 at a parking lot of the Ducos housing\n\nproject.     Llaurador presciently noted to prosecutor Delgado that\n\nValle-Lassalle would kill him if he found out about the statements\n\nhe was then making and that he omitted the leader's involvement in\n\nhis earlier statement \"because Manolo is the one who orders the\n\n\n     9\n         We take this to be a reference to Martin's murder.\n\n                                     -38-\n\fkillings.\"       Finally, he said that he had not seen Peña since the\n\nmurder and that he had not seen Genao since the two attended\n\nCaballo's wake.\n\n             These detailed statements of Llaurador, so similar in\n\nsome of their details to the testimony of Ramos, are powerfully\n\ncorroborative      of   the     testimony       offered    by   Ramos   and     others\n\nimplicating Genao in the murder of Caballo. To treat these hearsay\n\nstatements of Llaurador as merely cumulative (the harmless side of\n\ncorroborative) would be unrealistic.                Moreover, these statements\n\nwere read into the record by a Commonwealth judge who was so\n\nidentified to the jury.             That association inevitably added to the\n\nweight of the hearsay testimony being offered, particularly since\n\nthe principal non-hearsay evidence consisted of testimony by a co-\n\nconspirator      (Ramos)      and    a   cooperator    (Soto),     both    of    whose\n\nintegrity might be more open to question than Llaurador's.                       Under\n\nthese circumstances, we cannot exclude the reasonable possibility\n\nthat   the   constitutional          error    at   issue   in   the   admission     of\n\nLlaurador's statements influenced the jury in reaching its verdict\n\nthat Genao was guilty of participating in a conspiracy to murder\n\nCaballo and that he aided and abetted that murder.                    Therefore, we\n\nmust vacate those convictions.\n\n             We reach a different conclusion regarding the impact of\n\nthe    court's    error    on    the     jury's    consideration      of   the    drug\n\nconspiracy (count one) charge.               Focusing almost exclusively on the\n\n\n                                          -39-\n\fevents   surrounding   Caballo's   murder,   Llaurador's   erroneously-\n\nadmitted statements say little about Genao's involvement in the\n\ndrug smuggling work of the conspiracy.       Moreover, the testimony of\n\nthe two cooperating witnesses firmly established his participation\n\nin those activities.    Ramos testified that Genao worked as a drug\n\ncourier for him before Genao became a member of the conspiracy,\n\ndelivering pounds of marijuana for Ramos to sell at the Montana\n\nhousing complex.   He described Genao's participation in two large\n\ndrug shipments, a nine hundred to one thousand kilogram shipment in\n\nthe fall of 1995 that the group smuggled on behalf of Ayala; and a\n\nshipment of cocaine in February 1996, which Genao also helped to\n\ntransport and from which the conspirators stole kilos.             Soto\n\ntestified that Genao participated in an aborted effort to smuggle\n\na large load of marijuana in June 1996.          Genao was one of the\n\ncaptains of the boats and was supposed to be paid between fifty\n\nthousand and sixty thousand dollars, but they were never able to\n\nconnect with their supplier.\n\n           On the basis of this evidence, we readily conclude that\n\nthe district court's erroneous admission of Llaurador's statements\n\nwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in securing convictions on\n\ncount one of the second superseding indictment.         See Casas, 356\n\nF.3d at 121 (upholding a drug conspiracy conviction where \"[o]ther\n\nevidence presented at trial, as well as the admissible testimony of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\f[the investigating agent] based on personal knowledge, clearly\n\nestablished that [the defendant] was a member of the conspiracy\").\n\n\n\n\n                              -41-\n\f</pre>",
