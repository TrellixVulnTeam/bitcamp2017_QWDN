Christie, with whom Shaheen & Gordon was on brief,\nfor appellant Rodger Beaudoin.\n     Joshua L. Gordon for appellant Robert Champagne.\n     Terry L. Ollila, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 26, 2004\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       This appeal presents interesting\n\nquestions about the application of the Fourth Amendment when an\n\nanonymous tipster informs police that there is a dead body in a\n\nmotel room.\n\n           A series of events cascaded from that tip, resulting in\n\nthe arrests of Rodger Beaudoin and Robert Champagne on various\n\ndrug-related charges and a federal prosecution for conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine and crack and for possession of crack with\n\nintent to distribute.      21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.       Before trial,\n\nthe defendants each moved to suppress all of the evidence that the\n\npolice had found in a search of them and their motel room,\n\nincluding knives, drugs, drug paraphernalia, and large amounts of\n\ncash.    After    an   evidentiary   hearing,   the   trial   court,    in   a\n\nthoughtful opinion, denied their motions.             The defendants pled\n\nguilty but preserved the right to challenge the suppression ruling\n\non appeal, which they now exercise.        Champagne also appeals from a\n\nsentence enhancement. We affirm both the denial of the suppression\n\nmotions and the sentence enhancement.\n\n                                   I.\n                            Background Facts\n\n           The facts are taken from the suppression hearing, as\n\nfound by the district judge, and supplemented from the record.\n\n           At 5:15 in the morning on July 24, 2001, the Manchester,\n\nNew   Hampshire   Police   Department      informed   the   Hookset    Police\n\nDepartment that a dispatcher had just received a 911 call during\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwhich an unidentified person reported \"a drug deal gone bad at the\n\nKozy 7 Motel, Room 10\" in Hooksett.    The caller said \"I think there\n\nis a dead body in there,\" and then hung-up before any follow-up\n\nquestions could be asked.\n\n          Three   Hooksett    officers,   Sergeant   Chamberlain   and\n\nOfficers Pinardi and Sherrill, were immediately dispatched to the\n\nmotel, about three miles away. Officer Pinardi understood that the\n\ninformation was that \"a drug deal [had] gone bad, during which a\n\nperson was allegedly shot and there was a dead body.\"        The call\n\ntranscript itself contains nothing about a shooting, but Pinardi\n\nheard the dispatcher conveying the information to Chamberlain. The\n\nmotel was not upscale and was the sort of place that police had\n\nvisited before in connection with criminal activity.\n\n          The officers arrived several minutes later. They did not\n\nattempt to see the motel manager to ask if there was any unusual\n\nactivity in the room, but instead went straight to the room that\n\nthe caller had identified.    The officers noticed that a light was\n\non in Room 10, but that all of the other rooms were dark.          The\n\ncurtain of the window to Room 10 was closed.\n\n          The uniformed officers approached the room; Officers\n\nPinardi and Sherrill took positions on either side of the doorway,\n\nwhile Sergeant Chamberlain stood farther back on the opposite side\n\nof the motel room's window.    Pinardi stood to the left of the door\n\nfor \"officer safety reasons.\" Among other things, in that position\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fhe \"would be able to see inside the room, see what was going on,\n\nand also . . . be able to get out of the way if . . . the door . .\n\n. swung open.\"    Officer Sherrill instinctively stood in front of\n\nthe door, but he moved to the right after Sergeant Chamberlain told\n\nhim to step away from the door.          Sergeant Chamberlain chose a\n\nposition to the right of the door, by the window, to get \"a little\n\nconcealment or whatever if something did happen in the room,\n\nwhether there was going to be a shoot-out or whatever.\"                He was\n\nconcerned for his own safety because of the report that there was\n\na dead body in the room.\n\n          Chamberlain, with a view of the window, saw some movement\n\nbehind the window, and the officers heard some rustling from the\n\nroom.   Pinardi   knocked   on   the    door.   A   man   (who   was    later\n\nidentified as Beaudoin) drew back the curtains of the window and\n\npeered outside toward Chamberlain.       There was sufficient light to\n\nsee the uniformed officers.      Chamberlain then identified himself\n\nand the others as Hooksett police officers and asked the man to go\n\nto the door so they could speak with him.            The man, Beaudoin,\n\nopened the door, but only wide enough so his face could be seen.\n\nBoth the interior door and an outer screen door were opened.\n\nSergeant Chamberlain could not recall if Beaudoin pushed the screen\n\ndoor entirely open, or if Beaudoin pushed the screen door part way\n\nopen and an officer held it open.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            Officers    Chamberlain    and   Pinardi   presented   slightly\n\nvarying accounts of what transpired next.          These differences prove\n\nto be immaterial.       Officer Pinardi testified that once Beaudoin\n\nopened the door, the officers explained to him that they were\n\ninvestigating a crime and had heard that someone had been shot in\n\nthe room.    Pinardi said that he then asked Beaudoin if he could\n\n\"just come out here\" so the police could talk to him and that\n\nBeaudoin    did   so   voluntarily.     Sergeant    Chamberlain,   however,\n\ntestified that he asked Beaudoin to step outside so they could talk\n\nto him, which Beaudoin did, and only then explained why the police\n\nwere there. Either way, Beaudoin stepped outside, leaving the door\n\nbehind him sufficiently open so that Pinardi could see inside the\n\nroom.   Whether Beaudoin felt free not to step outside is an open\n\nquestion.\n\n            Once Beaudoin was outside, Sergeant Chamberlain asked him\n\nif he was carrying any weapons.        Beaudoin said that he had a knife\n\nin his left rear pocket and started to reach for it.               Sergeant\n\nChamberlain said that he would remove the knife, ordered Beaudoin\n\nto put his hands on the wall, and proceeded to pat him down.\n\nDuring the pat down, Sergeant Chamberlain patted Beaudoin's left\n\nrear pocket and felt three objects:          an object that seemed to be a\n\nknife and two long and hard cylindrical objects that he was unable\n\nto identify.      Chamberlain reached into the pocket and removed a\n\nknife, two glass tubes, and three plastic balls containing crack\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcocaine.    The glass tubes and crack cocaine were contained in one\n\nplastic bag. Chamberlain placed Beaudoin under arrest and finished\n\nthe pat down.    He found $300 in Beaudoin's right front pocket.\n\n            While Sergeant Chamberlain was frisking Beaudoin, Officer\n\nPinardi made eye contact with a second man in the motel room, later\n\nidentified as Champagne, through the open door. Once Champagne saw\n\nPinardi, Champagne hurried across the room toward the far wall and\n\nbegan to shuffle through some items on top of a dresser and to\n\nreach into his pockets.       Pinardi thought it odd that the man, upon\n\nseeing the police, did not come toward them to ask why they were\n\nthere.     Pinardi feared that Champagne was either searching for a\n\nweapon or trying to hide evidence, so he and Officer Sherrill\n\nentered the motel room and directed Champagne away from the dresser\n\nand toward the middle of the room.        Pinardi explained to Champagne\n\nthat the officers had received a report that there was a dead\n\nperson in the motel room.       Champagne denied that there was a dead\n\nbody.\n\n            Pinardi   asked     Champagne   if   he   had   any   weapons.\n\nChampagne, who was nervous, said that he did not, but Officer\n\nPinardi saw that Champagne had a knife clipped to one of his\n\npockets.     Pinardi removed the knife and conducted a protective\n\nfrisk, holding Champagne's arms behind his back. During the frisk,\n\nChampagne became increasingly fidgety and kept attempting to free\n\nhis hands to reach into the pockets of his pants.           Pinardi patted\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fChampagne's    right   front    pocket    and   felt    several   long,   hard\n\ncylinders, which he feared could be small pen guns or knives.\n\nChampagne became even more fidgety when Pinardi patted that pocket.\n\nWhen Champagne refused to comply with Pinardi's instruction to stop\n\nmoving his hands, Pinardi and Sherrill pushed him face down on the\n\nbed and handcuffed him.        Pinardi told Champagne that he was not\n\nunder arrest but was being restrained so Pinardi could safely\n\nascertain the nature of the situation in the room. Officer Pinardi\n\nstill had not looked in the bathroom and had no idea whether there\n\nwas a dead body inside.\n\n          Pinardi and Sherrill helped Champagne to his feet and\n\nasked him what was in his front pocket.          When Champagne said that\n\nhe did not know, Pinardi stretched open Champagne's pocket so he\n\ncould see inside it.           With the aid of a flashlight held by\n\nSherrill, Pinardi saw several crack pipes, which were the long\n\ncylindrical objects that he had feared were weapons, as well as a\n\nsubstance that later proved to be crack-cocaine.              Pinardi seized\n\nthese items and continued his frisk, finding yet more crack and a\n\nwad of cash.\n\n          After completing these searches, the officers searched\n\nthe rest of the motel room for a dead body.            When they did not find\n\na body, the officers left behind the contraband they had found and\n\nbrought Beaudoin and Champagne to the police station.                 Once a\n\nsearch warrant was obtained, the police returned to the motel room\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fand   took   the   contraband       found   in   the   searches,     as    well   as\n\nadditional drug paraphernalia, into police custody.                       They also\n\nfound by the door a plugged-in skill saw with its safety cover\n\nduct-taped up.\n\n                                   II.\n                            Procedural History\n\n             Each defendant was indicted on charges of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine and crack and possession of crack with intent to\n\ndistribute. 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.                     Champagne was also\n\nindicted on charges of obtaining proceeds from the distribution of\n\ncrack.   Id. § 853.       Both defendants moved to suppress all of the\n\nevidence that had been seized at or near the motel room, including\n\nthe drugs found on them and the contraband discovered inside the\n\nmotel room.    The prosecution argued that the request that Beaudoin\n\nstep out of the motel room doorway was justified by exigent\n\ncircumstances,     such    as   a   Terry    stop,     and   that   the    evidence\n\nsubsequently found was admissible under the inevitable discovery\n\ndoctrine.     The trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on\n\nDecember 5, 2001.     After hearing the testimony of Officer Pinardi\n\nand Sergeant Chamberlain and reviewing a transcript of the 911 call\n\nand copies of the police reports, the district court judge denied\n\nboth defendants' motions.             The judge held that the officers'\n\ninitial request that Beaudoin exit his motel room and their later\n\nentry into the room were both justified by the emergency assistance\n\nexception to the warrant requirement because the officers could\n\n                                       -9-\n\freasonably have believed that a person inside of the motel room was\n\nin need of emergency aid.\n\n            The defendants then pled guilty to the crimes charged in\n\nthe indictment, but reserved their right to appeal the district\n\ncourt judge's denial of their suppression motions.            Beaudoin was\n\nsentenced to fifty-seven months in prison to be followed by four\n\nyears of supervised release, and Champagne, to 151 months in prison\n\nto be followed by five years of supervised release.           In sentencing\n\nChampagne, the judge imposed a two-point increase in his offense\n\nlevel based upon his possession of the electric saw, which the\n\njudge deemed to be a dangerous weapon.         U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1).\n\n                                 III.\n                               Analysis\n\nA.   Fourth Amendment Issue\n\n            The ultimate conclusion on whether the police violated\n\nthe Fourth Amendment is reviewed de novo.               Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 697 (1996).      We defer to the district court's\n\nfactual findings, which we accept.         This case does not turn on any\n\ndisputed issue of fact.\n\n            The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures by the government.           A warrantless search\n\ninvolving   an   intrusion   into   someone's    home    is   presumptively\n\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.         Groh v. Ramirez, No. 02-\n\n811, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 162, at *15-*16 (2004); Steagald v. United\n\nStates, 451 U.S. 204, 211-12 (1981).            The reasonableness of a\n\n                                    -10-\n\fsearch depends entirely on the context in which it takes place;\n\ndifferent Fourth Amendment doctrines as to reasonableness have\n\nevolved to fit different contexts.\n\n          One set of variants in these doctrines is the degree of\n\nthe privacy expectations involved.     For example, expectations of\n\nprivacy in a commercial establishment are not strong. See New York\n\nv. Burger, 482 U.S. 691, 700 (1987). Privacy expectations in one's\n\nhome, by contrast, are quite strong.   See Groh, 2004 US LEXIS 162,\n\nat *15-*16; Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 40 (2001).       As\n\nsuch, searches usually may not be made in a person's home unless\n\nthe police have obtained a search warrant based on probable cause.\n\nPayton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586-87 (1980).    By analogy, this\n\nrule is usually extended to searches in a person's hotel or motel\n\nroom, which is a sort of temporary home.    See Stoner v. California,\n\n376 U.S. 483, 490 (1964); United States v. Bardacchino, 762 F.2d\n\n170, 175-76 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n          Another set of contextual variants are grouped under the\n\ndoctrine of exigent circumstances.         The exigent circumstances\n\nusually recognized include: (1) risk to the lives or health of the\n\ninvestigating officers; (2) risk that the evidence sought will be\n\ndestroyed; (3) risk that the person sought will escape from the\n\npremises; and (4) \"hot pursuit\" of a fleeing felon.       See United\n\nStates v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f           Several courts have recognized another type of exigent\n\ncircumstance: an emergency situation in which police must act\n\nquickly to save someone's life or prevent harm.        See United States\n\nv. Holloway, 290 F.3d 1331, 1337 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v.\n\nRichardson, 208 F.3d 626, 630 (7th Cir. 2000); Seymour v. Walker,\n\n224 F.3d 542, 556 (6th Cir. 2000); Tierney v. Davidson, 133 F.3d\n\n189, 196 (2d Cir. 1998); Wayne v. United States, 318 F.2d 205, 212\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1963) (Burger, J.).       This court has not had occasion to\n\naddress the emergency doctrine.            Recognition of some type of\n\nemergency doctrine is entirely consistent, though, with the logic\n\nof the traditional exigency exceptions to the warrant requirement.\n\nThis court implicitly said as much in Bilida v. McCleod, 211 F.3d\n\n166 (1st Cir. 2000), holding that \"[w]arrantless entries are most\n\noften justified by 'exigent circumstances,' the best examples being\n\nhot   pursuit   of   a   felon,   imminent   destruction   or   removal   of\n\nevidence, the threatened escape by a suspect, or imminent threat to\n\nthe life or safety of the public, police officers, or a person in\n\nresidence.\"     Id. at 171 (emphasis added).      And the Supreme Court,\n\nin dicta, has said that the Fourth Amendment \"does not bar police\n\nofficers from making warrantless entries and searches when they\n\nreasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate\n\naid.\"   Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978).\n\n           In the end, this case involves the intersection of\n\nseveral Fourth Amendment doctrines, most notably, those of exigent\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fcircumstances, emergencies, and Terry-type temporary detentions\n\nduring investigations.          Generally, under the emergency doctrine,\n\nthere       must   be    a   reasonable     basis,     sometimes     said   to    be\n\napproximating probable cause, both to believe in the existence of\n\nthe emergency and to associate that emergency with the area or\n\nplace to be searched.1         3 W. LaFave, Search & Seizure § 6.6(a) (3d\n\nEd. 1996); People v. Mitchell, 39 N.Y.2d 173, 177-78 (1976).                     The\n\nanalysis must be with reference to the circumstances confronting\n\nthe officer, including, as one commentator has put it, \"the need\n\nfor     a   prompt      assessment   of    sometimes     ambiguous    information\n\nconcerning potentially serious consequences.\"                 LaFave, supra, §\n\n6.6(a); see also Wayne, 318 F.2d at 212 (Burger, J.).\n\n              The facts also raise the classic exigent circumstances\n\nsituation, of a risk to the safety of police officers; the officers\n\nwere investigating a report of both drug activity and possible\n\ndeadly      criminal     activity    in   the    room.     Traditional      exigent\n\ncircumstances justify a warrantless search when there is reasonable\n\nsuspicion that a person poses a threat to the lives or safety of\n\npolice officers and there is probable cause to believe that a crime\n\nhas been committed.          McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance Serv., 77 F.3d\n\n\n      1\n      A few courts have imported an \"intent\" requirement, demanding\nthat the officers not be primarily motivated by an intent to arrest\nand seize evidence. Subsequent Supreme Court case law, we think,\neliminates any such intent requirement in favor of a purely\nobjective test. Whren v. United States 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996);\nScott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 137 (1978); see United States\nv. Richardson, 208 F.3d 626, 630 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                          -13-\n\f540, 545 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); Hegarty v. Somerset City, 53 F.3d 1367, 1376 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).       But whether or not probable cause for a crime exists,\n\nthe inquiry determining the existence of an exigency is essentially\n\none of reasonable suspicion.          See United States v. Soto-Beniquez,\n\n356 F.3d 1, 36 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Lopez, 989 F.2d\n\n24, 26 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             Further,      the   government   correctly   suggests     that    the\n\ndetention of Beaudoin was analogous to a Terry stop.                    Terry v.\n\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).          Terry stops, designed to protect police\n\nofficers     in    their    investigations,     may   occur    when    there   is\n\nreasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity is afoot,\n\neven where there is not probable cause to arrest.                     See United\n\nStates v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (warrantless\n\ninvestigatory stops are allowable if, and to the extent that,\n\npolice officers have reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing that is\n\nbased on specific, articulable facts);                LaFave, supra, § 9.4;\n\nFlorida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 498 (1983).             Reasonable suspicion\n\nis a less demanding standard than probable cause. United States v.\n\nGolab, 325 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 2003).                   Once the stop has\n\noccurred, an officer may search a suspect's person for weapons\n\nbased   on   reasonable      suspicion   that   the   person    is    armed    and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdangerous.    Terry, 392 U.S. at 27.2   When the officer suspects a\n\ncrime of violence, the same information that will support an\n\ninvestigatory stop will, without more, support a protective search.\n\nId. at 33; United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 41 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nDefendants argue only that Terry does not justify a command to step\n\nout of the doorway.    They do not argue that Terry precluded the\n\npolice, standing outside and knocking, to ask the man (who opened\n\nthe curtain) to go to the doorway to talk to the police.     Nor do\n\nthey argue that Beaudoin went involuntarily to the door and opened\n\nit.   So this is more like a situation in which a person voluntarily\n\nstops, and then the police take reasonable steps, during that\n\ntemporary stop, to protect themselves during the questioning.\n\n           These doctrines are not firm-line tests.   \"The governing\n\ncaselaw under the Fourth Amendment does not yield very many bright\n\nline rules.   This is not surprising since the ultimate touchstone\n\nis one of reasonableness . . . .\"   Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, 112\n\nF.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           When the police were informed of the anonymous call\n\nreporting both drug dealing and a dead body, they were certainly\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      Several courts have found that Terry does not justify\nintrusions into the home. See LaLonde v. Riverside, 204 F.3d 947,\n954 (9th Cir. 2000); United States v. Winsor, 846 F.2d 1569, 1577-\n78 (9th Cir. 1988) (en banc). But this issue is not before us --\nthe issue, as described below, does not arise from an intrusion\ninto the home or motel room.\n\n                                -15-\n\fjustified in promptly going to the motel to investigate.3            Not\n\nsurprisingly, nothing visible at the motel either disproved the\n\nreport nor particularly confirmed it.      As such, it was reasonable\n\nfor the police, seeing a light on at 5:30 a.m. in the room that the\n\nanonymous caller had identified, to assume that someone was in the\n\nroom and to knock on the door.       Once the police heard movement in\n\nthe room and saw someone open the curtain, it was reasonable for\n\nthem to ask that person to go to the door so they could speak with\n\nhim.       See Illinois v. Lidster, 124 S.Ct. 885, 890 (2004) (law\n\nenforcement      officials   can   permissibly   \"seek   the   voluntary\n\ncooperation of members of the public in the investigation of a\n\ncrime\").\n\n              Beaudoin did not fully open the door in response to the\n\nofficers' request; rather, he opened it just enough so that his\n\nface was visible. The officers could not see Beaudoin's hands, nor\n\ncould they see any part of the room that was within easy reach of\n\nthe doorway.      It is at this point that the issue of officer safety\n\narose.      The relevant facts are those that were known to the police\n\nat the time of the exigency.       See Banks, 124 S. Ct. at 527.     The\n\npolice knew that a 911 call had been made within the half-hour\n\nstating that both a crime (drug dealing) and a death (possible\n\n\n\n       3\n      The motel was familiar to the police; they had been called\nthere before in criminal matters. Drug deals in Maine motel rooms\nhave certainly happened before.     See, e.g., United States v.\nJulien, 318 F.3d 316, 318 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                   -16-\n\fcrime) had happened in the motel room.       If the phone report was\n\ntrue, the man in the doorway probably was involved in either or\n\nboth of the reported activities and might even be a murderer; the\n\nman might well be armed and might have companions in the room.   The\n\nassociation between drug dealing and guns is well known.         The\n\nofficers could not verify that the man was not armed because of the\n\nway he had opened the door, nor could they tell if he had a weapon\n\nclose at hand.    The partially opened doorway to the small motel\n\nroom was not a safe place for the police to investigate whether the\n\nman was armed, in this situation.      Additionally, the officers had\n\nheard noises from inside the room and thus had reason to suspect\n\nthat at least one other person besides the man at the door was\n\ninside.\n\n            In the end, this case turns on whether it was reasonable\n\nfor Sergeant Chamberlain to ask Beaudoin to step out of the\n\ndoorway.4    It matters not, in these particular circumstances,\n\nwhether the request was in essence a command.         We will assume\n\narguendo that Beaudoin did not feel free to ignore the officers'\n\n\n\n     4\n      This is not, then, an issue of a search inside of a person's\nhome or motel room or of the arrest of a person in a doorway.\nIndeed, even in the situation of arrests pursuant to warrant in the\ndoorways of homes, the law is not clearly defined. In the context\nof doorway arrests, a more serious intrusion than here, this court\nhas noted \"[t]he Supreme Court cases, with Steagald at one pole and\nSantana at the other, do not definitively resolve [the issue].\nEven a quick review of lower court cases reveals that there is no\nsettled answer as to the constitutionality of doorway arrests.\"\nJoyce v. Town of Tewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                -17-\n\fsummons. We also assume arguendo that the statement to Beaudoin to\n\nstep outside was a \"seizure,\" though this is not free from doubt.5\n\nThe    issue    is    whether   the    command     was   justified    under    the\n\ncombination of the three doctrines.              The Fourth Amendment question\n\nis not whether Beaudoin acted reasonably that morning; the question\n\nis    whether   the    officers'      response    to   Beaudoin's    actions   was\n\nreasonable in context.          Nor is the issue whether the officers had\n\nprobable cause to arrest Beaudoin and enter the room based solely\n\non the anonymous tip; we need not decide that.                  See Florida v.\n\nJ.L., 529 U.S. 266, 270-71 (2000).\n\n            There may, of course, be exigent circumstances posing a\n\nthreat to officers and justifying reasonable responses even in the\n\nabsence of probable cause to arrest.              The notion is abhorrent that\n\npolice who are investigating a crime and suddenly find themselves\n\nat risk are precluded from acting reasonably in response to that\n\nrisk merely because they have not yet established probable cause to\n\nmake an arrest for a crime.           Finally, the question presented here\n\nis not whether the anonymous tip alone, absent any risk of injury\n\nto the officers, justified the command to step out of the doorway.\n\nNor is any abstract issue raised about the application of Terry to\n\npersons in doorways absent the emergency and exigent circumstances\n\npresent here.\n\n\n       5\n      Consider, for example, if Beaudoin had already left the\ndoorway and the officer simply instructed Beaudoin to step closer\nto him.\n\n                                        -18-\n\f           As the Supreme Court has emphasized, determining whether\n\nthe officers' actions were reasonable in the context of exigent\n\ncircumstances requires balancing the need for the warrantless\n\nsearch or seizure against the harm to the individual whose privacy\n\nis being intruded upon in light of all the circumstances.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Banks, 124 S. Ct. 521, 525 (2003) (whether exigent\n\ncircumstances justify police action depends on a reasonableness\n\ninquiry based on the totality of the circumstances).                   Courts\n\nengaging   in    this    balancing     must   be   wary    of   overlaying    a\n\n\"categorical scheme on the general reasonableness analysis\" and\n\nthus \"distort[ing] the 'totality of the circumstances' principle,\n\nby   replacing    a     stress   on   revealing    facts    with   resort    to\n\npigeonholes.\"    Id. at 528.\n\n           Here, the harm to Beaudoin in being commanded (assuming\n\nhe was commanded) to step out of the doorway of his motel room was\n\nrelatively small.        The police did not order Beaudoin out of the\n\ndoorway until he had voluntarily opened the door and spoken with\n\nthem.   To the extent this was a seizure, it was more akin to the\n\ntemporary detention involved in a Terry stop.              The police did not\n\nenter the motel room here, but merely told (or perhaps, requested)\n\nBeaudoin to step outside of his doorway.              This is entirely in\n\nkeeping with the basic rationale of Terry: a brief \"seizure\" in\n\nthese circumstances protected police safety and facilitated the\n\ninvestigation while minimizing the intrusiveness of the invasion on\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fBeaudoin's privacy.          We do not say that Beaudoin relinquished all\n\nexpectations of privacy merely by opening his door; still, it was\n\nless intrusive for the police to tell him to step outside at that\n\npoint than it would have been if Beaudoin had not himself come\n\npartially outside by opening the door.                Cf. U.S. v. Santana, 427\n\nU.S. 38, 42 (1976) (there is no expectation of privacy in the\n\ndoorway to one's home because one is knowingly \"exposed to public\n\nview, speech, hearing, and touch as if [one] had been standing\n\ncompletely outside [one's] house\").\n\n               A police command to step out of the opened door of one's\n\nmotel room is, nonetheless, a non-trivial invasion of privacy. But\n\nbalanced against the objective safety concerns of the officers\n\nhere,    and    in   light    of   the    call   about   an    emergency,   it    was\n\nreasonable. See United States v. Sargent, 319 F.3d 4, 10-12 (1st\n\nCir.    2003)     (officers    had    reasonable     suspicion     of    danger   in\n\nexecuting a search warrant at an apartment that they knew contained\n\ndrugs and numerous knives when there was a five-second delay\n\nbetween the police announcement of their presence and the opening\n\nof the door); United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 442 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (noting the importance of the police officers' safety in the\n\nexigent circumstances analysis).\n\n               Telling Beaudoin to step outside was an effective way for\n\nthe    officers      to   alleviate      their   significant    safety   concerns.\n\nFirst, it assured the officers that Beaudoin was not holding a\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\floaded gun in his hands and that he was not within easy reach of a\n\nweapon.      Second, it allowed the police to ask Beaudoin some\n\nquestions while putting some distance between themselves and other\n\npersons potentially in the room.    Finally, asking Beaudoin out of\n\nthe room allowed the police to perform a pat down unhindered by a\n\ndoor frame and to subdue Beaudoin if necessary.\n\n            An argument may be made that there were alternatives\n\navailable to the police.    The officers could have attempted first\n\nto contact the motel manager or to telephone to see if there were\n\npeople inside of the room.     But most of those alternatives were\n\navailable several steps earlier in the process and were hardly\n\nrequired.     Realistically, they were no longer available once\n\nBeaudoin opened the door as he did.      There is also a suggestion\n\nthat the officers should not have asked Beaudoin to step out of the\n\ndoorway at all once he opened it; they should have simply retreated\n\nfrom the area.   The officers had reasons to fear being shot if they\n\nretreated.    The police would have been foolish either to back away\n\nor to turn their backs on Beaudoin.    For the officers to ascertain\n\nwhether he had weapons, in light of the information they had, was\n\neminently sensible.    Moreover, delay risked the life of the person\n\nin the room reported to be dead, if there were such a person.\n\n            None of the officers' actions after Beaudoin stepped out\n\nof the doorway justifies suppressing the evidence.    Once Beaudoin\n\nstepped out of the doorway, it was reasonable for the officers to\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fask him if he had a weapon.       And when Beaudoin said that he had a\n\nknife and reached for his pocket, it was reasonable for the\n\nofficers to do a quick pat down.         After finding the knife and two\n\ndrug pipes, it was reasonable for them to enter the room, given the\n\ninformation about the drug deal and the dead body.\n\n           The fact that the other two officers had not waited long\n\nbefore entering the room and frisking Champagne (while Beaudoin was\n\nquestioned and frisked outside) need not be addressed in these\n\ncircumstances.      Under   the   inevitable   discovery    doctrine,    the\n\nofficers   would   inevitably     have   entered   the   room   and   frisked\n\nChampagne once the results of frisking Beaudoin were known.             And,\n\ninevitably, they would have arrested him, once they found what was\n\nin his pockets.    See United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 42 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).      This is what the district court concluded and we\n\nagree.   Had Beaudoin not had drugs and a weapon on him, this court\n\nwould be faced with a much different question about the police\n\nentry into the room.\n\n           One essential purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to\n\nimpose a standard of reasonableness on the exercise of discretion\n\nby the police in order to safeguard \"the privacy and security of\n\nindividuals against arbitrary invasions.\"          Delaware v. Prouse, 440\n\nU.S. 648, 653-54 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted).              This\n\nis distinctly not a case in which the raw question is presented of\n\nwhether police may barge into someone's home or even motel room\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fmerely based on the receipt of a tip that there is a dead body\n\ninside.     The concerns raised by such a scenario are very serious.\n\nAnonymous tips, without more, do not justify free-wheeling police\n\naction.     J.L., 529 U.S. at 270.      It is easy for someone to make an\n\nanonymous 911 call to the police with a false report of a dead body\n\nin a room in order to set up the people in that room.            This case\n\nshows exactly that: Beaudoin and Champagne were set up by the\n\nanonymous tipster.       Equally, though, society expects police to\n\ninvestigate reports of dead bodies, and to do so promptly.              The\n\nreportedly \"dead\" body might yet be alive and prompt action could\n\nsave the person.      See Wayne, 318 F.2d at 212 (\"Acting in response\n\nto reports of 'dead bodies,' the police may find the 'bodies' to be\n\ncommon drunks, diabetics in shock, or distressed cardiac patients\n\n. . . .     Even the apparently dead often are saved by swift police\n\nresponse.\").\n\n             Fourth Amendment analysis is renownedly fact specific; a\n\nstep-by-step analysis is inherent in the claim.         Defendants, ably\n\nrepresented by counsel, argue that the court should not do a step-\n\nby-step analysis of the officers' actions, but should back up and\n\ninstead take a look at the entire picture.          Courts must do both.\n\nThere may indeed be rare cases where the entire picture reveals\n\nthat the reasonableness of each succeeding step was so marginal\n\nthat   an   overall   conclusion   of    unreasonableness   is   warranted.\n\nStill, defendants' disavowal of a step-by-step approach relies too\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fmuch on doctrinal categories, and not enough on the facts of the\n\ncase.   The Supreme Court expressly disapproved of such an approach\n\nin Banks, 124 S. Ct. at 528.\n\n           We emphatically do not create an anonymously reported\n\nmurder scene exception to the warrant requirement, nor do we adopt\n\na broad emergency aid doctrine, as defendants fear.                 There are\n\nvalid concerns about the harm to Fourth Amendment interests from a\n\ngenerous interpretation of the emergency doctrine as an exception\n\nto the warrant requirement.        This case does not, in the end, turn\n\non the emergency doctrine alone but turns also on the exigent\n\ncircumstance of risk to the officers, a risk that justified telling\n\nBeaudoin to step out of the doorway and is a justification for the\n\nTerry doctrine.     From that, all else followed.\n\nB.   Sentencing Issue\n\n           Champagne appeals the district court's two-point increase\n\nin his offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon.                 He\n\ncontends that it was clearly implausible that the circular saw\n\nfound in the motel room could have been used as a weapon because it\n\nwas unwieldy and had to be plugged in to be operational.                  The\n\ndistrict court judge was required to impose the enhancement if the\n\ndefendant possessed a dangerous weapon \"unless it [was] clearly\n\nimprobable   that   the   weapon    was    connected   with   the   offense.\"\n\nU.S.S.G § 2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n.3 (2003).           Our review is only for\n\n\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fclear error.   United States v. Picanso, 333 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n            Champagne's arguments do not demonstrate clear error.\n\nThe safety cover of the saw was duct-taped so the saw's blade could\n\nbe engaged more easily.   And the incongruous presence of the saw in\n\na motel room must be considered in conjunction with the fact that\n\nChampagne, as a convicted felon, knew that he could not lawfully\n\npossess a weapon.    Under these circumstances, the district court\n\ndid not commit clear error in applying the sentencing enhancement\n\nfor possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\n                                 IV.\n                             Conclusion\n\n            The denials of the defendants' motions to suppress are\n\naffirmed.   Champagne's sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                    Dissenting opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting. The majority concludes\n\nthat the Hooksett police officers did not violate the Fourth\n\nAmendment's protections for a private residence when they directed\n\nRodger Beaudoin to step outside of his motel room.             In reaching\n\nthis result, the majority does not rely on the emergency exception\n\ndoctrine,   which   provided   the    basis   for   the   district   court's\n\ndecision, nor does it accept the government's alternative argument\n\nthat the seizure of Rodger Beaudoin was equivalent to an on-the-\n\nbeat, non-residential Terry-stop to which the Fourth Amendment's\n\nwarrant requirement does not apply.         Rather, the majority adopts a\n\nnovel amalgam of Fourth Amendment doctrines that combines the\n\nemergency exception doctrine, the traditional exigent circumstance\n\nof risk to the safety of police officers, and the Terry doctrine to\n\nuphold the officers' actions under the Fourth Amendment.             Absent\n\nfrom this analysis is any consideration of whether the command to\n\nBeaudoin was supported by probable cause to believe that a criminal\n\noffense had been or was being committed, or probable cause to\n\nbelieve that an individual's life or safety was in danger within\n\nthe defendants' motel room.     Because I believe that the majority's\n\napproach is irreconcilable with long-established Fourth Amendment\n\njurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.\n\n            As I will explain more fully below, under Payton v. New\n\nYork, 445 U.S. 573 (1980), and its progeny, the Fourth Amendment\n\nprohibits searches and seizures inside a private residence unless\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fthey are conducted pursuant to a warrant or are supported by\n\nexigent circumstances and probable cause (or, in the emergency\n\ncontext, by exigent circumstances amounting to probable cause).\n\nThe Terry doctrine, which permits minimally-intrusive, warrantless\n\nstops based on reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity, does not\n\napply to residential searches and seizures.        Moreover, for Fourth\n\nAmendment purposes, an overnight guest temporarily residing in a\n\nhotel or motel room is accorded the same protections as a person\n\nresiding   in   his   private   residence.   In   my   view,   the   police\n\nofficers' order to Beaudoin constituted a seizure of his person\n\nfrom his private residence that implicated Payton's heightened\n\nprotections for the home. That seizure was             not supported by\n\nprobable cause of criminal activity or probable cause of a danger\n\nto the life or safety of an individual within the defendants' motel\n\nroom. Therefore, I would vacate the district court's order denying\n\nthe defendants' motion to suppress.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\f                                  I.\n                 Fourth Amendment Requirements for\n                  Residential Searches and Seizures\n\n     The Fourth Amendment's protections hold particular importance\n\nfor searches and seizures within a private residence.6           In Payton\n\nv. New York, the Supreme Court explained that:\n\n     The Fourth Amendment protects the individual's privacy in\n     a variety of settings. In none is the zone of privacy\n     more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous\n     physical dimensions of an individual's home – a zone that\n     finds its roots in clear and specific constitutional\n     terms. . . . In terms that apply equally to seizures of\n     property and seizures of persons, the Fourth Amendment\n     has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house.\n\n\n445 U.S. at 589-90 (emphasis added).               The Fourth Amendment's\n\nwarrant    requirement   serves   as    the   primary    safeguard   against\n\nunlawful    searches   and   seizures    within    the   home.   Welsh    v.\n\nWisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 748 (1984) (noting that \"the physical\n\nentry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of\n\nthe Fourth Amendment is directed\").               These heightened Fourth\n\nAmendment protections for the home unmistakably apply to seizures\n\nof individuals who reside in hotel or motel rooms as overnight\n\nguests.    Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483, 490 (1964) (\"No less\n\nthan a tenant of a house, or the occupant of a room in a boarding\n\n\n\n     6\n      The Fourth Amendment provides: \"The right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or\naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,\nand persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const., amend. 4.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fhouse, a guest in a hotel room is entitled to constitutional\n\nprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\")(internal\n\ncitation omitted); United States v. Bardacchino, 762 F.2d 170, 175-\n\n76 (1st Cir. 1985) (defendant \"had the same right of privacy\n\n[against a warrantless forced entry into his motel room] that one\n\nwould have against an intrusion into one's private dwelling\").\n\nThus, when Beaudoin partially opened the door to his motel room in\n\nresponse to a police knock and request, he was entitled to no less\n\nconstitutional        protection   against     unreasonable         searches   and\n\nseizures than if he had opened the door to his private residence.\n\n     A warrantless search of a residence violates the Fourth\n\nAmendment's proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures\n\n\"unless   the   search     comes   within    one   of   a    'few     specifically\n\nestablished     and     well-delineated      exceptions'\"      to     the   Fourth\n\nAmendment's warrant requirement.            United States v. Luciano, 329\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412\n\nU.S. 218, 219 (1973) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347,\n\n357 (1967)).     In the context of a residential search or seizure,\n\nthese   specifically      established     exceptions        consist    of   either\n\nconsent, or exigent circumstances and probable cause.                       As the\n\nSupreme Court has recently reaffirmed, \"police officers need either\n\na warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances in order to\n\nmake a lawful entry into the home.\" Kirk v. Louisiana, 536 U.S.\n\n635, 638 (2002); see also Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 328\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f(1987) (\"A dwelling-place search, no less than a dwelling-place\n\nseizure, requires probable cause.\"); United States v. Khounsavanh,\n\n113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"While the warrant requirement\n\n[for a residential search or seizure] may be dispensed with in\n\ncertain exigent circumstances that are few in number and carefully\n\ndelineated, the probable cause requirement is rigorously adhered\n\nto.\") (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).                Exigent\n\ncircumstances exist where law enforcement officers confront \"a\n\ncompelling necessity for immediate action that would not brook the\n\ndelay of obtaining a warrant.\"       United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d\n\n965, 969 (1st Cir. 1995).         Probable cause requires that \"the\n\nofficers at the scene collectively possess[] reasonably trustworthy\n\ninformation sufficient to warrant a prudent policeman in believing\n\nthat a criminal offense had been or was being committed.\" Id.\n\n     Under a traditional Fourth Amendment analysis, the lawfulness\n\nof the Hooksett police officers' search and seizure of the motel\n\nroom and of the defendants turns on the initial question of whether\n\nBeaudoin exited the motel room voluntarily or whether he did so\n\nonly in response to a police order.            This question is important\n\nbecause a police order to exit your private residence is tantamount\n\nto a police seizure of your person within that residence.             As the\n\nSupreme Court has explained, a person has been seized for Fourth\n\nAmendment   purposes   if   \"in   view    of   all   of   the   circumstances\n\nsurrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fthat he was not free to leave.\"             United States v. Mendenhall, 446\n\nU.S. 544, 554 (1980).             If a reasonable person in Beaudoin's\n\nposition would have believed that he was not free to remain inside\n\nthe motel room because of the force of the police order and\n\napparent      authority,      then    the   police   constructively     entered\n\nBeaudoin's room to effect a seizure within the meaning of the\n\nFourth Amendment.         See United States v. Saari, 272 F.3d 804, 809\n\n(6th       Cir.   2002)     (police     officers'    conduct   constituted    a\n\nconstructive entry where they \"summoned Defendant to exit his home\n\nand acted with such a show of authority that Defendant reasonably\n\nbelieved he had no choice but to comply\").             On the other hand, if\n\na reasonable person in Beaudoin's position would have believed that\n\nhe was free to decline to exit the motel room, the directive was\n\nnot    a    seizure   and   did   not    implicate   the   Fourth   Amendment's\n\nproscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n       Although the district court did not explicitly decide whether\n\nBeaudoin voluntarily stepped outside of the room, it described the\n\nevidence on this point as \"equivocal\" in its written decision and\n\nnoted that it was \"by no means clear that Beaudoin voluntarily\n\nexited the room.\"         It further noted, at the suppression hearing,\n\nthat \"Mr. Beaudoin was not free under those circumstances to shut\n\nthe door and decline to come out of the hotel.              He was coming out\n\nof the hotel whether he wanted to or not.\"             The government always\n\nbears the burden of proving the existence of an exception to the\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fFourth Amendment's warrant requirement.   United States v. Jeffers,\n\n342 U.S. 48, 51 (1951).    Where a warrantless search or seizure is\n\npurportedly justified by the defendant's consent, \"the prosecution\n\n[must] show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent\n\nwas knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given.\"        United\n\nStates v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281, 285-86 (1st Cir. 2003).     Given\n\nthe sharp discrepancy between the two officers' testimonies, I\n\nwould read the district court's observations as a finding that the\n\ngovernment failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat Beaudoin freely and voluntarily consented to step outside of\n\nthe motel room.7   Indeed, the conflicting testimony of the officers\n\nwould seem to preclude any finding that the government met its\n\nburden of proof on its claim that Beaudoin exited the motel room\n\nvoluntarily. Therefore, I would conclude that the police officers'\n\norder to Beaudoin to step outside constituted a seizure of his\n\nperson from his motel room.\n\n     Whether Payton's heightened protections for the home apply in\n\nthis case depends not only upon whether the order to Beaudoin\n\n\n     7\n      The majority characterizes the two officers' testimonies as\n\"slightly varying accounts\" and suggests that the differences\nbetween them \"turn out to be immaterial.\"         In my view, the\ndifferences between the officers' testimonies are substantial and\nsignificant.    While Pinardi testified that he requested that\nBeaudoin step outside, Sergeant Chamberlain, when asked by the\ncourt whether he asked Beaudoin to step outside or ordered him out,\nresponded: \"I — I told him to come out, so I would say that I\nordered him out.\" He later testified that Beaudoin was not free to\nrefuse this directive, explaining that if Beaudoin had refused to\ncome out, Chamberlain would have gone in after him.\n\n                                -32-\n\fconstituted a seizure but also upon whether it was a residential\n\nseizure.     While one can argue in some cases about where the\n\nentrance to a private residence begins, the Fourth Amendment's\n\nwarrant    requirement   and    protections         for    the   home   are   either\n\nimplicated by a given search or seizure or they are not.                    In Kyllo\n\nv. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 30 (2001), the Supreme Court\n\nreaffirmed Payton, explaining that: \"We have said that the Fourth\n\nAmendment draws 'a firm line at the entrance to the house.'                        That\n\nline, we think, must be not only firm but also bright.\"                       On the\n\nexternal, public side of Payton's firm line, a police officer's\n\nconduct is not subject to Payton's protections.                  On the internal,\n\nresidential side of this line, police officers must obtain a\n\nwarrant supported by probable cause prior to conducting a non-\n\nconsensual search or seizure, or demonstrate that their actions are\n\njustified by exigent circumstances and probable cause.\n\n     The important question in this case, therefore, is not whether\n\nthe police conduct was intrusive, non-intrusive, or something in\n\nbetween when weighed against Beaudoin's reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy, but whether the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement and\n\nheightened    protections      for   the     home    were      implicated     by    the\n\nchallenged police conduct.           If the police officers' seizure of\n\nBeaudoin had taken place outside of the motel room, the Fourth\n\nAmendment's warrant requirement would not apply, and the police\n\nofficers'    directive   to    Beaudoin      might        be   understood     as    the\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fequivalent of a brief, investigative Terry stop, which requires\n\nonly a \"reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing – a suspicion that finds\n\nexpression in specific, articulable reasons for believing that a\n\nperson may be connected to the commission of a particular crime\" in\n\norder to meet the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement.\n\nUnited States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Terry\n\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968)). The reasonable suspicion standard\n\nis   \"an   intermediate   standard    requiring   more   than   unfounded\n\nspeculation but less than probable cause.\"        United States v. Cook,\n\n277 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Ornelas v. United States,\n\n517 U.S. 690, 696 (1981)).    In evaluating whether a Terry stop was\n\njustified by reasonable suspicion, the reviewing court must examine\n\n\"'the totality of the circumstances' of each case to see whether\n\nthe detaining officer ha[d] a 'particular and objective basis' for\n\nsuspecting legal wrongdoing.\"        United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S.\n\n266, 273 (2002).     In the course of a legitimate Terry stop, a\n\npolice officer may conduct a frisk of the suspect, searching his or\n\nher person for weapons, \"on reasonable suspicion that the suspect\n\nis armed and dangerous.\"     United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied 535 U.S. 1007 (2002).\n\n     In arguing that the seizure of Beaudoin was justified under\n\nthe Terry doctrine, the government suggested that under the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in United States v. Santana, Beaudoin had no\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy in his motel room once he opened\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fthe door to the police.       See United States v. Santana, 427 U.S. 38,\n\n40 n.1, 42 (1976) (holding that a suspect \"was in a public place\"\n\nand could be arrested without a warrant where she was standing\n\n\"directly in the doorway . . . not merely visible to the public but\n\n[] exposed to public view, speech, hearing, and touch, as if she\n\nhad   been    standing     completely    outside    of   her   house\").       The\n\ngovernment relied on the Second Circuit's opinion in Gori v. United\n\nStates, which found that the Santana doorway exception permitted a\n\nTerry-type investigatory stop based on reasonable suspicion where\n\ndefendants voluntarily opened the door of their apartment to public\n\nview in response to the knock of a delivery person they had\n\ninvited.      230 F.3d 44, 53 (2d Cir. 2000); c.f. Saari, 272 F.3d at\n\n811 (finding that Terry did not apply where the defendant was\n\nforcibly summoned out of the house at the command of the police and\n\ndid not voluntarily relinquish Payton's heightened protections for\n\nthe home).\n\n      In my view, the Santana doorway exception does not obviate the\n\nneed in this case for a warrant or exigent circumstances plus\n\nprobable cause.       Unlike the defendants in Gori, who \"opened [their\n\napartment] to public view . . . in response to the knock of an\n\ninvitee\" and therefore had \"no expectation of privacy as to what\n\ncould be seen from the hall,\" Beaudoin opened the interior door of\n\nhis   motel    room   in   response     to   a   knock   and   request   by   law\n\n\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fenforcement officials.8    Moreover, he opened the door just enough\n\nto reveal his face, exposing nothing inside the room.     He did not\n\nrelinquish his and Robert Champagne's reasonable expectation of\n\nresidential privacy.      Thus, when the police ordered Beaudoin to\n\nstep outside, he was not in a place where Terry's reasonable\n\nsuspicion analysis would apply in lieu of the probable cause basis\n\nrequired for a search or seizure within a private residence.\n\nBecause Beaudoin did not voluntarily step outside of the motel room\n\nor voluntarily expose the room to public view, Payton's heightened\n\nprotections for private residences apply in this case.\n\n                               II.\n          Fourth Amendment Doctrines and the Majority's\n                Exigency/Emergency/Terry Approach\n\n     As noted above, the majority does not uphold the warrantless\n\nseizure of Beaudoin based on the presence of exigent circumstances\n\nplus probable cause nor does it affirm the district court's denial\n\nof the motion to suppress under the emergency exception doctrine.\n\nIt also does not adopt the alternative argument advanced below by\n\nthe government that the order to Beaudoin did not take place within\n\nBeaudoin's private residence and thus constituted a Terry stop that\n\nwas justified solely on the ground of reasonable suspicion of\n\nunlawful activity.   Instead, the majority's analysis \"involves the\n\n\n\n     8\n      Pinardi and Chamberlain testified that Beaudoin opened the\nmain, inside door to the motel room, leaving an outer, screen door\nbetween Beaudoin and the officers. The record does not resolve the\nquestion of when the screen door was opened, or by whom.\n\n                                 -36-\n\fintersection of several Fourth Amendment doctrines, most notably,\n\nthose    of   exigent    circumstances,      emergencies,    and   Terry-type\n\ntemporary detentions during investigation.\"          Under this analysis,\n\n\"the issue is whether the command [to Beaudoin] was justified under\n\nthe combination of the three doctrines.\"              This combination of\n\nFourth Amendment doctrines is an innovation.          To my knowledge, no\n\nother court has combined the traditional exigent circumstances\n\ndoctrine, the emergency exception doctrine, and the Terry doctrine\n\nto justify a residential search or seizure.           The outcome of this\n\nunusual mix is an analysis that is, in my view, at odds with each\n\nof the doctrines it purports to adopt.\n\nA.   The Terry Doctrine\n\n     The majority's emergency/exigency/Terry approach removes the\n\nTerry doctrine from its constitutional moorings and extends the\n\ndoctrine to the seizure of a person from his private residence.\n\nFirst, the majority suggests that the Terry doctrine applies to the\n\npolice   officers'      order   to   Beaudoin   because     Beaudoin   stopped\n\nvoluntarily when he opened the curtain to his motel room and\n\nanswered the knock at his door.        Thus, the majority claims that the\n\ncircumstances that culminated in the order to Beaudoin to exit his\n\nmotel room were like \"a situation in which a person voluntarily\n\nstops, and then the police take reasonable steps, during that\n\ntemporary stop to protect themselves during the questioning.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f      Although the majority is correct that once a Terry stop has\n\noccurred, \"an officer may search a person for weapons based on\n\nreasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous,\" the\n\nvoluntary actions that the majority describes do not constitute the\n\ninvoluntary, investigative Terry stop (the seizure) that is the\n\npremise of the Terry analysis.        Indeed, the so-called voluntary\n\n\"stop\" of Beaudoin within the motel room seems to be offered as a\n\nsubstitute for the involuntary Terry seizure, which would require\n\nreasonable suspicion that Beaudoin had committed, was committing,\n\nor was about to commit a crime.\n\n      More   importantly,   the   majority's   analysis   overlooks   the\n\ncritical fact that Beaduoin was inside his motel room when he\n\nlooked out the window and responded to the officers' knock by\n\nopening the door to his motel room just far enough to reveal his\n\nface.   This situation differs in constitutionally significant ways\n\nfrom a situation in which police officers conduct a voluntary stop\n\nof an individual in a public setting.        In order to place Beaudoin\n\nin a situation where Terry's reasonable suspicion standard might\n\napply, the officers had to order him to exit his room.        Terry did\n\nnot justify that command because Terry does not apply to seizures\n\nof   individuals   from   their   private   residences.    Although   the\n\nmajority observes that \"[w]hen the officer suspects a crime of\n\nviolence, the same information that will support an investigatory\n\n\n\n\n                                   -38-\n\fstop will without more support a protective search,\" it is the\n\nstop, not the protective search, that is at issue in this case.\n\n      The majority's blend of Fourth Amendment doctrines overlooks\n\nthe   importance   of   place      in   determining   whether   a    minimally\n\nintrusive   seizure     can   be   justified   under   Terry's      reasonable\n\nsuspicion standard.     The majority cautions that this case does not\n\npresent \"any abstract issue . . . about the application of Terry to\n\npersons in doorways absent the emergency and exigent circumstances\n\npresent here.\"9    Yet Terry's applicability to the order to Beaudoin\n\ndoes not turn on the presence or absence of exigent circumstances\n\nbut on the physical location of Beaudoin and the police officers at\n\nthe time of the seizure. Terry itself distinguished police conduct\n\n\"predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of an officer on the\n\nbeat — which historically has not been and as a practical matter\n\ncould not be, subject to the warrant procedure\" from \"conduct\n\nsubject to the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.\" Terry, 392\n\n\n      9\n      While the majority acknowledges that \"[s]ome courts have\nfound that Terry does not justify intrusions into the home,\" it\ninsists that \"[t]his issue is not before us — the issue, as\ndescribed below, does not arise from an intrusion into the home or\nmotel room.\" However, insofar as Beaudoin was positioned on the\nresidential side of Payton's firm line at the time that he opened\nthe inner door of his motel room, the officers' seizure of his\nperson was subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement,\nand the Terry doctrine did not apply. See, e.g., United States v.\nWinsor, 846 F.2d 1569, 1577-78 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that\nTerry's reasonable suspicion standard could not justify a\nconstructive search that was conducted as police officers peered\nthrough the doorway into the defendant's home); Saari, 272 F.3d at\n809 (holding that Terry did not apply where police officers ordered\nthe defendant to exit his home).\n\n                                        -39-\n\fU.S. at 20.     Terry dealt with the former category of conduct and\n\ndid not require exigent circumstances or probable cause to justify\n\nthe warrantless seizure — because a warrant was not required in the\n\nfirst place.       By contrast, if the situation in Terry involved\n\nconduct subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the\n\nCourt \"would have [had] to ascertain whether 'probable cause'\n\nexisted to justify the search and seizure which took place.\"                Id.\n\n       Thus,   the    majority's       incorporation    of   Terry   into    an\n\nexigency/emergency analysis overlooks the constitutional difference\n\nbetween police conduct in the home and police conduct outside it.10\n\nThis    approach     represents    a   significant     departure   from   well-\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment doctrine, under which residential\n\nseizures must be supported by a warrant or exigent circumstances\n\nand probable cause, whereas seizures short of arrest that are\n\nconducted outside of the home do not require a warrant and may be\n\njustified under Terry's reasonable suspicion standard. The command\n\nto Beaudoin to exit his motel room constituted a seizure of\n\nBeaudoin from his private residence.              It was an intrusion of\n\n       10\n       Although the majority assumes, arguendo, that the order to\nBeaudoin was a seizure of his person, it suggests that the order\nmay not have been a seizure after all, inviting us to \"[c]onsider,\nfor example, if Beaudoin had left the doorway, and the officer\nsimply instructed Beaudoin to step closer to him.\" This example\nagain misapprehends the significance of place.         Whether the\nofficers' directive was a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes\nturns on the nature of the order, not the location of Beaudoin. On\nthe other hand, Beaudoin's location is relevant in determining\nwhether that order was a residential seizure that implicated the\nFourth Amendment's warrant requirement or whether it was a\nnonresidential seizure equivalent to an on-the-beat Terry stop.\n\n                                       -40-\n\fsignificant import that required a search warrant or exigent\n\ncircumstances plus probable cause.               Therefore, Payton, not Terry,\n\napplies in this case.\n\nB.   The Exigent Circumstances and Emergency Doctrines\n\n      Just as the majority's approach is inconsistent with the Terry\n\ndoctrine, so too it cannot be reconciled with the traditional\n\nexigent circumstances doctrine or the emergency exception doctrine.\n\n      1.    The Exigent Circumstances Doctrine\n\n      Under      a   traditional       Fourth     Amendment    analysis,      exigent\n\ncircumstances        present     an    exception    to   the   Fourth    Amendment's\n\nwarrant requirement for residential searches and seizures. Exigent\n\ncircumstances involve a \"compelling necessity for immediate action\n\nas w[ould] not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.\"                        United\n\nStates v. Wilson, 36 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir. 1994)(quoting United\n\nStates     v.    Adams,    621    F.2d     41,     44    (1980)).       The   exigent\n\ncircumstances        analysis     is    necessarily       fact-intensive      and   is\n\n\"limited        to   the   objective      facts     reasonably      known     to,   or\n\ndiscoverable by, the officers at the time of the search.\"                     Tibolt,\n\n72 F.3d at 969.       As the majority notes, this circuit has recognized\n\nthat exigent circumstances may exist where a suspect poses a threat\n\n\"to the lives or safety of the public, the police officers, or to\n\nherself.\"       Hegarty v. Somerset Cty., 53 F.3d 1367, 1375 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -41-\n\f      Yet exigent circumstances alone cannot excuse the Fourth\n\nAmendment's      warrant   requirement   for       residential        searches   and\n\nseizures.    While the majority is correct that a risk to the safety\n\nof the public or the police may rise to the level of an exigent\n\ncircumstance, our case law is clear that this exigency justifies a\n\nwarrantless residential search or seizure only where it is also\n\nsupported by probable cause. See, e.g., United States v. Bartelho,\n\n71 F.3d 426 F.3d 442 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Lopez, 989\n\nF.2d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1993).             Thus, the traditional exigent\n\ncircumstances doctrine requires two separate elements. The exigent\n\ncircumstance element focuses on circumstances that are incident to\n\nthe   criminal      investigation,   such     as    a     risk   of   flight,    the\n\ndestruction of evidence, or a risk to police officer safety.                     The\n\nprobable    cause    element   focuses   on    the      suspicion      of   criminal\n\nactivity, which must amount to probable cause to believe that a\n\ncrime has been or is being committed.              In the absence of a valid\n\nsearch warrant or consent, both elements must be present in order\n\nto justify a search or seizure within a private residence.\n\n      2.    The Emergency Exception Doctrine\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized that some emergencies may\n\nobviate the need to obtain a warrant prior to entering a private\n\nresidence,       Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978), and\n\nnumerous state and federal courts have upheld emergency entries and\n\nsearches    of   private   residences    based       on    the   need    to   render\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\femergency aid. See United States v. Holloway, 290 F.3d 1331, 1336-\n\n37 (11th Cir. 2002) (collecting cases).                         In contrast to the\n\ntraditional      exigent   circumstance         case,      in   which   the     exigency\n\npresents itself in the course of a criminal investigation and\n\nrequires probable cause of criminal activity, a search or seizure\n\nthat falls under the emergency exception doctrine may be only\n\nincidentally      connected       to   unlawful      acts.         Police       officers\n\nresponding to emergency situations are responding to the need to\n\nlocate and provide assistance to a person whose life may hang in\n\nthe balance      rather    than    the    search     for    evidence       of   criminal\n\nactivity.\n\n     As    the   Fourth    Circuit       has    explained,       \"[t]his    particular\n\nexigency    is    expressed       as   one      of   [a]    reasonably          perceived\n\n'emergency' requiring immediate entry as an incident to the service\n\nand protective functions of the police as opposed to, or as a\n\ncomplement to, their law enforcement functions.\"                   United States v.\n\nMoss, 963 F.2d 673, 678 (4th Cir. 1992).                A Fourth Amendment issue\n\narises in these emergency exception cases only when someone becomes\n\nthe subject of a search or seizure within the protected area,\n\nusually because the police discover evidence of criminal activity\n\nwhile searching for the individual believed to be in need of aid.11\n\n\n     11\n      The emergency exception doctrine must be distinguished from\nthe \"special needs\" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant and\nprobable cause requirements. The latter exception provides that \"a\nresidential search pursuant to an established warrantless search\nprocedure, may be reasonable if conducted in furtherance of an\n\n                                         -43-\n\fIn such cases, the reasonableness of the search or seizure does not\n\ndepend on the existence of probable cause to believe that criminal\n\nactivity      had   been   or    was   being    committed.     Indeed,       the   law\n\nenforcement officers initially may not be aware of any connection\n\nbetween the emergency and a crime.              Instead, the reasonableness of\n\nthe intrusive action under the emergency doctrine depends on the\n\nobjective probability that someone's life or safety is in danger\n\nwithin a setting protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n\n       Thus, the emergency exception suggested by Mincey, and adopted\n\nin various forms by state and federal courts, does not dispense\n\nwith   the    Fourth   Amendment's       probable     cause   requirement.         In\n\napplying the emergency doctrine, other circuits have found that the\n\nFourth Amendment requires a standard of suspicion approximating\n\nprobable cause to justify a warrantless search or seizure in a\n\nprivate residence under the emergency exception doctrine.                      While\n\nthe phrasing of the applicable standard varies, I agree with the\n\nSecond Circuit that probable cause exists in the emergency context\n\nwhere there exists a probability that an individual's life or\n\nsafety   is    in   danger      within   an    area   protected   by   the    Fourth\n\n\n\nimportant administrative or regulatory purpose, or 'special need,'\nwhich would be undermined systematically by an impracticable\nwarrant or probable-cause requirement.\" McCabe v. Life-Line\nAmbulance Serv., Inc., 77 F.3d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1996)(emphasis in\nthe original)(applying the exception to a municipal policy allowing\nwarrantless entries into private residences for the purpose of\nexecuting involuntary commitment papers).\n\n\n                                         -44-\n\fAmendment.    See Koch v. Town of Brattleboro, 287 F.3d 162, 169 (2d\n\nCir. 2002) (probable cause under the emergency doctrine requires \"a\n\nprobability that a person is in danger\").          Courts that have found\n\nthat the emergency doctrine requires a \"reasonable belief\" or a\n\n\"reasonable basis for believing\" that someone is in danger have\n\nalso essentially     applied   a   probable    cause     test.   See,   e.g.,\n\nHolloway, 290 F.3d at 1338 (\"[I]n an emergency, the probable cause\n\nelement may be satisfied where officers reasonably believe a person\n\nis in danger.\"); 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure § 6.6(a), at 393\n\n(\"There must be some reasonable basis, approximating probable\n\ncause, to associate the emergency with the area or place to be\n\nsearched.\")(quoting People v. Mitchell, 39 N.Y.2d 173, 177-78\n\n(1976)).\n\n     Whether articulated as a reasonable belief or a probability,\n\nthe probable cause element of the emergency doctrine requires the\n\nsame heightened standard that applies to other warrantless searches\n\nand seizures in a private residence where the object of the search\n\nand seizure is criminal activity.          However, under the emergency\n\ndoctrine,    the   separate   elements    of   exigent    circumstances   and\n\nprobable cause come together.       In other words, probable cause in\n\nthe emergency context focuses on the threat to an individual's life\n\nor safety – that is, on the exigency itself.           Unless the objective\n\nbasis for suspicion of an emergency rises to the level of probable\n\n\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fcause, a warrantless residential search or seizure violates the\n\nFourth Amendment.\n\n     3.     The Majority's Approach\n\n     The majority never claims that the anonymous call reporting a\n\nfailed drug deal and possible dead body, and the light inside of\n\nthe defendants' motel room, provided an adequate basis for a\n\nwarrantless entry into the room under the traditional exigent\n\ncircumstances doctrine or the emergency exception doctrine.      At\n\nmost, the majority's analysis suggests that the facts known to the\n\nofficers relating to the possible emergency and crime justified\n\ntheir decision to approach the defendants' motel room and knock on\n\nthe door.    I agree with that proposition.\n\n     However, Beaudoin had no obligation to open that door, even in\n\nresponse to a knock and request of the police.         Because the\n\nofficers did not have a warrant, Beaudoin could have simply told\n\nthem to go away.      In that case, the officers would have been\n\nrequired to explore other investigative options until they could\n\ndevelop sufficient probable cause to support a search warrant.\n\n     Yet Beaudoin responded to the officers' knock by opening the\n\ninner door to his motel room, revealing only his face.     At that\n\ncritical moment, the majority introduces the exigent circumstance\n\nof the risk to the officers' safety.    According to the majority,\n\nthe police officers had a reasonable basis to believe that their\n\nsafety was at risk based on the information provided by the\n\n\n                                -46-\n\fanonymous call,12 the sounds that they heard inside of the room, and\n\nthe way that Beaudoin opened the door.   As the majority explains:\n\n\"[t]he partially opened doorway to the small motel room was not a\n\nsafe place for the police to investigate whether [Beaudoin] was\n\narmed, in this situation.\"13 Therefore, it concludes that \"balanced\n\nagainst the objective safety concerns of the officers here, and in\n\nlight of the call about an emergency, it was reasonable\" to order\n\nBeaudoin to step outside of his motel room.\n\n     I do not doubt that an officer investigating reports of drug\n\nactivity and a possible dead body in a motel room has valid\n\ngrounds for concern about his or her personal safety in standing\n\noutside of that room under the circumstances presented here.\n\nHowever, the officers could have addressed their concerns for\n\npersonal safety by withdrawing from the area around the motel room\n\ndoor in any one of several directions.   The door was adjacent to a\n\n\n     12\n       The majority points out that Officer Pinardi testified that\nhe believed the call had reported a shooting, as well as a drug\ndeal gone bad and a possible dead body. However, the source of\nthat belief is unclear, and it conflicts with the transcript of the\ncall, which said nothing about a shooting, as well as the testimony\nof Sergeant Chamberlain, who said nothing about a shooting.\n\n     13\n      In fact, as noted in footnote 3, supra, Beaudoin initially\nopened the interior door of the room. The record leaves unclear\nwhether he had pushed open the outer, screen door at the time that\nthe police commanded him from the room.\n\n\n\n\n                               -47-\n\flit walkway that flanked a circular driveway where the police\n\nofficers had parked their car in view of the defendants' room.             The\n\npolice did not have to turn their backs to Beaudoin or end their\n\nvigilance as they retreated from the area in front of the door.\n\nWhile courts are appropriately reluctant to tell police officers\n\nhow to carry out their investigatory responsibilities, officers\n\nmust    make     investigative     choices   within    the   limits   of   the\n\nConstitution.        A decision by the Hooksett police officers to\n\nwithdraw from the area around Beaudoin's door would not mean an\n\nabandonment of their investigation of the anonymous call.                  They\n\ncould have pursued a number of alternative options, including\n\nstaking out the scene,14 questioning other motel residents, or\n\ncalling Beaudoin's room in an effort to win his consent to a\n\nvoluntary departure from that room.          What the police could not do,\n\nhowever, was use their continued presence outside the motel room\n\ndoor        as   a   basis   for    disregarding      the    well-established\n\nconstitutional prohibition against entering a private residence\n\nwithout a combination of probable cause to believe that criminal\n\nactivity was occurring within and exigent circumstances or, in a\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      Sergeant Chamberlain recognized the availability of other\nalternatives, testifying that if the call had reported a drug deal\ngone bad but not a dead body, the officers would not have ordered\nBeaudoin to step outside when he guardedly opened the door but\nwould have \"put a perimeter up outside the place and tried to\ndevelop enough probable cause to at least get a search warrant, and\n[] would also have at that point called for more help.\"\n\n                                      -48-\n\fpure emergency situation, probable cause to believe that somebody's\n\nlife or safety is in danger within the private residence.\n\n     Implicit in the majority's analysis is the notion that the\n\nofficers' belief that someone was injured or dying inside of the\n\nroom justified their continued presence outside of the doorway and,\n\nafter concerns    arose   for   their    own    safety,   their   seizure   of\n\nBeaudoin.   In other words, the police could not have been required\n\nto abandon their position in front of the motel room door because\n\nthey were in the process of investigating a reported emergency.\n\nHowever, the only basis for the officers' belief that someone might\n\nbe in danger inside the room was an anonymous, uncorroborated 911\n\ncall devoid of any details (other than the room number) that did\n\nnot provide sufficiently reasonable grounds to believe that an\n\nemergency existed.     Nor was the officers' belief in a possible\n\nemergency rendered any more reasonable by their concerns for their\n\nown safety or by the fact that they ordered Beaudoin to step\n\noutside of his motel room rather than physically entering the room\n\nthemselves.    In essence, when the majority's amalgam of doctrines\n\nand its language of reasonableness are probed, it concludes that an\n\nanonymous, uncorroborated call trumps the strong Fourth Amendment\n\nrule that the police may not enter a private residence without\n\nprobable cause to do so.             This proposition represents a new\n\nexception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant and probable cause\n\nrequirements   that   cannot    be    squared   with   traditional   exigent\n\n\n                                     -49-\n\fcircumstances      analysis   or    the    emergency         exception      doctrine.\n\nBecause the officers in this case had no probable cause basis for\n\nbelieving that there was criminal activity or an emergency inside\n\nthe defendants' room, I would hold that their decision to order\n\nBeaudoin from his motel room violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n                                 III.\n         Fourth Amendment Analysis of the Seizure of Beaudoin\n\nA.   Traditional Fourth Amendment Analysis\n\n        Although the district court did not decide this case on\n\ntraditional Fourth Amendment grounds, it stated at the suppression\n\nhearing that \"the ordinary exigent circumstances exception, when\n\nyou're trying to seek evidence of a crime rather than trying to\n\ndetermine     if   somebody   in    need     of    assistance       can     get     that\n\nassistance,    requires    probable       cause.       And    I   agree     [with    the\n\ndefendants] that in these circumstances, there is not probable\n\ncause present.\"      Because the majority affirms the decision of the\n\ndistrict court under its exigency/emergency/Terry analysis, it does\n\nnot consider whether the seizure of Beaudoin was justified by\n\nprobable cause of criminal activity.              I suspect, however, that the\n\nmajority would agree with the district court, as do I, that the\n\nseizure of Beaudoin was not justified by probable cause of criminal\n\nactivity,     notwithstanding        the      presence         of     any     exigent\n\ncircumstances.\n\n     As noted in Part I, for Fourth Amendment purposes, probable\n\ncause    exists    where   \"the    officers       at   the    scene    collectively\n\n                                      -50-\n\fpossessed reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to warrant\n\na prudent policeman in believing that a criminal offense had been\n\nor was being committed.\"        Tibolt, 72 F.3d at 969.         The probable\n\ncause   standard   is   a    fact-specific   concept    that    \"deals   with\n\nprobabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances.\"\n\nMaryland v. Pringle, 124 S. Ct. 795, 800 (2003); see Valente v.\n\nWallace, 332 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that whether the\n\nrequisite probability must be \"'more likely than not' [is] . . .\n\narguably unsettled; but, centrally, the mercurial phrase 'probable\n\ncause' means a reasonable likelihood\").         Like the less demanding\n\nstandard of reasonable suspicion, probable cause is \"dependant upon\n\nboth the content of information possessed by the police and its\n\ndegree of reliability.       Both factors – quantity and quality – are\n\nconsidered in the 'totality of the circumstances' – the whole\n\npicture – that must be taken into account\" when evaluating whether\n\na search or seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion or by\n\nprobable cause.    Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 330 (1990).               Of\n\ncourse, probable cause is a more demanding standard than reasonable\n\nsuspicion, both in terms of the detail of information and the\n\ndegree of reliability required.       See id.\n\n     An anonymous tip \"seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of\n\nknowledge   or   veracity\"    and   typically   fails   to     give   rise   to\n\nreasonable suspicion, let alone probable cause. Id. at 329 (finding\n\nthat a detailed anonymous tip that a woman was carrying cocaine and\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fpredicting    that   she    would    leave   an   apartment    building    at   a\n\nspecified time, enter a car of a specified description, and drive\n\nto a specified motel would not, without further corroboration, have\n\njustified a Terry stop based on reasonable suspicion); see Florida\n\nv. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 271 (2000) (holding that an anonymous 911\n\ncall lacked sufficient indicia of reliability for a showing of\n\nreasonable suspicion where the caller reported that a young man\n\nstanding at a particular bus stop wearing a plaid shirt was\n\ncarrying a gun).     The anonymous 911 call to the Manchester police\n\nreporting a dead body and failed drug deal in a particular room at\n\na particular motel did not provide anything approaching the degree\n\nof detail and specificity that might have supported the veracity of\n\nthe information.      See Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 288 (noting that\n\n\"there may be cases where an informant provides such a wealth of\n\ndetail, with such a high degree of specificity that it is unlikely\n\nthat the informant is inventing these assertions, and his veracity\n\nis    supported   through    the    very   specificity   and   detail     of   his\n\nstatement\").      The caller did not describe who was involved in the\n\nalleged events, when these events took place, how the alleged death\n\noccurred, how many people could be found inside the motel room, or\n\nhow he knew about the information he proffered.                In essence, the\n\ncall consisted of a \"bare report of an unknown, unaccountable\n\ninformant\" who provided little detail or predictive information and\n\ndid    not   \"suppl[y]      any    basis   for    believing    he   had   inside\n\n\n                                      -52-\n\finformation\" about the defendants or the alleged events at the Kozy\n\n7 motel.    See J.L., 529 U.S. at 271.\n\n       It is true that an anonymous tip with predictive detail that\n\nis then supported by corroborating facts may demonstrate sufficient\n\nreliability to give rise to a reasonable suspicion or, potentially,\n\nprobable cause, of criminal activity.          See J.L., 529 U.S. at 270;\n\nWood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922 (1st Cir. 1996).             However, there was\n\nprecious little detail or corroboration at the time that the\n\nHooksett police officers knocked on the defendants' motel room door\n\nand ordered Beaudoin to step outside.               Arriving at the motel at\n\nabout 5:30 a.m., the officers observed that a light was on inside\n\nRoom 10, in contrast to the other darkened rooms of the motel.\n\nSergeant       Chamberlain    noticed    movement     inside    the   room    and\n\nsubsequently observed Beaudoin pull back the curtain and look\n\noutside in response to the officers' knock on the door.                      When\n\nBeaudoin opened the door at the request or instruction of the\n\nofficers, he did so only far enough to reveal his face.\n\n       I do not find it out of the ordinary that two individuals\n\nwould be awake at 5:30 a.m. on a July morning when the sun had\n\nalready begun to rise.             As Officer Pinardi acknowledged at the\n\nsuppression hearing, it was \"not very dark in July\" at that time of\n\nmorning.    Nor do I think that Beaudoin's decision to look outside\n\nthe window before answering an early morning knock on his motel\n\nroom    door    provides     any    corroboration    of   the   anonymous     and\n\n\n                                        -53-\n\funidentified tip alleging a homicide or drug deal.           As noted, he\n\nhad no obligation to open the door at all.             His hesitancy to\n\nvoluntarily expose himself and the room to full public view when\n\nopening the door in response to a request from police officers\n\nvisible in their uniforms could provide some indication of a guilty\n\nconscience.     On the other hand, it could suggest a reasonable\n\nconcern for safety, or for modesty, when strangers, even uniformed\n\nones, unexpectedly knock on one's motel room door in the early\n\nhours of the morning.      In any event, considered        together, these\n\nfacts were insufficient to corroborate an anonymous call devoid of\n\ndetails   and   to   provide   sufficient   indicia   of   reliability   to\n\n\"warrant a prudent policeman in believing\" that Beaudoin and\n\nChampagne had committed or were committing an offense inside the\n\nmotel room.     Tibolt, 72 F.3d at 969; see J.L., 529 U.S. at 271\n\n(holding that anonymous call alleging unlawful carriage of gun was\n\nnot sufficiently corroborated by police observation of suspect\n\nmatching the description and standing at the location reported by\n\nthe caller to establish reasonable suspicion justifying a Terry\n\ninvestigative stop of that individual). Hence, under a traditional\n\nFourth Amendment analysis relating to the investigation of criminal\n\nactivity, there was no probable cause basis for ordering Beaudoin\n\nto leave his room.\n\nB.   Emergency Exception Doctrine\n\n     The question here is whether the Hooksett police officers\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\flawfully ordered Beaudoin to step outside of his motel room under\n\nan emergency doctrine that incorporates the Fourth Amendment's\n\nrequirements for warrantless residential searches and seizures. In\n\naddressing this question, I consider whether there existed an\n\nobjective probability that an individual's life or safety was in\n\ndanger inside the motel room at the time that the officers ordered\n\nBeaudoin to step outside — in other words, whether the risk of an\n\nemergency rose to the level of probable cause.\n\n       The   government     claims   that   emergency    circumstances     were\n\ncreated by the anonymous 911 call that reported a possible dead\n\nbody   inside   a   motel    room.     As   several     circuit   courts   have\n\nrecognized, 911 calls are among the most frequent and widely\n\nrecognized means of reporting emergencies.              See, e.g., Holloway,\n\n290 F.3d at 1339 (\"Not surprisingly, 911 calls are the predominant\n\nmeans of communicating emergency situations.\"); United States v.\n\nRichardson, 208 F.3d 626, 630 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"A 911 call is one\n\nof the most common — and universally recognized — means through\n\nwhich police and other emergency personnel learn that there is\n\nsomeone in a dangerous situation who urgently needs help.\").               When\n\nconfronted with an emergency situation, police officers generally\n\nmust act swiftly to investigate and respond to information that\n\nsomeone may be in need of urgent assistance.\n\n       Although a homicide scene does not automatically present an\n\nexigent circumstance that justifies a warrantless search, see\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\fMincey, 437 U.S. at 393-94,15 a 911 report of a dead body may in\n\nsome circumstances create a reasonable assumption that the reported\n\nvictim    might   be    alive   and     in    need   of   immediate     aid.   See\n\nRichardson, 208 F.3d at 631 (concluding that \"it was objectively\n\nreasonable    for      the   officers    to    conclude    that   the    situation\n\npresented exigent circumstances\" based on a 911 report that a woman\n\nhad been raped and murdered in an apartment). As then-Judge Burger\n\nexplained in Wayne v. United States:\n\n     [A] warrant is not required to break down a door to enter\n     a burning home to rescue occupants or extinguish a fire,\n     to prevent a shooting or to bring emergency aid to an\n     injured person. The need to protect or preserve life or\n     avoid serious injury is justification for what would be\n     otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency. . . .\n     [T]he business of policemen and firemen is to act, not to\n     speculate or meditate on whether the report is correct.\n     People could well die in emergencies if the police tried\n     to act with the calm deliberation associated with the\n     judicial process.   Even the apparently dead often are\n     saved by swift police response.\n\n318 F.2d 205, 212 (D.C. Cir. 1963)(dicta).                In this case, the 911\n\ncall suggested that someone may have been killed as the result of\n\na drug deal.        I agree with the district court that a 911 call\n\nreporting a potential victim of a drug-related homicide may present\n\nan exigency that compels immediate action and justifies forgoing\n\nthe delay of obtaining a warrant.\n\n\n     15\n      In Mincey, the Supreme Court found that a four-day search of\nan apartment after the victims of a shooting had been found\nviolated the Fourth Amendment, explaining that \"the warrantless\nsearch of [the defendant's] apartment was not constitutionally\npermissible simply because a homicide had occurred there.\" Id. at\n395.\n\n                                        -56-\n\f     The   analysis      does   not   end     there,   however.        Again,   the\n\ngovernment       must   establish     that    the    suspicion    of    emergency\n\ncircumstances rises to the level of probable cause in order to\n\nvalidate     a   warrantless    search       or   seizure   within     a   private\n\nresidence.       The district court concluded that the anonymous 911\n\ncall that reported a dead body inside Room 10 of the Kozy 7 Motel\n\n\"provided both reasonable grounds for effectuating a warrantless\n\nattempted rescue of the putative victim and a reasonable basis for\n\ndoing so within the room specified.\"              The majority apparently does\n\nnot agree with that conclusion, nor do I.\n\n     The relevant facts on this issue are not in dispute.                       The\n\ngovernment agrees that the anonymous 911 call alleging a \"drug deal\n\ngone bad\" and possible dead body provided the basis for the police\n\nofficers' seizure of Beaudoin.          The officers acknowledge that they\n\ndid not know the identity of the caller or the origin of the call.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record suggesting that the officers\n\ntried to trace the call or conducted any other investigation to\n\ncorroborate the information that they received or the identity of\n\nthe caller prior to appearing at the defendants' door.\n\n     The concerns with anonymous and uncorroborated tips expressed\n\nby the Supreme Court in J.L. under a traditional Fourth Amendment\n\nanalysis are also relevant in the emergency context.                   It is true\n\nthat the J.L. Court recognized that certain emergency situations\n\nmight justify a reduced showing of reliability regarding anonymous\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\ftips, explaining that \"[w]e do not say, for example, that a report\n\nof a person carrying a bomb need bear the indicia of reliability we\n\ndemand for a person carrying a firearm before the police can\n\nconstitutionally    conduct    a    frisk.\"   529   U.S.    at   273-74.   I\n\nrecognize that unusually severe and time-sensitive emergencies,\n\nsuch as the report of a bomb, may validate a protective, on-the-\n\nstreet, stop and frisk, even without a showing of reliability.\n\nSuch an emergency might also justify a search or seizure within a\n\nprivate     residence     without    a   showing    of     probable   cause,\n\nnotwithstanding the heightened privacy interest at stake in such\n\ncases.     However, an anonymous call alleging a possible dead body\n\ninside a motel room does not present the same kind of clear and\n\nimmediate threat of harm as a report alleging that a person is\n\ncarrying a bomb.    J.L. does not stand for the proposition that an\n\nanonymous report of a dead body inside a private residence obviates\n\nthe need to verify the reliability of the caller or the call.\n\n     As in J.L., the caller in this case \"provided no predictive\n\ninformation and therefore left the police without means to test the\n\ninformant's knowledge or credibility.\"        See J.L., 529 U.S. at 271.\n\nSuch a call presents a troubling possibility that someone may have\n\nplaced the call in order to \"harass another [by] set[ting] in\n\nmotion an intrusive, embarrassing police search of the targeted\n\nperson.\"    Id. at 272.    Indeed, Beaudoin and Champagne were set up\n\n\n\n\n                                     -58-\n\fby somebody who concocted a phony story about an emergency.16 There\n\nwas no dead body inside Room 10 of the Kozy 7 Motel.             Instead, an\n\nunknown person placed an anonymous and unreliable call reporting an\n\nemergency that did not exist.\n\n      While   several   circuit     courts   have   applied   the   emergency\n\ndoctrine to uphold a warrantless search or seizure in a private\n\nresidence based on a 911 emergency call, in each case the call at\n\nissue was more reliable than the call in this case.           In some cases,\n\nthe caller was not anonymous.          See Richardson, 208 F.3d at 628\n\n(caller identified himself by name and explained that he lived at\n\nthe   same    address   as   the   alleged   murder);   United      States   v.\n\nCunningham, 133 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir. 1998) (caller identified\n\nherself).     In another case, the address from which the call was\n\nplaced was verified by caller identification, and the caller\n\ndescribed an immediate and deadly threat of harm to which she\n\nherself was being exposed.         Anthony v. City of New York, 339 F.3d\n\n129, 136 (2d Cir. 2003).       In still other cases, the police found\n\ncorroborating evidence of an emergency when they arrived at the\n\nreported location.      See United States v. Jenkins, 329 F.3d 579,\n\n580-81 (7th Cir. 2003) (caller identified herself and called from\n\n\n\n      16\n      This observation does not suggest any sympathy for the plight\nof the defendants. They were obviously up to no good. However,\ntheir culpable conduct is not at issue here. The fact that they\nwere set up simply illustrates the reliability problems that are\npresented by anonymous and uncorroborated tips that become the\nbasis for intrusive police actions.\n\n                                     -59-\n\fthe location of the alleged assault, and when police officer\n\narrived at that location, he observed that the front door was open\n\nand   heard    sounds   of    someone     standing   up   and   falling   down);\n\nHolloway, 290 F.3d at 1332-33 (when investigating anonymous report\n\nof a violent domestic dispute and gun shots inside a home, police\n\nofficers discovered individuals on the porch, a shotgun against the\n\nhouse, and several expended and one live shotgun shells on the\n\npicnic table and lawn).        In none of these cases did the police rely\n\nupon an anonymous and uncorroborated emergency call to justify a\n\nwarrantless search or seizure in a private residence.                See Kerman,\n\n261 F.3d at 238 (finding that search violated the Fourth Amendment\n\nwhere it was based on an anonymous and unverified 911 call).\n\n        The   government     did   not   present   the    district   court   with\n\nevidence that the Manchester or Hooksett police had any additional,\n\nobjective reason to believe in the reliability of the caller.                 See\n\nJ.L., 529 U.S. at 276 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting that\n\ninstant caller identification and voice recordings of telephone\n\ncalls may lend reliability to an otherwise unreliable anonymous\n\ntip).     When the police arrived at the motel, they discovered no\n\ncommotion, no sign of a disturbance, nothing to indicate that a\n\nperson had been shot or killed or was in need of emergency\n\nassistance.      They did not look for a manager or others on the\n\npremises to ask if they had heard any disturbance in or around Room\n\n10.      Instead, the police seized Beaudoin on the basis of an\n\n\n                                         -60-\n\fanonymous call and evidence of someone awake inside the reported\n\nlocation at 5:30 a.m. and movement inside the room.       These meager\n\nobservations   did   not   provide   sufficient   corroboration   of   an\n\nanonymous and unidentified call from an unknown location reporting\n\na possible dead body at that address to establish probable cause of\n\na danger to the life or safety of someone inside the motel room.\n\nTherefore, when the Hooksett police ordered Beaudoin to step\n\noutside of his motel room, they violated his Fourth Amendment right\n\nto be free from unreasonable seizures and triggered subsequent\n\nsearches and seizures of Beaudoin, Champagne, and the room that\n\ncannot escape the taint of this original violation.17\n\n                                  IV.\n                              Conclusion\n\n     The seizure of Beaudoin was not supported by probable cause of\n\ncriminal activity or probable cause of a danger to human life or\n\nsafety. Indeed, it is questionable whether the police officers had\n\neven a reasonable suspicion that there was criminal activity in the\n\n\n     17\n        Because the initial seizure of Beaudoin was unlawful, the\ngovernment's theory of inevitable discovery as a justification for\nthe ensuing searches and seizures unravels. See Nix v. Williams,\n467 U.S. 431, 444 (1984) (holding that if the government \"can\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information\nultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means\n. . . the evidence should be received\" even if it was obtained by\nan unlawful search or seizure).        Evidence seized under the\nsubsequently executed search warrant is also inadmissible as fruit\nof the poisonous tree. See generally, Wong Sun v. United States,\n371 U.S. 471, 487-88 (1963).    It would have been impossible to\nsecure the warrant without the prior unlawful seizure of Beaudoin\nand the subsequent entry into the motel room and the seizure of\nChampagne.\n\n                                 -61-\n\froom, or an emergency involving someone's life or safety.      Yet one\n\nof the officers testified that if Beaudoin had not come out of his\n\nmotel room the police were going to go in.         That determination\n\nreflects a failure on the part of the officers to understand the\n\nconstitutional principles that circumscribe their investigative\n\nchoices.\n\n       These constitutional principles do not make the difficult and\n\nimportant job of police officers any easier.     However, they cannot\n\nbe removed from the calculus of reasonableness.     In this case, the\n\nwell-established proposition that the police cannot enter a private\n\nresidence without probable cause to do so means that the officers\n\nmade a constitutionally inappropriate choice when their concern for\n\ntheir own safety induced them, with their order to Beaudoin to\n\nleave his motel room, to cross the threshold into the protected\n\narea instead of withdrawing from the scene to continue their\n\ninvestigation in a manner that would comport with constitutional\n\nrequirements. Under both traditional Fourth Amendment analysis and\n\nthe emergency exception doctrine, the officers' conduct in this\n\ncase    violated   the   Fourth   Amendment's   proscription   against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures.      The district court's order\n\ndenying the defendants' motion to suppress should be vacated, and\n\nthe motion to suppress granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -62-\n\f",

This appeal presents interesting\n\nquestions about the application of the Fourth Amendment when an\n\nanonymous tipster informs police that there is a dead body in a\n\nmotel room.\n\n           A series of events cascaded from that tip, resulting in\n\nthe arrests of Rodger Beaudoin and Robert Champagne on various\n\ndrug-related charges and a federal prosecution for conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine and crack and for possession of crack with\n\nintent to distribute.      21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.       Before trial,\n\nthe defendants each moved to suppress all of the evidence that the\n\npolice had found in a search of them and their motel room,\n\nincluding knives, drugs, drug paraphernalia, and large amounts of\n\ncash.    After    an   evidentiary   hearing,   the   trial   court,    in   a\n\nthoughtful opinion, denied their motions.             The defendants pled\n\nguilty but preserved the right to challenge the suppression ruling\n\non appeal, which they now exercise.        Champagne also appeals from a\n\nsentence enhancement. We affirm both the denial of the suppression\n\nmotions and the sentence enhancement.\n\n                                   I.\n                            Background Facts\n\n           The facts are taken from the suppression hearing, as\n\nfound by the district judge, and supplemented from the record.\n\n           At 5:15 in the morning on July 24, 2001, the Manchester,\n\nNew   Hampshire   Police   Department      informed   the   Hookset    Police\n\nDepartment that a dispatcher had just received a 911 call during\n\n                                     -3-\n\fwhich an unidentified person reported \"a drug deal gone bad at the\n\nKozy 7 Motel, Room 10\" in Hooksett.    The caller said \"I think there\n\nis a dead body in there,\" and then hung-up before any follow-up\n\nquestions could be asked.\n\n          Three   Hooksett    officers,   Sergeant   Chamberlain   and\n\nOfficers Pinardi and Sherrill, were immediately dispatched to the\n\nmotel, about three miles away. Officer Pinardi understood that the\n\ninformation was that \"a drug deal [had] gone bad, during which a\n\nperson was allegedly shot and there was a dead body.\"        The call\n\ntranscript itself contains nothing about a shooting, but Pinardi\n\nheard the dispatcher conveying the information to Chamberlain. The\n\nmotel was not upscale and was the sort of place that police had\n\nvisited before in connection with criminal activity.\n\n          The officers arrived several minutes later. They did not\n\nattempt to see the motel manager to ask if there was any unusual\n\nactivity in the room, but instead went straight to the room that\n\nthe caller had identified.    The officers noticed that a light was\n\non in Room 10, but that all of the other rooms were dark.          The\n\ncurtain of the window to Room 10 was closed.\n\n          The uniformed officers approached the room; Officers\n\nPinardi and Sherrill took positions on either side of the doorway,\n\nwhile Sergeant Chamberlain stood farther back on the opposite side\n\nof the motel room's window.    Pinardi stood to the left of the door\n\nfor \"officer safety reasons.\" Among other things, in that position\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fhe \"would be able to see inside the room, see what was going on,\n\nand also . . . be able to get out of the way if . . . the door . .\n\n. swung open.\"    Officer Sherrill instinctively stood in front of\n\nthe door, but he moved to the right after Sergeant Chamberlain told\n\nhim to step away from the door.          Sergeant Chamberlain chose a\n\nposition to the right of the door, by the window, to get \"a little\n\nconcealment or whatever if something did happen in the room,\n\nwhether there was going to be a shoot-out or whatever.\"                He was\n\nconcerned for his own safety because of the report that there was\n\na dead body in the room.\n\n          Chamberlain, with a view of the window, saw some movement\n\nbehind the window, and the officers heard some rustling from the\n\nroom.   Pinardi   knocked   on   the    door.   A   man   (who   was    later\n\nidentified as Beaudoin) drew back the curtains of the window and\n\npeered outside toward Chamberlain.       There was sufficient light to\n\nsee the uniformed officers.      Chamberlain then identified himself\n\nand the others as Hooksett police officers and asked the man to go\n\nto the door so they could speak with him.            The man, Beaudoin,\n\nopened the door, but only wide enough so his face could be seen.\n\nBoth the interior door and an outer screen door were opened.\n\nSergeant Chamberlain could not recall if Beaudoin pushed the screen\n\ndoor entirely open, or if Beaudoin pushed the screen door part way\n\nopen and an officer held it open.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            Officers    Chamberlain    and   Pinardi   presented   slightly\n\nvarying accounts of what transpired next.          These differences prove\n\nto be immaterial.       Officer Pinardi testified that once Beaudoin\n\nopened the door, the officers explained to him that they were\n\ninvestigating a crime and had heard that someone had been shot in\n\nthe room.    Pinardi said that he then asked Beaudoin if he could\n\n\"just come out here\" so the police could talk to him and that\n\nBeaudoin    did   so   voluntarily.     Sergeant    Chamberlain,   however,\n\ntestified that he asked Beaudoin to step outside so they could talk\n\nto him, which Beaudoin did, and only then explained why the police\n\nwere there. Either way, Beaudoin stepped outside, leaving the door\n\nbehind him sufficiently open so that Pinardi could see inside the\n\nroom.   Whether Beaudoin felt free not to step outside is an open\n\nquestion.\n\n            Once Beaudoin was outside, Sergeant Chamberlain asked him\n\nif he was carrying any weapons.        Beaudoin said that he had a knife\n\nin his left rear pocket and started to reach for it.               Sergeant\n\nChamberlain said that he would remove the knife, ordered Beaudoin\n\nto put his hands on the wall, and proceeded to pat him down.\n\nDuring the pat down, Sergeant Chamberlain patted Beaudoin's left\n\nrear pocket and felt three objects:          an object that seemed to be a\n\nknife and two long and hard cylindrical objects that he was unable\n\nto identify.      Chamberlain reached into the pocket and removed a\n\nknife, two glass tubes, and three plastic balls containing crack\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcocaine.    The glass tubes and crack cocaine were contained in one\n\nplastic bag. Chamberlain placed Beaudoin under arrest and finished\n\nthe pat down.    He found $300 in Beaudoin's right front pocket.\n\n            While Sergeant Chamberlain was frisking Beaudoin, Officer\n\nPinardi made eye contact with a second man in the motel room, later\n\nidentified as Champagne, through the open door. Once Champagne saw\n\nPinardi, Champagne hurried across the room toward the far wall and\n\nbegan to shuffle through some items on top of a dresser and to\n\nreach into his pockets.       Pinardi thought it odd that the man, upon\n\nseeing the police, did not come toward them to ask why they were\n\nthere.     Pinardi feared that Champagne was either searching for a\n\nweapon or trying to hide evidence, so he and Officer Sherrill\n\nentered the motel room and directed Champagne away from the dresser\n\nand toward the middle of the room.        Pinardi explained to Champagne\n\nthat the officers had received a report that there was a dead\n\nperson in the motel room.       Champagne denied that there was a dead\n\nbody.\n\n            Pinardi   asked     Champagne   if   he   had   any   weapons.\n\nChampagne, who was nervous, said that he did not, but Officer\n\nPinardi saw that Champagne had a knife clipped to one of his\n\npockets.     Pinardi removed the knife and conducted a protective\n\nfrisk, holding Champagne's arms behind his back. During the frisk,\n\nChampagne became increasingly fidgety and kept attempting to free\n\nhis hands to reach into the pockets of his pants.           Pinardi patted\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fChampagne's    right   front    pocket    and   felt    several   long,   hard\n\ncylinders, which he feared could be small pen guns or knives.\n\nChampagne became even more fidgety when Pinardi patted that pocket.\n\nWhen Champagne refused to comply with Pinardi's instruction to stop\n\nmoving his hands, Pinardi and Sherrill pushed him face down on the\n\nbed and handcuffed him.        Pinardi told Champagne that he was not\n\nunder arrest but was being restrained so Pinardi could safely\n\nascertain the nature of the situation in the room. Officer Pinardi\n\nstill had not looked in the bathroom and had no idea whether there\n\nwas a dead body inside.\n\n          Pinardi and Sherrill helped Champagne to his feet and\n\nasked him what was in his front pocket.          When Champagne said that\n\nhe did not know, Pinardi stretched open Champagne's pocket so he\n\ncould see inside it.           With the aid of a flashlight held by\n\nSherrill, Pinardi saw several crack pipes, which were the long\n\ncylindrical objects that he had feared were weapons, as well as a\n\nsubstance that later proved to be crack-cocaine.              Pinardi seized\n\nthese items and continued his frisk, finding yet more crack and a\n\nwad of cash.\n\n          After completing these searches, the officers searched\n\nthe rest of the motel room for a dead body.            When they did not find\n\na body, the officers left behind the contraband they had found and\n\nbrought Beaudoin and Champagne to the police station.                 Once a\n\nsearch warrant was obtained, the police returned to the motel room\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fand   took   the   contraband       found   in   the   searches,     as    well   as\n\nadditional drug paraphernalia, into police custody.                       They also\n\nfound by the door a plugged-in skill saw with its safety cover\n\nduct-taped up.\n\n                                   II.\n                            Procedural History\n\n             Each defendant was indicted on charges of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine and crack and possession of crack with intent to\n\ndistribute. 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.                     Champagne was also\n\nindicted on charges of obtaining proceeds from the distribution of\n\ncrack.   Id. § 853.       Both defendants moved to suppress all of the\n\nevidence that had been seized at or near the motel room, including\n\nthe drugs found on them and the contraband discovered inside the\n\nmotel room.    The prosecution argued that the request that Beaudoin\n\nstep out of the motel room doorway was justified by exigent\n\ncircumstances,     such    as   a   Terry    stop,     and   that   the    evidence\n\nsubsequently found was admissible under the inevitable discovery\n\ndoctrine.     The trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on\n\nDecember 5, 2001.     After hearing the testimony of Officer Pinardi\n\nand Sergeant Chamberlain and reviewing a transcript of the 911 call\n\nand copies of the police reports, the district court judge denied\n\nboth defendants' motions.             The judge held that the officers'\n\ninitial request that Beaudoin exit his motel room and their later\n\nentry into the room were both justified by the emergency assistance\n\nexception to the warrant requirement because the officers could\n\n                                       -9-\n\freasonably have believed that a person inside of the motel room was\n\nin need of emergency aid.\n\n            The defendants then pled guilty to the crimes charged in\n\nthe indictment, but reserved their right to appeal the district\n\ncourt judge's denial of their suppression motions.            Beaudoin was\n\nsentenced to fifty-seven months in prison to be followed by four\n\nyears of supervised release, and Champagne, to 151 months in prison\n\nto be followed by five years of supervised release.           In sentencing\n\nChampagne, the judge imposed a two-point increase in his offense\n\nlevel based upon his possession of the electric saw, which the\n\njudge deemed to be a dangerous weapon.

If the phone report was\n\ntrue, the man in the doorway probably was involved in either or\n\nboth of the reported activities and might even be a murderer; the\n\nman might well be armed and might have companions in the room.   The\n\nassociation between drug dealing and guns is well known.         The\n\nofficers could not verify that the man was not armed because of the\n\nway he had opened the door, nor could they tell if he had a weapon\n\nclose at hand.    The partially opened doorway to the small motel\n\nroom was not a safe place for the police to investigate whether the\n\nman was armed, in this situation.      Additionally, the officers had\n\nheard noises from inside the room and thus had reason to suspect\n\nthat at least one other person besides the man at the door was\n\ninside.\n\n            In the end, this case turns on whether it was reasonable\n\nfor Sergeant Chamberlain to ask Beaudoin to step out of the\n\ndoorway.4    It matters not, in these particular circumstances,\n\nwhether the request was in essence a command.

The notion is abhorrent that\n\npolice who are investigating a crime and suddenly find themselves\n\nat risk are precluded from acting reasonably in response to that\n\nrisk merely because they have not yet established probable cause to\n\nmake an arrest for a crime.           Finally, the question presented here\n\nis not whether the anonymous tip alone, absent any risk of injury\n\nto the officers, justified the command to step out of the doorway.\n\nNor is any abstract issue raised about the application of Terry to\n\npersons in doorways absent the emergency and exigent circumstances\n\npresent here.\n\n\n       5\n      Consider, for example, if Beaudoin had already left the\ndoorway and the officer simply instructed Beaudoin to step closer\nto him.\n\n                                        -18-\n\f           As the Supreme Court has emphasized, determining whether\n\nthe officers' actions were reasonable in the context of exigent\n\ncircumstances requires balancing the need for the warrantless\n\nsearch or seizure against the harm to the individual whose privacy\n\nis being intruded upon in light of all the circumstances.

The police did not order Beaudoin out of the\n\ndoorway until he had voluntarily opened the door and spoken with\n\nthem.   To the extent this was a seizure, it was more akin to the\n\ntemporary detention involved in a Terry stop.              The police did not\n\nenter the motel room here, but merely told (or perhaps, requested)\n\nBeaudoin to step outside of his doorway.              This is entirely in\n\nkeeping with the basic rationale of Terry: a brief \"seizure\" in\n\nthese circumstances protected police safety and facilitated the\n\ninvestigation while minimizing the intrusiveness of the invasion on\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fBeaudoin's privacy.          We do not say that Beaudoin relinquished all\n\nexpectations of privacy merely by opening his door; still, it was\n\nless intrusive for the police to tell him to step outside at that\n\npoint than it would have been if Beaudoin had not himself come\n\npartially outside by opening the door.

Second, it allowed the police to ask Beaudoin some\n\nquestions while putting some distance between themselves and other\n\npersons potentially in the room.    Finally, asking Beaudoin out of\n\nthe room allowed the police to perform a pat down unhindered by a\n\ndoor frame and to subdue Beaudoin if necessary.\n\n            An argument may be made that there were alternatives\n\navailable to the police.    The officers could have attempted first\n\nto contact the motel manager or to telephone to see if there were\n\npeople inside of the room.     But most of those alternatives were\n\navailable several steps earlier in the process and were hardly\n\nrequired.     Realistically, they were no longer available once\n\nBeaudoin opened the door as he did.      There is also a suggestion\n\nthat the officers should not have asked Beaudoin to step out of the\n\ndoorway at all once he opened it; they should have simply retreated\n\nfrom the area.   The officers had reasons to fear being shot if they\n\nretreated.    The police would have been foolish either to back away\n\nor to turn their backs on Beaudoin.    For the officers to ascertain\n\nwhether he had weapons, in light of the information they had, was\n\neminently sensible.    Moreover, delay risked the life of the person\n\nin the room reported to be dead, if there were such a person.\n\n            None of the officers' actions after Beaudoin stepped out\n\nof the doorway justifies suppressing the evidence.    Once Beaudoin\n\nstepped out of the doorway, it was reasonable for the officers to\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fask him if he had a weapon.       And when Beaudoin said that he had a\n\nknife and reached for his pocket, it was reasonable for the\n\nofficers to do a quick pat down.         After finding the knife and two\n\ndrug pipes, it was reasonable for them to enter the room, given the\n\ninformation about the drug deal and the dead body.\n\n           The fact that the other two officers had not waited long\n\nbefore entering the room and frisking Champagne (while Beaudoin was\n\nquestioned and frisked outside) need not be addressed in these\n\ncircumstances.      Under   the   inevitable   discovery    doctrine,    the\n\nofficers   would   inevitably     have   entered   the   room   and   frisked\n\nChampagne once the results of frisking Beaudoin were known.             And,\n\ninevitably, they would have arrested him, once they found what was\n\nin his pockets.    See United States v.

The concerns raised by such a scenario are very serious.\n\nAnonymous tips, without more, do not justify free-wheeling police\n\naction.     J.L., 529 U.S. at 270.      It is easy for someone to make an\n\nanonymous 911 call to the police with a false report of a dead body\n\nin a room in order to set up the people in that room.            This case\n\nshows exactly that: Beaudoin and Champagne were set up by the\n\nanonymous tipster.       Equally, though, society expects police to\n\ninvestigate reports of dead bodies, and to do so promptly.              The\n\nreportedly \"dead\" body might yet be alive and prompt action could\n\nsave the person.      See Wayne, 318 F.2d at 212 (\"Acting in response\n\nto reports of 'dead bodies,' the police may find the 'bodies' to be\n\ncommon drunks, diabetics in shock, or distressed cardiac patients\n\n. . . .     Even the apparently dead often are saved by swift police\n\nresponse.\").\n\n             Fourth Amendment analysis is renownedly fact specific; a\n\nstep-by-step analysis is inherent in the claim.         Defendants, ably\n\nrepresented by counsel, argue that the court should not do a step-\n\nby-step analysis of the officers' actions, but should back up and\n\ninstead take a look at the entire picture.          Courts must do both.\n\nThere may indeed be rare cases where the entire picture reveals\n\nthat the reasonableness of each succeeding step was so marginal\n\nthat   an   overall   conclusion   of    unreasonableness   is   warranted.\n\nStill, defendants' disavowal of a step-by-step approach relies too\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fmuch on doctrinal categories, and not enough on the facts of the\n\ncase.   The Supreme Court expressly disapproved of such an approach\n\nin Banks, 124 S. Ct. at 528.\n\n           We emphatically do not create an anonymously reported\n\nmurder scene exception to the warrant requirement, nor do we adopt\n\na broad emergency aid doctrine, as defendants fear.                 There are\n\nvalid concerns about the harm to Fourth Amendment interests from a\n\ngenerous interpretation of the emergency doctrine as an exception\n\nto the warrant requirement.        This case does not, in the end, turn\n\non the emergency doctrine alone but turns also on the exigent\n\ncircumstance of risk to the officers, a risk that justified telling\n\nBeaudoin to step out of the doorway and is a justification for the\n\nTerry doctrine.     From that, all else followed.\n\nB.

The majority concludes\n\nthat the Hooksett police officers did not violate the Fourth\n\nAmendment's protections for a private residence when they directed\n\nRodger Beaudoin to step outside of his motel room.             In reaching\n\nthis result, the majority does not rely on the emergency exception\n\ndoctrine,   which   provided   the    basis   for   the   district   court's\n\ndecision, nor does it accept the government's alternative argument\n\nthat the seizure of Rodger Beaudoin was equivalent to an on-the-\n\nbeat, non-residential Terry-stop to which the Fourth Amendment's\n\nwarrant requirement does not apply.         Rather, the majority adopts a\n\nnovel amalgam of Fourth Amendment doctrines that combines the\n\nemergency exception doctrine, the traditional exigent circumstance\n\nof risk to the safety of police officers, and the Terry doctrine to\n\nuphold the officers' actions under the Fourth Amendment.             Absent\n\nfrom this analysis is any consideration of whether the command to\n\nBeaudoin was supported by probable cause to believe that a criminal\n\noffense had been or was being committed, or probable cause to\n\nbelieve that an individual's life or safety was in danger within\n\nthe defendants' motel room.     Because I believe that the majority's\n\napproach is irreconcilable with long-established Fourth Amendment\n\njurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.\n\n            As I will explain more fully below, under Payton v.

Given\n\nthe sharp discrepancy between the two officers' testimonies, I\n\nwould read the district court's observations as a finding that the\n\ngovernment failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat Beaudoin freely and voluntarily consented to step outside of\n\nthe motel room.7   Indeed, the conflicting testimony of the officers\n\nwould seem to preclude any finding that the government met its\n\nburden of proof on its claim that Beaudoin exited the motel room\n\nvoluntarily. Therefore, I would conclude that the police officers'\n\norder to Beaudoin to step outside constituted a seizure of his\n\nperson from his motel room.\n\n     Whether Payton's heightened protections for the home apply in\n\nthis case depends not only upon whether the order to Beaudoin\n\n\n     7\n      The majority characterizes the two officers' testimonies as\n\"slightly varying accounts\" and suggests that the differences\nbetween them \"turn out to be immaterial.\"         In my view, the\ndifferences between the officers' testimonies are substantial and\nsignificant.    While Pinardi testified that he requested that\nBeaudoin step outside, Sergeant Chamberlain, when asked by the\ncourt whether he asked Beaudoin to step outside or ordered him out,\nresponded: \"I — I told him to come out, so I would say that I\nordered him out.\" He later testified that Beaudoin was not free to\nrefuse this directive, explaining that if Beaudoin had refused to\ncome out, Chamberlain would have gone in after him.\n\n                                -32-\n\fconstituted a seizure but also upon whether it was a residential\n\nseizure.

That\n\nline, we think, must be not only firm but also bright.\"                       On the\n\nexternal, public side of Payton's firm line, a police officer's\n\nconduct is not subject to Payton's protections.                  On the internal,\n\nresidential side of this line, police officers must obtain a\n\nwarrant supported by probable cause prior to conducting a non-\n\nconsensual search or seizure, or demonstrate that their actions are\n\njustified by exigent circumstances and probable cause.\n\n     The important question in this case, therefore, is not whether\n\nthe police conduct was intrusive, non-intrusive, or something in\n\nbetween when weighed against Beaudoin's reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy, but whether the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement and\n\nheightened    protections      for   the     home    were      implicated     by    the\n\nchallenged police conduct.

Unlike the defendants in Gori, who \"opened [their\n\napartment] to public view . . . in response to the knock of an\n\ninvitee\" and therefore had \"no expectation of privacy as to what\n\ncould be seen from the hall,\" Beaudoin opened the interior door of\n\nhis   motel    room   in   response     to   a   knock   and   request   by   law\n\n\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fenforcement officials.8    Moreover, he opened the door just enough\n\nto reveal his face, exposing nothing inside the room.

Thus, when the police ordered Beaudoin to\n\nstep outside, he was not in a place where Terry's reasonable\n\nsuspicion analysis would apply in lieu of the probable cause basis\n\nrequired for a search or seizure within a private residence.\n\nBecause Beaudoin did not voluntarily step outside of the motel room\n\nor voluntarily expose the room to public view, Payton's heightened\n\nprotections for private residences apply in this case.\n\n                               II.\n          Fourth Amendment Doctrines and the Majority's\n                Exigency/Emergency/Terry Approach\n\n     As noted above, the majority does not uphold the warrantless\n\nseizure of Beaudoin based on the presence of exigent circumstances\n\nplus probable cause nor does it affirm the district court's denial\n\nof the motion to suppress under the emergency exception doctrine.\n\nIt also does not adopt the alternative argument advanced below by\n\nthe government that the order to Beaudoin did not take place within\n\nBeaudoin's private residence and thus constituted a Terry stop that\n\nwas justified solely on the ground of reasonable suspicion of\n\nunlawful activity.   Instead, the majority's analysis \"involves the\n\n\n\n     8\n      Pinardi and Chamberlain testified that Beaudoin opened the\nmain, inside door to the motel room, leaving an outer, screen door\nbetween Beaudoin and the officers.

To my knowledge, no\n\nother court has combined the traditional exigent circumstances\n\ndoctrine, the emergency exception doctrine, and the Terry doctrine\n\nto justify a residential search or seizure.           The outcome of this\n\nunusual mix is an analysis that is, in my view, at odds with each\n\nof the doctrines it purports to adopt.\n\nA.   The Terry Doctrine\n\n     The majority's emergency/exigency/Terry approach removes the\n\nTerry doctrine from its constitutional moorings and extends the\n\ndoctrine to the seizure of a person from his private residence.\n\nFirst, the majority suggests that the Terry doctrine applies to the\n\npolice   officers'      order   to   Beaudoin   because     Beaudoin   stopped\n\nvoluntarily when he opened the curtain to his motel room and\n\nanswered the knock at his door.        Thus, the majority claims that the\n\ncircumstances that culminated in the order to Beaudoin to exit his\n\nmotel room were like \"a situation in which a person voluntarily\n\nstops, and then the police take reasonable steps, during that\n\ntemporary stop to protect themselves during the questioning.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\f      Although the majority is correct that once a Terry stop has\n\noccurred, \"an officer may search a person for weapons based on\n\nreasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous,\" the\n\nvoluntary actions that the majority describes do not constitute the\n\ninvoluntary, investigative Terry stop (the seizure) that is the\n\npremise of the Terry analysis.        Indeed, the so-called voluntary\n\n\"stop\" of Beaudoin within the motel room seems to be offered as a\n\nsubstitute for the involuntary Terry seizure, which would require\n\nreasonable suspicion that Beaudoin had committed, was committing,\n\nor was about to commit a crime.\n\n      More   importantly,   the   majority's   analysis   overlooks   the\n\ncritical fact that Beaduoin was inside his motel room when he\n\nlooked out the window and responded to the officers' knock by\n\nopening the door to his motel room just far enough to reveal his\n\nface.   This situation differs in constitutionally significant ways\n\nfrom a situation in which police officers conduct a voluntary stop\n\nof an individual in a public setting.        In order to place Beaudoin\n\nin a situation where Terry's reasonable suspicion standard might\n\napply, the officers had to order him to exit his room.        Terry did\n\nnot justify that command because Terry does not apply to seizures\n\nof   individuals   from   their   private   residences.

The majority cautions that this case does not\n\npresent \"any abstract issue . . . about the application of Terry to\n\npersons in doorways absent the emergency and exigent circumstances\n\npresent here.\"9    Yet Terry's applicability to the order to Beaudoin\n\ndoes not turn on the presence or absence of exigent circumstances\n\nbut on the physical location of Beaudoin and the police officers at\n\nthe time of the seizure. Terry itself distinguished police conduct\n\n\"predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of an officer on the\n\nbeat — which historically has not been and as a practical matter\n\ncould not be, subject to the warrant procedure\" from \"conduct\n\nsubject to the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.\" Terry, 392\n\n\n      9\n      While the majority acknowledges that \"[s]ome courts have\nfound that Terry does not justify intrusions into the home,\" it\ninsists that \"[t]his issue is not before us — the issue, as\ndescribed below, does not arise from an intrusion into the home or\nmotel room.\" However, insofar as Beaudoin was positioned on the\nresidential side of Payton's firm line at the time that he opened\nthe inner door of his motel room, the officers' seizure of his\nperson was subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement,\nand the Terry doctrine did not apply.

Terry dealt with the former category of conduct and\n\ndid not require exigent circumstances or probable cause to justify\n\nthe warrantless seizure — because a warrant was not required in the\n\nfirst place.       By contrast, if the situation in Terry involved\n\nconduct subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the\n\nCourt \"would have [had] to ascertain whether 'probable cause'\n\nexisted to justify the search and seizure which took place.\"                Id.\n\n       Thus,   the    majority's       incorporation    of   Terry   into    an\n\nexigency/emergency analysis overlooks the constitutional difference\n\nbetween police conduct in the home and police conduct outside it.10\n\nThis    approach     represents    a   significant     departure   from   well-\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment doctrine, under which residential\n\nseizures must be supported by a warrant or exigent circumstances\n\nand probable cause, whereas seizures short of arrest that are\n\nconducted outside of the home do not require a warrant and may be\n\njustified under Terry's reasonable suspicion standard. The command\n\nto Beaudoin to exit his motel room constituted a seizure of\n\nBeaudoin from his private residence.              It was an intrusion of\n\n       10\n       Although the majority assumes, arguendo, that the order to\nBeaudoin was a seizure of his person, it suggests that the order\nmay not have been a seizure after all, inviting us to \"[c]onsider,\nfor example, if Beaudoin had left the doorway, and the officer\nsimply instructed Beaudoin to step closer to him.\" This example\nagain misapprehends the significance of place.         Whether the\nofficers' directive was a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes\nturns on the nature of the order, not the location of Beaudoin. On\nthe other hand, Beaudoin's location is relevant in determining\nwhether that order was a residential seizure that implicated the\nFourth Amendment's warrant requirement or whether it was a\nnonresidential seizure equivalent to an on-the-beat Terry stop.\n\n                                       -40-\n\fsignificant import that required a search warrant or exigent\n\ncircumstances plus probable cause.

The Exigent Circumstances and Emergency Doctrines\n\n      Just as the majority's approach is inconsistent with the Terry\n\ndoctrine, so too it cannot be reconciled with the traditional\n\nexigent circumstances doctrine or the emergency exception doctrine.\n\n      1.    The Exigent Circumstances Doctrine\n\n      Under      a   traditional       Fourth     Amendment    analysis,      exigent\n\ncircumstances        present     an    exception    to   the   Fourth    Amendment's\n\nwarrant requirement for residential searches and seizures. Exigent\n\ncircumstances involve a \"compelling necessity for immediate action\n\nas w[ould] not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.\"                        United\n\nStates v.

While the majority is correct that a risk to the safety\n\nof the public or the police may rise to the level of an exigent\n\ncircumstance, our case law is clear that this exigency justifies a\n\nwarrantless residential search or seizure only where it is also\n\nsupported by probable cause.

Thus, the traditional exigent\n\ncircumstances doctrine requires two separate elements. The exigent\n\ncircumstance element focuses on circumstances that are incident to\n\nthe   criminal      investigation,   such     as    a     risk   of   flight,    the\n\ndestruction of evidence, or a risk to police officer safety.                     The\n\nprobable    cause    element   focuses   on    the      suspicion      of   criminal\n\nactivity, which must amount to probable cause to believe that a\n\ncrime has been or is being committed.              In the absence of a valid\n\nsearch warrant or consent, both elements must be present in order\n\nto justify a search or seizure within a private residence.\n\n      2.    The Emergency Exception Doctrine\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized that some emergencies may\n\nobviate the need to obtain a warrant prior to entering a private\n\nresidence,       Mincey v.

In contrast to the\n\ntraditional      exigent   circumstance         case,      in   which   the     exigency\n\npresents itself in the course of a criminal investigation and\n\nrequires probable cause of criminal activity, a search or seizure\n\nthat falls under the emergency exception doctrine may be only\n\nincidentally      connected       to   unlawful      acts.         Police       officers\n\nresponding to emergency situations are responding to the need to\n\nlocate and provide assistance to a person whose life may hang in\n\nthe balance      rather    than    the    search     for    evidence       of   criminal\n\nactivity.\n\n     As    the   Fourth    Circuit       has    explained,       \"[t]his    particular\n\nexigency    is    expressed       as   one      of   [a]    reasonably          perceived\n\n'emergency' requiring immediate entry as an incident to the service\n\nand protective functions of the police as opposed to, or as a\n\ncomplement to, their law enforcement functions.\"                   United States v.\n\nMoss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583359\"><a href=\"/opinion/583359/united-states-v-bryan-a-moss/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (4th Cir. 1992).                A Fourth Amendment issue\n\narises in these emergency exception cases only when someone becomes\n\nthe subject of a search or seizure within the protected area,\n\nusually because the police discover evidence of criminal activity\n\nwhile searching for the individual believed to be in need of aid.11\n\n\n     11\n      The emergency exception doctrine must be distinguished from\nthe \"special needs\" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant and\nprobable cause requirements. The latter exception provides that \"a\nresidential search pursuant to an established warrantless search\nprocedure, may be reasonable if conducted in furtherance of an\n\n                                         -43-\n\fIn such cases, the reasonableness of the search or seizure does not\n\ndepend on the existence of probable cause to believe that criminal\n\nactivity      had   been   or    was   being    committed.     Indeed,       the   law\n\nenforcement officers initially may not be aware of any connection\n\nbetween the emergency and a crime.              Instead, the reasonableness of\n\nthe intrusive action under the emergency doctrine depends on the\n\nobjective probability that someone's life or safety is in danger\n\nwithin a setting protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n\n       Thus, the emergency exception suggested by Mincey, and adopted\n\nin various forms by state and federal courts, does not dispense\n\nwith   the    Fourth   Amendment's       probable     cause   requirement.         In\n\napplying the emergency doctrine, other circuits have found that the\n\nFourth Amendment requires a standard of suspicion approximating\n\nprobable cause to justify a warrantless search or seizure in a\n\nprivate residence under the emergency exception doctrine.                      While\n\nthe phrasing of the applicable standard varies, I agree with the\n\nSecond Circuit that probable cause exists in the emergency context\n\nwhere there exists a probability that an individual's life or\n\nsafety   is    in   danger      within   an    area   protected   by   the    Fourth\n\n\n\nimportant administrative or regulatory purpose, or 'special need,'\nwhich would be undermined systematically by an impracticable\nwarrant or probable-cause requirement.\" McCabe v.

However, under the emergency\n\ndoctrine,    the   separate   elements    of   exigent    circumstances   and\n\nprobable cause come together.       In other words, probable cause in\n\nthe emergency context focuses on the threat to an individual's life\n\nor safety – that is, on the exigency itself.           Unless the objective\n\nbasis for suspicion of an emergency rises to the level of probable\n\n\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fcause, a warrantless residential search or seizure violates the\n\nFourth Amendment.\n\n     3.     The Majority's Approach\n\n     The majority never claims that the anonymous call reporting a\n\nfailed drug deal and possible dead body, and the light inside of\n\nthe defendants' motel room, provided an adequate basis for a\n\nwarrantless entry into the room under the traditional exigent\n\ncircumstances doctrine or the emergency exception doctrine.      At\n\nmost, the majority's analysis suggests that the facts known to the\n\nofficers relating to the possible emergency and crime justified\n\ntheir decision to approach the defendants' motel room and knock on\n\nthe door.    I agree with that proposition.\n\n     However, Beaudoin had no obligation to open that door, even in\n\nresponse to a knock and request of the police.         Because the\n\nofficers did not have a warrant, Beaudoin could have simply told\n\nthem to go away.      In that case, the officers would have been\n\nrequired to explore other investigative options until they could\n\ndevelop sufficient probable cause to support a search warrant.\n\n     Yet Beaudoin responded to the officers' knock by opening the\n\ninner door to his motel room, revealing only his face.     At that\n\ncritical moment, the majority introduces the exigent circumstance\n\nof the risk to the officers' safety.    According to the majority,\n\nthe police officers had a reasonable basis to believe that their\n\nsafety was at risk based on the information provided by the\n\n\n                                -46-\n\fanonymous call,12 the sounds that they heard inside of the room, and\n\nthe way that Beaudoin opened the door.   As the majority explains:\n\n\"[t]he partially opened doorway to the small motel room was not a\n\nsafe place for the police to investigate whether [Beaudoin] was\n\narmed, in this situation.\"13 Therefore, it concludes that \"balanced\n\nagainst the objective safety concerns of the officers here, and in\n\nlight of the call about an emergency, it was reasonable\" to order\n\nBeaudoin to step outside of his motel room.\n\n     I do not doubt that an officer investigating reports of drug\n\nactivity and a possible dead body in a motel room has valid\n\ngrounds for concern about his or her personal safety in standing\n\noutside of that room under the circumstances presented here.\n\nHowever, the officers could have addressed their concerns for\n\npersonal safety by withdrawing from the area around the motel room\n\ndoor in any one of several directions.   The door was adjacent to a\n\n\n     12\n       The majority points out that Officer Pinardi testified that\nhe believed the call had reported a shooting, as well as a drug\ndeal gone bad and a possible dead body. However, the source of\nthat belief is unclear, and it conflicts with the transcript of the\ncall, which said nothing about a shooting, as well as the testimony\nof Sergeant Chamberlain, who said nothing about a shooting.\n\n     13\n      In fact, as noted in footnote 3, supra, Beaudoin initially\nopened the interior door of the room. The record leaves unclear\nwhether he had pushed open the outer, screen door at the time that\nthe police commanded him from the room.\n\n\n\n\n                               -47-\n\flit walkway that flanked a circular driveway where the police\n\nofficers had parked their car in view of the defendants' room.             The\n\npolice did not have to turn their backs to Beaudoin or end their\n\nvigilance as they retreated from the area in front of the door.\n\nWhile courts are appropriately reluctant to tell police officers\n\nhow to carry out their investigatory responsibilities, officers\n\nmust    make     investigative     choices   within    the   limits   of   the\n\nConstitution.        A decision by the Hooksett police officers to\n\nwithdraw from the area around Beaudoin's door would not mean an\n\nabandonment of their investigation of the anonymous call.                  They\n\ncould have pursued a number of alternative options, including\n\nstaking out the scene,14 questioning other motel residents, or\n\ncalling Beaudoin's room in an effort to win his consent to a\n\nvoluntary departure from that room.          What the police could not do,\n\nhowever, was use their continued presence outside the motel room\n\ndoor        as   a   basis   for    disregarding      the    well-established\n\nconstitutional prohibition against entering a private residence\n\nwithout a combination of probable cause to believe that criminal\n\nactivity was occurring within and exigent circumstances or, in a\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      Sergeant Chamberlain recognized the availability of other\nalternatives, testifying that if the call had reported a drug deal\ngone bad but not a dead body, the officers would not have ordered\nBeaudoin to step outside when he guardedly opened the door but\nwould have \"put a perimeter up outside the place and tried to\ndevelop enough probable cause to at least get a search warrant, and\n[] would also have at that point called for more help.\"\n\n                                      -48-\n\fpure emergency situation, probable cause to believe that somebody's\n\nlife or safety is in danger within the private residence.\n\n     Implicit in the majority's analysis is the notion that the\n\nofficers' belief that someone was injured or dying inside of the\n\nroom justified their continued presence outside of the doorway and,\n\nafter concerns    arose   for   their    own    safety,   their   seizure   of\n\nBeaudoin.   In other words, the police could not have been required\n\nto abandon their position in front of the motel room door because\n\nthey were in the process of investigating a reported emergency.\n\nHowever, the only basis for the officers' belief that someone might\n\nbe in danger inside the room was an anonymous, uncorroborated 911\n\ncall devoid of any details (other than the room number) that did\n\nnot provide sufficiently reasonable grounds to believe that an\n\nemergency existed.     Nor was the officers' belief in a possible\n\nemergency rendered any more reasonable by their concerns for their\n\nown safety or by the fact that they ordered Beaudoin to step\n\noutside of his motel room rather than physically entering the room\n\nthemselves.    In essence, when the majority's amalgam of doctrines\n\nand its language of reasonableness are probed, it concludes that an\n\nanonymous, uncorroborated call trumps the strong Fourth Amendment\n\nrule that the police may not enter a private residence without\n\nprobable cause to do so.             This proposition represents a new\n\nexception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant and probable cause\n\nrequirements   that   cannot    be    squared   with   traditional   exigent\n\n\n                                     -49-\n\fcircumstances      analysis   or    the    emergency         exception      doctrine.\n\nBecause the officers in this case had no probable cause basis for\n\nbelieving that there was criminal activity or an emergency inside\n\nthe defendants' room, I would hold that their decision to order\n\nBeaudoin from his motel room violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n                                 III.\n         Fourth Amendment Analysis of the Seizure of Beaudoin\n\nA.   Traditional Fourth Amendment Analysis\n\n        Although the district court did not decide this case on\n\ntraditional Fourth Amendment grounds, it stated at the suppression\n\nhearing that \"the ordinary exigent circumstances exception, when\n\nyou're trying to seek evidence of a crime rather than trying to\n\ndetermine     if   somebody   in    need     of    assistance       can     get     that\n\nassistance,    requires    probable       cause.

However, there was\n\nprecious little detail or corroboration at the time that the\n\nHooksett police officers knocked on the defendants' motel room door\n\nand ordered Beaudoin to step outside.               Arriving at the motel at\n\nabout 5:30 a.m., the officers observed that a light was on inside\n\nRoom 10, in contrast to the other darkened rooms of the motel.\n\nSergeant       Chamberlain    noticed    movement     inside    the   room    and\n\nsubsequently observed Beaudoin pull back the curtain and look\n\noutside in response to the officers' knock on the door.                      When\n\nBeaudoin opened the door at the request or instruction of the\n\nofficers, he did so only far enough to reveal his face.\n\n       I do not find it out of the ordinary that two individuals\n\nwould be awake at 5:30 a.m. on a July morning when the sun had\n\nalready begun to rise.             As Officer Pinardi acknowledged at the\n\nsuppression hearing, it was \"not very dark in July\" at that time of\n\nmorning.    Nor do I think that Beaudoin's decision to look outside\n\nthe window before answering an early morning knock on his motel\n\nroom    door    provides     any    corroboration    of   the   anonymous     and\n\n\n                                        -53-\n\funidentified tip alleging a homicide or drug deal.           As noted, he\n\nhad no obligation to open the door at all.             His hesitancy to\n\nvoluntarily expose himself and the room to full public view when\n\nopening the door in response to a request from police officers\n\nvisible in their uniforms could provide some indication of a guilty\n\nconscience.     On the other hand, it could suggest a reasonable\n\nconcern for safety, or for modesty, when strangers, even uniformed\n\nones, unexpectedly knock on one's motel room door in the early\n\nhours of the morning.      In any event, considered        together, these\n\nfacts were insufficient to corroborate an anonymous call devoid of\n\ndetails   and   to   provide   sufficient   indicia   of   reliability   to\n\n\"warrant a prudent policeman in believing\" that Beaudoin and\n\nChampagne had committed or were committing an offense inside the\n\nmotel room.     Tibolt, 72 F.3d at 969; see J.L., 529 U.S. at 271\n\n(holding that anonymous call alleging unlawful carriage of gun was\n\nnot sufficiently corroborated by police observation of suspect\n\nmatching the description and standing at the location reported by\n\nthe caller to establish reasonable suspicion justifying a Terry\n\ninvestigative stop of that individual). Hence, under a traditional\n\nFourth Amendment analysis relating to the investigation of criminal\n\nactivity, there was no probable cause basis for ordering Beaudoin\n\nto leave his room.\n\nB.   Emergency Exception Doctrine\n\n     The question here is whether the Hooksett police officers\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\flawfully ordered Beaudoin to step outside of his motel room under\n\nan emergency doctrine that incorporates the Fourth Amendment's\n\nrequirements for warrantless residential searches and seizures. In\n\naddressing this question, I consider whether there existed an\n\nobjective probability that an individual's life or safety was in\n\ndanger inside the motel room at the time that the officers ordered\n\nBeaudoin to step outside — in other words, whether the risk of an\n\nemergency rose to the level of probable cause.\n\n       The   government     claims   that   emergency    circumstances     were\n\ncreated by the anonymous 911 call that reported a possible dead\n\nbody   inside   a   motel    room.     As   several     circuit   courts   have\n\nrecognized, 911 calls are among the most frequent and widely\n\nrecognized means of reporting emergencies.              See, e.g., Holloway,\n\n290 F.3d at 1339 (\"Not surprisingly, 911 calls are the predominant\n\nmeans of communicating emergency situations.\"); United States v.\n\nRichardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768239\"><a href=\"/opinion/768239/united-states-v-clarence-richardson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"A 911 call is one\n\nof the most common — and universally recognized — means through\n\nwhich police and other emergency personnel learn that there is\n\nsomeone in a dangerous situation who urgently needs help.\").               When\n\nconfronted with an emergency situation, police officers generally\n\nmust act swiftly to investigate and respond to information that\n\nsomeone may be in need of urgent assistance.\n\n       Although a homicide scene does not automatically present an\n\nexigent circumstance that justifies a warrantless search, see\n\n\n                                     -55-\n\fMincey, 437 U.S. at 393-94,15 a 911 report of a dead body may in\n\nsome circumstances create a reasonable assumption that the reported\n\nvictim    might   be    alive   and     in    need   of   immediate     aid.   See\n\nRichardson, 208 F.3d at 631 (concluding that \"it was objectively\n\nreasonable    for      the   officers    to    conclude    that   the    situation\n\npresented exigent circumstances\" based on a 911 report that a woman\n\nhad been raped and murdered in an apartment). As then-Judge Burger\n\nexplained in Wayne v. United States:\n\n     [A] warrant is not required to break down a door to enter\n     a burning home to rescue occupants or extinguish a fire,\n     to prevent a shooting or to bring emergency aid to an\n     injured person. The need to protect or preserve life or\n     avoid serious injury is justification for what would be\n     otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency. . . .\n     [T]he business of policemen and firemen is to act, not to\n     speculate or meditate on whether the report is correct.\n     People could well die in emergencies if the police tried\n     to act with the calm deliberation associated with the\n     judicial process.

Cir. 1963)(dicta).                In this case, the 911\n\ncall suggested that someone may have been killed as the result of\n\na drug deal.        I agree with the district court that a 911 call\n\nreporting a potential victim of a drug-related homicide may present\n\nan exigency that compels immediate action and justifies forgoing\n\nthe delay of obtaining a warrant.\n\n\n     15\n      In Mincey, the Supreme Court found that a four-day search of\nan apartment after the victims of a shooting had been found\nviolated the Fourth Amendment, explaining that \"the warrantless\nsearch of [the defendant's] apartment was not constitutionally\npermissible simply because a homicide had occurred there.\" Id. at\n395.\n\n                                        -56-\n\f     The   analysis      does   not   end     there,   however.        Again,   the\n\ngovernment       must   establish     that    the    suspicion    of    emergency\n\ncircumstances rises to the level of probable cause in order to\n\nvalidate     a   warrantless    search       or   seizure   within     a   private\n\nresidence.       The district court concluded that the anonymous 911\n\ncall that reported a dead body inside Room 10 of the Kozy 7 Motel\n\n\"provided both reasonable grounds for effectuating a warrantless\n\nattempted rescue of the putative victim and a reasonable basis for\n\ndoing so within the room specified.\"              The majority apparently does\n\nnot agree with that conclusion, nor do I.\n\n     The relevant facts on this issue are not in dispute.                       The\n\ngovernment agrees that the anonymous 911 call alleging a \"drug deal\n\ngone bad\" and possible dead body provided the basis for the police\n\nofficers' seizure of Beaudoin.          The officers acknowledge that they\n\ndid not know the identity of the caller or the origin of the call.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record suggesting that the officers\n\ntried to trace the call or conducted any other investigation to\n\ncorroborate the information that they received or the identity of\n\nthe caller prior to appearing at the defendants' door.\n\n     The concerns with anonymous and uncorroborated tips expressed\n\nby the Supreme Court in J.L. under a traditional Fourth Amendment\n\nanalysis are also relevant in the emergency context.                   It is true\n\nthat the J.L. Court recognized that certain emergency situations\n\nmight justify a reduced showing of reliability regarding anonymous\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\ftips, explaining that \"[w]e do not say, for example, that a report\n\nof a person carrying a bomb need bear the indicia of reliability we\n\ndemand for a person carrying a firearm before the police can\n\nconstitutionally    conduct    a    frisk.\"   529   U.S.    at   273-74.   I\n\nrecognize that unusually severe and time-sensitive emergencies,\n\nsuch as the report of a bomb, may validate a protective, on-the-\n\nstreet, stop and frisk, even without a showing of reliability.\n\nSuch an emergency might also justify a search or seizure within a\n\nprivate     residence     without    a   showing    of     probable   cause,\n\nnotwithstanding the heightened privacy interest at stake in such\n\ncases.     However, an anonymous call alleging a possible dead body\n\ninside a motel room does not present the same kind of clear and\n\nimmediate threat of harm as a report alleging that a person is\n\ncarrying a bomb.    J.L. does not stand for the proposition that an\n\nanonymous report of a dead body inside a private residence obviates\n\nthe need to verify the reliability of the caller or the call.\n\n     As in J.L., the caller in this case \"provided no predictive\n\ninformation and therefore left the police without means to test the\n\ninformant's knowledge or credibility.\"        See J.L., 529 U.S. at 271.\n\nSuch a call presents a troubling possibility that someone may have\n\nplaced the call in order to \"harass another [by] set[ting] in\n\nmotion an intrusive, embarrassing police search of the targeted\n\nperson.\"    Id. at 272.

Yet one\n\nof the officers testified that if Beaudoin had not come out of his\n\nmotel room the police were going to go in.

However, they cannot\n\nbe removed from the calculus of reasonableness.     In this case, the\n\nwell-established proposition that the police cannot enter a private\n\nresidence without probable cause to do so means that the officers\n\nmade a constitutionally inappropriate choice when their concern for\n\ntheir own safety induced them, with their order to Beaudoin to\n\nleave his motel room, to cross the threshold into the protected\n\narea instead of withdrawing from the scene to continue their\n\ninvestigation in a manner that would comport with constitutional\n\nrequirements. Under both traditional Fourth Amendment analysis and\n\nthe emergency exception doctrine, the officers' conduct in this\n\ncase    violated   the   Fourth   Amendment's   proscription   against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures.      The district court's order\n\ndenying the defendants' motion to suppress should be vacated, and\n\nthe motion to suppress granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -62-\n\f</pre>",
