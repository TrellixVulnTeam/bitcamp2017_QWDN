José Antonio Fusté,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n               Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                 and DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Héctor L. Ramos Vega, with whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr. and\nPatricia A. Garrity were on brief, for appellant.\n     Timothy R. Henwood, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Rosa\nEmilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 15, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f             LYNCH,    Circuit    Judge.      Eutacio   Cáceres-Cabrera    was\n\nconvicted after trial of attempting to launder proceeds of a\n\nspecified unlawful activity.           See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(I),\n\n(a)(2).      The sums were forfeited.           See id. § 982(a)(1).       The\n\nunlawful activity specified in the indictment and argued by the\n\nprosecutor was drug dealing, and the amount of money the defendant\n\nattempted to launder was $198,965 in cash.\n\n             At sentencing, the district court imposed a six-level\n\nupward adjustment under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(1), and sentenced\n\nCáceres-Cabrera to sixty-three months' imprisonment with three\n\nyears of supervised release.\n\n             Cáceres-Cabrera appeals         his sentence, arguing the court\n\nerred   in   imposing    the     six-level    adjustment.    Under    U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2S1.1(b)(1) the adjustment may be imposed if, inter alia, the\n\ngovernment has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the laundered\n\nfunds were narcotics proceeds.\n\n             The parties disagree over the basis for the district\n\ncourt's ruling.       The defendant argues that the ruling rested on an\n\nerror of law, and that the evidence is insufficient.                 He argues\n\nthat the district court erroneously imposed the enhancement solely\n\non the basis of the jury verdict, which did not establish Cáceres-\n\nCabrera's knowledge that the monies were drug proceeds.                    The\n\ndefendant correctly points out that it is not an element of the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\foffense of conviction that the defendant know that the laundered\n\nmonies are proceeds of illicit drug transactions.                   18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1956(a).   Rather, conviction requires only that the defendant\n\nknow that the monies are proceeds of some illegal activity.                   Id.\n\n§ 1956(a)(1); see also United States v. Cornier-Ortiz, 361 F.3d 29,\n\n37 (1st Cir. 2004). Defense counsel also notes that the government\n\nargued at closing that there was no burden on the government to\n\nprove that Cáceres-Cabrera knew the money came from narcotics\n\nproceeds, only that the money came from illegal activity.\n\n          The government rejoins that the court's result is based\n\non the jury verdict along with other evidence the government\n\nproduced at sentencing.1\n\n          The   court   asked    for    and     heard   a   recitation   of   the\n\ngovernment's evidence supporting the six-level increase.                    After\n\nthat recitation, the court expressed, several times, considerable\n\ndoubt that the evidence was enough to meet the government's burden\n\nof proving that the laundered monies were drug proceeds.                      The\n\ngovernment then switched tactics and argued that the jury, in\n\ndelivering   the   verdict      of     guilt,     necessarily     adopted     the\n\ngovernment's theory that the funds were drug funds, despite the\n\n\n     1\n          The government also adds some arguments on appeal which\nwere not directly presented to the district court. One of those\narguments is that the defendant was untruthful on this very\nsubject. He gave one version of events when he testified as to\nwhether he knew the bag contained money and whether he knew the\nsource of the money, and gave another version to the Probation\nOfficer, as reflected in the P.S.R.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fdefense's objections that this was not an element of the crime and\n\nthat the jury verdict form did not require any such finding.\n\n           The court then concluded, \"[T]he adjustment has to be\n\nmade in light of the verdict.\"       It is unclear whether the court was\n\nimplicitly     ruling   that   the   government's      other    evidence   was\n\ninsufficient, as the court had earlier suggested; or that the\n\ntotality of the evidence, including the verdict, sufficed to meet\n\nthe government's    burden; or that the result was compelled by the\n\njury verdict standing alone, regardless of the other evidence.\n\n           The sentencing transcript can be read to support either\n\nside's argument as to the court's reasons.              We think that the\n\nproper course is to remand to the district court for clarification\n\nand a further statement of reasons.          See United States v. Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc) (\"[O]ur\n\nemphasis in reviewing . . . claims [contesting the treatment of\n\nvarious sentencing factors by the district court] will be on the\n\nprovision of a reasoned explanation . . . .\"); see also United\n\nStates v. Catano, 65 F.3d 219, 231 (1st Cir. 1995) (remanding for\n\nfurther explanation); United States v. Levy, 897 F.2d 596, 599 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)   (\"Where,   as   here,   the    record   admits    of   possible\n\nambiguity, our practice is to remand for a limited purpose.\").\n\nRather than retain jurisdiction, we remand for resentencing.               See\n\nUnited States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1012 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(remanding for resentencing where appellate court cannot tell the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fbasis on which a four-level upward adjustment was given).     Nothing\n\nin this opinion should be taken as addressing the merits of the\n\nissues raised by the defendant.\n\n          This   appeal   is   terminated.   If   the   defendant   is\n\ndissatisfied with the district court's actions after remand, he\n\nshould take a new appeal.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
