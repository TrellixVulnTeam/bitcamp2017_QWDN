Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert E.

The   prosecution      takes    this\n\ninterlocutory appeal, under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3731, from the district\n\ncourt's partial allowance of the defendant's motion to suppress\n\nevidence       and      denial       of     the     prosecution's       motion      for\n\nreconsideration.           United States v. Dessesaure (Dessesaure I), 314\n\nF. Supp. 2d 81 (D. Mass. 2004); United States v. Dessesaure\n\n(Dessesaure II), 323 F. Supp. 2d 211 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\n              In sum, the district court suppressed evidence seized\n\nfrom   Earl    Dessesaure's          apartment    (consisting     of   heroin,     drug\n\nparaphernalia, a gun, and bullets) pursuant to a warrant because\n\nthe    warrant      affidavit    contained        information    that     the    police\n\nobserved when they earlier illegally entered the apartment to\n\n\"freeze\"      it     and    because    of   material      misstatements     in     that\n\naffidavit.         Accepting as accurate these factual conclusions, we\n\nnonetheless disagree with the trial court's ultimate conclusion\n\nthat suppression was required.               Rather, we find that, even after\n\nstriking      the    offending       material     from   the   warrant,    there    was\n\nadequate basis for a probable cause determination and the officers\n\nwould have sought a warrant regardless.                  We reverse.\n\n                                            I.\n\n              For our purposes, a greatly streamlined version of the\n\nfacts taken from the suppression hearing, geared to the issues\n\ndescribed above, is all that is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\f           The investigation of Dessesaure began when Officer John\n\nBroderick, Jr. received information from \"different sources\" that\n\nDessesaure was selling heroin out of a maroon Cadillac Escalade\n\nwith a particular license plate.1   Dessesaure I, 314 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n83.   The license plate number given by the sources matched that of\n\na maroon Cadillac Escalade registered to Dessesaure at an address\n\nin Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\n           In the early hours of February 24, 2003, police began\n\nsurveillance on the Quincy apartment.      Id. at 86.   At 9:00 a.m.,\n\nOfficer Paul Quinn observed Dessesaure leave the Quincy apartment\n\nand throw a trash bag in a dumpster before he drove off.           Id.\n\nQuinn recovered the trash bag and found a \"residue of an unknown\n\npowder substance\" and a utility bill with Dessesaure's name and the\n\naddress of the Quincy apartment.    The residue was not field tested\n\nto confirm that it was heroin.     Id.   Officers followed Dessesaure\n\nin his Escalade to a home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood and\n\nsaw Dessesaure enter, carrying a black shoulder bag.         Id.   He\n\n\n\n      1\n       Broderick testified at the suppression hearing about the\ninformation he received from these sources. The district court\ndescribed Broderick's testimony about the sources as \"sloppy,\ninconsistent, and worse, not credible.\" Dessesaure I, 314 F. Supp.\n2d at 84.    In particular, the court focused on the fact that\nBroderick had discarded his notes about the statements made by the\nsources and the lack of other evidence supporting the credibility\nof the sources. Id. at 84-86. Nonetheless, the court concluded\nthat this \"vague information from sources without any description\nof their basis of knowledge\" could be considered when evaluating\nwhether the information in the warrant affidavit could establish\nprobable cause. Id. at 94.\n\n                                 -3-\n\femerged two minutes later, as did his girlfriend, Tina Tate.                               Id.\n\nat 86-87.       The police followed Dessesaure to Brigham and Women's\n\nHospital, where Tate went in and returned ten minutes later.                               Id.\n\nat 87.      The police then lost surveillance for some time.                     When they\n\nreestablished contact with the car again at approximately 11:15\n\na.m.,       Dessesaure   and    Tate       were    returning          to    Quincy.        Id.\n\nDessesaure made a number of evasive maneuvers as he drove and did\n\nnot take the most direct route back to the Quincy apartment.                               Id.\n\nOfficer Broderick testified that such driving is often employed by\n\ndrug       traffickers   to    see    if    they    are    being       followed       by   law\n\nenforcement officers.2          Id.\n\n               Dessesaure and Tate returned to the Quincy apartment.\n\nApproximately 20 minutes later, Dessesaure left alone and drove\n\ninto Boston, followed by the officers.                          Id.        Once in Boston,\n\nDessesaure pulled his Escalade over on a street in the South End\n\nand picked up a man, Nelson Boyd.                 Dessesaure drove Boyd for a few\n\nblocks and stopped.           Id.    Boyd got out of the car and Dessesaure\n\ndrove away. Police officers, including Broderick, stopped Boyd and\n\nsearched him, recovering a plastic bag they supposed, based on\n\ntheir experience, contained heroin.                       Id.     Boyd lied, telling\n\n\n       2\n       In Dessesaure I, the district court found that this\nconclusion \"made no sense.\" 314 F. Supp. 2d at 87. In Dessesaure\nII, however, it amended this finding \"to reflect the fact that\nDessesaure may well have been driving erratically even while going\non a routine errand with his girlfriend.\" 323 F. Supp. 2d at 217\nn.11.\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fofficers that he had never even been in the Escalade.                             As to\n\nwhether Boyd acquired the heroin while in Dessesaure's car, Officer\n\nJuan    Seoane,    who,    along      with   Broderick,       had   been    following\n\nDessesaure before Dessesaure picked up Boyd, testified that Boyd\n\ndid not appear to be carrying anything when he entered the vehicle.\n\nId.     However, Seoane also testified that he could not see an\n\nexchange being made while Boyd was in the Escalade.                      The district\n\ncourt noted that \"the bag was small and would not necessarily have\n\nbeen apparent to the surveilling officers.\"                   Id.\n\n            While    Broderick        remained       behind    with      Boyd,    other\n\nofficers,    including      Officer      Seoane,     continued      to    follow    the\n\nEscalade.    Dessesaure drove erratically after dropping Boyd off.\n\nId.    Seoane testified that, based on his experience, Dessesaure's\n\ndriving   was     consistent     with    that   of    drug    dealers      who,   after\n\nconducting a drug sale, attempt to make sure that they are not\n\nbeing followed.      Id.    Once the officers following Dessesaure were\n\ninformed that heroin had been found on Boyd, they pulled over the\n\nEscalade.    While the officers obtained no contraband from a pat-\n\nfrisk of Dessesaure and a search of the car, Seoane noted that\n\nDessesaure's pants zipper was open and his shirt was pulled out\n\nthrough his fly.      Id.    Seoane testified that in his experience, it\n\nwas common for a drug dealer to hide his wares in his rectum to\n\navoid   detection.         Id.   at    87-88.        The   implication      was    that\n\nDessesaure had put drugs in his rectum at home and just had\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fretrieved a bag to sell to Boyd.              Dessesaure was arrested on the\n\nstreet by Officer Seoane.         Id.\n\n            Officers took Dessesaure to the station house to be\n\nbooked; Seoane followed them in Dessesaure's car.                   Broderick\n\narrived a short time later. Broderick questioned Dessesaure at the\n\nbooking    desk.    Both   Broderick      and    Dessesaure   testified    that\n\nBroderick told Dessesaure he was going to get a warrant to search\n\nthe Quincy apartment.          When Broderick asked Dessesaure where he\n\nlived, Dessesaure replied that he lived in Roxbury.              That was not\n\ntrue; he lived in Quincy.           Broderick testified that he warned\n\nDessesaure at the booking desk that if heroin was found in his\n\napartment, his girlfriend could be charged.            Broderick stated that\n\nDessesaure then informed him of the location of the heroin in the\n\nQuincy apartment, with the hope that his girlfriend would not be\n\ncharged.      Id.   at   89.     Dessesaure      denied   ever   making   these\n\nstatements.     The district court noted that Broderick could not\n\nsatisfactorily explain why these statements were not recorded in\n\nany way, and thus gave \"no credit to Broderick's claims that\n\ndefendant made statements about drugs in his apartment.\"3                   Id.\n\n\n     3\n       In Dessesaure I, the district court found that there was an\ninconsistency between Broderick's statement that he told Dessesaure\nhis girlfriend could be charged and his earlier testimony that he\ndid not believe the girlfriend was involved. 314 F. Supp. 2d at 89\n& n.11.    In Dessesaure II, the district court modified this\nfinding, stating that the issue of \"[w]hether Broderick believed\nDessesaure's girlfriend was an 'active participant' in drug dealing\nor not a participant at all\" was immaterial. 323 F. Supp. 2d at\n215.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fAfter questioning Dessesaure, Broderick and other officers took\n\nDessesaure's keys and proceeded to the Quincy apartment for the\n\npurpose of \"freezing\" it on Broderick's way to get a warrant.             Id.\n\nThe goal of a \"freeze,\" it seems, is to secure a location to\n\nprevent its occupants from destroying evidence while a search\n\nwarrant is being obtained.\n\n            From the record, the government suggests to us and the\n\ndistrict court that Broderick thought he could enter the apartment\n\nto \"freeze it\" absent exigent circumstances based on vague and\n\nbroad language in a state court opinion.         See Dessesaure II, 323 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 216 & n.10 (discussing Commonwealth v. Alvarez, 661\n\nN.E.2d 1293 (Mass. 1996)).          The testimony of the officers at the\n\nsuppression hearing, however, dealt more with whether there were\n\nexigent circumstances justifying the pre-warrant entry.\n\n            Broderick testified that at the station house Seoane told\n\nhim that as Dessesaure was being arrested, Desseaure had yelled\n\nsomething    to   the   gathering    crowd   about   calling   \"his   peeps.\"\n\nDessesaure I, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 88.         Broderick took this statement\n\nto be an attempt by Dessesaure to communicate the fact of his\n\narrest to people who might be in a position to destroy evidence; he\n\ntestified that he believed Dessesaure's statement created exigent\n\ncircumstances necessitating a \"freeze\" of Dessesaure's apartment.\n\nId. at 88.    The district court did not believe Broderick, finding\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthat he had \"fabricated [Dessesaure's] alleged statement.\"4                       Id.\n\nSeoane testified that at the station house, he witnessed Dessesaure\n\nsign a written waiver of his Miranda rights.                        The government,\n\nhowever, was unable to produce the signed waiver, leading the\n\ndistrict court to the \"inevitable conclusion that [the waiver]\n\nsimply never existed.\"         Id. at 89 n.12.\n\n              At the station house, Seone followed up on his earlier\n\nobservation of Dessesaure's open pants zipper by conducting a strip\n\nsearch of Dessesaure.          Id. at 88.       He found that Dessesaure had\n\nsecreted a plastic bag containing six smaller plastic bags of\n\nheroin   in    his   rectum.      Seoane       also   found    sixty    dollars   in\n\nDessesaure's shirt pocket.         Id.    Seoane testified that Dessesaure\n\nlater told him he was selling bags of heroin for sixty dollars, but\n\nthe district court noted that \"[t]his statement was not recorded in\n\nany police document.\"       Id. at 88-89.\n\n              In   the   meantime,   Broderick        and     the    officers   used\n\nDessesaure's keys to enter the Quincy apartment and found Tina Tate\n\n\n\n     4\n       In Dessesaure I, the court found that this fabrication came\n\"when [Broderick] knew the warrantless entry was being challenged\nand he needed to come up with some exigency to justify it.\" 314 F.\nSupp. 2d at 88. In Dessesaure II, however, the court modified this\nfinding, and held that \"the record is not clear about what Officer\nBroderick specifically knew or did not know of the Court's concerns\nat the moment he took the stand, or whether he gleaned that concern\nfrom his questioning at the hearing or from his pre-trial\npreparation, or was just 'gilding the lily,' as they say, on his\nown.\"   323 F. Supp. 2d at 214.      Nonetheless, the court still\nconcluded that \"what Broderick reported Dessesaure had said at his\narrest was not true.\" Id.\n\n                                         -8-\n\finside.   Id. at 89.      The officers detained Tate and made a number\n\nof observations which were used shortly thereafter in the warrant\n\naffidavit.      The    items    observed      and   recited    in   the   affidavit\n\nincluded \"sixteen (16) 'bundles' of glassine bags, five (5) loose\n\nglassine bags, a large plastic bag containing a powder believed to\n\nbe Heroin, a digital scale, a roll of tape, a box containing\n\nhundreds of empty glassine bags, a bag of small black elastics, a\n\nceramic plate with two plastic [transit] passes.\"                         Broderick\n\ntestified that he then telephoned back to the station house, where\n\nDessesaure   was      being    detained,     and    informed    Seoane    what    the\n\nofficers had found in Dessesaure's apartment.                  Id. at 90.    Seoane\n\ntestified that when he informed Dessesaure what was found during\n\nthe \"freeze\" of the apartment, Dessesaure gave him additional\n\ninformation about the drugs.          Id.     The district court disbelieved\n\nSeoane's testimony on this point.              Id. (\"I do not find Seoane's\n\naccount of Dessesaure's statements credible.\").\n\n           After five to ten minutes in Dessesaure's apartment,\n\nBroderick went to the District Attorney's office to prepare a\n\nwarrant affidavit and to apply for a search warrant, as he had\n\nearlier said that he would, leaving behind other officers at the\n\napartment to maintain the freeze.                   In the warrant affidavit,\n\nBroderick included the following: (1) information he received from\n\nhis   sources   before        the   police    began    surveillance;        (2)   the\n\nregistration information of the Escalade showing that it belonged\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fto Dessesaure and was registered at the Quincy address; (3) a\n\ndescription of the February 24th surveillance of Dessesaure, as\n\nrelated above; (4) the fact that Dessesaure had concealed bags of\n\nheroin in his body; (5) the statements Dessesaure purportedly made\n\nat the station regarding the location of heroin in the Quincy\n\napartment, both before and after the freeze; and (6) the items\n\nobserved in plain view at the apartment during the freeze.            Id.\n\nThe magistrate granted the warrant application.       During the search\n\npursuant to this warrant, officers seized a gun, bullets, more\n\ndrugs and drug paraphernalia, money, and documents, in addition to\n\nthe items which been observed during the pre-warrant search.         Id.\n\n          Dessesaure    challenged    his   arrest   as   being   without\n\nprobable cause and sought to suppress evidence from the time of the\n\narrest, from his person while he was at the station house, and from\n\nhis apartment.    The district court found that, while it was \"a\n\nclose case,\" there was probable cause for Dessesaure's arrest on\n\nthe street.   Id. at 91.     The search at the station house was, as a\n\nresult, also justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest.\n\nId. Nonetheless, the district court granted Dessesaure's motion to\n\nsuppress the evidence found in his apartment on the grounds that\n\nthere was no exigency that would justify a warrantless entry and\n\nthat any testimony by Broderick suggesting exigent circumstances\n\nwas not credible.      Id.     The district court found that absent\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fexigency, the pre-warrant entry into the apartment constituted a\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.            Id. at 92-93.\n\n           The   district      court     further     found    that   the   warrant\n\naffidavit used tainted information, that is, (1) the observations\n\nmade pursuant to the illegal pre-warrant entry, and (2) Broderick\n\nand Seoane's testimony as to statements made by Dessesaure while in\n\ncustody regarding the location of heroin in his apartment, which\n\nthe court had found to be fabricated.           Id. at 93-94.        The district\n\ncourt concluded that the remaining untainted evidence \"[did] not\n\nsuffice to create probable cause to conclude that Dessesaure kept\n\ndrugs in his apartment, or anywhere else besides his car\" and so\n\nsuppressed all the evidence found in the apartment.                    Id. at 94.\n\nThe government appeals only this finding as to probable cause and\n\nthe   suppression   of   the    evidence      from   Dessesaure's      apartment,\n\nleaving unchallenged the court's underlying findings regarding the\n\nlegality of the warrantless entry and the falsity of the officers'\n\ntestimony.5\n\n                                       II.\n\n           We    turn    to    whether    the      district    court    erred   in\n\nsuppressing the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.\n\nOur review is bifurcated; factual findings are examined for clear\n\n\n      5\n       To summarize, the evidence from Dessesaure's home that the\ngovernment argues the district court improperly suppressed includes\ndrugs and drug paraphernalia, glassine bags and bag ties, a digital\nscale, a ceramic plate with two transit passes, a roll of tape, a\ngun, bullets, money, and documents.\n\n                                       -11-\n\ferror, while ultimate questions as to whether the later search\n\nunder the warrant violated the Fourth Amendment are reviewed\n\nde novo.      See United States v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n              The   district     court's    analysis,    as   it   correctly\n\narticulated, was governed by Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154\n\n(1978), and Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533 (1988).                Under\n\nthe procedure set forth in Franks, a court faced with a warrant\n\naffidavit which includes deliberately or reckless false statements\n\nmust set aside those false statements and determine whether the\n\nremaining information in the affidavit sets forth sufficient facts\n\nto support a finding of probable cause.          Franks, 438 U.S. at 171-\n\n72. Although it is not explicitly tied to the \"independent source\"\n\ndoctrine,6 Franks requires an analogous inquiry: whether, ignoring\n\nthe false statements, the remaining information in a warrant\n\napplication is an independent source of the discovered material.\n\n              In Murray, police officers, after conducting an illegal\n\nsearch   of    a    warehouse,   obtained   a   search   warrant   for   that\n\nwarehouse, although the information observed during the illegal\n\n\n     6\n       The independent source doctrine acts as a limitation on the\nexclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment. The doctrine \"allows\nadmission of evidence that has been discovered by means wholly\nindependent of any constitutional violation.\" Nix v. Williams, 467\nU.S. 431, 443 (1984); see also Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S.\n471, 487 (1963) (\"[T]he exclusionary rule has no application [when]\nthe Government learned of the evidence 'from an independent source'\n. . . .\" (quoting Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251\nU.S. 385, 392 (1920))).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fsearch was not included in the warrant affidavit.   487 U.S. at 535-\n\n36.   Murray held that the \"ultimate question\" was \"whether the\n\nsearch pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely independent\n\nsource of the information and tangible evidence at issue here.\"\n\n487 U.S. at 542.   The Court held that in two situations, the search\n\nwould not be an independent source: (1) \"if the agents' decision to\n\nseek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the\n\ninitial entry\"; and (2) \"if information obtained during that entry\n\nwas presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue\n\nthe warrant.\"   Id.\n\n          Unlike in Franks, the constitutional violation in this\n\ncase was not solely the inclusion of deliberate or reckless false\n\nstatements in a warrant application, but also an illegal search.\n\nHowever, unlike in Murray, the observations made during the illegal\n\nentry were included in the warrant affidavit, making this situation\n\nripe for a Franks analysis.\n\n          This case requires us to attempt to reconcile the Court's\n\ninstructions in Franks and Murray.     Prior to Murray, this court\n\nheld that, when considering a warrant that contained information\n\nobtained through an illegal search, a simple Franks analysis was\n\nappropriate. See United States v. Veillette, 778 F.2d 899, 903-904\n\n(1st Cir. 1985) (\"[B]ales of marihuana [observed during an illegal\n\nsearch] should be set to one side . . . and the remaining content\n\nof the affidavit examined to determine whether there was probable\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fcause to search, apart from the tainted averments.\").           Most other\n\ncircuits followed the same approach.         See, e.g., United States v.\n\nAlexander, 761 F.2d 1294, 1300 (9th Cir. 1985); United States v.\n\nAntone, 753 F.2d 1301, 1307 (5th Cir. 1985); James v. United\n\nStates, 418 F.2d 1150, 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1969).        The question for us\n\nnow is whether the Court's subsequent decision in Murray requires\n\na different analysis in the context of observations made during an\n\nillegal search.\n\n           Murray states as a first criterion that a search pursuant\n\nto a warrant does not come from an independent source \"if the\n\nagent's decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had\n\nseen during their initial [illegal] entry.\"              487 U.S. at 542.\n\nAgain, there is a seeming tension between this inquiry and Franks,\n\nwhich only requires a determination that the affidavit still\n\nsupports a finding of probable cause if the illegal information is\n\nexcised.   See United States v. Beltran, 917 F.2d 641, 644 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (noting but not resolving this tension).              The cases on\n\nMurray's first prong are reconcilable, as we discuss below.\n\n           As to the second prong, read literally, the Murray\n\nstatement that a search pursuant to a warrant would not be an\n\n\"independent   source\"   of   the   seized    material    \"if   information\n\nobtained during [the initial] entry was presented to the Magistrate\n\nand affected his decision to issue the warrant,\" Murray, 487 U.S.\n\nat 542, seems in considerable tension with continued use of the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fFranks    procedure   for    evaluating     tainted   material   in    warrant\n\napplications.      When a warrant application contains deliberate or\n\nreckless false statements, Franks does not require a separate\n\nevaluation    of   whether    the   warrant    magistrate's   decision    was\n\n\"affected\" by the falsehoods.\n\n            Indeed,   since    illegally      obtained   information    could\n\n\"affect\" the decision of the magistrate without changing the\n\nultimate decision to grant the warrant, broad application of the\n\nadditional analysis suggested by Murray would work against the\n\nprinciple that the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine not be\n\nused to place the government in a worse position than it would have\n\nbeen in absent its illegal conduct. See Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S.\n\n431, 443 (1984); see also United States v. Jenkins, 396 F.3d 751,\n\n758-59 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n            Every circuit to consider the question has held that the\n\nCourt's instruction in Murray to analyze whether the tainted\n\ninformation affected the magistrate's decision to issue the warrant\n\ndid not mean to change the dominant pre-existing approach under\n\nFranks.    See Jenkins, 396 F.3d at 757-60 (\"[A]uthority from this\n\nand other circuits, as well as the principles underlying the Murray\n\nrule, support an interpretation of the independent source rule that\n\nincorporates consideration of the sufficiency of the untainted\n\naffidavit to see if probable cause exists without the tainted\n\ninformation.\"); United States v. Markling, 7 F.3d 1309, 1316 (7th\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fCir. 1993) (\"[T]here is no indication in Murray that the Court\n\nintended to reject -- or even that it was considering -- the\n\nprevailing Franks-based rule.       A rule focusing on the tainted\n\ninformation's actual influence on a particular magistrate would be\n\ninconsistent with Franks; yet, the Court in Murray did not cite\n\nFranks, much less attempt to reconcile Murray with Franks.\");\n\nUnited States v. Restrepo, 966 F.2d 964, 968-70 (5th Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"The   relevant   phrase   ('affected   his   decision   to   issue   the\n\nwarrant'), almost certainly was simply a paraphrase -- albeit a\n\nconfusing one when considered noncontextually -- of the approach\n\nlong sanctioned in the circuits.\"); United States v. Herrold, 962\n\nF.2d 1131, 1141 (3d Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he Court's use of 'affect' in\n\nMurray must be understood to signify affect in a substantive\n\nmanner.\"   (emphasis in original)).      We agree.\n\n           Furthermore, other circuits, including this one, have\n\nimplicitly adopted the same approach, applying the Franks analysis\n\nwithout engaging in consideration of the effect of the illegality\n\non the magistrate's thought process as suggested by Murray.            See\n\nUnited States v. Ford, 22 F.3d 374, 379 (1st Cir. 1994);          United\n\nStates v. Davis, 313 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Halliman, 923 F.2d 873, 880-81 (D.C. Cir. 1991); United\n\nStates v. Gillenwaters, 890 F.2d 679, 681-82 (4th Cir. 1989).\n\n           We hold that the Court in Murray did not intend to add\n\nanything to the pre-existing Franks approach to evaluating warrant\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fapplications containing tainted information when it stated that\n\ncourts     should   ask   whether   such    information    \"affected    [the\n\nMagistrate's] decision to issue the warrant.\"           Murray, 487 U.S. at\n\n542.       Thus, when faced with a warrant containing information\n\nobtained pursuant to an illegal search, a reviewing court must\n\nexcise the offending information and evaluate whether what remains\n\nis sufficient to establish probable cause.\n\n             There of course remains the separate question of whether\n\nthe first Murray requirement -- that the police would have sought\n\nthe warrant even in the absence of the tainted material -- was\n\nmeant to place an additional gloss on the Franks analysis.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             Two questions must be addressed here: (1) whether \"the\n\nagents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had\n\nseen during their initial entry,\"         Murray, 487 U.S. at 542, and (2)\n\nwhether     the   affidavit   contained    sufficient    facts   to   support\n\nprobable cause when the offending facts were excised.7           We address\n\nthe probable cause issue first.\n\n             As to probable cause, the district court concluded that\n\nthe untainted facts in the warrant application were insufficient to\n\nsupport probable cause for a search of the apartment.            Dessesaure\n\n\n       7\n       We take it as given that the warrant affidavit contains\ndeliberate or reckless falsehoods -- the station house statements\npurportedly made by Dessesaure -- and information obtained pursuant\nto an illegal search -- the observations of the officers during\ntheir \"freeze\" of Dessesaure's apartment.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fI, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 94.    The district court framed the second\n\nquestion as asking whether officers would have sought the warrant\n\nif their illegal search had turned up nothing, and concluded that\n\nthe officers would not have continued pursuing the warrant.     We\n\nreview the conclusion that the cleansed affidavit was insufficient\n\nunder the special de novo review provisions set forth in Ornelas v.\n\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996).   See United States v. Smith,\n\n423 F.3d 25, 31 n.4. (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining that under\n\nOrnelas, review of the Fourth Amendment conclusion is de novo, but\n\ndeference is owed to the inferences drawn from facts found by the\n\nissuing court and by law enforcement officers).8        As to the\n\n\n     8\n       There is a separate question of the lens through which the\naction of the issuing magistrate is viewed. In Illinois v. Gates,\n462 U.S. 213 (1983), the Court held that \"after-the-fact scrutiny\nby courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit should not take the\nform of de novo review.\" Id. at 236. Rather, \"[a] magistrate's\ndetermination of probable cause should be paid great deference by\nreviewing courts.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus,\nthe issuing magistrate's decision should be reviewed to determine\nonly that there was a \"substantial basis for . . . [concluding]\nthat a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.\" Id. (omission\nand alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see\nalso United States v. Ribeiro, 397 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2005)\n(using \"substantial basis\" analysis). An aspect of this deference\nis that \"[i]n a doubtful or marginal case, the court defers to the\nissuing magistrate's determination of probable cause.\"       United\nStates v. Greenburg, 410 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting\nUnited States v. Barnard 299 F.3d 90, 92-93 (1st Cir. 2002));\nsee also Gates, 462 U.S. at 236 n.10.        There is a split of\nauthority on whether, in a criminal case, deference to the decision\nof the issuing magistrate still applies when material portions of\nan affidavit are stricken for intentional misrepresentation or\nillegality.   Compare United States v. Barajas-Avalos, 377 F.3d\n1040, 1058 (9th Cir. 2004) (de novo review), and United States v.\nElkins, 300 F.3d 638, 651-52 (6th Cir. 2002) (same), with United\nStates v. Kirk, 781 F.2d 1498, 1505-06 (11th Cir. 1986) (applying\n\n                               -18-\n\fquestion regarding Murray's first prong, we review the district\n\ncourt's conclusions of law de novo, and, giving the defendant the\n\nbenefit here, we review the factual determination under a clear\n\nerror standard.    The district court was in error.\n\nA.         Probable Cause\n\n           We find that the affidavit still contained sufficient\n\ninformation   to   support   probable   cause   to   search   the   Quincy\n\napartment even after striking from it all evidence found by the\n\ndistrict court to either be untruthful or illegally obtained.\n\n           What concerned the district court was whether there was\n\nprobable cause to search Dessesaure's apartment, as opposed to his\n\ncar.   The court reasoned that just because a defendant is arrested\n\ndealing drugs from his car does not mean that there is probable\n\ncause to believe that the defendant's home would likely yield\n\nevidence connected with his drug dealing.        Dessesaure I, 314 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 94.       The government in response talks about the\n\ninherent unlikelihood that the defendant would store valuable drugs\n\nin the car, or insert drugs into his rectum while in the car.          We\n\nneed not analyze the district court's proposition, because here\n\nthere was far more evidence for probable cause than simply the\n\ndrugs found in Dessesaure's car and on his person.\n\n\nsubstantial basis test).       This circuit has never squarely\nconfronted this issue, and the parties here do not address it.\nGiving the defendant the benefit of the rule favorable to him,\narguendo, we do not rely on any presumption in favor of the issuing\nmagistrate's determination.\n\n                                 -19-\n\f              The    vehicle      in   which     Dessesaure    was   traveling   and\n\napprehended was registered in his name at the address of the\n\napartment searched.            The police found traces of white powder,\n\nwhich, from their experience and observation, they thought (but did\n\nnot test) to be heroin, on the garbage bags Dessesaure took to the\n\ntrash from the apartment. When Dessesaure was arrested, the police\n\ntestified, he tried to lead them down a false trail, denying that\n\nhe lived where he did; a likely reason is that he had something to\n\nhide at the apartment.            When Dessesaure picked up Boyd, Dessesaure\n\nhad just come from his apartment, making it likely that the drugs\n\nhe   sold    to     Boyd   came    from    the    apartment.     Dessesaure   drove\n\nerratically as he returned under surveillance to his apartment.\n\nThe affidavit stated that he drove this way to throw off anyone\n\nfollowing him, again suggesting he had drugs in his apartment, a\n\nsuggestion strengthened by his subsequent lies about where he\n\nlived.      These facts were more than adequate to constitute probable\n\ncause.      See United States v. Ribeiro, 397 F.3d 43, 48-52 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (finding sufficient \"nexus\" between activities described in\n\nwarrant affidavit and defendant's residence to establish probable\n\ncause to search residence);               United States v. Keene, 341 F.3d 78,\n\n82 (1st Cir. 2003) (same);             United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 86\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (same).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\fB.             Whether the Warrant Was Prompted by the Illegal Search\n\n               We turn back to the first Murray prong, which requires\n\nthat 'the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely\n\nindependent source' and that the agents' decision to seek the\n\nwarrant not have been prompted by what the police observed during\n\nthe prior search.         Murray, 487 U.S. at 542.             As the Court wrote,\n\n\"to determine whether the warrant was independent of the illegal\n\nentry, one must ask whether it would have been sought even if what\n\nactually happened had not occurred.\"               Id. at 542 n.3.         The second\n\nMurray prong, is, as we have held, wholly objective in its focus.\n\nBy contrast, as articulated by Murray in 1988, the first prong\n\nappeared to be subjective: would these particular police officers\n\nhave sought the warrant even if they had not known, as a result of\n\nthe illegal search, that drugs were present in the apartment.                      See\n\nid., 487 U.S. at 542 n.3; Restrepo, 966 F.2d at 971-72.9                     While the\n\nfirst       prong   of   Murray    is   articulated     as     a    subjective   test,\n\nnonetheless, it should not be proven by purely subjective means.\n\nIn making the factual determination as to the police officers'\n\nintent,       the   district      court   is     not   bound       by   after-the-fact\n\nassurances of their intent, but instead must assess the totality of\n\n\n        9\n       Since Murray, the Court has, without commenting on Murray's\nfirst prong, eschewed use of subjective intent in certain Fourth\nAmendment analyses as to whether there is probable cause to support\nan arrest. See Devenpeck v. Alford, 125 S.Ct. 588, 594 (2004);\nWhren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 811-13 (1996). We need not\ndetermine today whether Whren and Devenpeck have affected the\nsubjective analysis mandated by the first prong of Murray.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fthe attendant circumstances to ascertain whether those assurances\n\nappear \"implausible.\"   Murray, 487 U.S. at 540 n.2; see Restrepo,\n\n966 F.2d at 971-72; see also Devenpeck v. Alford, 125 S.Ct. 588,\n\n594 (2004) (\"Subjective intent of the arresting officer, however it\n\nis determined (and of course subjective intent is always determined\n\nby objective means) . . . .\").\n\n          Applying the first prong of Murray, it is clear that\n\nobjectively the officers were not prompted to seek the warrant by\n\nwhat they saw in the apartment.         Significantly, Dessesaure and\n\nOfficer Broderick both testified that Broderick informed Dessesaure\n\nat the station prior to the initial entry into the defendant's\n\napartment that the police were going to apply for a search warrant.\n\nIndeed, the freezing of the apartment (whether done for exigent\n\ncircumstances or not) was done on Broderick's way to get a warrant.\n\nBroderick left Dessesaure's apartment after spending only five or\n\nten minutes there to go directly to the District Attorney's office\n\nand prepare a warrant application.       Moreover, even if there had\n\nbeen no illegal entry into the apartment and the officers lacked\n\nknowledge that drugs were present there, there is no evidence to\n\nsuggest that these officers would not have sought a warrant.\n\nIndeed, the absence of knowledge of the evidence viewed via the\n\nillegal access could only have encouraged them further to seek a\n\nwarrant, as that would have been their only way to have sought out\n\nthe evidence in the apartment they obviously suspected to exist and\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fdesired to see.   The facts gathered legally, without resort to the\n\nfacts gathered illegally, provided an independent and adequate\n\nsource for the warrant application.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            One other issue deserves comment. Taking it as true that\n\nthe officers lied (over the government's protest that this is an\n\nunfair characterization), the district court was understandably\n\nunhappy.    The record shows more than a touch of frustration and\n\nbuilding tension.     At least some members of the Boston Police\n\nDepartment may have mistakenly believed that they were free, absent\n\na search warrant or exigent circumstances, to enter a dwelling in\n\norder to \"freeze\" the scene.   The district court was quite correct\n\nto state strongly that this is not the law:\n\n     There is no question that the police had no right to\n     \"freeze\" the Quincy apartment where that meant entering\n     it, looking around, searching, all the while ostensibly\n     waiting for someone to get a warrant. Nothing in First\n     Circuit or Supreme Court case law remotely justifies such\n     a step. Nor should it. Searching without a warrant, on\n     the assumption that the magistrate will no doubt agree\n     with the officers that there is probable cause to search\n     that location at that time, makes a mockery of Fourth\n     Amendment protection.    The warrant, and the review it\n     requires, is reduced to a technicality.\n\nDessesaure I, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 92.\n\n            The allowance of the motion to suppress was error and is\n\nreversed.    The case is remanded to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f",

Accepting as accurate these factual conclusions, we nonetheless disagree with the trial court's ultimate conclusion that suppression was required. Rather, we find that, even after striking the offending material from the warrant, there was adequate basis for a probable cause determination and the officers would have sought a warrant regardless. We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For our purposes, a greatly streamlined version of the facts taken from the suppression hearing, geared to the issues described above, is all that is necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation of Dessesaure began when Officer John Broderick, Jr. received information from \"different sources\" that Dessesaure was selling heroin out of a maroon Cadillac Escalade with a particular license plate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 83. The license plate number given by the sources matched that of a maroon Cadillac Escalade registered to Dessesaure at an address in Quincy, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early hours of February 24, 2003, police began surveillance on the Quincy apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 86. At 9:00 a.m., Officer Paul Quinn observed Dessesaure leave the Quincy apartment and throw a trash bag in a dumpster before he drove off. <i>Id.</i> Quinn recovered the trash bag and found a \"residue of an unknown powder substance\" and a utility bill with Dessesaure's name and the address of the Quincy apartment. The residue was not field tested to confirm that it was heroin. <i>Id.</i> Officers followed Dessesaure in his Escalade to a home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood and saw Dessesaure enter, carrying a black shoulder bag. <i>Id.</i> He emerged two minutes later, as did his girlfriend, Tina Tate. <i>Id.</i> at 86-87. The police followed Dessesaure to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where Tate went in and returned ten minutes later. <i>Id.</i> at 87. The police then lost surveillance for some time. When they reestablished contact with the car again at approximately 11:15 a.m., Dessesaure and Tate were returning to Quincy. <i>Id.</i> Dessesaure made a number of evasive maneuvers as he drove and did not take the most direct route back to the Quincy apartment. <i>Id.</i> Officer Broderick testified that such driving is often employed by drug traffickers to see if they are being followed by law enforcement officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dessesaure and Tate returned to the Quincy apartment. Approximately 20 minutes later, Dessesaure left alone and drove into Boston, followed by the officers. <i>Id.</i> Once in Boston, Dessesaure pulled his Escalade over on a street in the South End and picked up a man, Nelson Boyd. Dessesaure drove Boyd for a few blocks and stopped. <i>Id.</i> Boyd got out of the car and Dessesaure drove away. Police officers, including Broderick, stopped Boyd and searched him, recovering a plastic bag they supposed, based on their experience, contained heroin. <i>Id.</i> Boyd lied, telling officers that he had never even been in the Escalade. As to whether Boyd acquired the heroin while in Dessesaure's car, Officer Juan Seoane, who, along with Broderick, had been following Dessesaure before Dessesaure picked up Boyd, testified that Boyd did not appear to be carrying anything when he entered the vehicle. <i>Id.</i> However, Seoane also testified that he could not see an exchange being made while Boyd was in the Escalade. The district court noted that \"the bag was small and would not necessarily have been apparent to the surveilling officers.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Broderick remained behind with Boyd, other officers, including Officer Seoane, continued to follow the Escalade. Dessesaure drove erratically after dropping Boyd off. <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that, based on his experience, Dessesaure's driving was consistent with that of drug dealers who, after conducting a drug sale, attempt to make sure that they are not being followed. <i>Id.</i> Once the officers following Dessesaure were informed that heroin had been found on Boyd, they pulled over the Escalade. While the officers obtained no contraband from a pat-frisk of Dessesaure and a search of the car, Seoane noted that Dessesaure's pants zipper was open and his shirt was pulled out through his fly. <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that in his experience, it was common for a drug dealer to hide his wares in his rectum to avoid detection. <i>Id.</i> at 87-88. The implication was that Dessesaure had put drugs in his rectum at home and just had retrieved a bag to sell to Boyd. Dessesaure was arrested on the street by Officer Seoane. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers took Dessesaure to the station house to be booked; Seoane followed them in Dessesaure's car. Broderick arrived a short time later. Broderick questioned Dessesaure at the booking desk. Both Broderick and Dessesaure testified that Broderick told Dessesaure he was going to get a warrant to search the Quincy apartment. When Broderick asked Dessesaure where he lived, Dessesaure replied that he lived in Roxbury. That was not true; he lived in Quincy. Broderick testified that he warned Dessesaure at the booking desk that if heroin was found in his apartment, his girlfriend could be charged. Broderick stated that Dessesaure then informed him of the location of the heroin in the Quincy apartment, with the hope that his girlfriend would not be charged. <i>Id.</i> at 89. Dessesaure denied ever making these statements. The district court noted that Broderick could not satisfactorily explain why these statements were not recorded in any way, and thus gave \"no credit to Broderick's claims that defendant made statements about drugs in his apartment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> After questioning Dessesaure, Broderick and other officers took Dessesaure's keys and proceeded to the Quincy apartment for the purpose of \"freezing\" it on Broderick's way to get a warrant. <i>Id.</i> The goal of a \"freeze,\" it seems, is to secure a location to prevent its occupants from destroying evidence while a search warrant is being obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the record, the government suggests to us and the district court that Broderick thought he could enter the apartment to \"freeze it\" absent exigent circumstances based on vague and broad language in a state court opinion. <i>See Dessesaure II,</i> 323 F.Supp.2d at 216 &amp; n. 10 (discussing <i>Commonwealth v. Alvarez,</i> 422 Mass. 198, 661 N.E.2d 1293 (1996)). The testimony of the officers at the suppression hearing, however, dealt more with whether there were exigent circumstances justifying the pre-warrant entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broderick testified that at the station house Seoane told him that as Dessesaure was being arrested, Desseaure had yelled something to the gathering crowd about calling \"his peeps.\" <i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 88. Broderick took this statement to be an attempt by Dessesaure to communicate the fact of his arrest to people who might be in a position to destroy evidence; he testified that he believed Dessesaure's statement created exigent circumstances necessitating a \"freeze\" of Dessesaure's apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 88. The district court did not believe Broderick, finding that he had \"fabricated [Dessesaure's] alleged statement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that at the station house, he witnessed Dessesaure sign a written waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. The government, however, was unable to produce the signed waiver, leading the district court to the \"inevitable conclusion that [the waiver] simply never existed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 89 n. 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station house, Seone followed up on his earlier observation of Dessesaure's open pants zipper by conducting a strip search of Dessesaure. <i>Id.</i> at 88. He found that Dessesaure had secreted a plastic bag containing six smaller plastic bags of heroin in his rectum. Seoane also found sixty dollars in Dessesaure's shirt pocket. <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that Dessesaure later told him he was selling bags of heroin for sixty dollars, but the district court noted that \"[t]his statement was not recorded in any police document.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Broderick and the officers used Dessesaure's keys to enter the Quincy apartment and found Tina Tate inside. <i>Id.</i> at 89. The officers detained Tate and made a number of observations which were used shortly thereafter in the warrant affidavit. The items observed and recited in the affidavit included \"sixteen (16) `bundles' of glassine bags, five (5) loose glassine bags, a large plastic bag containing a powder believed to be Heroin, a digital scale, a roll of tape, a box containing hundreds of empty glassine bags, a bag of small black elastics, a ceramic plate with two plastic [transit] passes.\" Broderick testified that he then telephoned back to the station house, where Dessesaure was being detained, and informed Seoane what the officers had found in Dessesaure's apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 90. Seoane testified that when he informed Dessesaure what was found during the \"freeze\" of the apartment, Dessesaure gave him additional information about the drugs. <i>Id.</i> The district court disbelieved Seoane's testimony on this point. <i>Id.</i> (\"I do not find Seoane's account of Dessesaure's statements credible.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After five to ten minutes in Dessesaure's apartment, Broderick went to the District Attorney's office to prepare a warrant affidavit and to apply for a search warrant, as he had earlier said that he would, leaving behind other officers at the apartment to maintain the freeze. In the warrant affidavit, Broderick included the following: (1) information he received from his sources before the police began surveillance; (2) the registration information of the Escalade showing that it belonged to Dessesaure and was registered at the Quincy address; (3) a description of the February 24th surveillance of Dessesaure, as related above; (4) the fact that Dessesaure had concealed bags of heroin in his body; (5) the statements Dessesaure purportedly made at the station regarding the location of heroin in the Quincy apartment, both before and after the freeze; and (6) the items observed in plain view at the apartment during the freeze. <i>Id.</i> The magistrate granted the warrant application. During the search pursuant to this warrant, officers seized a gun, bullets, more drugs and drug paraphernalia, money, and documents, in addition to the items which been observed during the pre-warrant search. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dessesaure challenged his arrest as being without probable cause and sought to suppress evidence from the time of the arrest, from his person while he was at the station house, and from his apartment. The district court found that, while it was \"a close case,\" there was probable cause for Dessesaure's arrest on the street. <i>Id.</i> at 91. The search at the station house was, as a result, also justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest. <i>Id.</i> Nonetheless, the district court granted Dessesaure's motion to suppress the evidence found in his apartment on the grounds that there was no exigency that would justify a warrantless entry and that any testimony by Broderick suggesting exigent circumstances was not credible. <i>Id.</i> The district court found that absent exigency, the pre-warrant entry into the apartment constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 92-93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further found that the warrant affidavit used tainted information, that is, (1) the observations made pursuant to the illegal pre-warrant entry, and (2) Broderick and Seoane's testimony as to statements made by Dessesaure while in custody regarding the location of heroin in his apartment, which the court had found to be fabricated. <i>Id.</i> at 93-94. The district court concluded that the remaining untainted evidence \"[did] not suffice to create probable cause to conclude that Dessesaure kept drugs in his apartment, or anywhere else besides his car\" and so suppressed all the evidence found in the apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 94. The government appeals only this finding as to probable cause and the suppression of the evidence from Dessesaure's apartment, leaving unchallenged the court's underlying findings regarding the legality of the warrantless entry and the falsity of the officers' testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to whether the district court erred in suppressing the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant. Our review is bifurcated; factual findings are examined for clear error, while ultimate questions as to whether the later search under the warrant violated the Fourth Amendment are reviewed <i>de novo. See United States v. Weidul,</i> 325 F.3d 50, 51 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis, as it correctly articulated, was governed by <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), and <i>Murray v. United States,</i> 487 U.S. 533, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988). Under the procedure set forth in <i>Franks,</i> a court faced with a warrant affidavit which includes deliberately or reckless false statements must set aside those false statements and determine whether the remaining information in the affidavit sets forth sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause. <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Although it is not explicitly tied to the \"independent source\" doctrine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Franks</i> requires an analogous inquiry: whether, ignoring the false statements, the remaining information in a warrant application is an independent source of the discovered material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Murray,</i> police officers, after conducting an illegal search of a warehouse, obtained a search warrant for that warehouse, although the information observed during the illegal search was not included in the warrant affidavit. 487 U.S. at 535-36, 108 S.Ct. 2529. <i>Murray</i> held that the \"ultimate question\" was \"whether the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely independent source of the information and tangible evidence at issue here.\" 487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529. The Court held that in two situations, the search would not be an independent source: (1) \"if the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry\"; and (2) \"if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike in <i>Franks,</i> the constitutional violation in this case was not solely the inclusion of deliberate or reckless false statements in a warrant application, but also an illegal search. However, unlike in <i>Murray,</i> the observations made during the illegal entry were included in the warrant affidavit, making this situation ripe for a <i>Franks</i> analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case requires us to attempt to reconcile the Court's instructions in <i>Franks</i> and <i>Murray.</i> Prior to <i>Murray,</i> this court held that, when considering a warrant that contained information obtained through an illegal search, a simple <i>Franks</i> analysis was appropriate. <i>See United States v. Veillette,</i> 778 F.2d 899, 903-904 (1st Cir.1985) (\"[B]ales of marihuana [observed during an illegal search] should be set to one side ... and the remaining content of the affidavit examined to determine whether there was probable cause to search, apart from the tainted averments.\"). Most other circuits followed the same approach. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Alexander,</i> 761 F.2d 1294, 1300 (9th Cir.1985); <i>United States v. Antone,</i> 753 F.2d 1301, 1307 (5th Cir.1985); <i>James v. United States,</i> 418 F.2d 1150, 1151 (D.C.Cir.1969). The question for us now is whether the Court's subsequent decision in <i>Murray</i> requires a different analysis in the context of observations made during an illegal search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Murray</i> states as a first criterion that a search pursuant to a warrant does not come from an independent source \"if the agent's decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during their initial [illegal] entry.\" 487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529. Again, there is a seeming tension between this inquiry and <i>Franks,</i> which only requires a determination that the affidavit still supports a finding of probable cause if the illegal information is excised. <i>See United States v. Beltran,</i> 917 F.2d 641, 644 (1st Cir.1990) (noting but not resolving this tension). The cases on <i>Murray</i>'s first prong are reconcilable, as we discuss below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second prong, read literally, the <i>Murray</i> statement that a search pursuant to a warrant would not be an \"independent source\" of the seized material \"if information obtained during [the initial] entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant,\" <i>Murray,</i> 487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529, seems in considerable tension with continued use of the <i>Franks</i> procedure for evaluating tainted material in warrant applications. When a warrant application contains deliberate or reckless false statements, <i>Franks</i> does not require a separate evaluation of whether the warrant magistrate's decision was \"affected\" by the falsehoods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, since illegally obtained information could \"affect\" the decision of the magistrate without changing the ultimate decision to grant the warrant, broad application of the additional analysis suggested by <i>Murray</i> would work against the principle that the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine not be used to place the government in a worse position than it would have been in absent its illegal conduct. <i>See Nix v. Williams,</i> 467 U.S. 431, 443, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984); <i>see also United States v. Jenkins,</i> 396 F.3d 751, 758-59 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every circuit to consider the question has held that the Court's instruction in <i>Murray</i> to analyze whether the tainted information affected the magistrate's decision to issue the warrant did not mean to change the dominant pre-existing approach under <i>Franks. See Jenkins,</i> 396 F.3d at 757-60 (\"[A]uthority from this and other circuits, as well as the principles underlying the <i>Murray</i> rule, support an interpretation of the independent source rule that incorporates consideration of the sufficiency of the untainted affidavit to see if probable cause exists without the tainted information.\"); <i>United States v. Markling,</i> 7 F.3d 1309, 1316 (7th Cir.1993) (\"[T]here is no indication in <i>Murray</i> that the Court intended to reject &#8212; or even that it was considering &#8212; the prevailing <i>Franks</i>-based rule. A rule focusing on the tainted information's actual influence on a particular magistrate would be inconsistent with <i>Franks.</i>; yet, the Court in <i>Murray</i> did not cite <i>Franks,</i> much less attempt to reconcile <i>Murray</i> with <i>Franks.</i>\"); <i>United States v. Restrepo,</i> 966 F.2d 964, 968-70 (5th Cir.1992) (\"The relevant phrase (`affected his decision to issue the warrant'), almost certainly was simply a paraphrase &#8212; albeit a confusing one when considered noncontextually &#8212; of the approach long sanctioned in the circuits.\"); <i>United States v. Herrold,</i> 962 F.2d 1131, 1141 (3d Cir.1992) (\"[T]he Court's use of `affect' in <i>Murray</i> must be understood to signify affect in a <i>substantive</i> manner.\" (emphasis in original)). We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, other circuits, including this one, have implicitly adopted the same approach, applying the <i>Franks</i> analysis without engaging in consideration of the effect of the illegality on the magistrate's thought process as suggested by <i>Murray. See United States v. Ford,</i> 22 F.3d 374, 379 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 313 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Halliman,</i> 923 F.2d 873, 880-81 (D.C.Cir.1991); <i>United States v. Gillenwaters,</i> 890 F.2d 679, 681-82 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the Court in <i>Murray</i> did not intend to add anything to the pre-existing <i>Franks</i> approach to evaluating warrant applications containing tainted information when it stated that courts should ask whether such information \"affected [the Magistrate's] decision to issue the warrant.\" <i>Murray,</i> 487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529. Thus, when faced with a warrant containing information obtained pursuant to an illegal search, a reviewing court must excise the offending information and evaluate whether what remains is sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There of course remains the separate question of whether the first <i>Murray</i> requirement &#8212; that the police would have sought the warrant even in the absence of the tainted material &#8212; was meant to place an additional gloss on the <i>Franks</i> analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two questions must be addressed here: (1) whether \"the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during their initial entry,\" <i>Murray,</i> 487 U.S. at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529, and (2) whether the affidavit contained sufficient facts to support probable cause when the offending facts were excised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We address the probable cause issue first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to probable cause, the district court concluded that the untainted facts in the warrant application were insufficient to support probable cause for a search of the apartment. <i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 94. The district court framed the second question as asking whether officers would have sought the warrant if their illegal search had turned up nothing, and concluded that the officers would not have continued pursuing the warrant. We review the conclusion that the cleansed affidavit was insufficient under the special de novo review provisions set forth in <i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). <i>See United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 31 n. 4. (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that under <i>Ornelas,</i> review of the Fourth Amendment conclusion is de novo, but deference is owed to the inferences drawn from facts found by the issuing court and by law enforcement officers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> As to the question regarding <i>Murray's</i> first prong, we review the district court's conclusions of law de novo, and, giving the defendant the benefit here, we review the factual determination under a clear error standard. The district court was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Probable Cause</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the affidavit still contained sufficient information to support probable cause to search the Quincy apartment even after striking from it all evidence found by the district court to either be untruthful or illegally obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What concerned the district court was whether there was probable cause to search Dessesaure's apartment, as opposed to his car. The court reasoned that just because a defendant is arrested dealing drugs from his car does not mean that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant's home would likely yield evidence connected with his drug dealing. <i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 94. The government in response talks about the inherent unlikelihood that the defendant would store valuable drugs in the car, or insert drugs into his rectum while in the car. We need not analyze the district court's proposition, because here there was far more evidence for probable cause than simply the drugs found in Dessesaure's car and on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vehicle in which Dessesaure was traveling and apprehended was registered in his name at the address of the apartment searched. The police found traces of white powder, which, from their experience and observation, they thought (but did not test) to be heroin, on the garbage bags Dessesaure took to the trash from the apartment. When Dessesaure was arrested, the police testified, he tried to lead them down a false trail, denying that he lived where he did; a likely reason is that he had something to hide at the apartment. When Dessesaure picked up Boyd, Dessesaure had just come from his apartment, making it likely that the drugs he sold to Boyd came from the apartment. Dessesaure drove erratically as he returned under surveillance to his apartment. The affidavit stated that he drove this way to throw off anyone following him, again suggesting he had drugs in his apartment, a suggestion strengthened by his subsequent lies about where he lived. These facts were more than adequate to constitute probable cause. <i>See United States v.

As the Court wrote, \"to determine whether the warrant was independent of the illegal entry, one must ask whether it would have been sought even if what actually happened had not occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> at 542, 108 S.Ct. 2529 n. 3. The second <i>Murray</i> prong, is, as we have held, wholly objective in its focus. By contrast, as articulated by <i>Murray</i> in 1988, the first prong appeared to be subjective: would these particular police officers have sought the warrant even if they had not known, as a result of the illegal search, that drugs were present in the apartment. <i>See id.,</i> 487 U.S. at 542 n. 3; <i>Restrepo,</i> 966 F.2d at 971-72.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> While the first prong of <i>Murray</i> is articulated as a subjective test, nonetheless, it should not be proven by purely subjective means. In making the factual determination as to the police officers' intent, the district court is not bound by after-the-fact assurances of their intent, but instead must assess the totality of the attendant circumstances to ascertain whether those assurances appear \"implausible.\" <i>Murray,</i> 487 U.S. at 540 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2529; <i>see Restrepo,</i> 966 F.2d at 971-72; <i>see also Devenpeck v. Alford,</i> 543 U.S. 146, 125 S.Ct. 588, 594, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004) (\"Subjective intent of the arresting officer, however it is determined (and of course subjective intent is always determined by objective means)....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the first prong of <i>Murray,</i> it is clear that objectively the officers were not prompted to seek the warrant by what they saw in the apartment. Significantly, Dessesaure and Officer Broderick both testified that Broderick informed Dessesaure at the station prior to the initial entry into the defendant's apartment that the police were going to apply for a search warrant. Indeed, the freezing of the apartment (whether done for exigent circumstances or not) was done on Broderick's way to get a warrant. Broderick left Dessesaure's apartment after spending only five or ten minutes there to go directly to the District Attorney's office and prepare a warrant application. Moreover, even if there had been no illegal entry into the apartment and the officers lacked knowledge that drugs were present there, there is no evidence to suggest that these officers would not have sought a warrant. Indeed, the absence of knowledge of the evidence viewed via the illegal access could only have encouraged them further to seek a warrant, as that would have been their only way to have sought out the evidence in the apartment they obviously suspected to exist and desired to see. The facts gathered legally, without resort to the facts gathered illegally, provided an independent and adequate source for the warrant application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other issue deserves comment. Taking it as true that the officers lied (over the government's protest that this is an unfair characterization), the district court was understandably unhappy. The record shows more than a touch of frustration and building tension. At least some members of the Boston Police Department may have mistakenly believed that they were free, absent a search warrant or exigent circumstances, to enter a dwelling in order to \"freeze\" the scene. The district court was quite correct to state strongly that this is not the law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the police had no right to \"freeze\" the Quincy apartment where that meant entering it, looking around, searching, all the while ostensibly waiting for someone to get a warrant. Nothing in First Circuit or Supreme Court case law remotely justifies such a step. Nor should it. Searching without a warrant, on the assumption that the magistrate will no doubt agree with the officers that there is probable cause to search that location at that time, makes a mockery of Fourth Amendment protection. The warrant, and the review it requires, is reduced to a technicality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allowance of the motion to suppress was error and is <i>reversed.</i> The case is <i>remanded</i> to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Broderick testified at the suppression hearing about the information he received from these sources.

In<i>Illinois v.

Rather, \"[a] magistrate's determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the issuing magistrate's decision should be reviewed to determine only that there was a \"substantial basis for ...

Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2005) (using \"substantial basis\" analysis). An aspect of this deference is that \"[i]n a doubtful or marginal case, the court defers to the issuing magistrate's determination of probable cause.\" <i>United States v.

There is a split of authority on whether, in a criminal case, deference to the decision of the issuing magistrate still applies when material portions of an affidavit are stricken for intentional misrepresentation or illegality. <i>Compare United States v.

Accepting as accurate these factual conclusions, we nonetheless disagree with the trial court's ultimate conclusion that suppression was required.

The license plate number given by the sources matched that of a maroon Cadillac Escalade registered to Dessesaure at an address in Quincy, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early hours of February 24, 2003, police began surveillance on the Quincy apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 86. At 9:00 a.m., Officer Paul Quinn observed Dessesaure leave the Quincy apartment and throw a trash bag in a dumpster before he drove off. <i>Id.</i> Quinn recovered the trash bag and found a \"residue of an unknown powder substance\" and a utility bill with Dessesaure's name and the address of the Quincy apartment. The residue was not field tested to confirm that it was heroin. <i>Id.</i> Officers followed Dessesaure in his Escalade to a home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood and saw Dessesaure enter, carrying a black shoulder bag. <i>Id.</i> He emerged two minutes later, as did his girlfriend, Tina Tate. <i>Id.</i> at 86-87. The police followed Dessesaure to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where Tate went in and returned ten minutes later. <i>Id.</i> at 87. The police then lost surveillance for some time. When they reestablished contact with the car again at approximately 11:15 a.m., Dessesaure and Tate were returning to Quincy. <i>Id.</i> Dessesaure made a number of evasive maneuvers as he drove and did not take the most direct route back to the Quincy apartment. <i>Id.</i> Officer Broderick testified that such driving is often employed by drug traffickers to see if they are being followed by law enforcement officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dessesaure and Tate returned to the Quincy apartment. Approximately 20 minutes later, Dessesaure left alone and drove into Boston, followed by the officers. <i>Id.</i> Once in Boston, Dessesaure pulled his Escalade over on a street in the South End and picked up a man, Nelson Boyd. Dessesaure drove Boyd for a few blocks and stopped. <i>Id.</i> Boyd got out of the car and Dessesaure drove away. Police officers, including Broderick, stopped Boyd and searched him, recovering a plastic bag they supposed, based on their experience, contained heroin. <i>Id.</i> Boyd lied, telling officers that he had never even been in the Escalade. As to whether Boyd acquired the heroin while in Dessesaure's car, Officer Juan Seoane, who, along with Broderick, had been following Dessesaure before Dessesaure picked up Boyd, testified that Boyd did not appear to be carrying anything when he entered the vehicle. <i>Id.</i> However, Seoane also testified that he could not see an exchange being made while Boyd was in the Escalade. The district court noted that \"the bag was small and would not necessarily have been apparent to the surveilling officers.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Broderick remained behind with Boyd, other officers, including Officer Seoane, continued to follow the Escalade. Dessesaure drove erratically after dropping Boyd off. <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that, based on his experience, Dessesaure's driving was consistent with that of drug dealers who, after conducting a drug sale, attempt to make sure that they are not being followed. <i>Id.</i> Once the officers following Dessesaure were informed that heroin had been found on Boyd, they pulled over the Escalade. While the officers obtained no contraband from a pat-frisk of Dessesaure and a search of the car, Seoane noted that Dessesaure's pants zipper was open and his shirt was pulled out through his fly. <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that in his experience, it was common for a drug dealer to hide his wares in his rectum to avoid detection. <i>Id.</i> at 87-88. The implication was that Dessesaure had put drugs in his rectum at home and just had retrieved a bag to sell to Boyd. Dessesaure was arrested on the street by Officer Seoane. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officers took Dessesaure to the station house to be booked; Seoane followed them in Dessesaure's car. Broderick arrived a short time later. Broderick questioned Dessesaure at the booking desk. Both Broderick and Dessesaure testified that Broderick told Dessesaure he was going to get a warrant to search the Quincy apartment. When Broderick asked Dessesaure where he lived, Dessesaure replied that he lived in Roxbury. That was not true; he lived in Quincy. Broderick testified that he warned Dessesaure at the booking desk that if heroin was found in his apartment, his girlfriend could be charged. Broderick stated that Dessesaure then informed him of the location of the heroin in the Quincy apartment, with the hope that his girlfriend would not be charged. <i>Id.</i> at 89. Dessesaure denied ever making these statements. The district court noted that Broderick could not satisfactorily explain why these statements were not recorded in any way, and thus gave \"no credit to Broderick's claims that defendant made statements about drugs in his apartment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> After questioning Dessesaure, Broderick and other officers took Dessesaure's keys and proceeded to the Quincy apartment for the purpose of \"freezing\" it on Broderick's way to get a warrant. <i>Id.</i> The goal of a \"freeze,\" it seems, is to secure a location to prevent its occupants from destroying evidence while a search warrant is being obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the record, the government suggests to us and the district court that Broderick thought he could enter the apartment to \"freeze it\" absent exigent circumstances based on vague and broad language in a state court opinion. <i>See Dessesaure II,</i> 323 F.Supp.2d at 216 &amp; n. 10 (discussing <i>Commonwealth v.

Broderick took this statement to be an attempt by Dessesaure to communicate the fact of his arrest to people who might be in a position to destroy evidence; he testified that he believed Dessesaure's statement created exigent circumstances necessitating a \"freeze\" of Dessesaure's apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 88. The district court did not believe Broderick, finding that he had \"fabricated [Dessesaure's] alleged statement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that at the station house, he witnessed Dessesaure sign a written waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. The government, however, was unable to produce the signed waiver, leading the district court to the \"inevitable conclusion that [the waiver] simply never existed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 89 n. 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station house, Seone followed up on his earlier observation of Dessesaure's open pants zipper by conducting a strip search of Dessesaure. <i>Id.</i> at 88. He found that Dessesaure had secreted a plastic bag containing six smaller plastic bags of heroin in his rectum. Seoane also found sixty dollars in Dessesaure's shirt pocket. <i>Id.</i> Seoane testified that Dessesaure later told him he was selling bags of heroin for sixty dollars, but the district court noted that \"[t]his statement was not recorded in any police document.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Broderick and the officers used Dessesaure's keys to enter the Quincy apartment and found Tina Tate inside. <i>Id.</i> at 89. The officers detained Tate and made a number of observations which were used shortly thereafter in the warrant affidavit. The items observed and recited in the affidavit included \"sixteen (16) `bundles' of glassine bags, five (5) loose glassine bags, a large plastic bag containing a powder believed to be Heroin, a digital scale, a roll of tape, a box containing hundreds of empty glassine bags, a bag of small black elastics, a ceramic plate with two plastic [transit] passes.\" Broderick testified that he then telephoned back to the station house, where Dessesaure was being detained, and informed Seoane what the officers had found in Dessesaure's apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 90. Seoane testified that when he informed Dessesaure what was found during the \"freeze\" of the apartment, Dessesaure gave him additional information about the drugs. <i>Id.</i> The district court disbelieved Seoane's testimony on this point. <i>Id.</i> (\"I do not find Seoane's account of Dessesaure's statements credible.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After five to ten minutes in Dessesaure's apartment, Broderick went to the District Attorney's office to prepare a warrant affidavit and to apply for a search warrant, as he had earlier said that he would, leaving behind other officers at the apartment to maintain the freeze. In the warrant affidavit, Broderick included the following: (1) information he received from his sources before the police began surveillance; (2) the registration information of the Escalade showing that it belonged to Dessesaure and was registered at the Quincy address; (3) a description of the February 24th surveillance of Dessesaure, as related above; (4) the fact that Dessesaure had concealed bags of heroin in his body; (5) the statements Dessesaure purportedly made at the station regarding the location of heroin in the Quincy apartment, both before and after the freeze; and (6) the items observed in plain view at the apartment during the freeze. <i>Id.</i> The magistrate granted the warrant application. During the search pursuant to this warrant, officers seized a gun, bullets, more drugs and drug paraphernalia, money, and documents, in addition to the items which been observed during the pre-warrant search. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dessesaure challenged his arrest as being without probable cause and sought to suppress evidence from the time of the arrest, from his person while he was at the station house, and from his apartment. The district court found that, while it was \"a close case,\" there was probable cause for Dessesaure's arrest on the street. <i>Id.</i> at 91. The search at the station house was, as a result, also justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest. <i>Id.</i> Nonetheless, the district court granted Dessesaure's motion to suppress the evidence found in his apartment on the grounds that there was no exigency that would justify a warrantless entry and that any testimony by Broderick suggesting exigent circumstances was not credible. <i>Id.</i> The district court found that absent exigency, the pre-warrant entry into the apartment constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 92-93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further found that the warrant affidavit used tainted information, that is, (1) the observations made pursuant to the illegal pre-warrant entry, and (2) Broderick and Seoane's testimony as to statements made by Dessesaure while in custody regarding the location of heroin in his apartment, which the court had found to be fabricated. <i>Id.</i> at 93-94. The district court concluded that the remaining untainted evidence \"[did] not suffice to create probable cause to conclude that Dessesaure kept drugs in his apartment, or anywhere else besides his car\" and so suppressed all the evidence found in the apartment. <i>Id.</i> at 94. The government appeals only this finding as to probable cause and the suppression of the evidence from Dessesaure's apartment, leaving unchallenged the court's underlying findings regarding the legality of the warrantless entry and the falsity of the officers' testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to whether the district court erred in suppressing the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.

Under the procedure set forth in <i>Franks,</i> a court faced with a warrant affidavit which includes deliberately or reckless false statements must set aside those false statements and determine whether the remaining information in the affidavit sets forth sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause. <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 171-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court held that in two situations, the search would not be an independent source: (1) \"if the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry\"; and (2) \"if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike in <i>Franks,</i> the constitutional violation in this case was not solely the inclusion of deliberate or reckless false statements in a warrant application, but also an illegal search.

The court reasoned that just because a defendant is arrested dealing drugs from his car does not mean that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant's home would likely yield evidence connected with his drug dealing. <i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 94. The government in response talks about the inherent unlikelihood that the defendant would store valuable drugs in the car, or insert drugs into his rectum while in the car. We need not analyze the district court's proposition, because here there was far more evidence for probable cause than simply the drugs found in Dessesaure's car and on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vehicle in which Dessesaure was traveling and apprehended was registered in his name at the address of the apartment searched. The police found traces of white powder, which, from their experience and observation, they thought (but did not test) to be heroin, on the garbage bags Dessesaure took to the trash from the apartment. When Dessesaure was arrested, the police testified, he tried to lead them down a false trail, denying that he lived where he did; a likely reason is that he had something to hide at the apartment. When Dessesaure picked up Boyd, Dessesaure had just come from his apartment, making it likely that the drugs he sold to Boyd came from the apartment. Dessesaure drove erratically as he returned under surveillance to his apartment. The affidavit stated that he drove this way to throw off anyone following him, again suggesting he had drugs in his apartment, a suggestion strengthened by his subsequent lies about where he lived.

By contrast, as articulated by <i>Murray</i> in 1988, the first prong appeared to be subjective: would these particular police officers have sought the warrant even if they had not known, as a result of the illegal search, that drugs were present in the apartment. <i>See id.,</i> 487 U.S. at 542 n. 3; <i>Restrepo,</i> 966 F.2d at 971-72.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> While the first prong of <i>Murray</i> is articulated as a subjective test, nonetheless, it should not be proven by purely subjective means.

Significantly, Dessesaure and Officer Broderick both testified that Broderick informed Dessesaure at the station prior to the initial entry into the defendant's apartment that the police were going to apply for a search warrant. Indeed, the freezing of the apartment (whether done for exigent circumstances or not) was done on Broderick's way to get a warrant. Broderick left Dessesaure's apartment after spending only five or ten minutes there to go directly to the District Attorney's office and prepare a warrant application. Moreover, even if there had been no illegal entry into the apartment and the officers lacked knowledge that drugs were present there, there is no evidence to suggest that these officers would not have sought a warrant. Indeed, the absence of knowledge of the evidence viewed via the illegal access could only have encouraged them further to seek a warrant, as that would have been their only way to have sought out the evidence in the apartment they obviously suspected to exist and desired to see. The facts gathered legally, without resort to the facts gathered illegally, provided an independent and adequate source for the warrant application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other issue deserves comment. Taking it as true that the officers lied (over the government's protest that this is an unfair characterization), the district court was understandably unhappy. The record shows more than a touch of frustration and building tension. At least some members of the Boston Police Department may have mistakenly believed that they were free, absent a search warrant or exigent circumstances, to enter a dwelling in order to \"freeze\" the scene. The district court was quite correct to state strongly that this is not the law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that the police had no right to \"freeze\" the Quincy apartment where that meant entering it, looking around, searching, all the while ostensibly waiting for someone to get a warrant. Nothing in First Circuit or Supreme Court case law remotely justifies such a step. Nor should it. Searching without a warrant, on the assumption that the magistrate will no doubt agree with the officers that there is probable cause to search that location at that time, makes a mockery of Fourth Amendment protection. The warrant, and the review it requires, is reduced to a technicality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dessesaure I,</i> 314 F.Supp.2d at 92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allowance of the motion to suppress was error and is <i>reversed.</i> The case is <i>remanded</i> to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Broderick testified at the suppression hearing about the information he received from these sources.

In particular, the court focused on the fact that Broderick had discarded his notes about the statements made by the sources and the lack of other evidence supporting the credibility of the sources. <i>Id.</i> at 84-86. Nonetheless, the court concluded that this \"vague information from sources without any description of their basis of knowledge\" could be considered when evaluating whether the information in the warrant affidavit could establish probable cause. <i>Id.</i> at 94.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In<i>Dessesaure I,</i> the district court found that this conclusion \"made no sense.\" 314 F.Supp.2d at 87.

In <i>Dessesaure II,</i> the district court modified this finding, stating that the issue of \"[w]hether Broderick believed Dessesaure's girlfriend was an `active participant' in drug dealing or not a participant at all\" was immaterial. 323 F.Supp.2d at 215.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In<i>Dessesaure I,</i> the court found that this fabrication came \"when [Broderick] knew the warrantless entry was being challenged and he needed to come up with some exigency to justify it.\" 314 F.Supp.2d at 88. In <i>Dessesaure II,</i> however, the court modified this finding, and held that \"the record is not clear about what Officer Broderick specifically knew or did not know of the <i>Court's</i> concerns at the moment he took the stand, or whether he gleaned that concern from his questioning at the hearing or from his pre-trial preparation, or was just `gilding the lily,' as they say, on his own.\" 323 F.Supp.2d at 214.
