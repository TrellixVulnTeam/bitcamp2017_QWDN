Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jorge L. Armenteros-Chervoni, for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 30, 2011\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.      After a twenty-eight-day trial in\n\n2007 a jury found Elkin Meléndez-Santiago, one of twelve indicted\n\nco-conspirators, guilty of conspiracy to import five or more\n\nkilograms of cocaine and one or more kilograms of heroin, as well\n\nas actual importation of five or more kilograms of cocaine, as part\n\nof a massive cocaine and heroin importation organization. Only one\n\nother defendant went to trial and he was also convicted. The\n\nremainder pled guilty.\n\n          In   the   conspiracy,   Meléndez   provided   cash   to   co-\n\nconspirators to cover expenses for some drug smuggling operations\n\nand purchased cocaine and heroin imported into Puerto Rico for\n\nfurther distribution.    Millions of dollars worth of drugs were\n\nimported. During one importation attempt in 2004, federal officers\n\nwho had been tipped off to the drugs' arrival seized the drugs\n\nafter a shootout with some of Meléndez's co-conspirators.            The\n\ndistrict court found it was known or foreseeable that firearms were\n\nbeing carried in furtherance of the conspiracy, justifying a\n\nsentence enhancement.\n\n          Meléndez was a cocaine addict who used cocaine daily,\n\nUnited States v. Melendez Santiago, 544 F. Supp. 2d 76, 83 (D.P.R.\n\n2007) (Melendez II), but he had no prior criminal record.       He was\n\nsentenced to 360 months' imprisonment, which was less than the life\n\nsentence advised by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            His appeal argues two points.            First, he argues the\n\ndistrict   court    committed    reversible    error      in   not   suppressing\n\nevidence of conversations recorded in two Title III wiretaps\n\nbecause    the   affidavits     in   support   of   the    wiretaps     did   not\n\nsufficiently explain why traditional investigative procedures were\n\ninadequate, necessitating wiretaps, see 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c),\n\n(3)(c),    and     because    the     affidavits     contained        misleading\n\ninformation.     He argues that the district court should have held a\n\nFranks hearing to permit him to establish that the affidavits\n\nincluded misleading information and that without such information,\n\nthe affidavits would not have sufficed to establish probable cause\n\nfor the wiretaps.      See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56\n\n(1978).    Second, Meléndez argues the court erred in denying a\n\nsecond motion to suppress his own statements and confession to\n\nagents while in custody as involuntary under the Fifth Amendment or\n\nin violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The district\n\ncourt issued careful and helpful opinions on both motions.                    See\n\nMelendez II, 544 F. Supp. 2d 76 (denying motion to suppress\n\nstatements); United States v. Melendez-Santiago, 447 F. Supp. 2d\n\n144 (D.P.R. 2006) (Melendez I) (denying motion to suppress wiretap\n\nrecordings).     We reject Meléndez's arguments and affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f                           I. The Title III Wiretap\n\nA.             Necessity\n\n               The initial determination as to compliance with the\n\nstringent standards for issuing a wiretap authorization, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2518(1), is made by the judge to whom the application is made.\n\nSee United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d 12, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (explaining standard and procedure for wiretap warrants). At\n\nthis later stage, appellate review of that authorization is not de\n\nnovo, but deferential.         We \"decide if the facts set forth in the\n\napplication were minimally adequate to support the determination\n\nthat was made.\"        Id. (quoting United States v. Ashley, 876 F.2d\n\n1069, 1074 (1st Cir. 1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n               Here,   two    wiretap      authorizations     resulted   from\n\napplications dated November 23 and December 9, 2004, both supported\n\nby sworn affidavits by FBI agent Jose Mena.                 Both applications\n\ntargeted certain cell phone numbers and were approved by a district\n\ncourt judge.      These cell phone numbers were used by the conspiracy\n\nleader, Luis Alfredo De La Rosa-Montero, also known as \"Luis\n\nViagra\" or \"El Compadre,\" to coordinate the drug conspiracy.\n\n               In order to be approved, the applications needed to show\n\nwhat is commonly referred to as the \"necessity\" of resort to\n\nwiretaps.       United States v. Martinez, 452 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    To make this showing, wiretap applications must provide \"a\n\nfull     and    complete     statement    as   to   whether   or   not   other\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\finvestigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they\n\nreasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too\n\ndangerous.\"       18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c); see also id. § 2518(3)(c)\n\n(judge's duty to evaluate showing of necessity).           In United States\n\nv. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), we interpreted\n\n§ 2518(1)(c) \"to mean that the statement should demonstrate that\n\nthe government has made 'a reasonable, good faith effort to run the\n\ngamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means\n\nso intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.'\"               Id.\n\nat 9 (quoting United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1306-07 (1st\n\nCir. 1987)).      In such a statement, \"[i]t is not necessary . . . to\n\nshow that other methods have been entirely unsuccessful.\"             Id.\n\n            Our    reading   of   the    affidavits   disproves   Meléndez's\n\ncontentions that they were insufficient to support issuance of the\n\nwiretap authorizations.         Indeed, they were better than minimally\n\nadequate.      The November 23 affidavit contained the available\n\nidentifying information known about the conspirators, all Dominican\n\nor Puerto Rican nationals.        The affidavit also described how three\n\nconfidential sources and one confidential informant had at times\n\naided the investigation, providing information about those who were\n\nworking in the conspiracy and about particular prior shipments,\n\ninformation that had led to successful arrests and drug seizures.\n\nThe   affidavit     described     in    twenty-five   detailed    pages     the\n\nconversations and interactions the sources and informant had with\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fDe La Rosa, some of which were recorded by the sources and some of\n\nwhich    were   verified     when    transactions       were    interrupted         and\n\nsmugglers arrested by federal officials.                  The affidavit also\n\ndescribed what information had been gleaned from existing pen\n\nregister and trap and trace analysis of De La Rosa's phone numbers.\n\n            The November 23 affidavit also described the limited\n\nsuccess    of   efforts     to   conduct     physical    surveillance          of   the\n\nconspiracy leader De La Rosa. Physical surveillance was especially\n\ndifficult in St. Thomas, where De La Rosa lived, because the\n\nstreets were narrow and foreigners easily spotted.                   De La Rosa and\n\nother conspirators stayed in areas frequented by other Dominican\n\nnationals who were part of the same criminal subculture.                            The\n\nconspirators were wary of surveillance and they, in fact, mounted\n\nvigilant counter-surveillance.         The conspirators did not use their\n\nreal names and distrusted others not like them.                      Federal agents\n\neither    mounting    surveillance     or    attempting    to    infiltrate         the\n\norganization undercover who were not members of that subculture\n\nwould be easily spotted, would not be trusted by other members of\n\nthe     conspiracy,   and    would    consequently       be     at     great    risk.\n\nImportantly, at the time of the wiretap application, one of the\n\nconfidential sources had been missing for five months and was\n\npresumed dead; another had been threatened with death and was no\n\nlonger trusted by members of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            The information from sources other than surveillance was\n\nalso    constrained.        The   affidavit   explained   why   traditional\n\ninvestigative techniques that had not been used--a grand jury\n\ninvestigation, interviews with co-conspirators or their associates,\n\nor execution of search warrants--were, particularly given the\n\nlimited information known about the co-conspirators' identities and\n\nroles, likely to tip off the co-conspirators as to the developing\n\ninvestigation without yielding much helpful information.                Pen\n\nregisters and trap and trace records were already being used and\n\nwould continue to be used, but gleaned only limited information\n\nabout the cell phones being used.\n\n            The December 9 application sought wiretap authorization\n\nfor another, new cell phone number used by De La Rosa.                  The\n\nsupporting affidavit was similar in its level of detail to the\n\nfirst, related affidavit.\n\n            The affidavits' exhaustive explanation of what facts were\n\nknown, what details remained unknown, what investigative techniques\n\nhad been used and what techniques were likely to be unhelpful in\n\nthe    specific   context    of    this   particular   conspiracy   clearly\n\nconstituted \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not\n\nother investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why\n\nthey reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be\n\ntoo dangerous.\"    18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c).       The affidavits certainly\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fsupported the determination to authorize the wiretaps. See Nelson-\n\nRodriguez, 319 F.3d at 32-33.\n\nB.        Alleged Misleading Information\n\n          Meléndez argues that the affidavits failed to disclose\n\nthat the agent who signed them was himself of Dominican origin, as\n\nwas one of the confidential sources, and that they understated the\n\nscope of that source's knowledge about the internal workings of the\n\ncriminal conspiracy.    These arguments are in service of Meléndez's\n\nhypothesis that someone of Dominican origin could easily have been\n\nslipped into the organization as an undercover agent, and that\n\nalternatively,   the   confidential    source   must   already   have   had\n\nsufficient knowledge about the conspiracy's organization, both\n\nfacts obviating any need for wiretaps.\n\n          Meléndez takes it one step further and argues that\n\nbecause these facts were so obviously material, the affidavit\n\nmisled the district court judges who authorized the wiretaps into\n\nauthorizations they would not otherwise have granted.        See Franks,\n\n438 U.S. at 171-72 (holding that if \"deliberate falsity or reckless\n\ndisregard\" for the truth in a warrant affidavit are specifically\n\nand reliably alleged, and if there is no longer sufficient material\n\nto support a finding of probable cause when the material in\n\nquestion \"is set to one side,\" the court must grant the defendant\n\na hearing to prove the allegations).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           This house of cards is too flimsy to stand.     To be of\n\nDominican origin does not make one a natural undercover agent (or\n\ninconspicuous as part of a criminal sub-culture); nor does it\n\nmitigate the likelihood of an agent or confidential source being\n\nmurdered by the conspiracy upon discovery.1 Meléndez's speculation\n\nthat the confidential source must already have known and shared\n\nwith the investigators the details of the conspiracy's inner\n\nworkings before the wiretap application is equally illogical and\n\nunsupported.   No inference of falsity or reckless disregard of the\n\ntruth can be drawn from the non-disclosure of these irrelevant bits\n\nof information.    For that reason no hearing was required.     See\n\nFranks, 438 U.S. at 155-56.    Nor did the ample probable cause set\n\nforth in the affidavit for tapping the phones depend in any way on\n\nthese alleged omissions, also obviating the need for a Franks\n\nhearing.   See Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d at 34.\n\n    II. Defendant's Incriminatory Statements to Investigators\n\n           After evidentiary hearings on two days, the district\n\ncourt made findings of fact and concluded that statements Meléndez\n\nhad made while in custody were voluntary under the Fifth Amendment\n\nand that Meléndez had intelligently waived any right to counsel\n\nunder the Sixth Amendment.    Melendez II, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 85-89.\n\n\n\n     1\n          Indeed, as the affidavit explained, the confidential\nsource Meléndez refers to was in custody at the time of the\napplication because members of the conspiracy already distrusted\nhim and had threatened his life.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           We review the factual findings for clear error.         United\n\nStates v. Rojas-Tapia, 446 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2006).           But as to\n\ndeterminations on matters of law, such as whether the totality of\n\nthe circumstances demonstrates that a defendant's statement was\n\nknowing and voluntary, our review is de novo.           Id.\n\n           As to Fifth Amendment rights, the Supreme Court recently\n\nsummarized the familiar Miranda rule in Maryland v. Shatzer, 130 S.\n\nCt. 1213 (2010):\n\n           To counteract the coercive pressure [of a custodial\n           interrogation], Miranda announced that police\n           officers must warn a suspect prior to questioning\n           that he has a right to remain silent, and a right\n           to the presence of an attorney. After the warnings\n           are given, if the suspect indicates that he wishes\n           to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\n           Similarly, if the suspect states that he wants an\n           attorney, the interrogation must cease until an\n           attorney is present.       Critically, however, a\n           suspect can waive these rights.     To establish a\n           valid waiver, the State must show that the waiver\n           was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary . . . .\n\nId. at 1219 (citations omitted).       If a suspect invokes the right to\n\nhave   counsel   present    during   custodial    interrogation,   further\n\ninterrogation may take place without counsel only if \"the accused\n\nhimself    initiates       further     communication,     exchanges,   or\n\nconversations\" with the authorities.             Id. (quoting Edwards v.\n\nArizona, 451 U.S. 477, 485 (1981)).\n\n           As to the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, it attaches\n\nat or shortly after \"the initiation of adversary judicial criminal\n\nproceedings--whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing,\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\findictment,   information,    or    arraignment.\"2       United    States   v.\n\nBoskic, 545 F.3d 69, 81 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Rothgery v.\n\nGillespie   County,   Tex.,   554   U.S.    191,   198   (2008))    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).     These rights may also be waived, and \"a\n\nvalid waiver of Fifth Amendment rights typically will suffice to\n\naccomplish a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in the\n\ncontext of police questioning of a defendant.\"           Id. at 84 n.17.\n\n            The dispute concerns Meléndez's several confessions to\n\nthe federal agents of his role in the conspiracy.                 There is no\n\nassertion that the district court misapprehended or misapplied the\n\nlaw on waiver of these rights.             Rather, Meléndez attacks the\n\ndistrict court's judgments that the government's witnesses were\n\ncredible and Meléndez was not in recounting the events following\n\nhis arrest.\n\n            We briefly summarize the testimony at the suppression\n\nhearings of FBI Agents Juan Berrios Silva and Felix Rivera, and of\n\nMeléndez.   Meléndez was arrested at his home just after 5:00 a.m.\n\non September 13, 2005 by Agent Berrios and others and initially\n\ntaken into custody at FBI offices.         He testified that he was first\n\n\n\n     2\n          In this case, the indictment against the co-conspirators\nwas filed before Meléndez was arrested. Meléndez argues, and the\ngovernment does not dispute, that as a result his Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel had already attached when he was first arrested,\nso that it covered his interviews with federal agents both before\nand after his initial appearance before the magistrate judge. The\nanalysis that follows assumes without deciding that he is correct\nabout the timing.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fadvised of his rights under Miranda while en route, and was then\n\ngiven a written form explaining those rights in Spanish upon\n\narrival at the Federal building. The parties agree that the bottom\n\nportion of the form, which contained an assent to waiver of\n\nMeléndez's rights, was crossed out before he signed the form at\n\n6:45 a.m, because he was not at that time waiving his rights.\n\nMeléndez admits he then went to Pretrial Services where he was\n\ngiven Miranda warnings a third time.\n\n          Agent Berrios and defendant Meléndez testified rather\n\ndifferently regarding what happened after Meléndez was returned to\n\nthe processing room from Pretrial Services, and the district court\n\ncredited the agent's testimony.        Agent Berrios testified that\n\nMeléndez approached him and another FBI agent and told them he\n\nwanted to cooperate, then spoke with them voluntarily for close to\n\nan hour, confessing to his role in the conspiracy.    The next day,\n\nBerrios prepared an FBI Form 302 summarizing Meléndez's debriefing\n\nand the information obtained.   Meléndez was kept separately from\n\nthe other detainees after he was debriefed.\n\n          Meléndez testified, by contrast, that he had specifically\n\nand repeatedly requested his own lawyer from the time he was first\n\nread his Miranda rights, that he had been told that after he\n\ncooperated the agents would call his attorney, and that despite the\n\nagents' constant pressure on him he had consistently refused to\n\ncooperate.\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f                At about 1:30 p.m. the same day, Meléndez was taken\n\nbefore a magistrate judge for his initial appearance.                  The judge\n\nadvised him of his right to consult counsel, but Meléndez, as his\n\nown testimony established, did not request an attorney.3                    It is\n\nundisputed that Meléndez did not say he had already requested an\n\nattorney but had been denied one, that he was being pressed to\n\nwaive his right to counsel, or that he had already been interviewed\n\nin violation of his rights.              Berrios testified that the prosecutor\n\ntold the judge at sidebar that Meléndez had decided to cooperate.\n\nIt is undisputed that Meléndez was returned to the custody of the\n\nFBI after his initial appearance, which Berrios testified happened\n\nonly       in   order   to   facilitate     Meléndez's   cooperation   with   the\n\ninvestigation.\n\n                Berrios      testified    that,   wanting   Meléndez   to     feel\n\ncomfortable because he was cooperating, the agents took him to a\n\nhotel after that initial appearance, and not to jail, as would\n\nusually happen.           Another agent, Felix Rivera, was present at the\n\nhotel and testified at the suppression hearing consistently with\n\nAgent Berrios that Meléndez was indeed relaxed and comfortable at\n\n\n\n       3\n          For reasons that are not clear, no transcript or\nrecording of the initial appearance has been located or presented\nto us. We rely on the trial judge's findings of fact as to what\nhappened at the initial appearance.      In addition, there is no\nreason to believe that this highly experienced magistrate judge did\nnot advise Meléndez of his right to counsel at his appearance after\nhis arrest. Meléndez in fact testified that he was read his rights\nbefore the magistrate judge and did not ask for a lawyer.\n\n                                           -13-\n\fthe hotel, that he made a few fruitless phone calls to co-\n\nconspirators who would not speak because they already knew he had\n\nbeen arrested, and that he did not request counsel in either\n\nagent's presence.    Both agents testified that the next morning,\n\nSeptember 14, Meléndez was taken to a government building where he\n\nwas debriefed in more depth by several agents, including Berrios\n\nand Rivera, at which time he cooperated without ever requesting\n\ncounsel or expressing reluctance to cooperate, and after which\n\nRivera prepared another FBI Form 302 summarizing the interview.\n\nAfter the interview, the agents consulted with the prosecutors, who\n\ndetermined Meléndez should be taken to the federal prison.\n\n           Meléndez testified that he was terrified to be taken to\n\nthe hotel because he thought he was being kidnapped, and that he\n\nhad refused to make any calls while there.           He testified that\n\nduring the second interview the next morning he had continued to\n\nadamantly refuse to cooperate, confess, or make calls, and had\n\ncontinued to ask to see an attorney.\n\n           The district court decided to \"afford total credibility\"\n\nto the agents' testimony rather than to Meléndez's version of\n\nevents.   Melendez II, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 86.      The court found that\n\neach agent's testimony was delivered credibly and was consistent\n\nwith the other's \"even after being rigorously cross examined\" by\n\ndefense   counsel.    Id.   at   85.     And   circumstantial   evidence\n\ncorroborated the agents' testimony that Meléndez was voluntarily\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcooperating with the agents during the two days following his\n\narrest, including that the magistrate judge left Meléndez in the\n\ncustody of the FBI after his initial appearance, that he was taken\n\nto a hotel instead of to jail following his initial appearance, and\n\nthat he did not ask for a lawyer before the magistrate judge even\n\nwhen advised he had a right to consult one.          Id. at 85-86.\n\n              Crediting the agents' testimony, the district court found\n\nas fact that during those two days, Meléndez was calm, collected,\n\nand capable of intelligent and voluntary waiver of his rights. Id.\n\nat 86 n.1.      The court found that he initiated the first interview\n\nwith the agents, and that he did not ask for an attorney, did not\n\nsay he did not want to cooperate, and did not ask to stop any of\n\nthe interviews.      Id. at 86.\n\n              We have reviewed the transcripts of the suppression\n\nhearing and conclude that there is no clear error in the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact.           \"Where a district court's 'factual\n\nfindings are based on credibility determinations[,] . . . error is\n\nseldom considered \"clear\" unless the credibility assessments were\n\nbased on testimony which was inherently implausible, internally\n\ninconsistent, or critically impeached.'\" United States v.

He\n\ninitiated his first interview on September 13 himself after being\n\nadvised twice of his Miranda rights.                         Even later, after being\n\nadvised of both his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by the\n\nmagistrate       judge        at    his    initial      appearance,     he   continued     to\n\ncooperate without reluctance and without requesting counsel.                              The\n\ncourt     did     not     err      in     its    conclusion     that,    under    all     the\n\ncircumstances, Meléndez voluntarily and intelligently waived both\n\nhis right to remain silent and his right to counsel as of the time\n\nhe made his statements.4                  See United States v.

Indeed, they were better than minimally\n\nadequate.      The November 23 affidavit contained the available\n\nidentifying information known about the conspirators, all Dominican\n\nor Puerto Rican nationals.        The affidavit also described how three\n\nconfidential sources and one confidential informant had at times\n\naided the investigation, providing information about those who were\n\nworking in the conspiracy and about particular prior shipments,\n\ninformation that had led to successful arrests and drug seizures.\n\nThe   affidavit     described     in    twenty-five   detailed    pages     the\n\nconversations and interactions the sources and informant had with\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fDe La Rosa, some of which were recorded by the sources and some of\n\nwhich    were   verified     when    transactions       were    interrupted         and\n\nsmugglers arrested by federal officials.                  The affidavit also\n\ndescribed what information had been gleaned from existing pen\n\nregister and trap and trace analysis of De La Rosa's phone numbers.\n\n            The November 23 affidavit also described the limited\n\nsuccess    of   efforts     to   conduct     physical    surveillance          of   the\n\nconspiracy leader De La Rosa. Physical surveillance was especially\n\ndifficult in St. Thomas, where De La Rosa lived, because the\n\nstreets were narrow and foreigners easily spotted.                   De La Rosa and\n\nother conspirators stayed in areas frequented by other Dominican\n\nnationals who were part of the same criminal subculture.                            The\n\nconspirators were wary of surveillance and they, in fact, mounted\n\nvigilant counter-surveillance.         The conspirators did not use their\n\nreal names and distrusted others not like them.                      Federal agents\n\neither    mounting    surveillance     or    attempting    to    infiltrate         the\n\norganization undercover who were not members of that subculture\n\nwould be easily spotted, would not be trusted by other members of\n\nthe     conspiracy,   and    would    consequently       be     at     great    risk.\n\nImportantly, at the time of the wiretap application, one of the\n\nconfidential sources had been missing for five months and was\n\npresumed dead; another had been threatened with death and was no\n\nlonger trusted by members of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            The information from sources other than surveillance was\n\nalso    constrained.        The   affidavit   explained   why   traditional\n\ninvestigative techniques that had not been used--a grand jury\n\ninvestigation, interviews with co-conspirators or their associates,\n\nor execution of search warrants--were, particularly given the\n\nlimited information known about the co-conspirators' identities and\n\nroles, likely to tip off the co-conspirators as to the developing\n\ninvestigation without yielding much helpful information.                Pen\n\nregisters and trap and trace records were already being used and\n\nwould continue to be used, but gleaned only limited information\n\nabout the cell phones being used.\n\n            The December 9 application sought wiretap authorization\n\nfor another, new cell phone number used by De La Rosa.                  The\n\nsupporting affidavit was similar in its level of detail to the\n\nfirst, related affidavit.\n\n            The affidavits' exhaustive explanation of what facts were\n\nknown, what details remained unknown, what investigative techniques\n\nhad been used and what techniques were likely to be unhelpful in\n\nthe    specific   context    of    this   particular   conspiracy   clearly\n\nconstituted \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not\n\nother investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why\n\nthey reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be\n\ntoo dangerous.\"    18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c).       The affidavits certainly\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fsupported the determination to authorize the wiretaps. See Nelson-\n\nRodriguez, 319 F.3d at 32-33.\n\nB.        Alleged Misleading Information\n\n          Meléndez argues that the affidavits failed to disclose\n\nthat the agent who signed them was himself of Dominican origin, as\n\nwas one of the confidential sources, and that they understated the\n\nscope of that source's knowledge about the internal workings of the\n\ncriminal conspiracy.    These arguments are in service of Meléndez's\n\nhypothesis that someone of Dominican origin could easily have been\n\nslipped into the organization as an undercover agent, and that\n\nalternatively,   the   confidential    source   must   already   have   had\n\nsufficient knowledge about the conspiracy's organization, both\n\nfacts obviating any need for wiretaps.\n\n          Meléndez takes it one step further and argues that\n\nbecause these facts were so obviously material, the affidavit\n\nmisled the district court judges who authorized the wiretaps into\n\nauthorizations they would not otherwise have granted.        See Franks,\n\n438 U.S. at 171-72 (holding that if \"deliberate falsity or reckless\n\ndisregard\" for the truth in a warrant affidavit are specifically\n\nand reliably alleged, and if there is no longer sufficient material\n\nto support a finding of probable cause when the material in\n\nquestion \"is set to one side,\" the court must grant the defendant\n\na hearing to prove the allegations).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           This house of cards is too flimsy to stand.     To be of\n\nDominican origin does not make one a natural undercover agent (or\n\ninconspicuous as part of a criminal sub-culture); nor does it\n\nmitigate the likelihood of an agent or confidential source being\n\nmurdered by the conspiracy upon discovery.1 Meléndez's speculation\n\nthat the confidential source must already have known and shared\n\nwith the investigators the details of the conspiracy's inner\n\nworkings before the wiretap application is equally illogical and\n\nunsupported.   No inference of falsity or reckless disregard of the\n\ntruth can be drawn from the non-disclosure of these irrelevant bits\n\nof information.    For that reason no hearing was required.     See\n\nFranks, 438 U.S. at 155-56.    Nor did the ample probable cause set\n\nforth in the affidavit for tapping the phones depend in any way on\n\nthese alleged omissions, also obviating the need for a Franks\n\nhearing.   See Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d at 34.\n\n    II. Defendant's Incriminatory Statements to Investigators\n\n           After evidentiary hearings on two days, the district\n\ncourt made findings of fact and concluded that statements Meléndez\n\nhad made while in custody were voluntary under the Fifth Amendment\n\nand that Meléndez had intelligently waived any right to counsel\n\nunder the Sixth Amendment.

But as to\n\ndeterminations on matters of law, such as whether the totality of\n\nthe circumstances demonstrates that a defendant's statement was\n\nknowing and voluntary, our review is de novo.           Id.\n\n           As to Fifth Amendment rights, the Supreme Court recently\n\nsummarized the familiar Miranda rule in Maryland v. Shatzer, 130 S.\n\nCt. 1213 (2010):\n\n           To counteract the coercive pressure [of a custodial\n           interrogation], Miranda announced that police\n           officers must warn a suspect prior to questioning\n           that he has a right to remain silent, and a right\n           to the presence of an attorney. After the warnings\n           are given, if the suspect indicates that he wishes\n           to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\n           Similarly, if the suspect states that he wants an\n           attorney, the interrogation must cease until an\n           attorney is present.       Critically, however, a\n           suspect can waive these rights.     To establish a\n           valid waiver, the State must show that the waiver\n           was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary . . . .\n\nId. at 1219 (citations omitted).       If a suspect invokes the right to\n\nhave   counsel   present    during   custodial    interrogation,   further\n\ninterrogation may take place without counsel only if \"the accused\n\nhimself    initiates       further     communication,     exchanges,   or\n\nconversations\" with the authorities.             Id.

These rights may also be waived, and \"a\n\nvalid waiver of Fifth Amendment rights typically will suffice to\n\naccomplish a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in the\n\ncontext of police questioning of a defendant.\"           Id. at 84 n.17.\n\n            The dispute concerns Meléndez's several confessions to\n\nthe federal agents of his role in the conspiracy.                 There is no\n\nassertion that the district court misapprehended or misapplied the\n\nlaw on waiver of these rights.             Rather, Meléndez attacks the\n\ndistrict court's judgments that the government's witnesses were\n\ncredible and Meléndez was not in recounting the events following\n\nhis arrest.\n\n            We briefly summarize the testimony at the suppression\n\nhearings of FBI Agents Juan Berrios Silva and Felix Rivera, and of\n\nMeléndez.   Meléndez was arrested at his home just after 5:00 a.m.\n\non September 13, 2005 by Agent Berrios and others and initially\n\ntaken into custody at FBI offices.         He testified that he was first\n\n\n\n     2\n          In this case, the indictment against the co-conspirators\nwas filed before Meléndez was arrested. Meléndez argues, and the\ngovernment does not dispute, that as a result his Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel had already attached when he was first arrested,\nso that it covered his interviews with federal agents both before\nand after his initial appearance before the magistrate judge. The\nanalysis that follows assumes without deciding that he is correct\nabout the timing.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fadvised of his rights under Miranda while en route, and was then\n\ngiven a written form explaining those rights in Spanish upon\n\narrival at the Federal building. The parties agree that the bottom\n\nportion of the form, which contained an assent to waiver of\n\nMeléndez's rights, was crossed out before he signed the form at\n\n6:45 a.m, because he was not at that time waiving his rights.\n\nMeléndez admits he then went to Pretrial Services where he was\n\ngiven Miranda warnings a third time.\n\n          Agent Berrios and defendant Meléndez testified rather\n\ndifferently regarding what happened after Meléndez was returned to\n\nthe processing room from Pretrial Services, and the district court\n\ncredited the agent's testimony.        Agent Berrios testified that\n\nMeléndez approached him and another FBI agent and told them he\n\nwanted to cooperate, then spoke with them voluntarily for close to\n\nan hour, confessing to his role in the conspiracy.    The next day,\n\nBerrios prepared an FBI Form 302 summarizing Meléndez's debriefing\n\nand the information obtained.   Meléndez was kept separately from\n\nthe other detainees after he was debriefed.\n\n          Meléndez testified, by contrast, that he had specifically\n\nand repeatedly requested his own lawyer from the time he was first\n\nread his Miranda rights, that he had been told that after he\n\ncooperated the agents would call his attorney, and that despite the\n\nagents' constant pressure on him he had consistently refused to\n\ncooperate.\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f                At about 1:30 p.m. the same day, Meléndez was taken\n\nbefore a magistrate judge for his initial appearance.                  The judge\n\nadvised him of his right to consult counsel, but Meléndez, as his\n\nown testimony established, did not request an attorney.3                    It is\n\nundisputed that Meléndez did not say he had already requested an\n\nattorney but had been denied one, that he was being pressed to\n\nwaive his right to counsel, or that he had already been interviewed\n\nin violation of his rights.              Berrios testified that the prosecutor\n\ntold the judge at sidebar that Meléndez had decided to cooperate.\n\nIt is undisputed that Meléndez was returned to the custody of the\n\nFBI after his initial appearance, which Berrios testified happened\n\nonly       in   order   to   facilitate     Meléndez's   cooperation   with   the\n\ninvestigation.\n\n                Berrios      testified    that,   wanting   Meléndez   to     feel\n\ncomfortable because he was cooperating, the agents took him to a\n\nhotel after that initial appearance, and not to jail, as would\n\nusually happen.           Another agent, Felix Rivera, was present at the\n\nhotel and testified at the suppression hearing consistently with\n\nAgent Berrios that Meléndez was indeed relaxed and comfortable at\n\n\n\n       3\n          For reasons that are not clear, no transcript or\nrecording of the initial appearance has been located or presented\nto us. We rely on the trial judge's findings of fact as to what\nhappened at the initial appearance.      In addition, there is no\nreason to believe that this highly experienced magistrate judge did\nnot advise Meléndez of his right to counsel at his appearance after\nhis arrest. Meléndez in fact testified that he was read his rights\nbefore the magistrate judge and did not ask for a lawyer.\n\n                                           -13-\n\fthe hotel, that he made a few fruitless phone calls to co-\n\nconspirators who would not speak because they already knew he had\n\nbeen arrested, and that he did not request counsel in either\n\nagent's presence.    Both agents testified that the next morning,\n\nSeptember 14, Meléndez was taken to a government building where he\n\nwas debriefed in more depth by several agents, including Berrios\n\nand Rivera, at which time he cooperated without ever requesting\n\ncounsel or expressing reluctance to cooperate, and after which\n\nRivera prepared another FBI Form 302 summarizing the interview.\n\nAfter the interview, the agents consulted with the prosecutors, who\n\ndetermined Meléndez should be taken to the federal prison.\n\n           Meléndez testified that he was terrified to be taken to\n\nthe hotel because he thought he was being kidnapped, and that he\n\nhad refused to make any calls while there.           He testified that\n\nduring the second interview the next morning he had continued to\n\nadamantly refuse to cooperate, confess, or make calls, and had\n\ncontinued to ask to see an attorney.\n\n           The district court decided to \"afford total credibility\"\n\nto the agents' testimony rather than to Meléndez's version of\n\nevents.   Melendez II, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 86.      The court found that\n\neach agent's testimony was delivered credibly and was consistent\n\nwith the other's \"even after being rigorously cross examined\" by\n\ndefense   counsel.    Id.   at   85.     And   circumstantial   evidence\n\ncorroborated the agents' testimony that Meléndez was voluntarily\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcooperating with the agents during the two days following his\n\narrest, including that the magistrate judge left Meléndez in the\n\ncustody of the FBI after his initial appearance, that he was taken\n\nto a hotel instead of to jail following his initial appearance, and\n\nthat he did not ask for a lawyer before the magistrate judge even\n\nwhen advised he had a right to consult one.          Id. at 85-86.\n\n              Crediting the agents' testimony, the district court found\n\nas fact that during those two days, Meléndez was calm, collected,\n\nand capable of intelligent and voluntary waiver of his rights. Id.\n\nat 86 n.1.      The court found that he initiated the first interview\n\nwith the agents, and that he did not ask for an attorney, did not\n\nsay he did not want to cooperate, and did not ask to stop any of\n\nthe interviews.      Id. at 86.\n\n              We have reviewed the transcripts of the suppression\n\nhearing and conclude that there is no clear error in the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact.           \"Where a district court's 'factual\n\nfindings are based on credibility determinations[,] . . . error is\n\nseldom considered \"clear\" unless the credibility assessments were\n\nbased on testimony which was inherently implausible, internally\n\ninconsistent, or critically impeached.'\" United States v.
