In the teeth of two decades of\n\ncontrary     precedent        from     four     circuits,      defendant-appellant\n\nMallinckrodt, Inc. asks us to restrict the role of private citizens\n\nin   the   abatement     of   imminent        and   substantial    threats    to   the\n\nenvironment and public health.                  In support of this entreaty,\n\nMallinckrodt presents a gallimaufry of new, hitherto unconsidered\n\narguments.     After careful consideration of this asseverational\n\narray, we conclude that our sister circuits have adroitly distilled\n\nthe meaning of section 7002(a)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation\n\nand Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1)(B) — the so-called\n\ncitizen suit provision.              Correctly interpreted, this provision\n\nallows citizen suits when there is a reasonable prospect that a\n\nserious, near-term threat to human health or the environment\n\nexists.1     In   such    situations,         the   provision     permits    remedies\n\nconsistent    with     the     scope    of     a    district    court's     equitable\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            The district court read the statute in this manner and\n\nfaithfully applied the law to the facts. Its supportable liability\n\nfinding, coupled with a choice of remedy that comes within the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      We use the phrase \"near-term threat\" advisedly. It is the\nthreat that must be close at hand, even if the perceived harm is\nnot.   For example, if there is a reasonable prospect that a\ncarcinogen released into the environment today may cause cancer\ntwenty years hence, the threat is near-term even though the\nperceived harm will only occur in the distant future.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fencincture of its discretion, leads us to reject Mallinckrodt's\n\nappeal.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We rehearse here only those facts that are directly\n\nrelevant to the issues on appeal, referring readers who hunger for\n\nmore information to the district court's initial opinion.          See Me.\n\nPeople's Alliance v. HoltraChem Mfg. Co., 211 F. Supp. 2d 237 (D.\n\nMe. 2002).    This narrative credits the factual findings of the\n\ndistrict court to the extent that those findings are not clearly\n\nerroneous.    See Fed. Refinance Co. v. Klock, 352 F.3d 16, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n           From    1967      to     1982,   Mallinckrodt,   then    called\n\nInternational     Minerals    and    Chemicals   Corporation,   owned   and\n\noperated a chlor-alkali plant (the Plant) situated on the banks of\n\nthe Penobscot River in Orrington, Maine.           Thereafter, the Plant\n\ncontinued operations under other owners, namely, Hanlin Group, Inc.\n\nand HoltraChem Manufacturing Co.,2 until it closed in 2000.         During\n\nthe period of its operation, the Plant deposited tons of mercury-\n\nladen waste into the Penobscot River.         See Me. People's Alliance,\n\n211 F. Supp. 2d at 253.       While there have been a number of other\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      Hanlin Group declared bankruptcy in 1991 and was never named\nas a defendant in this action. HoltraChem dissolved in 2001 and,\nalthough originally a party, did not participate in the critical\ndistrict court proceedings.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fsignificant contributors to mercury in the Penobscot, \"Mallinckrodt\n\nhas been a dominant source.\"    Id. at 255.\n\n           In 1986, the Plant's continuous release of mercury led\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to file an administrative\n\nRCRA action against Hanlin (the Plant's quondam owner).        That\n\naction resulted in an agreement for corrective measures.    Deeming\n\nturnabout fair play, Hanlin sued Mallinckrodt for contribution. In\n\na 1991 settlement, Mallinckrodt agreed to pay a portion of the\n\ncompliance costs imposed by the agreement.\n\n           A subsequent enforcement action led to a 1993 consent\n\ndecree that superseded the earlier agreement. Although not a party\n\nto this consent decree, Mallinckrodt, consistent with the Hanlin\n\nsettlement, paid its share of the compliance costs and participated\n\nin ongoing negotiations with government regulators.3 That included\n\nworking with both EPA and Maine's Department of Environmental\n\nProtection (MDEP).\n\n           The 1993 consent decree contemplated a tripartite process\n\ncomprising site investigation, evaluation of possible corrective\n\nmeasures, and remediation.     In line with the first phase of this\n\nprocess, Mallinckrodt compiled and submitted a site investigation\n\nreport.   In March of 1997, EPA and MDEP, acting in concert, issued\n\n\n     3\n      HoltraChem was involved with Mallinckrodt in much of the\npretrial activity. For ease of exposition, however, we henceforth\nwill refer to the Plant owners collectively as \"Mallinckrodt.\"\nThis rhetorical device has no bearing on the outcome of this\nappeal.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fa draft notice of disapproval.           Mallinckrodt countered with a\n\nsupplemental site investigation report but, in 2000, EPA and MDEP\n\nagain disapproved.      Among other things, the regulators instructed\n\nMallinckrodt to study the effects of mercury downriver from the\n\nPlant.\n\n            Within a matter of months, Mallinckrodt commissioned a\n\nstudy aimed at examining downriver mercury contamination.                It\n\nconducted a second downriver study during the summer of 2001.\n\nNotwithstanding the submission of these studies, however, the\n\ndistrict   court   supportably   found    that    Mallinckrodt   made   only\n\nminimal efforts to pursue the designated line of inquiry and that\n\nthe decision to forgo more vigorous efforts was deliberate. Id. at\n\n244 & n.9.\n\n            In the midst of this sparring, two environmental groups\n\n— the National Resources Defense Council and the Maine People's\n\nAlliance — joined forces to commence a citizen suit under RCRA §\n\n7002(a)(1)(B).     The plaintiffs alleged that mercury contamination\n\ndownriver from the Plant \"may present an imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment to health or the environment.\"             Acknowledging the\n\npossibility that remediation might eventually prove to be either\n\nunnecessary or infeasible, their principal prayer for relief was\n\nthat     Mallinckrodt    be   ordered     to     fund   an   \"independent,\n\ncomprehensive, scientific study to determine the precise nature and\n\nextent of the endangerment.\"\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                 Mallinckrodt tried on several occasions to derail the\n\nsuit       on   the   ground     that    EPA,    not   the    courts,     had    primary\n\njurisdiction.           The district court demurred, holding that the suit\n\nwould not present any conflict with agency action due to EPA's\n\napparent lack of interest in the lower Penobscot.\n\n                 The case was reached for trial in March of 2002.                By that\n\ntime,      EPA    and    MDEP    had    made    public,   but      had   not    adopted,\n\npreliminary media protection standards, potentially applicable to\n\nthe lower Penobscot.             Had those standards gone into effect, no\n\nremediation would have been required for the region with which this\n\nlitigation is concerned.\n\n                 During a nine-day bench trial,4 one of the plaintiffs'\n\nprincipal experts was Dr. Robert Livingston.                       The district court\n\nfound      Livingston,      an   aquatic       biologist,     to    be   \"particularly\n\ncredible and persuasive.\"                Id. at 251.         Drawing on three main\n\nsources — the data gathered under the EPA-ordered site studies,\n\nsome limited field work, and the scientific literature concerning\n\nmercury in aquatic systems — Livingston opined that there might be\n\n\n       4\n      We need not recount the trial testimony in endless detail.\nThe critical facts are laid out in the district court's rescript.\nEven though many of the facts are undisputed, the parties have\nwoven them into widely dissimilar tapestries. On the plaintiffs'\ntelling,   Mallinckrodt   is  an   unrepentant   polluter,   which\nconsistently flouted governmental enforcement efforts and finally\nwore down the regulators.        On Mallinckrodt's telling, the\nplaintiffs are overzealous environmentalists attempting an end run\naround the reasoned policymaking of an Executive Branch agency.\nThese pejorative portrayals do little to aid the resolution of the\nissues before us.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fa serious endangerment to both human health and the environment\n\nresulting    from   mercury   contamination     in   the   lower    Penobscot.\n\nAlthough believing it \"highly likely\" that these harms would prove\n\nto be both real and severe, he cautioned that he had not yet \"done\n\nthe right research to determine that.\"               Due to the absence of\n\nsufficient research, no one could know with certitude \"if there is\n\na problem\" or \"what the problem is.\"       When all was said and done,\n\nhowever, he thought it \"highly likely\" that localized and targeted\n\nremediation would be both necessary and desirable.\n\n            The plaintiffs also adduced testimony from other experts,\n\nfrom individuals within their respective memberships, and from EPA\n\nand MDEP representatives. A number of defense experts testified as\n\nwell.   After both sides had rested and submitted briefs, the\n\ndistrict court issued a thoughtful rescript.\n\n            The court found that mercury in aquatic systems is\n\nsusceptible to being transformed by microscopic organisms into its\n\norganic form (known as methylmercury). Id. at 244.            Methylmercury\n\nis a highly toxic substance which, even in low dosages, is inimical\n\nto human health; for example, it \"attacks the nervous system, the\n\nkidneys, the immune system, and the reproductive system\" and is\n\nespecially    damaging   to    a   developing    fetus.       Id.    at   245.\n\nMethylmercury is especially pernicious because it is the most\n\nbioavailable form of mercury and therefore, is readily accumulated\n\nin humans and animals alike.       Id. at 244.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f           Next, the court found that mercury concentration in\n\nsediments extracted from the lower Penobscot runs five times higher\n\nthan in the Kennebec River (which Mallinckrodt's expert identified\n\nas an appropriate comparator).            Id. at 248.      Despite this high\n\nconcentration, the court wisely recognized that \"the mere presence\n\nof mercury contaminated sediments is alone not enough to constitute\n\nan imminent and substantial endangerment,\" id., so it proceeded to\n\nexamine the available data concerning mercury contamination in\n\nvarious species in the lower Penobscot, including benthos, killfish\n\n(minnows), lobsters, blue mussels, cormorants, osprey, and eagles.\n\nThis   examination   led   the    court    to   conclude   that   \"mercury    is\n\nmethylating downriver\" and that \"methylmercury is bioavailable,\n\nentering biota, and biomagnifying throughout the food web.\" Id. at\n\n251.\n\n           The court expressed heightened concern about a region\n\nknown as Frankfort Flats, which displayed extraordinarily high\n\nmercury   readings   in    both   sediments     and   biota.      Id.   at   252.\n\nFrankfort Flats receives drainage from a marsh system, and marshes\n\nare considered to be hotbeds of methylation.            See id.\n\n           When the district court turned to the legal standard for\n\ncitizen suits under RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B), it characterized that\n\nstandard as \"lenient.\"       211 F. Supp. 2d at 246.           It cited with\n\napproval case law emphasizing that RCRA allows such a suit when the\n\nputative polluter \"may\" have caused an imminent and substantial\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fendangerment.        Id. at 246-47 (collecting cases).      On this basis,\n\nthe court concluded that the statute's \"imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment\" standard would be satisfied by a \"reasonable medical\n\nconcern for public health and a reasonable scientific concern for\n\nthe environment.\"       Id. at 252.\n\n              Applying this interpretation of the statute to the facts\n\nas   found,    the    court   determined    that   Mallinckrodt's   disposal\n\nactivities may have created an imminent and substantial danger and\n\nthat, therefore, the plaintiffs had carried their burden of proof\n\nanent liability. Id. at 251-52. Then, having found liability, the\n\ncourt directed the parties to make a good-faith effort to agree on\n\na study plan.     Id. at 256.    The parties complied and, on August 10,\n\n2005, the court approved a plan which, if carried out, probably\n\nwill require Mallinckrodt to spend around $4,000,000 for laboratory\n\nanalyses, independent of all other costs. The purpose of the study\n\nis to learn whether, in actuality, mercury contamination in the\n\nlower Penobscot adversely affects either human health or the\n\nenvironment, and if so, to devise a feasible remedial approach.\n\n              Mallinckrodt now appeals, asserting that the plaintiffs\n\nlacked standing to sue in the first place; that the lower court set\n\nthe bar too low for RCRA citizen suits; and that, in all events,\n\nthe court abused its discretion in fashioning relief.           We address\n\nthese assertions one by one.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fII.   STANDING\n\n           As a threshold matter, Mallinckrodt alleges that the\n\nplaintiffs lack standing to sue because they have not suffered an\n\ninjury in fact.5   The existence vel non of standing is a legal\n\nquestion and, therefore, engenders de novo review.   See N.H. Right\n\nto Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).    When, however, the trial court's standing determination\n\nrests on findings of fact, we must honor those factual findings\n\nunless they are clearly erroneous.    See Rivera v. Wyeth-Ayerst\n\nLabs., 283 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\n           We start our inquiry into standing with the undisputed\n\nfact that both of the plaintiffs are associations.     In order to\n\nground a claim of associational standing (that is, standing to\n\nbring suit on behalf of its membership), an association must show\n\nthree things: (i) that individual members would have standing to\n\nsue in their own right; (ii) that the interests at stake are\n\nrelated to the organization's core purposes; and (iii) that both\n\nthe asserted claim and the requested relief can be adjudicated\n\n\n\n      5\n      Mallinckrodt also makes a weak argument that the claimed\ninjury cannot be redressed by the relief requested. This argument\nfocuses on the uncertainty attendant to the study's outcome (for\nexample, the study may find that there is no endangerment or, if\nendangerment exists, that it cannot be rectified). But even in the\nabsence of a demonstrated need for remediation, the information\nthat the study will provide is adequate redress because it will\nallow the plaintiffs to tailor their behavior to the actual\ncondition of the lower Penobscot.     Consequently, Mallinckrodt's\nredressability argument is untenable.\n\n                               -10-\n\fwithout     the     participation     of     individual     members     as   named\n\nplaintiffs.       Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.\n\n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000).             The plaintiffs in this case\n\nplainly have made the latter two showings.                  Hence, the inquiry\n\nreduces to whether the organizations' individual members would have\n\nhad standing to proceed in their own right.\n\n            Because there is nothing in RCRA's text or history that\n\nsuggests    a     congressional     intent    to   erect    statutory    standing\n\nbarriers beyond those imposed by Article III of the Constitution\n\nand because Mallinckrodt has not identified any prudential standing\n\nconcerns, we focus on what is essential to establish Article III\n\nstanding.        Those requirements are expressed in a familiar three-\n\npart algorithm: a would-be plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete\n\nand particularized injury in fact, a causal connection that permits\n\ntracing the claimed injury to the defendant's actions, and a\n\nlikelihood that prevailing in the action will afford some redress\n\nfor the injury.       Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-\n\n61 (1992); Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nThese requisites must be proved \"with the manner and degree of\n\nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.        When, as now, standing is reviewed after\n\ntrial,     the     facts   establishing      standing      \"must   be   supported\n\nadequately by the evidence adduced at trial.\"                      Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).           The ultimate quotient of proof is a\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fpreponderance of the evidence.        See Perry v. Vill. of Arlington\n\nHeights, 186 F.3d 826, 829 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n            We first dispose of an argument that verges on the\n\nspecious.    Mallinckrodt protests that the plaintiffs cannot have\n\nestablished a cognizable injury since the district court thought it\n\nappropriate to order a remedy — the study — that would determine\n\nwhether mercury in the Penobscot is \"having significant adverse\n\neffects\" on the environment or \"posing an unacceptable risk to\n\nhuman health.\"      This protestation conflates the district court's\n\nfinding of liability with its choice of remedy.               As we shortly\n\nshall explain, probabilistic harms are legally cognizable, and the\n\ndistrict    court   made   a   supportable   finding   that   a   sufficient\n\nprobability of harm exists to satisfy the Article III standing\n\ninquiry.    See Me. People's Alliance, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 253.          The\n\nfact that the court chose a remedy that aspires to furnish a degree\n\nof determinacy before fashioning further relief speaks only to the\n\ncourt's cautious use of discretion in selecting remedies; it does\n\nnot speak to the plaintiffs' standing as of the present time.\n\n            Having dispatched this attempted sleight of hand, we\n\nproceed to more serious matters.           Mallinckrodt concentrates its\n\nstanding attack on the plaintiffs' ostensible failure to prove the\n\ninjury-in-fact component.        At trial, the plaintiffs called four\n\nwitnesses from within their respective memberships, all of whom\n\nreside on or near the banks of the Penobscot River.                All four\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fvouchsafed that they have modified their behavior due to fear of\n\nmercury contamination.   Although eager to do so, none of them will\n\neat fish or shellfish from the river nor recreate on or near it.\n\nOne witness added that, but for the mercury contamination, she\n\nwould harvest mussels and sell them to supplement her income.   The\n\ndistrict court credited this testimony.    Id.\n\n           Plaintiffs in environmental suits may predicate claims of\n\ninjury on aesthetic or recreational harms.    See Laidlaw, 528 U.S.\n\nat 183; Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 735 (1972); Save Our\n\nHeritage, Inc. v. FAA, 269 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir. 2001).      Still,\n\nneither a bald assertion of such a harm nor a purely subjective\n\nfear that an environmental hazard may have been created is enough\n\nto ground standing.      Rather, an individual's decision to deny\n\nherself aesthetic or recreational pleasures based on concern about\n\npollution will constitute a cognizable injury only when the concern\n\nis premised upon a realistic threat.   See Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184;\n\nsee also City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 107 n.8 (1983)\n\n(explaining that \"the reality of the threat . . . , not the\n\nplaintiff's subjective apprehensions,\" constitutes the cognizable\n\ninjury).\n\n           In this instance, Mallinckrodt exhorts us to find that\n\nthe witnesses' stated fears are unreasonable.    It points out — and\n\nthe record confirms — that waterways throughout Maine suffer to\n\nsome extent from mercury pollution and that, therefore, it is\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fresponsible at most for a probabilistic increase in a risk that the\n\nwitnesses would in any event have had to run.\n\n             There     is    some     confusion     as     to     the   thrust     of\n\nMallinckrodt's argument.             The plaintiffs read its brief, not\n\nimplausibly,      as    arguing     that   these    facts       necessarily    limit\n\ncognizable      injuries     to    identifiable     medical       concerns.       See\n\nAppellees'      Br.    at   54.     Mallinckrodt's       reply    brief,    however,\n\nacknowledges that the plaintiffs' principal claim of injury is for\n\ndiminished enjoyment of their environment and joins issue on the\n\nsufficiency of the proof in that regard. See Appellant's Reply Br.\n\nat 25.    At bottom, this argument suggests that the plaintiffs must\n\nshow     that   Mallinckrodt's       activities     created       a   significantly\n\nincreased risk of harm to health or the environment so as to make\n\nit objectively reasonable for the plaintiffs' members to deny\n\nthemselves aesthetic and recreational use of the river.\n\n             To establish an injury in fact based on a probabilistic\n\nharm, a plaintiff must show that there is a substantial probability\n\nthat harm will occur.             See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 504\n\n(1975); see also Adams v. Watson, 10 F.3d 915, 923 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nMallinckrodt      suggests     that    the     instant    plaintiffs       have   not\n\ndemonstrated a sufficiently probable increase in harm because of\n\n(i) Dr. Livingston's admitted uncertainty about whether any problem\n\nexists and (ii) the notion that politically accountable branches of\n\ngovernment, not courts, are the appropriate entities to make\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fjudgments as to what risks are acceptable in modern society.\n\nNeither suggestion is convincing.\n\n              Mallinckrodt's first suggestion relies ultimately on a\n\nsingle snippet of Dr. Livingston's testimony, wrested from its\n\ncontextual moorings.          But a trial court, confronted with a complex\n\nand    highly    ramified     factual    situation,    is   fully   entitled     to\n\nconsider the import of a witness's testimony as a whole.              This case\n\nis a good example: Dr. Livingston testified, in effect, that the\n\npresence of a great deal of smoke justified looking for a fire.\n\nMallinckrodt excerpts only his isolated statement that he had not\n\nactually seen a fire yet.             This plucking of the record overlooks\n\nthe obvious fact that the district court, drawing on the whole of\n\nDr. Livingston's testimony as well as a plethora of other evidence,\n\nsupportably concluded that \"mercury is methylating downriver, and\n\nthat   such     methylmercury     is    bioavailable,    entering    biota,    and\n\nbiomagnifying throughout the food web\" in sufficient quantity that\n\nit may well present an imminent and substantial danger to the\n\nenvironment.       Me. People's Alliance, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 251\n\n(citation omitted).         Relatedly, the court found that \"the effects\n\nresulting from methylmercury exposure . . . clearly endanger\n\nreproduction, development, and overall health of the public and the\n\nenvironment,\"      id.   at    252,    and   that   \"Mallinckrodt   has   been   a\n\ndominant source of mercury in the Penobscot River,\" id. at 255.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            In other words — to return to our metaphor — the lower\n\ncourt   discerned         telltale    signs       that   a   fire     might    already   be\n\nsmoldering.        In light of its warrantable findings, the court had\n\nample     reason     to     conclude       that    Mallinckrodt         has    created    a\n\nsubstantial probability of increased harm to the environment. That\n\nincreased risk, in turn, rendered reasonable the actions of the\n\nplaintiffs' members in abstaining from their desired enjoyment of\n\nthe Penobscot.\n\n            Mallinckrodt's second suggestion is nothing less than a\n\nno-holds-barred       assault        on    the    federal     courts'       institutional\n\ncompetency.     It emphasizes that the plaintiffs allege no violation\n\nof any federally prescribed discharge limits, and then treats this\n\nomission as dispositive. See Appellant's Br. at 27 (asserting that\n\n\"in the absence of any finding by [EPA],\" courts are not equipped\n\nto determine whether \"the medical and scientific uncertainties\n\ncreated    by   mercury       in     the   Penobscot         create    an     unacceptable\n\nincreased risk of harm\" (emphasis in original)).\n\n            This postulate proceeds from a two-part premise.                        First,\n\nin terms of environmental regulation — where important policy\n\ntradeoffs must be made between protection and progress — the only\n\ninjuries that satisfy the criteria for Article III standing are\n\nthose injuries that are \"unacceptable\"; and second, the political\n\nbranches alone, not courts, have the expertise and accountability\n\nto determine which injuries society must be prepared to tolerate.\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\fIn Mallinckrodt's view, this need to restrict cognizable injuries\n\nto \"unacceptable\" injuries is especially acute where, as in this\n\ncase, the asserted harms are probabilistic.\n\n          Mallinckrodt provides scant authority for an argument\n\nthat has such breathtaking ramifications for the scope of judicial\n\npower.   Its notion of acceptability is apparently derived from a\n\nsingle, quarter-century-old opinion, in which a respected court\n\ncautioned that judges cannot \"formulate policy with respect to what\n\n[environmental] risks are acceptable.\"   Envtl. Def. Fund v. EPA,\n\n598 F.2d 62, 83-84 (D.C. Cir. 1978).     That court, however, was\n\nreviewing a challenge to an EPA regulation based on an alleged lack\n\nof substantial evidence. There is no discussion either of standing\n\nor of Article III's limits on judicial power.         The opinion,\n\ntherefore, affords no solid foundation for the proposition that\n\nMallinckrodt asserts.6\n\n          In a related vein, Mallinckrodt argues that a grant of\n\nstanding in this case would be tantamount to judicial usurpation of\n\nregulatory authority because it would permit \"private parties to\n\nattack EPA risk assessments collaterally, using the very risks EPA\n\ndeemed acceptable to establish standing and liability, with no\n\ndeference afforded to EPA's policy judgment.\"    Appellant's Reply\n\n\n     6\n      Mallinckrodt's other citations — National Lime Ass'n v. EPA,\n627 F.2d 416, 433 n.48 (D.C. Cir. 1980), and Industrial Union\nDepartment v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 662-63\n(1980) (Burger, C.J., concurring) — likewise concern judicial\nreview of agency regulations. They too are inapposite.\n\n                               -17-\n\fBr. at 27-28.     But the ingredients that comprise what Mallinckrodt\n\nsees as a recipe for disaster — the relatively broad scope of\n\ncitizens' rights to sue polluters, the existence of liability in\n\nsuch suits, and the less-than-total deference afforded to agency\n\ninaction — all turn on legislative choices.                      Congress has elected\n\nto create a cause of action for affected citizens notwithstanding\n\nthe   absence    of   any        EPA-sponsored       standard.         While      we   share\n\nMallinckrodt's belief that it would be a usurpation of legislative\n\nprerogative     for     a   court    to     assume       policymaking        control   over\n\nenvironmental      regulation,        it     would       be    no    less     offensive   a\n\nusurpation for a court to refuse to undertake a task validly\n\nentrusted to it by Congress.                In the last analysis, Article III\n\nrequires a cognizable injury; it does not speak to the wisdom of\n\nthe legislature's actions in providing redress for that injury.\n\n           We     add       an    eschatocol        of     sorts.            In   rejecting\n\nMallinckrodt's arguments as to standing, we remain confident that\n\nCongress has not asked federal courts to perform tasks that are\n\nbeyond their institutional competency.                        In our view, courts are\n\ncapable of assessing probabilistic injuries.                         Moreover, nuisance\n\nprinciples      contribute        heavily    to    the     doctrinal        template   that\n\nunderbraces statutes like RCRA, see, e.g., Cox v. City of Dallas,\n\n256 F.3d 281, 289 (5th Cir. 2001), and the tasks involved in\n\nadjudicating     environmental         cases       are    well      within    the   federal\n\ncourts' accustomed domain.            While courts can (and do) benefit from\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\favailable agency expertise, it is an insupportable leap of logic to\n\nmaintain that, in the absence of such input, claims of injury are\n\nnot cognizable at all.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.             For the reasons\n\ndiscussed above, we hold that the plaintiffs have standing to sue\n\nunder RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B).        We turn, then, to the meat of the\n\nappeal.\n\nIII. THE MERITS\n\n            This case revolves around the meaning and purport of RCRA\n\n§   7002(a)(1)(B),   a   statute   that,    as   described    above,    allows\n\ncitizens to sue persons or firms whose handling of solid or\n\nhazardous    waste   \"may   present    an    imminent    and        substantial\n\nendangerment to health or the environment.\"             Id.     The district\n\ncourt read this language as meaning that such suits could be\n\nbrought to alleviate reasonable medical or scientific concerns.\n\nMe. People's Alliance, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 252.          Mallinckrodt urges\n\na more circumscribed interpretation.             To the extent that this\n\ninterpretive    controversy    presents      a   question      of     statutory\n\nconstruction, we afford de novo review.7          See Lattab v. Ashcroft,\n\n384 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n      7\n      Mallinckrodt has pitched this aspect of its appeal\nexclusively in terms of statutory construction. Had it challenged\nthe district court's application of the law to the facts, our\nreview would have been more deferential. See, e.g., Interfaith\nCmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 248, 254 (3d Cir.\n2005) (advocating \"clear error\" review).\n\n                                   -19-\n\f            An historical perspective illustrates the strength of the\n\ncurrent against which Mallinckrodt is swimming.          Congress enacted\n\nRCRA in 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-580, 90 Stat. 2795, with the avowed\n\nintention of closing \"the last remaining loophole in environmental\n\nlaw, that of unregulated land disposal of discarded materials and\n\nhazardous waste.\"   H.R. Rep. No. 94-1491, pt. 1, at 4, reprinted in\n\n1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6238, 6241.      In its original iteration, RCRA §\n\n7002 (now codified in pertinent part at 42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1)(A))\n\noffered citizens the opportunity to bring suit against a polluter\n\nonly when the polluter was alleged to be in violation of a permit,\n\nstandard, regulation, condition, requirement, or order issued by\n\nEPA.   At the same time, RCRA created a cause of action, available\n\nexclusively to the EPA Administrator, for cases in which the\n\n\"disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste is presenting an\n\nimminent    and   substantial    endangerment       to   health   or    the\n\nenvironment.\"     RCRA § 7003 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n6973(a)).    In suits brought under this latter provision, federal\n\ndistrict courts were granted broad remedial authority to \"restrain\"\n\npolluters and take \"such other action as may be necessary.\"            Id.\n\n            Pertinently   we   think,    Congress   later   loosened    the\n\nstandard for liability under section 7003.          This transpired four\n\nyears later when Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act\n\nAmendments of 1980.       That legislation amended section 7003 by\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fsubstituting the words \"may present\" for the words \"is presenting.\"\n\nPub. L. No. 96-482, § 25, 94 Stat. 2334, 2348.\n\n          In United States v. Price, 688 F.2d 204 (3d Cir. 1982),\n\na seminal RCRA § 7003 case, a district court found that a landfill\n\nleaking toxic substances posed an imminent and substantial danger\n\nto Atlantic City's water supply but refused to order a study of\n\nthis hazard at the preliminary injunction stage.     Id. at 209.   The\n\nThird Circuit reversed, ruling that the use of the word \"may\" in\n\nRCRA § 7003 was intended to make the provision \"expansive.\"    Id. at\n\n213. In its view, \"Congress, by enacting section 7003, intended to\n\nconfer upon courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable\n\nrelief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risks posed by\n\ntoxic waste.\"   Id. at 214.\n\n          Soon thereafter, Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid\n\nWaste Amendments of 1984 (1984 amendments), Pub. L. No. 98-616, 98\n\nStat. 3221.    The 1984 amendments introduced a new provision, RCRA\n\n§ 7002(a)(1)(B), into the statutory scheme.       Using language that\n\ntracked the post-1980 text of RCRA § 7003, this new provision\n\nextended to citizens the right to sue a polluter who may be causing\n\nan imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the\n\nenvironment.    Id. § 401, 98 Stat. at 3268-69.     The Senate Report\n\nthat accompanied the 1984 amendments approvingly cited and quoted\n\nPrice on several occasions, specifically endorsing that court's\n\nconclusion that section 7003 is intended to give courts the tools\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fto \"eliminate any risks posed by toxic waste.\"            S. Rep. No. 98-284,\n\nat 59 (1983).\n\n           Around this same time, the Fourth Circuit decided another\n\nRCRA § 7003 case, in which it flatly rejected the proposition that\n\n\"section 7003 was designed to control pollution only in emergency\n\nsituations.\"     United States v. Waste Indus., Inc., 734 F.2d 159,\n\n165 (4th Cir. 1984).    The court emphasized the statute's use of the\n\nword \"may\" and cited Price approvingly.\n\n           Price and Waste Industries have become guideposts for\n\ncourts endeavoring to interpret the counterpart language contained\n\nin RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B).        To date, at least four of our sister\n\ncircuits have construed that provision expansively. See Interfaith\n\nCmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'l., Inc., 399 F.3d 248, 258-59 (3d Cir.\n\n2005); Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., 386 F.3d 993, 1015\n\n(11th   Cir.   2004);   Cox,   256   F.3d    at   299;    Dague   v.   City   of\n\nBurlington, 935 F.2d 1343, 1355 (2d Cir. 1991), rev'd in part on\n\nother grounds, 505 U.S. 557 (1992).          In taking this position, all\n\nfour courts have emphasized the preeminence of the word \"may\" in\n\ndefining   the    degree   of    risk       needed   to    support     RCRA    §\n\n7002(a)(1)(B)'s liability standard.\n\n           This expansiveness in construing the requisite degree of\n\nrisk has largely been matched in the courts' assessment of the\n\ngravity and immediacy of the threatened harm.              With one possible\n\nexception, the courts have agreed that the word \"substantial\"\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fimplies serious harm.8   See, e.g., Parker, 386 F.3d at 1015.     There\n\nhas, however, been some reluctance to quantify the needed level of\n\nharm more precisely.     See, e.g., Honeywell, 399 F.3d at 259.\n\nImminence generally has been read to require only that the harm is\n\nof a kind that poses a near-term threat; there is no corollary\n\nrequirement that the harm necessarily will occur or that the actual\n\ndamage will manifest itself immediately. See Cox, 256 F.3d at 299-\n\n300.\n\n           Mallinckrodt argues that this long line of cases has\n\nconsistently   misread   Price   (which,   Mallinckrodt   says,   only\n\nconcerned remedial power, not scope of liability) and, in the\n\nbargain, has disregarded the strictures imposed by the adjectives\n\n\"imminent\" and \"substantial.\" We have not had occasion to construe\n\nthe reach of the citizen suit provision contained in RCRA §\n\n7002(a)(1)(B), and we are obligated to offer our independent\n\njudgment on an issue of first impression here (which, as we shortly\n\nshall explain, coincides with the result reached by the other\n\ncourts of appeals that have confronted the question). Accordingly,\n\nwe proceed to test the mettle of the conventional construction of\n\nRCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B) against Mallinckrodt's challenge.\n\n           The district court, following the interpretive trail\n\nblazed by the four above-mentioned courts of appeals, employed the\n\n\n       8\n      The possible exception is the Second Circuit, which, to date,\nhas not committed to read into the statute a requirement of\nseriousness. See Dague, 935 F.2d at 1355-56.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fconventional construction.            It began by noting that the word\n\n\"endangerment\" does not imply actual harm but, rather, implies only\n\npotential harm.      Me. People's Alliance, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 246.\n\nThe court then noted that the statutory standard is further relaxed\n\nbecause of Congress's use of the word \"may.\"               Id.    As a result, the\n\ncourt found RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B) to be a \"sweeping provision\n\nindicat[ing] Congress's intent 'to confer upon the courts the\n\nauthority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent\n\nnecessary to eliminate any risk posed by toxic waste.'\"                      Id. at\n\n246-47 (quoting Dague, 935 F.2d at 1355 (quoting Price, 688 F.2d at\n\n214) (emphasis supplied in Dague)).\n\n             The court read the statute's adjectival elements in line\n\nwith the breadth of the authority granted.                It found that the word\n\n\"imminent\" connotes only that the \"factors giving rise to [the\n\nharm] are present, even though the harm may not be realized for\n\nsome time.\"    Id. at 247.       Relatedly, the court found that the word\n\n\"substantial\" connotes no more than \"reasonable cause for concern\n\nthat someone or something may be exposed\" to harm.                   Id. (quoting\n\nRaymond K. Hoxsie Real Estate Trust v. Exxon Educ. Found., 81 F.\n\nSupp.   2d    359,   366    (D.R.I.      2000)    (internal      quotation    marks\n\nomitted)).     A \"reasonable medical concern\" would, the court said,\n\nbe sufficient to ground liability under the statute.                     Id. at 252.\n\nThe court's only explicit limitation on the availability of relief\n\nwas   when   \"the    risk   of    harm    is     remote   in     time,    completely\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fspeculative in nature, or de minimis in degree.\"          Id. at 247\n\n(quoting United States v. Reilly Tar & Chem. Corp., 546 F. Supp.\n\n1100, 1109 (D. Minn. 1982)).      Mallinckrodt balks at this\n\ninterpretation of RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B) for a host of reasons.       It\n\nargues that this construction ignores the plain meaning of the\n\nphrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment,\" does violence to\n\nthe internal coherence of RCRA by overlooking the hierarchy of\n\nstandards contained within that statute, tampers with Congress's\n\nwise delegation of policymaking to an expert agency, and frustrates\n\ncongressional intent. We address each of these criticisms in turn.\n\n          Mallinckrodt's textual argument rests on the premise that\n\nthe courts that heretofore have explicated section 7002(a)(1)(B)'s\n\nliability standard have been blinded by the glare of the word \"may\"\n\nand have lost sight of the plain meaning of the words \"imminent and\n\nsubstantial.\"   In Mallinckrodt's view, the phrase \"may present an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment,\" when read as a whole,\n\nrequires a risk of grave harm that is more likely than not to\n\noccur. Mallinckrodt deduces this construction from a Rosetta Stone\n\nthat is part case law and part lexicography.\n\n          The   word   \"endangerment,\"   Mallinckrodt   says   somewhat\n\ntautologically, is \"the state of being placed in danger.\" Webster's\n\nThird New International Dictionary 748 (1993).   In that connection,\n\nit defines danger as \"exposed to harm\" or \"peril.\"         Id. at 573\n\n(excess capitalization omitted). To elucidate the meaning of \"may,\"\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fMallinckrodt points to a sixty-year old Supreme Court decision that\n\ndefines \"may,\" as used in section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as\n\n\"probably.\"     Corn Prods. Refining Co. v. FTC, 324 U.S. 726, 738\n\n(1945).     Finally, to give content to the phrase \"imminent and\n\nsubstantial,\" Mallinckrodt invokes case law suggesting that, in\n\nother environmental contexts, the unadorned word \"endanger\" implies\n\na lower standard than that denoted by the phrase \"imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment.\"    See Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1, 20\n\nn.36 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (en banc); Reserve Mining Co. v. EPA, 514 F.2d\n\n492, 528 (8th Cir. 1975) (en banc).\n\n             Mallinckrodt's textual argument makes sense — but only to\n\na point.    While the decisions in Ethyl Corp. and Reserve Mining are\n\nsome evidence that, as of 1976, the phrase \"imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment\" was thought to denote a heightened standard,9 the\n\nrelevant question is how that term was understood in 1984 (when\n\nsection 7002(a)(1)(B) was enacted).      The Senate Report on the 1984\n\namendments defines the word \"endangerment\" separately from the\n\nphrase \"imminent and substantial.\"      See S. Rep. No. 98-284, supra,\n\nat 59.     Mallinckrodt's criticism fails to account either for that\n\ncircumstance or for Congress's insertion, in 1980, of the word \"may\"\n\n\n     9\n      Mallinckrodt is correct in noting that the district court,\nwhich cited both Ethyl Corp. and Reserve Mining, see Me. People's\nAlliance, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 246, failed to acknowledge that those\ncases were defining the term \"endangerment\" in contrast with\n\"imminent and substantial endangerment.\"     This observation may\nweaken the persuasive power of the district court's reasoning, but\nit hardly answers the definitional question.\n\n                                 -26-\n\finto section 7003 and its subsequent use in section 7002. That word\n\ndoes not appear at all in the statute considered in Reserve Mining,\n\n514 F.2d at 528 & n.70 (citing 33 U.S.C. § 1364).        In Ethyl Corp.,\n\none of the referenced statutes does use the word \"may,\" but that\n\ncourt did not parse the entire sentence and looked only to the words\n\n\"imminent and substantial.\"       See Ethyl Corp., 541 F.2d at 20 n.36\n\n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 300i).    We also note that statutes referenced\n\nin Ethyl Corp. and Reserve Mining bore the subtitle \"Emergency\n\nPowers\"; in contrast, neither section 7002 nor section 7003 carry\n\nsuch a label.\n\n           The sockdolager, we think, is that \"words are like\n\nchameleons;   they   frequently    have   different   shades   of   meaning\n\ndepending upon the circumstances.\"        United States v. Romain, 393\n\nF.3d 63, 74 (1st Cir. 2004).       The terrain of the Clayton Act and\n\nprovisions specifically classified as conferring emergency powers\n\nare sufficiently distinct in subject matter from RCRA's terrain.\n\nThus, we are unprepared to say that the nuances attached to the\n\nphrase \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment\" by\n\njudicial decisions in those other contexts should be transplanted\n\nroot and branch into the differently textured soil of RCRA §\n\n7002(a)(1)(B) — a statute enacted by a different Congress at a\n\ndifferent time for a different purpose.        We conclude, therefore,\n\nthat Mallinckrodt's textual argument does not carry the day: the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\finterpretive question before us cannot be resolved favorably to\n\nMallinckrodt on the basis of plain meaning alone.\n\n           Mallinckrodt           next    argues       that     the      conventional\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) drains the phrase \"imminent\n\nand   substantial\"    of    any    meaning      because   RCRA       already    defines\n\n\"hazardous waste\" as material that will cause an increase in\n\nmortality or serious illness or \"pose a substantial present or\n\npotential hazard to human health or the environment.\"                     42 U.S.C. §\n\n6903(5).   Thus, any release of hazardous waste would satisfy the\n\nconventional   construction         of    RCRA     §   7002(a)(1)(B),          and    the\n\nrequirement that such a release create an \"imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment\" would be superfluous.\n\n           This argument is easily dispatched.                      In terms, section\n\n7002(a)(1)(B) applies to both solid waste and hazardous waste.\n\nRCRA's   definition    of    \"solid       waste\"   does       not    share   the     same\n\ncharacteristics as its definition of \"hazardous waste,\" so to that\n\nextent the phrase \"imminent and substantial\" retains an independent\n\nmeaning.\n\n           Relatedly, Mallinckrodt asserts that the conventional\n\ninterpretation of \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" overlooks\n\nRCRA's commitment to a hierarchy of risks in which \"imminent and\n\nsubstantial endangerment\" ranks at or near the top.                     This argument\n\nbuilds on the idea that Congress employed relatively lenient risk\n\nstandards elsewhere in RCRA.             See, e.g., RCRA § 4004(a), codified\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fat 42 U.S.C. § 6944(a) (providing that sanitary landfills must have\n\n\"no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the\n\nenvironment\").     Correspondingly, the word \"endangerment\" is used in\n\nother contexts in connection with \"imminent danger of death or\n\nserious bodily     injury.\"    See, e.g., RCRA § 3008(e), codified at 42\n\nU.S.C. § 6928(e) (defining the crime of \"knowing endangerment\").\n\nThus,   the    decision   to   require   an   \"imminent   and   substantial\n\nendangerment\" must signify a special, harder-to-achieve benchmark.\n\n              This argument has some superficial appeal. After all, it\n\nis a cardinal rule that courts should strive to interpret statutes\n\nas a whole and to give effect to every word and phrase.         King v. St.\n\nVincent Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221 (1991); United States v. Ven-Fuel,\n\nInc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985).         But the conventional\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) gives full effect to the\n\n\"imminent and substantial endangerment\" language; it merely eschews\n\nthe mechanical cross-referencing, not mandated by Congress, that\n\nMallinckrodt advocates. That, in itself, should not raise eyebrows:\n\nwhere the various parts of a complicated and multifaceted statutory\n\nscheme discuss significantly different topics and function within\n\ndifferent paradigms, mechanical cross-referencing, not mandated by\n\nCongress, can lead to confusion rather than clarity.\n\n              This is such a case.    There is no meaningful parallelism\n\nbetween section 7002(a)(1)(B) and the provisions that Mallinckrodt\n\nseeks to use as comparators.          For example, RCRA § 3008(e) is a\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fcriminal    provision.       Given    the   divergent      concerns   that   drive\n\ncriminal statutes as opposed to civil remedial statutes, it should\n\nnot be surprising that the same word may vary in meaning as the\n\ncontext shifts.         Indeed, if \"endangerment\" as defined in section\n\n3008(e)     were   to     mean    precisely    what   it     means    in   section\n\n7002(a)(1)(B),     the     word   \"imminent\"    would   be    rendered     utterly\n\nredundant — the statute would, in effect, require an imminent\n\nimminence — thus transgressing the very canon of construction that\n\nMallinckrodt labors to invoke.\n\n             Mallinckrodt offers a more sophisticated version of the\n\nargument that RCRA creates a hierarchy of risks when it posits that\n\nthe statute's most expansive remedies are reserved for the greatest\n\nrisks. In this regard, it points out that under RCRA § 3019(b), EPA\n\ncan commission a health assessment whenever it believes that a\n\nlandfill \"poses a substantial potential risk to human health,\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 6939a(b); under RCRA § 3013, EPA can order the owner or\n\noperator of a facility to conduct monitoring, testing, and analysis\n\nas long as the facility \"may present a substantial hazard to human\n\nhealth or the environment,\" id. § 6934(a); and under RCRA § 7003,\n\nwhich has a risk standard identical to RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B), EPA can\n\nact to protect the public health, see id. § 6973(a).                   From this\n\nstatutory melange, Mallinckrodt concludes that only the immediate\n\nthreat of grave harm is sufficient to trigger such far-reaching\n\nremedies.\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\f            The notion that a hierarchy of risks and remedies exists\n\nwithin RCRA is not easily disproved. What is fairly clear, however,\n\nis that any such hierarchy is well-disguised; if one exists, it\n\nseems more a product of fortuity than a product of a purposeful\n\nlegislative initiative.      We explain briefly.\n\n            Section 3019(b) was first enacted in 1984, Pub. L. No.\n\n98-616, § 247, 98 Stat. 3221, 3265; section 3013 in 1980, Pub. L.\n\nNo.   96-482,   §   17(a),   94   Stat.   2334,   2344;   and   section   7003\n\n(previously cited) in 1976 (though that provision was amended both\n\nin 1980 and 1984).     Given that the changes were made to different\n\nsubtitles of the statute at different times, such incrementalism\n\nweakens (perhaps to the vanishing point) any inference that Congress\n\nspecifically intended a strict hierarchy of harms.               If Congress\n\nactually wants a delineated hierarchy of risks and remedies, it will\n\nhave to say so more distinctly.             Cf. King, 502 U.S. at 222\n\n(construing that \"differences do not necessarily make hierarchies\").\n\n            This brings us to Mallinckrodt's separation-of-powers\n\nargument.    It asseverates that RCRA's allocation of policymaking\n\nauthority to EPA is such that the citizen suit provision must be\n\nviewed as an \"interstitial, emergency-type remedy.\" Appellant's Br.\n\nat 45.      Mallinckrodt asserts that this policymaking authority\n\nnecessarily includes responsibility for setting pollution standards\n\nand that, in setting such standards, EPA, consistent with the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\ftradeoffs inherent in setting virtually any standard, does not\n\naspire to eliminate all risks.\n\n            This assertion is founded on an indisputable verity: the\n\nprincipal responsibility for implementing and enforcing RCRA resides\n\nwith EPA, not with citizens acting as private attorneys general.\n\nSee Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 483-84 (1996).         We\n\ndisagree,   however,   with   Mallinckrodt's      contention   that   the\n\nconventional   interpretation    of     section   7002(a)(1)(B)   —   the\n\ninterpretation espoused by our sister circuits and by the court\n\nbelow — is inconsistent with this scheme because it allows courts\n\nto second-guess EPA's judgments too freely and affords relief based\n\nupon harms that EPA has found acceptable.\n\n            Mallinckrodt attempts to bolster this argument by citing\n\na plethora of cases for the proposition that environmental standards\n\nshould be set by EPA, not the courts. See, e.g., Amoco Oil Co. v.\n\nEPA, 501 F.2d 722, 735 (D.C. Cir. 1974).           This proposition is\n\nunremarkable, and we take no issue with it.         We agree, moreover,\n\nthat courts must show appropriate respect for EPA's judgments.        See\n\nEnvtl. Def. Fund, 598 F.2d at 83-84.      But allowing citizen suits to\n\nproceed is not the functional equivalent of allowing courts to\n\nhijack EPA's regulatory authority and weave safety standards out of\n\nwhole cloth.\n\n            The case at hand illustrates this point.       Although EPA\n\n(acting in concert with MDEP) was leaning toward the adoption of\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\fmedia protection standards that would not have required downriver\n\nremediation, no standards had been adopted at the time the district\n\ncourt acted (nor, for that matter, does the record suggest that any\n\nhave been adopted up to the present time).                  Furthermore, EPA has\n\nnever taken the position — or even so much as hinted — that\n\ncorrection of the Plant's effects on downriver pollution is bad\n\npolicy. Thus, this is not a situation in which a court has presumed\n\nto   grant   relief    that    flies   in      the   face   of     an    express       EPA\n\nauthorization of certain conduct.\n\n             We add, moreover, that the district court has been\n\nsensitive to separation-of-powers concerns.                  On three different\n\noccasions,    it     considered    and        thoughtfully       rejected        primary\n\njurisdiction challenges.10        And the court sensibly left open the\n\npossibility that \"primary jurisdiction concerns could arise in the\n\nfuture.\"     Me. People's Alliance, 211 F. Supp. 2d at 255.                         That\n\npresumably would cover the contingency of changed circumstances that\n\nwould    eventuate    should   EPA,    some     day,    actually        engage    in    an\n\nenforcement    action    pertinent       to    the     condition    of     the     lower\n\nPenobscot.\n\n             The fact that courts retain some latitude in this area is\n\nnot in any sense incompatible with the statutory scheme.                    There are\n\nfour different ways that EPA can preempt a citizen suit — and all\n\n\n\n        10\n      Mallinckrodt has opted not to revisit the district court's\nrejection of these challenges in this appeal.\n\n                                       -33-\n\ffour require that EPA itself take diligent steps to remedy looming\n\nenvironmental harm. See RCRA § 7002(b)(2)(B) (codified at 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 6972(b)(2)(B)).   That same provision narrowly circumscribes EPA's\n\npreemptive power; it states that, when preemption is premised on an\n\nEPA order, citizen suits are \"prohibited only as to the scope and\n\nduration of the administrative order.\"     The short of it is that\n\nCongress has told the federal courts that they are not required to\n\nsteer clear of an area simply because that area might be a focus of\n\nfuture EPA activity.11\n\n           Mallinckrodt tries to embellish its separation-of-powers\n\nargument in another way as well; it maintains that section 7002(a)\n\nembodies a strong preference for permit-violation suits as opposed\n\nto imminent and substantial endangerment suits.      This attempted\n\nembellishment does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n           When not premised on the title related to hazardous\n\nwaste, a permit-violation suit may be brought after a 60-day waiting\n\nperiod while an imminent and substantial endangerment suit requires\n\nobservance of a 90-day waiting period.    Compare RCRA § 7002(b)(1)\n\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 6972(b)(1)), with RCRA § 7002(b)(2)\n\n(codified at § 6972(b)(2)). This is the only substantive difference\n\nbetween permit-violation suits and suits alleging imminent and\n\n\n     11\n      This is not meant to suggest that a private party can\ninterfere with an EPA prosecution or disturb the finality of a\nnegotiated settlement. The opposite is true. See Supporters to\nOppose Pollution, Inc. v. Heritage Group, 973 F.2d 1320, 1323-25\n(7th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                -34-\n\fsubstantial endangerment. Given the relatively minor nature of that\n\nlone disparity, we conclude, without serious question, that the\n\nstructure of the statutory scheme does not offer any persuasive\n\nevidence that Congress sought to disfavor suits alleging imminent\n\nand substantial endangerment.\n\n           Mallinckrodt's emphasis on statutory structure includes\n\nan assertion that giving section 7002(a)(1)(B) a broad reading will\n\nrender nugatory the right to bring permit-violation actions and the\n\nlike under RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(A). See Appellant's Reply Br. at 15-16\n\n(querying whether, if \"there is a big hole in a fence for the big\n\ncat, need there be a small one for the small one?\") (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)).    The flaw in this argument, as\n\nit pertains to this case, is that the two holes were drilled at\n\ndifferent times.   Congress placed the \"imminent and substantial\n\nendangerment\" gloss on RCRA's citizen suit provision eight years\n\nafter making provision for permit-violation suits.    Thus, the more\n\nappropriate question is: \"If Congress deliberately cut a second hole\n\nin the fence, is there any reason not to accept the obvious premise\n\nthat Congress wanted to increase the ease with which cats of all\n\nsizes could come through the fence?\"\n\n           Insofar as Mallinckrodt theorizes that courts lack the\n\ncompetence to function under the conventional interpretation of RCRA\n\n§ 7002(a)(1)(B), we reject its thesis.     To be sure, Mallinckrodt\n\ncites case after case for the proposition that forging policy is a\n\n\n                                -35-\n\ftask that non-expert, non-accountable judges should not undertake.\n\nSee, e.g., Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.S. 837, 866 (1984); United States v. Gilman, 347 U.S. 507,\n\n511-13    (1954).      Some    of   these   cases    suggest   that     judicial\n\npolicymaking in the environmental sphere is especially inappropriate\n\nbecause   judges    lack   special     competence     to    interpret     complex\n\nscientific, technical, and medical data.             See, e.g., Safe Food &\n\nFertil. v. EPA, 365 F.3d 46, 49 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n             This view sells the federal judiciary short: federal\n\ncourts have proven, over time, that they are equipped to adjudicate\n\nindividual    cases,   regardless      of   the   complexity   of   the    issues\n\ninvolved.    Federal courts are often called upon to make evaluative\n\njudgments    in   highly   technical    areas     (patent   litigation     is   an\n\nexcellent example).12         Performing that quintessentially judicial\n\nfunction in the environmental sphere is not tantamount to rewriting\n\nenvironmental policy.         To the contrary, what the lower court did\n\nhere — listening to the testimony of expert witnesses, assessing\n\ntheir credibility, and determining whether or not a litigant has\n\ncarried the devoir of persuasion — is very much within the core\n\ncompetency of a federal district court.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      Indeed, even on Mallinckrodt's crabbed interpretation of\nsection 7002(a)(1)(B), courts would have to engage in exactly the\ntype of evidence-weighing that Mallinckrodt says is beyond their\ncompetence.\n\n                                     -36-\n\f           As a last-ditch measure, Mallinckrodt strives to convince\n\nus that Congress's revealed intent, as reflected in the legislative\n\nhistory,   counsels    in   favor   of     a   narrow   reading   of    section\n\n7002(a)(1)(B).    We are not persuaded.\n\n           The argument shapes up along the following lines. Citing\n\nS. Rep. No. 98-284, supra, at 56, Mallinckrodt reads this archival\n\ninformation as confirming that section 7002(a)(1)(B) was intended\n\nto operate \"exactly the same\" as section 7003.             Building on that\n\nfoundation, Mallinckrodt notes that section 7003, when enacted in\n\n1976, was envisioned as a means of providing \"emergency authority.\"\n\nS. Rep. No. 94-988, at 16 (1976).        This gloss, though artful, mixes\n\nplums and pomegranates.\n\n           What is relevant to a congressional statement, in 1984,\n\nthat section 7002(a)(1)(B) is intended to operate in the same way\n\nas section 7003, is not how Congress viewed section 7003 at the time\n\nof its original passage but, rather, how Congress understood section\n\n7003 in 1984.    This is especially significant because section 7003\n\nwas not worded the same in 1984 as it was in 1976.           We think it is\n\nclear that the 1980 amendment to the provision, substituting \"may\n\npresent\"   for   \"is   presenting,\"      fundamentally    altered      how   this\n\nprovision was understood.\n\n           The proof of the pudding is in the legislative archives.\n\nWe refer particularly to the way in which the provision                      was\n\n\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fdiscussed     during     testimony    taken   in    anticipation      of   the    1984\n\namendments.\n\n              At that time, the House of Representatives was told\n\nauthoritatively that section 7003 contained \"very broad and general\n\nstatutory language\" and that the government, \"over the last several\n\nyears,\" had been advocating \"as broad an interpretation [of it] as\n\npossible.\"     Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1983: Hearing on\n\nS. 757 Before the Subcomm. on Envtl. Pollution of the S. Comm. on\n\nEnv't and Public Works, 98th Cong. 17, 29 (1983) (statement of Carol\n\nDinkins, Asst. Atty. Gen., Land and Nat. Res. Div., Dep't of\n\nJustice).      It also learned that the Department of Justice viewed\n\nsection      7003   as     \"loosely     worded,\"         so   that    it   conveyed\n\n\"extraordinary, broad law enforcement powers.\"                    Id. at 110, 120.\n\n              The Senate's discussion of section 7003 in the course of\n\nconsidering the 1984 amendments likewise suggests an expansive view\n\nof the provision.        The Senate Report enthusiastically quotes Price\n\nfor the proposition that section 7003 is \"intended to confer upon\n\nthe courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to\n\nthe   extent    necessary     to   eliminate       any    risks    posed   by    toxic\n\nwastes.\"13     S. Rep. No. 98-284, supra, at 59 (quoting Price, 688\n\n\n\n      13\n      Mallinckrodt's major criticism of the courts that have relied\nupon Price when construing section 7002(a)(1)(B) is that liability\nwas not contested in Price and that, therefore, the quoted language\nmust have referred to remedial authority.        This criticism is\nundercut by the fact that the Senate Report quotes Price when\ndiscussing the liability standard.\n\n                                       -38-\n\fF.2d at 214).      It went on to observe that the \"primary intent of the\n\nprovision is to protect human health and the environment.\"                              Id.\n\nThus, there is good reason to believe that Congress, intending to\n\ncreate   a   provision    modeled      along      the     lines    of    section      7003,\n\nunderstood     that    section   as    offering      much     more      than    emergency\n\nauthority.\n\n             The      legislative      history       is     also        at     odds    with\n\nMallinckrodt's argument that the conventional interpretation of\n\nsection 7002(a)(1)(B) usurps EPA's policymaking role.                          In parsing\n\nthis   legislative      history,      it    is    important       to    recognize      that\n\nCongress, in 1984, was acting against a background finding that\n\nthere were \"serious gaps\" in RCRA, that EPA's enforcement actions\n\nwere characterized by \"inadequate effort,\" and that EPA \"ha[d] not\n\nbeen diligent in vigorously pursuing a tough enforcement program.\"\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-198, pt. 1, at 20 (1983), reprinted in 1984\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5576, 5578-79.            Congress had heard, and apparently\n\ncredited, testimony from a former Assistant Attorney General about\n\n\"an astonishing two years of mismanagement at EPA in which the\n\nenforcement of the hazardous waste disposal laws suffered greatly.\"\n\nId., pt. 3, at 6, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5636, 5641.                          Given\n\nthis mise-en-scène, it seems counterintuitive to suggest that\n\nCongress     intended    to   erect    an    enforcement       structure        built    on\n\nexaggerated deference to EPA.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -39-\n\f              To   be    sure,   the   legislative     history     reflects   the\n\nanticipation that \"courts will accord some deference to [EPA's]\n\ntechnical     findings     concerning         the   nature   and     extent   of\n\nendangerment.\"     S. Rep. No. 98-284, supra, at 56.               But we do not\n\nthink that \"some deference\" means either total obeisance or blind\n\nallegiance.    Congress desired a \"tough enforcement program\" and\n\nfound that EPA had not been \"diligent in vigorously pursuing\" one.\n\nCitizen suits were meant to fill the resultant void.14\n\n            We are unimpressed by Mallinckrodt's citation to language\n\nin the House Report to the effect that section 7002(a)(1)(B) was\n\ndesigned to create a \"limited right\" for citizens to sue. H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 98-198, supra, pt. 1, at 53, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5612.                   The\n\nvery next sentence in that report explains the nature of the\n\nlimitation, namely, that this \"right can only be exercised if the\n\nAdministrator (following notice of the intended litigation) fails\n\nto file an action under 7003.\" Id. The conventional interpretation\n\nof the statute does not in any way offend this directive.\n\n            Finally, Mallinckrodt spotlights a comment from the floor\n\ndebate on section 7002, in which the bill's sponsor characterized\n\n\n\n     14\n      To the extent that Congress, within this new regime, intended\nto allow EPA to defend its own policymaking prerogatives, it\nappears to have placed the onus on EPA, rather than the courts, to\nstand as the sentry at the gates. See S. Rep. No. 98-284, supra,\nat 56 (explaining that \"if the Administrator believes a citizen\nsuit . . . is not being prosecuted in the public interest, he may\nexercise the right to intervene . . . and seek from the court\nrestrictions or conditions upon the citizen suit\").\n\n                                       -40-\n\fthe provision as giving citizens the power \"to abate the most\n\nserious kinds of hazardous waste situations: Those that may present\n\nan imminent and substantial endangerment.\"            130 Cong. Rec. 2081,\n\n2815 (1984) (statement of Sen. Mitchell).           This one remark cannot\n\noutweigh the substantial countervailing evidence that the citizen\n\nsuit provision was intended to empower private citizens by granting\n\nthem relatively broad authority to litigate when EPA had not acted\n\nin the face of a reasonable prospect of serious, near-term harm.\n\nSee Weinberger v. Rossi, 456 U.S. 25, 35 (1982).\n\n            Legislative history is often a mixed bag.                Parties\n\nfrequently are able to mine nuggets from it selectively, picking and\n\nchoosing    isolated   statements   that    serve   particular    (sometimes\n\nconflicting) ends.      Here, the legislative history is less than\n\npellucid.    On the whole, however, it tends to support an expansive\n\nreading of the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" standard for\n\nliability under RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B).\n\n            To sum up, the combination of the word \"may\" with the\n\nword \"endanger,\" both of which are probabilistic, leads us to\n\nconclude that a reasonable prospect of future harm is adequate to\n\nengage the gears of RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B) so long as the threat is\n\nnear-term and involves potentially serious harm.               The language,\n\nstructure, purpose, and legislative history of the provision will\n\nnot   comfortably   accommodate     the    more   restricted   reading   that\n\nMallinckrodt espouses.     While there may be good and wise reasons to\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\fadopt   a   regime      in   which   EPA   determinations   of   environmental\n\nliability are exclusive, it is Congress's place, not ours, to\n\nconstruct such a regime.         To this date, Congress has not done so.\n\n            Given our conclusion that the conventional interpretation\n\nof RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B) is correct, the remainder of the liability\n\ninquiry falls neatly into place.           None of Mallinckrodt's arguments\n\npersuade    us   that    the   district    court   either   misconstrued   this\n\nstandard or misapplied it to the facts of this case.                 While an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment requires a reasonable prospect\n\nof a near-term threat of serious potential harm, the court below\n\nmade supportable findings that suffice to bring this case within the\n\ncompass of that standard.        See, e.g., Me. People's Alliance, 211 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 245 (concluding that methylmercury is a \"highly toxic\n\nsubstance\"); id. at 251 (concluding that, in an aquatic system,\n\n\"methylation is a continuous process that can go on for decades\").\n\nBased on these and other well-founded findings, the plaintiffs\n\nestablished that the potential risk from mercury is serious and\n\nlikely to be present here and now.            In turn, these findings support\n\na conclusion that, as the district court held, there may be an\n\nimminent and substantial endangerment to the lower Penobscot River.\n\nNo more is exigible.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fIV.    THE REMEDY\n\n            Our     environmental     odyssey          is   not   yet     finished.\n\nMallinckrodt contends that the district court committed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion in ordering it to fund a study of the lower Penobscot.\n\n            This contention is rooted in the notion that a court must\n\nbalance the relevant harms before granting injunctive relief under\n\nan    environmental    statute   —   even    if       the   statute   specifically\n\nauthorizes that type of relief.             See United States v. Bethlehem\n\nSteel Corp., 38 F.3d 862, 867 (7th Cir. 1994).                Mallinckrodt would\n\nhave us achieve this balance by applying the familiar four-part\n\nframework for determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief.\n\nUnder that framework, the injunction-seeker \"must demonstrate: (1)\n\nthat it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies\n\navailable at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to\n\ncompensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of\n\nhardships between the [parties], a remedy in equity is warranted;\n\nand (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a\n\npermanent injunction.\"      eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 126 S.\n\nCt. 1837, 1839 (2006).\n\n            Conceptually, we agree with Mallinckrodt that a trial\n\ncourt, in an environmental case, should consider the balance of\n\nrelevant harms before granting injunctive relief, even though the\n\nstatute itself authorizes such relief.                  The familiar four-part\n\nframework   for     injunctive   relief     is    a    suitable   guide    in   such\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fsituations.       We caution, however, that the operation of that\n\nframework is inevitably colored by the nature of the case and the\n\npurposes of the underlying environmental statute (here, RCRA).\n\n           Against this backdrop, Mallinckrodt insists that the\n\ndistrict court mishandled the third of the four enumerated elements\n\nby failing adequately to account for the onerous hardships that the\n\nstudy would impose and contrast those hardships with the meager\n\nbenefits   that    the   study   might     generate.      In   a   nutshell,\n\nMallinckrodt's position is that the study will saddle it with a\n\nstaggering economic burden — a burden so open-ended that the overall\n\ncost cannot be predicted with any assurance — yet will yield\n\nsupposed benefits to the plaintiffs' members that are at best\n\nspeculative and at worst ephemeral.         In this regard, Mallinckrodt\n\nstresses that it is an open question whether the lower Penobscot is\n\nactually in need of any remediation.15\n\n           One difficulty with Mallinckrodt's position is that it\n\ntreats this injunction like a garden-variety injunction and, in the\n\nbargain,   undervalues    the    extent    of   the   equitable    discretion\n\npossessed by a district court after a finding of liability under\n\n\n     15\n      Mallinckrodt   suggests   that   because    Dr.  Livingston\nacknowledged a dearth of information concerning the current\ncondition of the lower Penobscot, the district court did not have\nsufficient facts before it to make an informed weighing. It also\nsuggests that the court neglected to accord due respect to EPA's\ntentative view that the proposed media protection standards would\nadequately ensure the river's safety.       Whatever force these\nsuggestions may have — and we do not imply that they have any —\nthey go mainly to liability, not remedy.\n\n                                    -44-\n\fRCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B). While Mallinckrodt's hardships are relevant\n\nto the acceptability of a RCRA remedy, the argument that hardship\n\nmust always be outweighed by deliverable benefits offends the logic\n\nof Price.    Even on Mallinckrodt's restrictive reading of that\n\ndecision, Price holds that \"Congress sought to invoke the broad and\n\nflexible equity powers of the federal courts in instances where\n\nhazardous wastes threaten[] human health.\"   688 F.2d at 211.\n\n            Ironically, Mallinckrodt dresses this argument in the\n\nraiment of a defense of judicial prerogatives.   It cites Weinberger\n\nv. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 313 (1982), for the proposition\n\nthat judges should not lightly assume that Congress has stripped\n\ncourts of their equitable discretion.    But that is a red herring:\n\nwhile it is true that a district court is not commanded, regardless\n\nof the circumstances, to issue an injunction after a finding of\n\nliability, the court below was under no misapprehension on this\n\nscore.   In reality, Mallinckrodt wishes to restrict, not preserve,\n\nthe equitable discretion of the district courts, and the case law\n\nthat it cites is therefore beside the point.\n\n            In reviewing a district courts exercise of its equitable\n\ndiscretion under such circumstances, we think it fully appropriate\n\nto acknowledge the statutory scheme under which liability was found.\n\nGiven the strong statement in Price, embraced by the Senate Report,\n\nadvocating the exercise of equitable remediation of environmental\n\nhazards, we perceive a congressional thumb on the scale in favor of\n\n\n                                -45-\n\fremediation.    With this backdrop in place, we are unwilling to say\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion either by starting\n\nwith the proposition that its primary concern ought to be how best\n\nto remedy a potentially serious near-term environmental hazard or\n\nby granting relief notwithstanding the absence of a showing that the\n\nremedy's demonstrable benefits exceeded its probable costs.\n\n           This   is   not   to   say   that   the   costs   associated   with\n\ninjunctive relief are immaterial; we can imagine circumstances in\n\nwhich the expense entailed in carrying out a particular remedial\n\nplan might dwarf the potential benefits to the environment or to\n\nhuman health.     Here, however, the anodyne chosen by the district\n\ncourt does not seem so vastly disproportionate to the threatened\n\nharm as to warrant, from the vantage point of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, a recalibration of the balance.\n\n           This    conclusion     is    reinforced     by    the   fact   that\n\nMallinckrodt has not identified any less burdensome, more cost-\n\neffective remedy that the court could have imposed to address the\n\nperceived environmental harm.16         Where, as here, a polluter has\n\n\n     16\n      Mallinckrodt does mention, albeit in passing, that the\ndistrict court committed an abuse of discretion in not \"requiring\nan estimate of [the study's] overall costs.\" Appellant's Br. at\n62.   Although it certainly would be preferable for a court to\nestablish with some exactitude the extent of the financial burden\nimposed by a particular remedy, that degree of precision is\nsometimes infeasible or impractical. The court below was cognizant\nof this shortcoming and took pains to note in the order approving\nthe study plan, entered on August 10, 2005, that \"if necessary and\nat the appropriate time, the Court will require the preparation by\nthe Study Panel of a budget formulation for any remedial plan or\n\n                                    -46-\n\ffailed to articulate a \"nice adjustment and reconciliation between\n\nthe public interest and private needs,\" Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321\n\nU.S. 321, 329 (1944), a burdensomeness argument rarely will gain\n\nmuch traction.\n\n           Taking     a    slightly     different   tack,   Mallinckrodt\n\ncharacterizes the study-plan order as unfair.          It should not be\n\nforced to pay the entire cost of the study, it complains, because\n\nit is not the only entity to have contributed to the pollution of\n\nthe lower Penobscot.      That plaint rings hollow.   While Mallinckrodt\n\nwas not the sole source of mercury contamination, it was a dominant\n\none, so in that sense its claim of inequitable treatment comprises\n\nmore cry than wool.\n\n           At any rate, RCRA liability, generally speaking, is joint\n\nand several. See Cox, 256 F. 3d at 301 n.37.        The joint and several\n\nnature of environmental liability makes it fitting to hold a single\n\npolluter responsible for the totality of the damage where, as here,\n\nthe harm is indivisible.      See id.\n\n           We have said enough on this score.         Once liability has\n\nbeen found, equitable relief in RCRA citizen suits is largely in the\n\ninformed discretion of the trial court. For aught that appears, the\n\n\n\n\neffort which may result from the first phase\" of the study. Given\nthe complex nature of the situation and the existence of this\nsafety valve, we find the absence of more definitive cost\nparameters tolerable.\n\n                                   -47-\n\fcourt below did not abuse this discretion in its choice of a condign\n\nremedy.\n\nV.    CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.         Despite an impressive array of\n\narguments, skillfully presented by extraordinarily able counsel,\n\nMallinckrodt has not persuaded us that the plaintiffs lack standing\n\nto sue, that its cramped interpretation of RCRA § 7002(a)(1)(B) is\n\nwhat Congress had in mind, or that the district court acted outside\n\nthe   realm   of   its   discretion    in    fashioning   a   remedy   for   the\n\nthreatened harm.         Consequently, we uphold the district court's\n\nrulings in all respects.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\f",

In support of this entreaty, Mallinckrodt presents a gallimaufry of new, hitherto unconsidered arguments. After careful consideration of this asseverational array, we conclude that our sister circuits have adroitly distilled the meaning of section 7002(a)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(a)(1)(B) &#8212; the so-called citizen suit provision.

People's Alliance v. HoltraChem Mfg. Co.,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d 237 (D.Me.2002). This narrative credits the factual findings of the district court to the extent that those findings are not clearly erroneous. <i>See Fed. Refinance Co. v. Klock,</i> 352 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1967 to 1982, Mallinckrodt, then called International Minerals and Chemicals Corporation, owned and operated a chlor-alkali plant (the Plant) situated on the banks of the Penobscot River in Orrington, Maine. Thereafter, the Plant continued operations under other owners, namely, Hanlin Group, Inc. and HoltraChem Manufacturing Co.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> until it closed in 2000. During the period of its operation, the Plant deposited tons of mercury-laden waste into the Penobscot River. <i>See Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 253. While there have been a number of other significant contributors to mercury in the Penobscot, \"Mallinckrodt has been a dominant source.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, the Plant's continuous release of mercury led the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to file an administrative RCRA action against Hanlin (the Plant's quondam owner). That action resulted in an agreement for corrective measures. Deeming turnabout fair play, Hanlin sued Mallinckrodt for contribution. In a 1991 settlement, Mallinckrodt agreed to pay a portion of the compliance costs imposed by the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent enforcement action led to a 1993 consent decree that superseded the earlier agreement. Although not a party to this consent decree, Mallinckrodt, consistent with the Hanlin settlement, paid its share of the compliance costs and participated in ongoing negotiations with government regulators.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That included working with both EPA and Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1993 consent decree contemplated a tripartite process comprising site investigation, evaluation of possible corrective measures, and remediation. In line with the first phase of this process, Mallinckrodt compiled and submitted a site investigation report. In March of 1997, EPA and MDEP, acting in concert, issued a draft notice of disapproval. Mallinckrodt countered with a supplemental site investigation report but, in 2000, EPA and MDEP again disapproved. Among other things, the regulators instructed Mallinckrodt to study the effects of mercury downriver from the Plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a matter of months, Mallinckrodt commissioned a study aimed at examining downriver mercury contamination. It conducted a second downriver study during the summer of 2001. Notwithstanding the submission of these studies, however, the district court supportably found that Mallinckrodt made only minimal efforts to pursue the designated line of inquiry and that the decision to forgo more vigorous efforts was deliberate. <i>Id.</i> at 244 &amp; n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the midst of this sparring, two environmental groups &#8212; the National Resources Defense Council and the Maine People's Alliance &#8212; joined forces to commence a citizen suit under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). The plaintiffs alleged that mercury contamination downriver from the Plant \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\" Acknowledging the possibility that remediation might eventually prove to be either unnecessary or infeasible, their principal prayer for relief was that Mallinckrodt be ordered to fund an \"independent, comprehensive, scientific study to determine the precise nature and extent of the endangerment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt tried on several occasions to derail the suit on the ground that EPA, not the courts, had primary jurisdiction. The district court demurred, holding that the suit would not present any conflict with agency action due to EPA's apparent lack of interest in the lower Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was reached for trial in March of 2002. By that time, EPA and MDEP had made public, but had not adopted, preliminary media protection standards, potentially applicable to the lower Penobscot. Had those standards gone into effect, no remediation would have been required for the region with which this litigation is concerned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a nine-day bench trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> one of the plaintiffs' principal experts was Dr. Robert Livingston. The district court found Livingston, an aquatic biologist, to be \"particularly credible and persuasive.\" <i>Id.</i> at 251. Drawing on three main sources &#8212; the data gathered under the EPA-ordered site studies, some limited field work, and the scientific literature concerning mercury in aquatic systems &#8212; Livingston opined that there might be a serious endangerment to both human health and the environment resulting from mercury contamination in the lower Penobscot. Although believing it \"highly likely\" that these harms would prove to be both real and severe, he cautioned that he had not yet \"done the right research to determine that.\" Due to the absence of sufficient research, no one could know with certitude \"if there is a problem\" or \"what the problem is.\" When all was said and done, however, he thought it \"highly likely\" that localized and targeted remediation would be both necessary and desirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also adduced testimony from other experts, from individuals within their respective memberships, and from EPA and MDEP representatives. A number of defense experts testified as well. After both sides had rested and submitted briefs, the district court issued a thoughtful rescript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that mercury in aquatic systems is susceptible to being transformed by microscopic organisms into its organic form (known as methylmercury). <i>Id.</i> at 244. Methylmercury is a highly toxic substance which, even in low dosages, is inimical to human health; for example, it \"attacks the nervous system, the kidneys, the immune system, and the reproductive system\" and is especially damaging to a developing fetus. <i>Id.</i> at 245. Methylmercury is especially pernicious because it is the most bioavailable form of mercury and therefore, is readily accumulated in humans and animals alike. <i>Id.</i> at 244.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the court found that mercury concentration in sediments extracted from the lower Penobscot runs five times higher than in the Kennebec River (which Mallinckrodt's expert identified as an appropriate comparator). <i>Id.</i> at 248. Despite this high concentration, the court wisely recognized that \"the mere presence of mercury contaminated sediments is alone not enough to constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment,\" <i>id.,</i> so it proceeded to examine the available data concerning mercury contamination in various species in the lower Penobscot, including benthos, killfish (minnows), lobsters, blue mussels, cormorants, osprey, and eagles. This examination led the court to conclude that \"mercury is methylating downriver\" and that \"methylmercury is bioavailable, entering biota, and biomagnifying throughout the food web.\" <i>Id.</i> at 251.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court expressed heightened concern about a region known as Frankfort Flats, which displayed extraordinarily high mercury readings in both sediments and biota. <i>Id.</i> at 252. Frankfort Flats receives drainage from a marsh system, and marshes are considered to be hotbeds of methylation. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court turned to the legal standard for citizen suits under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), it characterized that standard as \"lenient.\" 211 F.Supp.2d at 246. It cited with approval case law emphasizing that RCRA allows such a suit when the putative polluter \"<i>may</i>\" have caused an imminent and substantial endangerment. <i>Id.</i> at 246-47 (collecting cases). On this basis, the court concluded that the statute's \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" standard would be satisfied by a \"reasonable medical concern for public health and a reasonable scientific concern for the environment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this interpretation of the statute to the facts as found, the court determined that Mallinckrodt's disposal activities may have created an imminent and substantial danger and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had carried their burden of proof anent liability. <i>Id.</i> at 251-52. Then, having found liability, the court directed the parties to make a good-faith effort to agree on a study plan. <i>Id.</i> at 256. The parties complied and, on August 10, 2005, the court approved a plan which, if carried out, probably will require Mallinckrodt to spend around $4,000,000 for laboratory analyses, independent of all other costs. The purpose of the study is to learn whether, in actuality, mercury contamination in the lower Penobscot adversely affects either human health or the environment, and if so, to devise a feasible remedial approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt now appeals, asserting that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue in the first place; that the lower court set the bar too low for RCRA citizen suits; and that, in all events, the court abused its discretion in fashioning relief. We address these assertions one by one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, Mallinckrodt alleges that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue because they have not suffered an injury in fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The existence vel non of standing is a legal question and, therefore, engenders de novo review. <i>See N.H. Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner,</i> 99 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.1996). When, however, the trial court's standing determination rests on findings of fact, we must honor those factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <i>See Rivera v. Wyeth-Ayerst Labs.,</i> 283 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our inquiry into standing with the undisputed fact that both of the plaintiffs are associations. In order to ground a claim of associational standing (that is, standing to bring suit on behalf of its membership), an association must show three things: (i) that individual members would have standing to sue in their own right; (ii) that the interests at stake are related to the organization's core purposes; and (iii) that both the asserted claim and the requested relief can be adjudicated without the participation of individual members as named plaintiffs. <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). The plaintiffs in this case plainly have made the latter two showings. Hence, the inquiry reduces to whether the organizations' individual members would have had standing to proceed in their own right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is nothing in RCRA's text or history that suggests a congressional intent to erect statutory standing barriers beyond those imposed by Article III of the Constitution and because Mallinckrodt has not identified any prudential standing concerns, we focus on what is essential to establish Article III standing. Those requirements are expressed in a familiar three-part algorithm: a would-be plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury in fact, a causal connection that permits tracing the claimed injury to the defendant's actions, and a likelihood that prevailing in the action will afford some redress for the injury. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <i>Pag&#225;n v. Calder&#243;n,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir.2006). These requisites must be proved \"with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. When, as now, standing is reviewed after trial, the facts establishing standing \"must be supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The ultimate quotient of proof is a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See Perry v. Vill. of Arlington Heights,</i> 186 F.3d 826, 829 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first dispose of an argument that verges on the specious. Mallinckrodt protests that the plaintiffs cannot have established a cognizable injury since the district court thought it appropriate to order a remedy &#8212; the study &#8212; that would determine whether mercury in the Penobscot is \"having significant adverse effects\" on the environment or \"posing an unacceptable risk to human health.\" This protestation conflates the district court's finding of liability with its choice of remedy. As we shortly shall explain, probabilistic harms are legally cognizable, and the district court made a supportable finding that a sufficient probability of harm exists to satisfy the Article III standing inquiry. <i>See Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 253. The fact that the court chose a remedy that aspires to furnish a degree of determinacy before fashioning further relief speaks only to the court's cautious use of discretion in selecting remedies; it does not speak to the plaintiffs' standing as of the present time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having dispatched this attempted sleight of hand, we proceed to more serious matters. Mallinckrodt concentrates its standing attack on the plaintiffs' ostensible failure to prove the injury-in-fact component. At trial, the plaintiffs called four witnesses from within their respective memberships, all of whom reside on or near the banks of the Penobscot River. All four vouchsafed that they have modified their behavior due to fear of mercury contamination. Although eager to do so, none of them will eat fish or shellfish from the river nor recreate on or near it. One witness added that, but for the mercury contamination, she would harvest mussels and sell them to supplement her income. The district court credited this testimony. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs in environmental suits may predicate claims of injury on aesthetic or recreational harms. <i>See Laidlaw,</i> 528 U.S. at 183, 120 S.Ct. 693; <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> 405 U.S. 727, 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <i>Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA,</i> 269 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir.2001). Still, neither a bald assertion of such a harm nor a purely subjective fear that an environmental hazard may have been created is enough to ground standing. Rather, an individual's decision to deny herself aesthetic or recreational pleasures based on concern about pollution will constitute a cognizable injury only when the concern is premised upon a realistic threat. <i>See Laidlaw,</i> 528 U.S. at 184, 120 S.Ct. 693; <i>see also City of Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 107 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (explaining that \"the <i>reality</i> of the threat . . ., not the plaintiff's subjective apprehensions,\" constitutes the cognizable injury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, Mallinckrodt exhorts us to find that the witnesses' stated fears are unreasonable. It points out &#8212; and the record confirms &#8212; that waterways throughout Maine suffer to some extent from mercury pollution and that, therefore, it is responsible at most for a probabilistic increase in a risk that the witnesses would in any event have had to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some confusion as to the thrust of Mallinckrodt's argument. The plaintiffs read its brief, not implausibly, as arguing that these facts necessarily limit cognizable injuries to identifiable medical concerns. <i>See</i> Appellees' Br. at 54. Mallinckrodt's reply brief, however, acknowledges that the plaintiffs' principal claim of injury is for diminished enjoyment of their environment and joins issue on the sufficiency of the proof in that regard. <i>See</i> Appellant's Reply Br. at 25. At bottom, this argument suggests that the plaintiffs must show that Mallinckrodt's activities created a significantly increased risk of harm to health or the environment so as to make it objectively reasonable for the plaintiffs' members to deny themselves aesthetic and recreational use of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish an injury in fact based on a probabilistic harm, a plaintiff must show that there is a substantial probability that harm will occur. <i>See Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 504, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <i>see also Adams v. Watson,</i> 10 F.3d 915, 923 (1st Cir.1993). Mallinckrodt suggests that the instant plaintiffs have not demonstrated a sufficiently probable increase in harm because of (i) Dr. Livingston's admitted uncertainty about whether any problem exists and (ii) the notion that politically accountable branches of government, not courts, are the appropriate entities to make judgments as to what risks are acceptable in modern society. Neither suggestion is convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's first suggestion relies ultimately on a single snippet of Dr. Livingston's testimony, wrested from its contextual moorings. But a trial court, confronted with a complex and highly ramified factual situation, is fully entitled to consider the import of a witness's testimony as a whole. This case is a good example: Dr. Livingston testified, in effect, that the presence of a great deal of smoke justified looking for a fire. Mallinckrodt excerpts only his isolated statement that he had not actually seen a fire yet. This plucking of the record overlooks the obvious fact that the district court, drawing on the whole of Dr. Livingston's testimony as well as a plethora of other evidence, supportably concluded that \"mercury is methylating downriver, and that such methylmercury is bioavailable, entering biota, and biomagnifying throughout the food web\" in sufficient quantity that it may well present an imminent and substantial danger to the environment. <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 251 (citation omitted). Relatedly, the court found that \"the effects resulting from methylmercury exposure . . . clearly endanger reproduction, development, and overall health of the public and the environment,\" <i>id.</i> at 252, and that \"Mallinckrodt has been a dominant source of mercury in the Penobscot River,\" <i>id.</i> at 255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words &#8212; to return to our metaphor &#8212; the lower court discerned telltale signs that a fire might already be smoldering. In light of its warrantable findings, the court had ample reason to conclude that Mallinckrodt has created a substantial probability of increased harm to the environment. That increased risk, in turn, rendered reasonable the actions of the plaintiffs' members in abstaining from their desired enjoyment of the Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's second suggestion is nothing less than a no-holds-barred assault on the federal courts' institutional competency. It emphasizes that the plaintiffs allege no violation of any federally prescribed discharge limits, and then treats this omission as dispositive. <i>See</i> Appellant's Br. at 27 (asserting that \"in the absence of any finding by [EPA],\" courts are not equipped to determine whether \"the medical and scientific uncertainties created by mercury in the Penobscot create an <i>unacceptable</i> increased risk of harm\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This postulate proceeds from a two-part premise. First, in terms of environmental regulation &#8212; where important policy tradeoffs must be made between protection and progress &#8212; the only injuries that satisfy the criteria for Article III standing are those injuries that are \"unacceptable\"; and second, the political branches alone, not courts, have the expertise and accountability to determine which injuries society must be prepared to tolerate. In Mallinckrodt's view, this need to restrict cognizable injuries to \"unacceptable\" injuries is especially acute where, as in this case, the asserted harms are probabilistic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt provides scant authority for an argument that has such breathtaking ramifications for the scope of judicial power. Its notion of acceptability is apparently derived from a single, quarter-century-old opinion, in which a respected court cautioned that judges cannot \"formulate policy with respect to what [environmental] risks are acceptable.\" <i>Envtl. Def. Fund v. EPA,</i> 598 F.2d 62, 83-84 (D.C.Cir. 1978). That court, however, was reviewing a challenge to an EPA regulation based on an alleged lack of substantial evidence. There is no discussion either of standing or of Article III's limits on judicial power. The opinion, therefore, affords no solid foundation for the proposition that Mallinckrodt asserts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, Mallinckrodt argues that a grant of standing in this case would be tantamount to judicial usurpation of regulatory authority because it would permit \"private parties to attack EPA risk assessments collaterally, using the very risks EPA deemed acceptable to establish standing and liability, with no deference afforded to EPA's policy judgment.\" Appellant's Reply Br. at 27-28. But the ingredients that comprise what Mallinckrodt sees as a recipe for disaster &#8212; the relatively broad scope of citizens' rights to sue polluters, the existence of liability in such suits, and the less-than-total deference afforded to agency inaction &#8212; all turn on legislative choices. Congress has elected to create a cause of action for affected citizens notwithstanding the absence of any EPA-sponsored standard. While we share Mallinckrodt's belief that it would be a usurpation of legislative prerogative for a court to assume policymaking control over environmental regulation, it would be no less offensive a usurpation for a court to refuse to undertake a task validly entrusted to it by Congress. In the last analysis, Article III requires a cognizable injury; it does not speak to the wisdom of the legislature's actions in providing redress for that injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add an eschatocol of sorts. In rejecting Mallinckrodt's arguments as to standing, we remain confident that Congress has not asked federal courts to perform tasks that are beyond their institutional competency. In our view, courts are capable of assessing probabilistic injuries. Moreover, nuisance principles contribute heavily to the doctrinal template that underbraces statutes like RCRA, <i>see, e.g., Cox v. City of Dallas,</i> 256 F.3d 281, 289 (5th Cir.2001), and the tasks involved in adjudicating environmental cases are well within the federal courts' accustomed domain. While courts can (and do) benefit from available agency expertise, it is an insupportable leap of logic to maintain that, in the absence of such input, claims of injury are not cognizable at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. For the reasons discussed above, we hold that the plaintiffs have standing to sue under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). We turn, then, to the meat of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case revolves around the meaning and purport of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), a statute that, as described above, allows citizens to sue persons or firms whose handling of solid or hazardous waste \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court read this language as meaning that such suits could be brought to alleviate reasonable medical or scientific concerns. <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 252. Mallinckrodt urges a more circumscribed interpretation. To the extent that this interpretive controversy presents a question of statutory construction, we afford de novo review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Lattab</i> <i>v. Ashcroft,</i> 384 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An historical perspective illustrates the strength of the current against which Mallinckrodt is swimming. Congress enacted RCRA in 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-580, 90 Stat. 2795, with the avowed intention of closing \"the last remaining loophole in environmental law, that of unregulated land disposal of discarded materials and hazardous waste.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-1491, pt. 1, at 4, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6238, 6241. In its original iteration, RCRA &#167; 7002 (now codified in pertinent part at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(a)(1)(A)) offered citizens the opportunity to bring suit against a polluter only when the polluter was alleged to be in violation of a permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, or order issued by EPA. At the same time, RCRA created a cause of action, available exclusively to the EPA Administrator, for cases in which the \"disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\" RCRA &#167; 7003 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6973(a)). In suits brought under this latter provision, federal district courts were granted broad remedial authority to \"restrain\" polluters and take \"such other action as may be necessary.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pertinently we think, Congress later <i>loosened</i> the standard for liability under section 7003. This transpired four years later when Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980. That legislation amended section 7003 by substituting the words \"may present\" for the words \"is presenting.\" Pub.L. No. 96-482, &#167; 25, 94 Stat. 2334, 2348.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Price,</i> 688 F.2d 204 (3d Cir.1982), a seminal RCRA &#167; 7003 case, a district court found that a landfill leaking toxic substances posed an imminent and substantial danger to Atlantic City's water supply but refused to order a study of this hazard at the preliminary injunction stage. <i>Id.</i> at 209. The Third Circuit reversed, ruling that the use of the word \"may\" in RCRA &#167; 7003 was intended to make the provision \"expansive.\" <i>Id.</i> at 213. In its view, \"Congress, by enacting section 7003, intended to confer upon courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risks posed by toxic waste.\" <i>Id.</i> at 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon thereafter, Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (1984 amendments), Pub.L. No. 98-616, 98 Stat. 3221. The 1984 amendments introduced a new provision, RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), into the statutory scheme. Using language that tracked the post-1980 text of RCRA &#167; 7003, this new provision extended to citizens the right to sue a polluter who may be causing an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 401, 98 Stat. at 3268-69. The Senate Report that accompanied the 1984 amendments approvingly cited and quoted <i>Price</i> on several occasions, specifically endorsing that court's conclusion that section 7003 is intended to give courts the tools to \"eliminate any risks posed by toxic waste.\" S.Rep. No. 98-284, at 59 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this same time, the Fourth Circuit decided another RCRA &#167; 7003 case, in which it flatly rejected the proposition that \"section 7003 was designed to control pollution only in emergency situations.\" <i>United States v. Waste Indus., Inc.,</i> 734 F.2d 159, 165 (4th Cir.1984). The court emphasized the statute's use of the word \"may\" and cited <i>Price</i> approvingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Price</i> and <i>Waste Industries</i> have become guideposts for courts endeavoring to interpret the counterpart language contained in RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). To date, at least four of our sister circuits have construed that provision expansively. <i>See Interfaith Cmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'l., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 248, 258-59 (3d Cir.2005); <i>Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc.,</i> 386 F.3d 993, 1015 (11th Cir.2004); <i>Cox,</i> 256 F.3d at 299; <i>Dague v. City of Burlington,</i> 935 F.2d 1343, 1355 (2d Cir.1991), <i>rev'd in part on other grounds,</i> 505 U.S. 557, 112 S.Ct. 2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992). In taking this position, all four courts have emphasized the preeminence of the word \"may\" in defining the degree of risk needed to support RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B)'s liability standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This expansiveness in construing the requisite degree of risk has largely been matched in the courts' assessment of the gravity and immediacy of the threatened harm. With one possible exception, the courts have agreed that the word \"substantial\" implies serious harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See, e.g., Parker,</i> 386 F.3d at 1015. There has, however, been some reluctance to quantify the needed level of harm more precisely. <i>See, e.g., Honeywell,</i> 399 F.3d at 259. Imminence generally has been read to require only that the harm is of a kind that poses a near-term threat; there is no corollary requirement that the harm necessarily will occur or that the actual damage will manifest itself immediately. <i>See Cox,</i> 256 F.3d at 299-300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt argues that this long line of cases has consistently misread <i>Price</i> (which, Mallinckrodt says, only concerned remedial power, not scope of liability) and, in the bargain, has disregarded the strictures imposed by the adjectives \"imminent\" and \"substantial.\" We have not had occasion to construe the reach of the citizen suit provision contained in RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), and we are obligated to offer our independent judgment on an issue of first impression here (which, as we shortly shall explain, coincides with the result reached by the other courts of appeals that have confronted the question). Accordingly, we proceed to test the mettle of the conventional construction of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) against Mallinckrodt's challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, following the interpretive trail blazed by the four above-mentioned courts of appeals, employed the conventional construction. It began by noting that the word \"endangerment\" does not imply actual harm but, rather, implies only potential harm. <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 246. The court then noted that the statutory standard is further relaxed because of Congress's use of the word \"may.\" <i>Id.</i> As a result, the court found RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) to be a \"sweeping provision indicat[ing] Congress's intent `to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate <i>any risk</i> posed by toxic waste.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 246-47 (quoting <i>Dague,</i> 935 F.2d at 1355 (quoting <i>Price,</i> 688 F.2d at 214) (emphasis supplied in <i>Dague</i>)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court read the statute's adjectival elements in line with the breadth of the authority granted. It found that the word \"imminent\" connotes only that the \"factors giving rise to [the harm] are present, even though the harm may not be realized for some time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247. Relatedly, the court found that the word \"substantial\" connotes no more than \"reasonable cause for concern that someone or something may be exposed\" to harm. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Raymond K. Hoxsie Real Estate Trust v. Exxon Educ. Found.,</i> 81 F.Supp.2d 359, 366 (D.R.I.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A \"reasonable medical concern\" would, the court said, be sufficient to ground liability under the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 252. The court's only explicit limitation on the availability of relief was when \"the risk of harm is remote in time, completely speculative in nature, or de minimis in degree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247 (quoting <i>United States v. Reilly Tar &amp; Chem. Corp.,</i> 546 F.Supp. 1100, 1109 (D.Minn.1982)). Mallinckrodt balks at this interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) for a host of reasons. It argues that this construction ignores the plain meaning of the phrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment,\" does violence to the internal coherence of RCRA by overlooking the hierarchy of standards contained within that statute, tampers with Congress's wise delegation of policymaking to an expert agency, and frustrates congressional intent. We address each of these criticisms in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's textual argument rests on the premise that the courts that heretofore have explicated section 7002(a)(1)(B)'s liability standard have been blinded by the glare of the word \"may\" and have lost sight of the plain meaning of the words \"imminent and substantial.\" In Mallinckrodt's view, the phrase \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment,\" when read as a whole, requires a risk of grave harm that is more likely than not to occur. Mallinckrodt deduces this construction from a Rosetta Stone that is part case law and part lexicography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"endangerment,\" Mallinckrodt says somewhat tautologically, is \"the state of being placed in danger.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 748 (1993). In that connection, it defines danger as \"exposed to harm\" or \"peril.\" <i>Id.</i> at 573 (excess capitalization omitted). To elucidate the meaning of \"may,\" Mallinckrodt points to a sixty-year old Supreme Court decision that defines \"may,\" as used in section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as \"probably.\" <i>Corn Prods. Refining Co. v. FTC,</i> 324 U.S. 726, 738, 65 S.Ct. 961, 89 L.Ed. 1320 (1945). Finally, to give content to the phrase \"imminent and substantial,\" Mallinckrodt invokes case law suggesting that, in other environmental contexts, the unadorned word \"endanger\" implies a lower standard than that denoted by the phrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment.\" <i>See Ethyl Corp. v. EPA,</i> 541 F.2d 1, 20 n. 36 (D.C.Cir.1976) (en banc); <i>Reserve Mining Co. v. EPA,</i> 514 F.2d 492, 528 (8th Cir.1975) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's textual argument makes sense &#8212; but only to a point. While the decisions in <i>Ethyl Corp.</i> and <i>Reserve Mining</i> are some evidence that, <i>as of 1976,</i> the phrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" was thought to denote a heightened standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> the relevant question is how that term was understood <i>in 1984</i> (when section 7002(a)(1)(B) was enacted). The Senate Report on the 1984 amendments defines the word \"endangerment\" separately from the phrase \"imminent and substantial.\" <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 59. Mallinckrodt's criticism fails to account either for that circumstance or for Congress's insertion, in 1980, of the word \"may\" into section 7003 and its subsequent use in section 7002. That word does not appear at all in the statute considered in <i>Reserve Mining,</i> 514 F.2d at 528 &amp; n. 70 (citing 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1364). In <i>Ethyl Corp.,</i> one of the referenced statutes does use the word \"may,\" but that court did not parse the entire sentence and looked only to the words \"imminent and substantial.\" <i>See Ethyl Corp.,</i> 541 F.2d at 20 n. 36 (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300i). We also note that statutes referenced in <i>Ethyl Corp.</i> and <i>Reserve Mining</i> bore the subtitle \"Emergency Powers\"; in contrast, neither section 7002 nor section 7003 carry such a label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager, we think, is that \"words are like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances.\" <i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 74 (1st Cir.2004). The terrain of the Clayton Act and provisions specifically classified as conferring emergency powers are sufficiently distinct in subject matter from RCRA's terrain. Thus, we are unprepared to say that the nuances attached to the phrase \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment\" by judicial decisions in those other contexts should be transplanted root and branch into the differently textured soil of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B)-a statute enacted by a different Congress at a different time for a different purpose. We conclude, therefore, that Mallinckrodt's textual argument does not carry the day: the interpretive question before us cannot be resolved favorably to Mallinckrodt on the basis of plain meaning alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt next argues that the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) drains the phrase \"imminent and substantial\" of any meaning because RCRA already defines \"hazardous waste\" as material that will cause an increase in mortality or serious illness or \"pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6903(5). Thus, any release of hazardous waste would satisfy the conventional construction of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), and the requirement that such a release create an \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" would be superfluous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is easily dispatched. In terms, section 7002(a)(1)(B) applies to <i>both</i> solid waste and hazardous waste. RCRA's definition of \"solid waste\" does not share the same characteristics as its definition of \"hazardous waste,\" so to that extent the phrase \"imminent and substantial\" retains an independent meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, Mallinckrodt asserts that the conventional interpretation of \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" overlooks RCRA's commitment to a hierarchy of risks in which \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" ranks at or near the top. This argument builds on the idea that Congress employed relatively lenient risk standards elsewhere in RCRA. <i>See, e.g.,</i> RCRA &#167; 4004(a), codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6944(a) (providing that sanitary landfills must have \"no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the environment\"). Correspondingly, the word \"endangerment\" is used in other contexts in connection with \"imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> RCRA &#167; 3008(e), codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6928(e) (defining the crime of \"knowing endangerment\"). Thus, the decision to require an \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" must signify a special, harder-to-achieve benchmark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has some superficial appeal. After all, it is a cardinal rule that courts should strive to interpret statutes as a whole and to give effect to every word and phrase. <i>King v. St. Vincent Hosp.,</i> 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991); <i>United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc.,</i> 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985). But the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) gives full effect to the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" language; it merely eschews the mechanical cross-referencing, not mandated by Congress, that Mallinckrodt advocates. That, in itself, should not raise eyebrows: where the various parts of a complicated and multifaceted statutory scheme discuss significantly different topics and function within different paradigms, mechanical cross-referencing, not mandated by Congress, can lead to confusion rather than clarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. There is no meaningful parallelism between section 7002(a)(1)(B) and the provisions that Mallinckrodt seeks to use as comparators. For example, RCRA &#167; 3008(e) is a <i>criminal</i> provision. Given the divergent concerns that drive criminal statutes as opposed to civil remedial statutes, it should not be surprising that the same word may vary in meaning as the context shifts. Indeed, if \"endangerment\" as defined in section 3008(e) were to mean precisely what it means in section 7002(a)(1)(B), the word \"imminent\" would be rendered utterly redundant &#8212; the statute would, in effect, require an imminent imminence &#8212; thus transgressing the very canon of construction that Mallinckrodt labors to invoke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt offers a more sophisticated version of the argument that RCRA creates a hierarchy of risks when it posits that the statute's most expansive remedies are reserved for the greatest risks. In this regard, it points out that under RCRA &#167; 3019(b), EPA can commission a health assessment whenever it believes that a landfill \"poses a substantial potential risk to human health,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6939a(b); under RCRA &#167; 3013, EPA can order the owner or operator of a facility to conduct monitoring, testing, and analysis as long as the facility \"may present a substantial hazard to human health or the environment,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 6934(a); and under RCRA &#167; 7003, which has a risk standard identical to RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), EPA can act to protect the public health, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 6973(a). From this statutory melange, Mallinckrodt concludes that only the immediate threat of grave harm is sufficient to trigger such far-reaching remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notion that a hierarchy of risks and remedies exists within RCRA is not easily disproved. What is fairly clear, however, is that any such hierarchy is well-disguised; if one exists, it seems more a product of fortuity than a product of a purposeful legislative initiative. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3019(b) was first enacted in 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-616, &#167; 247, 98 Stat. 3221, 3265; section 3013 in 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-482, &#167; 17(a), 94 Stat. 2334, 2344; and section 7003 (previously cited) in 1976 (though that provision was amended both in 1980 and 1984). Given that the changes were made to different subtitles of the statute at different times, such incrementalism weakens (perhaps to the vanishing point) any inference that Congress specifically intended a strict hierarchy of harms. If Congress actually wants a delineated hierarchy of risks and remedies, it will have to say so more distinctly. <i>Cf. King,</i> 502 U.S. at 222, 112 S.Ct. 570 (construing that \"differences do not necessarily make hierarchies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Mallinckrodt's separation-of-powers argument. It asseverates that RCRA's allocation of policymaking authority to EPA is such that the citizen suit provision must be viewed as an \"interstitial, emergency-type remedy.\" Appellant's Br. at 45. Mallinckrodt asserts that this policymaking authority necessarily includes responsibility for setting pollution standards and that, in setting such standards, EPA, consistent with the tradeoffs inherent in setting virtually any standard, does not aspire to eliminate all risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion is founded on an indisputable verity: the principal responsibility for implementing and enforcing RCRA resides with EPA, not with citizens acting as private attorneys general. <i>See Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc.,</i> 516 U.S. 479, 483-84, 116 S.Ct. 1251, 134 L.Ed.2d 121 (1996). We disagree, however, with Mallinckrodt's contention that the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) &#8212; the interpretation espoused by our sister circuits and by the court below &#8212; is inconsistent with this scheme because it allows courts to second-guess EPA's judgments too freely and affords relief based upon harms that EPA has found acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt attempts to bolster this argument by citing a plethora of cases for the proposition that environmental standards should be set by EPA, not the courts. <i>See, e.g., Amoco Oil Co. v. EPA,</i> 501 F.2d 722, 735 (D.C.Cir.1974). This proposition is unremarkable, and we take no issue with it. We agree, moreover, that courts must show appropriate respect for EPA's judgments. <i>See Envtl. Def. Fund,</i> 598 F.2d at 83-84. But allowing citizen suits to proceed is not the functional equivalent of allowing courts to hijack EPA's regulatory authority and weave safety standards out of whole cloth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand illustrates this point. Although EPA (acting in concert with MDEP) was leaning toward the adoption of media protection standards that would not have required downriver remediation, no standards had been adopted at the time the district court acted (nor, for that matter, does the record suggest that any have been adopted up to the present time). Furthermore, EPA has never taken the position &#8212; or even so much as hinted &#8212; that correction of the Plant's effects on downriver pollution is bad policy. Thus, this is not a situation in which a court has presumed to grant relief that flies in the face of an express EPA authorization of certain conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the district court has been sensitive to separation-of-powers concerns. On three different occasions, it considered and thoughtfully rejected primary jurisdiction challenges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> And the court sensibly left open the possibility that \"primary jurisdiction concerns could arise in the future.\" <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 255. That presumably would cover the contingency of changed circumstances that would eventuate should EPA, some day, actually engage in an enforcement action pertinent to the condition of the lower Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that courts retain some latitude in this area is not in any sense incompatible with the statutory scheme. There are four different ways that EPA can preempt a citizen suit &#8212; and all four require that EPA itself take diligent steps to remedy looming environmental harm. <i>See</i> RCRA &#167; 7002(b)(2)(B) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(b)(2)(B)). That same provision narrowly circumscribes EPA's preemptive power; it states that, when preemption is premised on an EPA order, citizen suits are \"prohibited only as to the scope and duration of the administrative order.\" The short of it is that Congress has told the federal courts that they are not required to steer clear of an area simply because that area might be a focus of future EPA activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt tries to embellish its separation-of-powers argument in another way as well; it maintains that section 7002(a) embodies a strong preference for permit-violation suits as opposed to imminent and substantial endangerment suits. This attempted embellishment does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When not premised on the title related to hazardous waste, a permit-violation suit may be brought after a 60-day waiting period while an imminent and substantial endangerment suit requires observance of a 90-day waiting period. <i>Compare</i> RCRA &#167; 7002(b)(1) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(b)(1)), <i>with</i> RCRA &#167; 7002(b)(2) (codified at &#167; 6972(b)(2)). This is the only substantive difference between permit-violation suits and suits alleging imminent and substantial endangerment. Given the relatively minor nature of that lone disparity, we conclude, without serious question, that the structure of the statutory scheme does not offer any persuasive evidence that Congress sought to disfavor suits alleging imminent and substantial endangerment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's emphasis on statutory structure includes an assertion that giving section 7002(a)(1)(B) a broad reading will render nugatory the right to bring permit-violation actions and the like under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(A). <i>See</i> Appellant's Reply Br. at 15-16 (querying whether, if \"there is a big hole in a fence for the big cat, need there be a small one for the small one?\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The flaw in this argument, as it pertains to this case, is that the two holes were drilled at different times. Congress placed the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" gloss on RCRA's citizen suit provision eight years <i>after</i> making provision for permit-violation suits. Thus, the more appropriate question is: \"If Congress deliberately cut a second hole in the fence, is there any reason not to accept the obvious premise that Congress wanted to increase the ease with which cats of all sizes could come through the fence?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Mallinckrodt theorizes that courts lack the competence to function under the conventional interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), we reject its thesis. To be sure, Mallinckrodt cites case after case for the proposition that forging policy is a task that non-expert, non-accountable judges should not undertake. <i>See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 866, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Gilman,</i> 347 U.S. 507, 511-13, 74 S.Ct. 695, 98 L.Ed. 898 (1954). Some of these cases suggest that judicial policymaking in the environmental sphere is especially inappropriate because judges lack special competence to interpret complex scientific, technical, and medical data. <i>See, e.g., Safe Food &amp; Fertil. v. EPA,</i> 365 F.3d 46, 49 (D.C.Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view sells the federal judiciary short: federal courts have proven, over time, that they are equipped to adjudicate individual cases, regardless of the complexity of the issues involved. Federal courts are often called upon to make evaluative judgments in highly technical areas (patent litigation is an excellent example).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Performing that quintessentially judicial function in the environmental sphere is not tantamount to rewriting environmental policy. To the contrary, what the lower court did here &#8212; listening to the testimony of expert witnesses, assessing their credibility, and determining whether or not a litigant has carried the devoir of persuasion &#8212; is very much within the core competency of a federal district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last-ditch measure, Mallinckrodt strives to convince us that Congress's revealed intent, as reflected in the legislative history, counsels in favor of a narrow reading of section 7002(a)(1)(B). We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument shapes up along the following lines. Citing S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 56, Mallinckrodt reads this archival information as confirming that section 7002(a)(1)(B) was intended to operate \"exactly the same\" as section 7003. Building on that foundation, Mallinckrodt notes that section 7003, when enacted in 1976, was envisioned as a means of providing \"emergency authority.\" S.Rep. No. 94-988, at 16 (1976). This gloss, though artful, mixes plums and pomegranates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is relevant to a congressional statement, in 1984, that section 7002(a)(1)(B) is intended to operate in the same way as section 7003, is not how Congress viewed section 7003 at the time of its original passage but, rather, how Congress understood section 7003 <i>in 1984.</i> This is especially significant because section 7003 was not worded the same in 1984 as it was in 1976. We think it is clear that the 1980 amendment to the provision, substituting \"may present\" for \"is presenting,\" fundamentally altered how this provision was understood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the pudding is in the legislative archives. We refer particularly to the way in which the provision was discussed during testimony taken in anticipation of the 1984 amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, the House of Representatives was told authoritatively that section 7003 contained \"very broad and general statutory language\" and that the government, \"over the last several years,\" had been advocating \"as broad an interpretation [of it] as possible.\" <i>Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1983: Hearing on S. 757 Before the Subcomm. on Envtl. Pollution of the S. Comm. on Env't and Public Works,</i> 98th Cong. 17, 29 (1983) (statement of Carol Dinkins, Asst. Atty. Gen., Land and Nat. Res. Div., Dep't of Justice). It also learned that the Department of Justice viewed section 7003 as \"loosely worded,\" so that it conveyed \"extraordinary, broad law enforcement powers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110, 120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senate's discussion of section 7003 in the course of considering the 1984 amendments likewise suggests an expansive view of the provision. The Senate Report enthusiastically quotes <i>Price</i> for the proposition that section 7003 is \"intended to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risks posed by toxic wastes.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 59 (quoting <i>Price,</i> 688 F.2d at 214). It went on to observe that the \"primary intent of the provision is to protect human health and the environment.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, there is good reason to believe that Congress, intending to create a provision modeled along the lines of section 7003, understood that section as offering much more than emergency authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history is also at odds with Mallinckrodt's argument that the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) usurps EPA's policymaking role. In parsing this legislative history, it is important to recognize that Congress, in 1984, was acting against a background finding that there were \"serious gaps\" in RCRA, that EPA's enforcement actions were characterized by \"inadequate effort,\" and that EPA \"ha[d] not been diligent in vigorously pursuing a tough enforcement program.\" H.R.Rep. No. 98-198, pt. 1, at 20 (1983), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5576, 5578-79. Congress had heard, and apparently credited, testimony from a former Assistant Attorney General about \"an astonishing two years of mismanagement at EPA in which the enforcement of the hazardous waste disposal laws suffered greatly.\" <i>Id.,</i> pt. 3, at 6, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5636, 5641. Given this miseen-sc&#232;ne, it seems counterintuitive to suggest that Congress intended to erect an enforcement structure built on exaggerated deference to EPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the legislative history reflects the anticipation that \"courts will accord some deference to [EPA's] technical findings concerning the nature and extent of endangerment.\" S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 56. But we do not think that \"some deference\" means either total obeisance or blind allegiance. Congress desired a \"tough enforcement program\" and found that EPA had not been \"diligent in vigorously pursuing\" one. Citizen suits were meant to fill the resultant void.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unimpressed by Mallinckrodt's citation to language in the House Report to the effect that section 7002(a)(1)(B) was designed to create a \"limited right\" for citizens to sue. H.R.Rep. No. 98-198, <i>supra,</i> pt. 1, at 53, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5612. The very next sentence in that report explains the nature of the limitation, namely, that this \"right can only be exercised if the Administrator (following notice of the intended litigation) fails to file an action under 7003.\" <i>Id.</i> The conventional interpretation of the statute does not in any way offend this directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mallinckrodt spotlights a comment from the floor debate on section 7002, in which the bill's sponsor characterized the provision as giving citizens the power \"to abate the most serious kinds of hazardous waste situations: Those that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment.\" 130 Cong. Rec.2081, 2815 (1984) (statement of Sen. Mitchell). This one remark cannot outweigh the substantial countervailing evidence that the citizen suit provision was intended to empower private citizens by granting them relatively broad authority to litigate when EPA had not acted in the face of a reasonable prospect of serious, near-term harm. <i>See Weinberger v. Rossi,</i> 456 U.S. 25, 35, 102 S.Ct. 1510, 71 L.Ed.2d 715 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Legislative history is often a mixed bag. Parties frequently are able to mine nuggets from it selectively, picking and choosing isolated statements that serve particular (sometimes conflicting) ends. Here, the legislative history is less than pellucid. On the whole, however, it tends to support an expansive reading of the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" standard for liability under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the combination of the word \"may\" with the word \"endanger,\" both of which are probabilistic, leads us to conclude that a reasonable prospect of future harm is adequate to engage the gears of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) so long as the threat is near-term and involves potentially serious harm. The language, structure, purpose, and legislative history of the provision will not comfortably accommodate the more restricted reading that Mallinckrodt espouses. While there may be good and wise reasons to adopt a regime in which EPA determinations of environmental liability are exclusive, it is Congress's place, not ours, to construct such a regime. To this date, Congress has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusion that the conventional interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) is correct, the remainder of the liability inquiry falls neatly into place. None of Mallinckrodt's arguments persuade us that the district court either misconstrued this standard or misapplied it to the facts of this case. While an imminent and substantial endangerment requires a reasonable prospect of a near-term threat of serious potential harm, the court below made supportable findings that suffice to bring this case within the compass of that standard. <i>See, e.g., Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 245 (concluding that methylmercury is a \"highly toxic substance\"); <i>id.</i> at 251 (concluding that, in an aquatic system, \"methylation is a continuous process that can go on for decades\"). Based on these and other well-founded findings, the plaintiffs established that the potential risk from mercury is serious and likely to be present here and now. In turn, these findings support a conclusion that, as the district court held, there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the lower Penobscot River. No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE REMEDY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our environmental odyssey is not yet finished. Mallinckrodt contends that the district court committed an abuse of discretion in ordering it to fund a study of the lower Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is rooted in the notion that a court must balance the relevant harms before granting injunctive relief under an environmental statute &#8212; even if the statute specifically authorizes that type of relief. <i>See United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</i> 38 F.3d 862, 867 (7th Cir.1994). Mallinckrodt would have us achieve this balance by applying the familiar four-part framework for determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief. Under that framework, the injunction-seeker \"must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the [parties], a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\" <i>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 1839, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceptually, we agree with Mallinckrodt that a trial court, in an environmental case, should consider the balance of relevant harms before granting injunctive relief, even though the statute itself authorizes such relief. The familiar four-part framework for injunctive relief is a suitable guide in such situations. We caution, however, that the operation of that framework is inevitably colored by the nature of the case and the purposes of the underlying environmental statute (here, RCRA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, Mallinckrodt insists that the district court mishandled the third of the four enumerated elements by failing adequately to account for the onerous hardships that the study would impose and contrast those hardships with the meager benefits that the study might generate. In a nutshell, Mallinckrodt's position is that the study will saddle it with a staggering economic burden &#8212; a burden so open-ended that the overall cost cannot be predicted with any assurance &#8212; yet will yield supposed benefits to the plaintiffs' members that are at best speculative and at worst ephemeral. In this regard, Mallinckrodt stresses that it is an open question whether the lower Penobscot is actually in need of any remediation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One difficulty with Mallinckrodt's position is that it treats this injunction like a garden-variety injunction and, in the bargain, undervalues the extent of the equitable discretion possessed by a district court after a finding of liability under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). While Mallinckrodt's hardships are relevant to the acceptability of a RCRA remedy, the argument that hardship must always be outweighed by deliverable benefits offends the logic of <i>Price.</i> Even on Mallinckrodt's restrictive reading of that decision, <i>Price</i> holds that \"Congress sought to invoke the broad and flexible equity powers of the federal courts in instances where hazardous wastes threaten [] human health.\" 688 F.2d at 211.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ironically, Mallinckrodt dresses this argument in the raiment of a defense of judicial prerogatives. It cites <i>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,</i> 456 U.S. 305, 313, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982), for the proposition that judges should not lightly assume that Congress has stripped courts of their equitable discretion. But that is a red herring: while it is true that a district court is not commanded, regardless of the circumstances, to issue an injunction after a finding of liability, the court below was under no misapprehension on this score. In reality, Mallinckrodt wishes to restrict, not preserve, the equitable discretion of the district courts, and the case law that it cites is therefore beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a district courts exercise of its equitable discretion under such circumstances, we think it fully appropriate to acknowledge the statutory scheme under which liability was found. Given the strong statement in <i>Price,</i> embraced by the Senate Report, advocating the exercise of equitable remediation of environmental hazards, we perceive a congressional thumb on the scale in favor of remediation. With this backdrop in place, we are unwilling to say that the district court abused its discretion either by starting with the proposition that its primary concern ought to be how best to remedy a potentially serious near-term environmental hazard or by granting relief notwithstanding the absence of a showing that the remedy's demonstrable benefits exceeded its probable costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that the costs associated with injunctive relief are immaterial; we can imagine circumstances in which the expense entailed in carrying out a particular remedial plan might dwarf the potential benefits to the environment or to human health. Here, however, the anodyne chosen by the district court does not seem so vastly disproportionate to the threatened harm as to warrant, from the vantage point of a cold appellate record, a recalibration of the balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Mallinckrodt has not identified any less burdensome, more cost-effective remedy that the court could have imposed to address the perceived environmental harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Where, as here, a polluter has failed to articulate a \"nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs,\" <i>Hecht Co. v. Bowles,</i> 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944), a burdensomeness argument rarely will gain much traction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a slightly different tack, Mallinckrodt characterizes the study-plan order as unfair. It should not be forced to pay the entire cost of the study, it complains, because it is not the only entity to have contributed to the pollution of the lower Penobscot. That plaint rings hollow. While Mallinckrodt was not the sole source of mercury contamination, it was a dominant one, so in that sense its claim of inequitable treatment comprises more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, RCRA liability, generally speaking, is joint and several. <i>See Cox,</i> 256 F.3d at 301 n. 37. The joint and several nature of environmental liability makes it fitting to hold a single polluter responsible for the totality of the damage where, as here, the harm is indivisible. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. Once liability has been found, equitable relief in RCRA citizen suits is largely in the informed discretion of the trial court. For aught that appears, the court below did not abuse this discretion in its choice of a condign remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Despite an impressive array of arguments, skillfully presented by extraordinarily able counsel, Mallinckrodt has not persuaded us that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue, that its cramped interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) is what Congress had in mind, or that the district court acted outside the realm of its discretion in fashioning a remedy for the threatened harm. Consequently, we uphold the district court's rulings in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We use the phrase \"near-term threat\" advisedly.

The critical facts are laid out in the district court's rescript. Even though many of the facts are undisputed, the parties have woven them into widely dissimilar tapestries. On the plaintiffs' telling, Mallinckrodt is an unrepentant polluter, which consistently flouted governmental enforcement efforts and finally wore down the regulators. On Mallinckrodt's telling, the plaintiffs are overzealous environmentalists attempting an end run around the reasoned policymaking of an Executive Branch agency.

This argument focuses on the uncertainty attendant to the study's outcome (for example, the study may find that there is no endangerment or, if endangerment exists, that it cannot be rectified). But even in the absence of a demonstrated need for remediation, the information that the study will provide is adequate redress because it will allow the plaintiffs to tailor their behavior to the actual condition of the lower Penobscot.

In support of this entreaty, Mallinckrodt presents a gallimaufry of new, hitherto unconsidered arguments. After careful consideration of this asseverational array, we conclude that our sister circuits have adroitly distilled the meaning of section 7002(a)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(a)(1)(B) &#8212; the so-called citizen suit provision. Correctly interpreted, this provision allows citizen suits when there is a reasonable prospect that a serious, near-term threat to human health or the environment exists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In such situations, the provision permits remedies consistent with the scope of a district court's equitable discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court read the statute in this manner and faithfully applied the law to the facts. Its supportable liability finding, coupled with a choice of remedy that comes within the encincture of its discretion, leads us to reject Mallinckrodt's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rehearse here only those facts that are directly relevant to the issues on appeal, referring readers who hunger for more information to the district court's initial opinion. <i>See Me. People's Alliance v. HoltraChem Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2572240\"><a href=\"/opinion/2572240/maine-peoples-alliance-v-holtrachem-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span> (D.Me.2002). This narrative credits the factual findings of the district court to the extent that those findings are not clearly erroneous. <i>See Fed. Refinance Co. v. Klock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200761\"><a href=\"/opinion/200761/federal-refinance-v-romano/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1967 to 1982, Mallinckrodt, then called International Minerals and Chemicals Corporation, owned and operated a chlor-alkali plant (the Plant) situated on the banks of the Penobscot River in Orrington, Maine. Thereafter, the Plant continued operations under other owners, namely, Hanlin Group, Inc. and HoltraChem Manufacturing Co.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> until it closed in 2000. During the period of its operation, the Plant deposited tons of mercury-laden waste into the Penobscot River. <i>See Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 253. While there have been a number of other significant contributors to mercury in the Penobscot, \"Mallinckrodt has been a dominant source.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, the Plant's continuous release of mercury led the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to file an administrative RCRA action against Hanlin (the Plant's quondam owner). That action resulted in an agreement for corrective measures. Deeming turnabout fair play, Hanlin sued Mallinckrodt for contribution. In a 1991 settlement, Mallinckrodt agreed to pay a portion of the compliance costs imposed by the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A subsequent enforcement action led to a 1993 consent decree that superseded the earlier agreement. Although not a party to this consent decree, Mallinckrodt, consistent with the Hanlin settlement, paid its share of the compliance costs and participated in ongoing negotiations with government regulators.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That included working with both EPA and Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1993 consent decree contemplated a tripartite process comprising site investigation, evaluation of possible corrective measures, and remediation. In line with the first phase of this process, Mallinckrodt compiled and submitted a site investigation report. In March of 1997, EPA and MDEP, acting in concert, issued a draft notice of disapproval. Mallinckrodt countered with a supplemental site investigation report but, in 2000, EPA and MDEP again disapproved. Among other things, the regulators instructed Mallinckrodt to study the effects of mercury downriver from the Plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a matter of months, Mallinckrodt commissioned a study aimed at examining downriver mercury contamination. It conducted a second downriver study during the summer of 2001. Notwithstanding the submission of these studies, however, the district court supportably found that Mallinckrodt made only minimal efforts to pursue the designated line of inquiry and that the decision to forgo more vigorous efforts was deliberate. <i>Id.</i> at 244 &amp; n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the midst of this sparring, two environmental groups &#8212; the National Resources Defense Council and the Maine People's Alliance &#8212; joined forces to commence a citizen suit under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). The plaintiffs alleged that mercury contamination downriver from the Plant \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\" Acknowledging the possibility that remediation might eventually prove to be either unnecessary or infeasible, their principal prayer for relief was that Mallinckrodt be ordered to fund an \"independent, comprehensive, scientific study to determine the precise nature and extent of the endangerment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt tried on several occasions to derail the suit on the ground that EPA, not the courts, had primary jurisdiction. The district court demurred, holding that the suit would not present any conflict with agency action due to EPA's apparent lack of interest in the lower Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was reached for trial in March of 2002. By that time, EPA and MDEP had made public, but had not adopted, preliminary media protection standards, potentially applicable to the lower Penobscot. Had those standards gone into effect, no remediation would have been required for the region with which this litigation is concerned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a nine-day bench trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> one of the plaintiffs' principal experts was Dr. Robert Livingston. The district court found Livingston, an aquatic biologist, to be \"particularly credible and persuasive.\" <i>Id.</i> at 251. Drawing on three main sources &#8212; the data gathered under the EPA-ordered site studies, some limited field work, and the scientific literature concerning mercury in aquatic systems &#8212; Livingston opined that there might be a serious endangerment to both human health and the environment resulting from mercury contamination in the lower Penobscot. Although believing it \"highly likely\" that these harms would prove to be both real and severe, he cautioned that he had not yet \"done the right research to determine that.\" Due to the absence of sufficient research, no one could know with certitude \"if there is a problem\" or \"what the problem is.\" When all was said and done, however, he thought it \"highly likely\" that localized and targeted remediation would be both necessary and desirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also adduced testimony from other experts, from individuals within their respective memberships, and from EPA and MDEP representatives. A number of defense experts testified as well. After both sides had rested and submitted briefs, the district court issued a thoughtful rescript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that mercury in aquatic systems is susceptible to being transformed by microscopic organisms into its organic form (known as methylmercury). <i>Id.</i> at 244. Methylmercury is a highly toxic substance which, even in low dosages, is inimical to human health; for example, it \"attacks the nervous system, the kidneys, the immune system, and the reproductive system\" and is especially damaging to a developing fetus. <i>Id.</i> at 245. Methylmercury is especially pernicious because it is the most bioavailable form of mercury and therefore, is readily accumulated in humans and animals alike. <i>Id.</i> at 244.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the court found that mercury concentration in sediments extracted from the lower Penobscot runs five times higher than in the Kennebec River (which Mallinckrodt's expert identified as an appropriate comparator). <i>Id.</i> at 248. Despite this high concentration, the court wisely recognized that \"the mere presence of mercury contaminated sediments is alone not enough to constitute an imminent and substantial endangerment,\" <i>id.,</i> so it proceeded to examine the available data concerning mercury contamination in various species in the lower Penobscot, including benthos, killfish (minnows), lobsters, blue mussels, cormorants, osprey, and eagles. This examination led the court to conclude that \"mercury is methylating downriver\" and that \"methylmercury is bioavailable, entering biota, and biomagnifying throughout the food web.\" <i>Id.</i> at 251.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court expressed heightened concern about a region known as Frankfort Flats, which displayed extraordinarily high mercury readings in both sediments and biota. <i>Id.</i> at 252. Frankfort Flats receives drainage from a marsh system, and marshes are considered to be hotbeds of methylation. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court turned to the legal standard for citizen suits under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), it characterized that standard as \"lenient.\" 211 F.Supp.2d at 246. It cited with approval case law emphasizing that RCRA allows such a suit when the putative polluter \"<i>may</i>\" have caused an imminent and substantial endangerment. <i>Id.</i> at 246-47 (collecting cases). On this basis, the court concluded that the statute's \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" standard would be satisfied by a \"reasonable medical concern for public health and a reasonable scientific concern for the environment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this interpretation of the statute to the facts as found, the court determined that Mallinckrodt's disposal activities may have created an imminent and substantial danger and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had carried their burden of proof anent liability. <i>Id.</i> at 251-52. Then, having found liability, the court directed the parties to make a good-faith effort to agree on a study plan. <i>Id.</i> at 256. The parties complied and, on August 10, 2005, the court approved a plan which, if carried out, probably will require Mallinckrodt to spend around $4,000,000 for laboratory analyses, independent of all other costs. The purpose of the study is to learn whether, in actuality, mercury contamination in the lower Penobscot adversely affects either human health or the environment, and if so, to devise a feasible remedial approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt now appeals, asserting that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue in the first place; that the lower court set the bar too low for RCRA citizen suits; and that, in all events, the court abused its discretion in fashioning relief. We address these assertions one by one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, Mallinckrodt alleges that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue because they have not suffered an injury in fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The existence vel non of standing is a legal question and, therefore, engenders de novo review. <i>See N.H. Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197054\"><a href=\"/opinion/197054/nh-right-to-life-v-nh-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1996). When, however, the trial court's standing determination rests on findings of fact, we must honor those factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <i>See Rivera v. Wyeth-Ayerst Labs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776894\"><a href=\"/opinion/776894/elizabeth-rivera-arkansas-carpenters-health-and-welfare-fund-on-behalf-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 319 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our inquiry into standing with the undisputed fact that both of the plaintiffs are associations. In order to ground a claim of associational standing (that is, standing to bring suit on behalf of its membership), an association must show three things: (i) that individual members would have standing to sue in their own right; (ii) that the interests at stake are related to the organization's core purposes; and (iii) that both the asserted claim and the requested relief can be adjudicated without the participation of individual members as named plaintiffs. <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span> (2000). The plaintiffs in this case plainly have made the latter two showings. Hence, the inquiry reduces to whether the organizations' individual members would have had standing to proceed in their own right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there is nothing in RCRA's text or history that suggests a congressional intent to erect statutory standing barriers beyond those imposed by Article III of the Constitution and because Mallinckrodt has not identified any prudential standing concerns, we focus on what is essential to establish Article III standing. Those requirements are expressed in a familiar three-part algorithm: a would-be plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury in fact, a causal connection that permits tracing the claimed injury to the defendant's actions, and a likelihood that prevailing in the action will afford some redress for the injury. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560-61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These requisites must be proved \"with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2130</span></a></span>. When, as now, standing is reviewed after trial, the facts establishing standing \"must be supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The ultimate quotient of proof is a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See Perry v. Vill. of Arlington Heights,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765544\"><a href=\"/opinion/765544/rixson-merle-perry-v-village-of-arlington-heights-a-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 829 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first dispose of an argument that verges on the specious. Mallinckrodt protests that the plaintiffs cannot have established a cognizable injury since the district court thought it appropriate to order a remedy &#8212; the study &#8212; that would determine whether mercury in the Penobscot is \"having significant adverse effects\" on the environment or \"posing an unacceptable risk to human health.\" This protestation conflates the district court's finding of liability with its choice of remedy. As we shortly shall explain, probabilistic harms are legally cognizable, and the district court made a supportable finding that a sufficient probability of harm exists to satisfy the Article III standing inquiry. <i>See Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 253. The fact that the court chose a remedy that aspires to furnish a degree of determinacy before fashioning further relief speaks only to the court's cautious use of discretion in selecting remedies; it does not speak to the plaintiffs' standing as of the present time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having dispatched this attempted sleight of hand, we proceed to more serious matters. Mallinckrodt concentrates its standing attack on the plaintiffs' ostensible failure to prove the injury-in-fact component. At trial, the plaintiffs called four witnesses from within their respective memberships, all of whom reside on or near the banks of the Penobscot River. All four vouchsafed that they have modified their behavior due to fear of mercury contamination. Although eager to do so, none of them will eat fish or shellfish from the river nor recreate on or near it. One witness added that, but for the mercury contamination, she would harvest mussels and sell them to supplement her income. The district court credited this testimony. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs in environmental suits may predicate claims of injury on aesthetic or recreational harms. <i>See Laidlaw,</i> 528 U.S. at 183, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Still, neither a bald assertion of such a harm nor a purely subjective fear that an environmental hazard may have been created is enough to ground standing. Rather, an individual's decision to deny herself aesthetic or recreational pleasures based on concern about pollution will constitute a cognizable injury only when the concern is premised upon a realistic threat. <i>See Laidlaw,</i> 528 U.S. at 184, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The plaintiffs read its brief, not implausibly, as arguing that these facts necessarily limit cognizable injuries to identifiable medical concerns. <i>See</i> Appellees' Br. at 54. Mallinckrodt's reply brief, however, acknowledges that the plaintiffs' principal claim of injury is for diminished enjoyment of their environment and joins issue on the sufficiency of the proof in that regard. <i>See</i> Appellant's Reply Br. at 25. At bottom, this argument suggests that the plaintiffs must show that Mallinckrodt's activities created a significantly increased risk of harm to health or the environment so as to make it objectively reasonable for the plaintiffs' members to deny themselves aesthetic and recreational use of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish an injury in fact based on a probabilistic harm, a plaintiff must show that there is a substantial probability that harm will occur. <i>See Warth v.

Watson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195073\"><a href=\"/opinion/195073/adams-v-watson-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 923 (1st Cir.1993). Mallinckrodt suggests that the instant plaintiffs have not demonstrated a sufficiently probable increase in harm because of (i) Dr. Livingston's admitted uncertainty about whether any problem exists and (ii) the notion that politically accountable branches of government, not courts, are the appropriate entities to make judgments as to what risks are acceptable in modern society. Neither suggestion is convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's first suggestion relies ultimately on a single snippet of Dr. Livingston's testimony, wrested from its contextual moorings. But a trial court, confronted with a complex and highly ramified factual situation, is fully entitled to consider the import of a witness's testimony as a whole. This case is a good example: Dr. Livingston testified, in effect, that the presence of a great deal of smoke justified looking for a fire. Mallinckrodt excerpts only his isolated statement that he had not actually seen a fire yet. This plucking of the record overlooks the obvious fact that the district court, drawing on the whole of Dr. Livingston's testimony as well as a plethora of other evidence, supportably concluded that \"mercury is methylating downriver, and that such methylmercury is bioavailable, entering biota, and biomagnifying throughout the food web\" in sufficient quantity that it may well present an imminent and substantial danger to the environment. <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 251 (citation omitted). Relatedly, the court found that \"the effects resulting from methylmercury exposure . . . clearly endanger reproduction, development, and overall health of the public and the environment,\" <i>id.</i> at 252, and that \"Mallinckrodt has been a dominant source of mercury in the Penobscot River,\" <i>id.</i> at 255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words &#8212; to return to our metaphor &#8212; the lower court discerned telltale signs that a fire might already be smoldering. In light of its warrantable findings, the court had ample reason to conclude that Mallinckrodt has created a substantial probability of increased harm to the environment. That increased risk, in turn, rendered reasonable the actions of the plaintiffs' members in abstaining from their desired enjoyment of the Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's second suggestion is nothing less than a no-holds-barred assault on the federal courts' institutional competency. It emphasizes that the plaintiffs allege no violation of any federally prescribed discharge limits, and then treats this omission as dispositive. <i>See</i> Appellant's Br. at 27 (asserting that \"in the absence of any finding by [EPA],\" courts are not equipped to determine whether \"the medical and scientific uncertainties created by mercury in the Penobscot create an <i>unacceptable</i> increased risk of harm\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This postulate proceeds from a two-part premise. First, in terms of environmental regulation &#8212; where important policy tradeoffs must be made between protection and progress &#8212; the only injuries that satisfy the criteria for Article III standing are those injuries that are \"unacceptable\"; and second, the political branches alone, not courts, have the expertise and accountability to determine which injuries society must be prepared to tolerate. In Mallinckrodt's view, this need to restrict cognizable injuries to \"unacceptable\" injuries is especially acute where, as in this case, the asserted harms are probabilistic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt provides scant authority for an argument that has such breathtaking ramifications for the scope of judicial power. Its notion of acceptability is apparently derived from a single, quarter-century-old opinion, in which a respected court cautioned that judges cannot \"formulate policy with respect to what [environmental] risks are acceptable.\" <i>Envtl. Def. Fund v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365968\"><a href=\"/opinion/365968/environmental-defense-fund-v-environmental-protection-agency-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 83-84 (D.C.Cir. 1978). That court, however, was reviewing a challenge to an EPA regulation based on an alleged lack of substantial evidence. There is no discussion either of standing or of Article III's limits on judicial power. The opinion, therefore, affords no solid foundation for the proposition that Mallinckrodt asserts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, Mallinckrodt argues that a grant of standing in this case would be tantamount to judicial usurpation of regulatory authority because it would permit \"private parties to attack EPA risk assessments collaterally, using the very risks EPA deemed acceptable to establish standing and liability, with no deference afforded to EPA's policy judgment.\" Appellant's Reply Br. at 27-28. But the ingredients that comprise what Mallinckrodt sees as a recipe for disaster &#8212; the relatively broad scope of citizens' rights to sue polluters, the existence of liability in such suits, and the less-than-total deference afforded to agency inaction &#8212; all turn on legislative choices. Congress has elected to create a cause of action for affected citizens notwithstanding the absence of any EPA-sponsored standard. While we share Mallinckrodt's belief that it would be a usurpation of legislative prerogative for a court to assume policymaking control over environmental regulation, it would be no less offensive a usurpation for a court to refuse to undertake a task validly entrusted to it by Congress. In the last analysis, Article III requires a cognizable injury; it does not speak to the wisdom of the legislature's actions in providing redress for that injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add an eschatocol of sorts. In rejecting Mallinckrodt's arguments as to standing, we remain confident that Congress has not asked federal courts to perform tasks that are beyond their institutional competency. In our view, courts are capable of assessing probabilistic injuries. Moreover, nuisance principles contribute heavily to the doctrinal template that underbraces statutes like RCRA, <i>see, e.g., Cox v. City of Dallas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24837\"><a href=\"/opinion/24837/cox-v-city-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 289 (5th Cir.2001), and the tasks involved in adjudicating environmental cases are well within the federal courts' accustomed domain. While courts can (and do) benefit from available agency expertise, it is an insupportable leap of logic to maintain that, in the absence of such input, claims of injury are not cognizable at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. For the reasons discussed above, we hold that the plaintiffs have standing to sue under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). We turn, then, to the meat of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case revolves around the meaning and purport of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), a statute that, as described above, allows citizens to sue persons or firms whose handling of solid or hazardous waste \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court read this language as meaning that such suits could be brought to alleviate reasonable medical or scientific concerns. <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 252. Mallinckrodt urges a more circumscribed interpretation. To the extent that this interpretive controversy presents a question of statutory construction, we afford de novo review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Lattab</i> <i>v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201243\"><a href=\"/opinion/201243/lattab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An historical perspective illustrates the strength of the current against which Mallinckrodt is swimming. Congress enacted RCRA in 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-580, 90 Stat. 2795, with the avowed intention of closing \"the last remaining loophole in environmental law, that of unregulated land disposal of discarded materials and hazardous waste.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-1491, pt. 1, at 4, <i>reprinted in</i> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6238, 6241. In its original iteration, RCRA &#167; 7002 (now codified in pertinent part at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(a)(1)(A)) offered citizens the opportunity to bring suit against a polluter only when the polluter was alleged to be in violation of a permit, standard, regulation, condition, requirement, or order issued by EPA. At the same time, RCRA created a cause of action, available exclusively to the EPA Administrator, for cases in which the \"disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\" RCRA &#167; 7003 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6973(a)). In suits brought under this latter provision, federal district courts were granted broad remedial authority to \"restrain\" polluters and take \"such other action as may be necessary.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pertinently we think, Congress later <i>loosened</i> the standard for liability under section 7003. This transpired four years later when Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980. That legislation amended section 7003 by substituting the words \"may present\" for the words \"is presenting.\" Pub.L. No. 96-482, &#167; 25, 94 Stat. 2334, 2348.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

The Third Circuit reversed, ruling that the use of the word \"may\" in RCRA &#167; 7003 was intended to make the provision \"expansive.\" <i>Id.</i> at 213. In its view, \"Congress, by enacting section 7003, intended to confer upon courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risks posed by toxic waste.\" <i>Id.</i> at 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon thereafter, Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (1984 amendments), Pub.L. No. 98-616, 98 Stat. 3221. The 1984 amendments introduced a new provision, RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), into the statutory scheme. Using language that tracked the post-1980 text of RCRA &#167; 7003, this new provision extended to citizens the right to sue a polluter who may be causing an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 401, 98 Stat. at 3268-69. The Senate Report that accompanied the 1984 amendments approvingly cited and quoted <i>Price</i> on several occasions, specifically endorsing that court's conclusion that section 7003 is intended to give courts the tools to \"eliminate any risks posed by toxic waste.\" S.Rep.

In taking this position, all four courts have emphasized the preeminence of the word \"may\" in defining the degree of risk needed to support RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B)'s liability standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This expansiveness in construing the requisite degree of risk has largely been matched in the courts' assessment of the gravity and immediacy of the threatened harm. With one possible exception, the courts have agreed that the word \"substantial\" implies serious harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See, e.g., Parker,</i> 386 F.3d at 1015. There has, however, been some reluctance to quantify the needed level of harm more precisely. <i>See, e.g., Honeywell,</i> 399 F.3d at 259. Imminence generally has been read to require only that the harm is of a kind that poses a near-term threat; there is no corollary requirement that the harm necessarily will occur or that the actual damage will manifest itself immediately. <i>See Cox,</i> 256 F.3d at 299-300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt argues that this long line of cases has consistently misread <i>Price</i> (which, Mallinckrodt says, only concerned remedial power, not scope of liability) and, in the bargain, has disregarded the strictures imposed by the adjectives \"imminent\" and \"substantial.\" We have not had occasion to construe the reach of the citizen suit provision contained in RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), and we are obligated to offer our independent judgment on an issue of first impression here (which, as we shortly shall explain, coincides with the result reached by the other courts of appeals that have confronted the question). Accordingly, we proceed to test the mettle of the conventional construction of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) against Mallinckrodt's challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, following the interpretive trail blazed by the four above-mentioned courts of appeals, employed the conventional construction. It began by noting that the word \"endangerment\" does not imply actual harm but, rather, implies only potential harm. <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 246. The court then noted that the statutory standard is further relaxed because of Congress's use of the word \"may.\" <i>Id.</i> As a result, the court found RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) to be a \"sweeping provision indicat[ing] Congress's intent `to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate <i>any risk</i> posed by toxic waste.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 246-47 (quoting <i>Dague,</i> 935 F.2d at 1355 (quoting <i>Price,</i> 688 F.2d at 214) (emphasis supplied in <i>Dague</i>)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court read the statute's adjectival elements in line with the breadth of the authority granted. It found that the word \"imminent\" connotes only that the \"factors giving rise to [the harm] are present, even though the harm may not be realized for some time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247. Relatedly, the court found that the word \"substantial\" connotes no more than \"reasonable cause for concern that someone or something may be exposed\" to harm. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Raymond K. Hoxsie Real Estate Trust v. Exxon Educ.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 366 (D.R.I.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A \"reasonable medical concern\" would, the court said, be sufficient to ground liability under the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 252. The court's only explicit limitation on the availability of relief was when \"the risk of harm is remote in time, completely speculative in nature, or de minimis in degree.\" <i>Id.</i> at 247 (quoting <i>United States v. Reilly Tar &amp; Chem.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span>, 1109 (D.Minn.1982)). Mallinckrodt balks at this interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) for a host of reasons. It argues that this construction ignores the plain meaning of the phrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment,\" does violence to the internal coherence of RCRA by overlooking the hierarchy of standards contained within that statute, tampers with Congress's wise delegation of policymaking to an expert agency, and frustrates congressional intent. We address each of these criticisms in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's textual argument rests on the premise that the courts that heretofore have explicated section 7002(a)(1)(B)'s liability standard have been blinded by the glare of the word \"may\" and have lost sight of the plain meaning of the words \"imminent and substantial.\" In Mallinckrodt's view, the phrase \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment,\" when read as a whole, requires a risk of grave harm that is more likely than not to occur. Mallinckrodt deduces this construction from a Rosetta Stone that is part case law and part lexicography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"endangerment,\" Mallinckrodt says somewhat tautologically, is \"the state of being placed in danger.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 748 (1993). In that connection, it defines danger as \"exposed to harm\" or \"peril.\" <i>Id.</i> at 573 (excess capitalization omitted). To elucidate the meaning of \"may,\" Mallinckrodt points to a sixty-year old Supreme Court decision that defines \"may,\" as used in section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as \"probably.\" <i>Corn Prods. Refining Co. v.

Finally, to give content to the phrase \"imminent and substantial,\" Mallinckrodt invokes case law suggesting that, in other environmental contexts, the unadorned word \"endanger\" implies a lower standard than that denoted by the phrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment.\" <i>See Ethyl Corp. v.

While the decisions in <i>Ethyl Corp.</i> and <i>Reserve Mining</i> are some evidence that, <i>as of 1976,</i> the phrase \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" was thought to denote a heightened standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> the relevant question is how that term was understood <i>in 1984</i> (when section 7002(a)(1)(B) was enacted). The Senate Report on the 1984 amendments defines the word \"endangerment\" separately from the phrase \"imminent and substantial.\" <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 59. Mallinckrodt's criticism fails to account either for that circumstance or for Congress's insertion, in 1980, of the word \"may\" into section 7003 and its subsequent use in section 7002. That word does not appear at all in the statute considered in <i>Reserve Mining,</i> 514 F.2d at 528 &amp; n. 70 (citing 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1364). In <i>Ethyl Corp.,</i> one of the referenced statutes does use the word \"may,\" but that court did not parse the entire sentence and looked only to the words \"imminent and substantial.\" <i>See Ethyl Corp.,</i> 541 F.2d at 20 n. 36 (citing 42 U.S.C. &#167; 300i). We also note that statutes referenced in <i>Ethyl Corp.</i> and <i>Reserve Mining</i> bore the subtitle \"Emergency Powers\"; in contrast, neither section 7002 nor section 7003 carry such a label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager, we think, is that \"words are like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances.\" <i>United States v. Romain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201394\"><a href=\"/opinion/201394/united-states-v-romain/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2004). The terrain of the Clayton Act and provisions specifically classified as conferring emergency powers are sufficiently distinct in subject matter from RCRA's terrain. Thus, we are unprepared to say that the nuances attached to the phrase \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment\" by judicial decisions in those other contexts should be transplanted root and branch into the differently textured soil of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B)-a statute enacted by a different Congress at a different time for a different purpose. We conclude, therefore, that Mallinckrodt's textual argument does not carry the day: the interpretive question before us cannot be resolved favorably to Mallinckrodt on the basis of plain meaning alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt next argues that the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) drains the phrase \"imminent and substantial\" of any meaning because RCRA already defines \"hazardous waste\" as material that will cause an increase in mortality or serious illness or \"pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6903(5). Thus, any release of hazardous waste would satisfy the conventional construction of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), and the requirement that such a release create an \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" would be superfluous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is easily dispatched. In terms, section 7002(a)(1)(B) applies to <i>both</i> solid waste and hazardous waste. RCRA's definition of \"solid waste\" does not share the same characteristics as its definition of \"hazardous waste,\" so to that extent the phrase \"imminent and substantial\" retains an independent meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, Mallinckrodt asserts that the conventional interpretation of \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" overlooks RCRA's commitment to a hierarchy of risks in which \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" ranks at or near the top. This argument builds on the idea that Congress employed relatively lenient risk standards elsewhere in RCRA. <i>See, e.g.,</i> RCRA &#167; 4004(a), codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6944(a) (providing that sanitary landfills must have \"no reasonable probability of adverse effects on health or the environment\"). Correspondingly, the word \"endangerment\" is used in other contexts in connection with \"imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> RCRA &#167; 3008(e), codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6928(e) (defining the crime of \"knowing endangerment\"). Thus, the decision to require an \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" must signify a special, harder-to-achieve benchmark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has some superficial appeal. After all, it is a cardinal rule that courts should strive to interpret statutes as a whole and to give effect to every word and phrase. <i>King v. St. Vincent Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 221, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) gives full effect to the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" language; it merely eschews the mechanical cross-referencing, not mandated by Congress, that Mallinckrodt advocates. That, in itself, should not raise eyebrows: where the various parts of a complicated and multifaceted statutory scheme discuss significantly different topics and function within different paradigms, mechanical cross-referencing, not mandated by Congress, can lead to confusion rather than clarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. There is no meaningful parallelism between section 7002(a)(1)(B) and the provisions that Mallinckrodt seeks to use as comparators. For example, RCRA &#167; 3008(e) is a <i>criminal</i> provision. Given the divergent concerns that drive criminal statutes as opposed to civil remedial statutes, it should not be surprising that the same word may vary in meaning as the context shifts. Indeed, if \"endangerment\" as defined in section 3008(e) were to mean precisely what it means in section 7002(a)(1)(B), the word \"imminent\" would be rendered utterly redundant &#8212; the statute would, in effect, require an imminent imminence &#8212; thus transgressing the very canon of construction that Mallinckrodt labors to invoke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt offers a more sophisticated version of the argument that RCRA creates a hierarchy of risks when it posits that the statute's most expansive remedies are reserved for the greatest risks. In this regard, it points out that under RCRA &#167; 3019(b), EPA can commission a health assessment whenever it believes that a landfill \"poses a substantial potential risk to human health,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6939a(b); under RCRA &#167; 3013, EPA can order the owner or operator of a facility to conduct monitoring, testing, and analysis as long as the facility \"may present a substantial hazard to human health or the environment,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 6934(a); and under RCRA &#167; 7003, which has a risk standard identical to RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), EPA can act to protect the public health, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 6973(a). From this statutory melange, Mallinckrodt concludes that only the immediate threat of grave harm is sufficient to trigger such far-reaching remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The notion that a hierarchy of risks and remedies exists within RCRA is not easily disproved. What is fairly clear, however, is that any such hierarchy is well-disguised; if one exists, it seems more a product of fortuity than a product of a purposeful legislative initiative. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3019(b) was first enacted in 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-616, &#167; 247, 98 Stat. 3221, 3265; section 3013 in 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-482, &#167; 17(a), 94 Stat. 2334, 2344; and section 7003 (previously cited) in 1976 (though that provision was amended both in 1980 and 1984). Given that the changes were made to different subtitles of the statute at different times, such incrementalism weakens (perhaps to the vanishing point) any inference that Congress specifically intended a strict hierarchy of harms. If Congress actually wants a delineated hierarchy of risks and remedies, it will have to say so more distinctly. <i>Cf. King,</i> 502 U.S. at 222, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It asseverates that RCRA's allocation of policymaking authority to EPA is such that the citizen suit provision must be viewed as an \"interstitial, emergency-type remedy.\" Appellant's Br. at 45. Mallinckrodt asserts that this policymaking authority necessarily includes responsibility for setting pollution standards and that, in setting such standards, EPA, consistent with the tradeoffs inherent in setting virtually any standard, does not aspire to eliminate all risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion is founded on an indisputable verity: the principal responsibility for implementing and enforcing RCRA resides with EPA, not with citizens acting as private attorneys general. <i>See Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118007\"><a href=\"/opinion/118007/meghrig-v-kfc-western-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 483-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118007\"><a href=\"/opinion/118007/meghrig-v-kfc-western-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span> (1996). We disagree, however, with Mallinckrodt's contention that the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) &#8212; the interpretation espoused by our sister circuits and by the court below &#8212; is inconsistent with this scheme because it allows courts to second-guess EPA's judgments too freely and affords relief based upon harms that EPA has found acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt attempts to bolster this argument by citing a plethora of cases for the proposition that environmental standards should be set by EPA, not the courts. <i>See, e.g., Amoco Oil Co. v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321074\"><a href=\"/opinion/321074/amoco-oil-company-v-environmental-protection-agency-ashland-oil-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 735 (D.C.Cir.1974). This proposition is unremarkable, and we take no issue with it. We agree, moreover, that courts must show appropriate respect for EPA's judgments. <i>See Envtl. Def. Fund,</i> 598 F.2d at 83-84. But allowing citizen suits to proceed is not the functional equivalent of allowing courts to hijack EPA's regulatory authority and weave safety standards out of whole cloth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand illustrates this point. Although EPA (acting in concert with MDEP) was leaning toward the adoption of media protection standards that would not have required downriver remediation, no standards had been adopted at the time the district court acted (nor, for that matter, does the record suggest that any have been adopted up to the present time). Furthermore, EPA has never taken the position &#8212; or even so much as hinted &#8212; that correction of the Plant's effects on downriver pollution is bad policy. Thus, this is not a situation in which a court has presumed to grant relief that flies in the face of an express EPA authorization of certain conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the district court has been sensitive to separation-of-powers concerns. On three different occasions, it considered and thoughtfully rejected primary jurisdiction challenges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> And the court sensibly left open the possibility that \"primary jurisdiction concerns could arise in the future.\" <i>Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 255. That presumably would cover the contingency of changed circumstances that would eventuate should EPA, some day, actually engage in an enforcement action pertinent to the condition of the lower Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that courts retain some latitude in this area is not in any sense incompatible with the statutory scheme. There are four different ways that EPA can preempt a citizen suit &#8212; and all four require that EPA itself take diligent steps to remedy looming environmental harm. <i>See</i> RCRA &#167; 7002(b)(2)(B) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(b)(2)(B)). That same provision narrowly circumscribes EPA's preemptive power; it states that, when preemption is premised on an EPA order, citizen suits are \"prohibited only as to the scope and duration of the administrative order.\" The short of it is that Congress has told the federal courts that they are not required to steer clear of an area simply because that area might be a focus of future EPA activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt tries to embellish its separation-of-powers argument in another way as well; it maintains that section 7002(a) embodies a strong preference for permit-violation suits as opposed to imminent and substantial endangerment suits. This attempted embellishment does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When not premised on the title related to hazardous waste, a permit-violation suit may be brought after a 60-day waiting period while an imminent and substantial endangerment suit requires observance of a 90-day waiting period. <i>Compare</i> RCRA &#167; 7002(b)(1) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 6972(b)(1)), <i>with</i> RCRA &#167; 7002(b)(2) (codified at &#167; 6972(b)(2)). This is the only substantive difference between permit-violation suits and suits alleging imminent and substantial endangerment. Given the relatively minor nature of that lone disparity, we conclude, without serious question, that the structure of the statutory scheme does not offer any persuasive evidence that Congress sought to disfavor suits alleging imminent and substantial endangerment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mallinckrodt's emphasis on statutory structure includes an assertion that giving section 7002(a)(1)(B) a broad reading will render nugatory the right to bring permit-violation actions and the like under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(A). <i>See</i> Appellant's Reply Br. at 15-16 (querying whether, if \"there is a big hole in a fence for the big cat, need there be a small one for the small one?\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The flaw in this argument, as it pertains to this case, is that the two holes were drilled at different times. Congress placed the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" gloss on RCRA's citizen suit provision eight years <i>after</i> making provision for permit-violation suits. Thus, the more appropriate question is: \"If Congress deliberately cut a second hole in the fence, is there any reason not to accept the obvious premise that Congress wanted to increase the ease with which cats of all sizes could come through the fence?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Mallinckrodt theorizes that courts lack the competence to function under the conventional interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B), we reject its thesis. To be sure, Mallinckrodt cites case after case for the proposition that forging policy is a task that non-expert, non-accountable judges should not undertake. <i>See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

Some of these cases suggest that judicial policymaking in the environmental sphere is especially inappropriate because judges lack special competence to interpret complex scientific, technical, and medical data. <i>See, e.g., Safe Food &amp; Fertil. v.

Federal courts are often called upon to make evaluative judgments in highly technical areas (patent litigation is an excellent example).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Performing that quintessentially judicial function in the environmental sphere is not tantamount to rewriting environmental policy. To the contrary, what the lower court did here &#8212; listening to the testimony of expert witnesses, assessing their credibility, and determining whether or not a litigant has carried the devoir of persuasion &#8212; is very much within the core competency of a federal district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last-ditch measure, Mallinckrodt strives to convince us that Congress's revealed intent, as reflected in the legislative history, counsels in favor of a narrow reading of section 7002(a)(1)(B). We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument shapes up along the following lines. Citing S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 56, Mallinckrodt reads this archival information as confirming that section 7002(a)(1)(B) was intended to operate \"exactly the same\" as section 7003. Building on that foundation, Mallinckrodt notes that section 7003, when enacted in 1976, was envisioned as a means of providing \"emergency authority.\" S.Rep. No. 94-988, at 16 (1976). This gloss, though artful, mixes plums and pomegranates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is relevant to a congressional statement, in 1984, that section 7002(a)(1)(B) is intended to operate in the same way as section 7003, is not how Congress viewed section 7003 at the time of its original passage but, rather, how Congress understood section 7003 <i>in 1984.</i> This is especially significant because section 7003 was not worded the same in 1984 as it was in 1976. We think it is clear that the 1980 amendment to the provision, substituting \"may present\" for \"is presenting,\" fundamentally altered how this provision was understood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the pudding is in the legislative archives. We refer particularly to the way in which the provision was discussed during testimony taken in anticipation of the 1984 amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, the House of Representatives was told authoritatively that section 7003 contained \"very broad and general statutory language\" and that the government, \"over the last several years,\" had been advocating \"as broad an interpretation [of it] as possible.\" <i>Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1983: Hearing on S. 757 Before the Subcomm. on Envtl. Pollution of the S. Comm. on Env't and Public Works,</i> 98th Cong. 17, 29 (1983) (statement of Carol Dinkins, Asst. Atty. Gen., Land and Nat. Res. Div., Dep't of Justice). It also learned that the Department of Justice viewed section 7003 as \"loosely worded,\" so that it conveyed \"extraordinary, broad law enforcement powers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110, 120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senate's discussion of section 7003 in the course of considering the 1984 amendments likewise suggests an expansive view of the provision. The Senate Report enthusiastically quotes <i>Price</i> for the proposition that section 7003 is \"intended to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risks posed by toxic wastes.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 59 (quoting <i>Price,</i> 688 F.2d at 214). It went on to observe that the \"primary intent of the provision is to protect human health and the environment.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, there is good reason to believe that Congress, intending to create a provision modeled along the lines of section 7003, understood that section as offering much more than emergency authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history is also at odds with Mallinckrodt's argument that the conventional interpretation of section 7002(a)(1)(B) usurps EPA's policymaking role. In parsing this legislative history, it is important to recognize that Congress, in 1984, was acting against a background finding that there were \"serious gaps\" in RCRA, that EPA's enforcement actions were characterized by \"inadequate effort,\" and that EPA \"ha[d] not been diligent in vigorously pursuing a tough enforcement program.\" H.R.Rep. No. 98-198, pt. 1, at 20 (1983), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5576, 5578-79. Congress had heard, and apparently credited, testimony from a former Assistant Attorney General about \"an astonishing two years of mismanagement at EPA in which the enforcement of the hazardous waste disposal laws suffered greatly.\" <i>Id.,</i> pt. 3, at 6, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5636, 5641. Given this miseen-sc&#232;ne, it seems counterintuitive to suggest that Congress intended to erect an enforcement structure built on exaggerated deference to EPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the legislative history reflects the anticipation that \"courts will accord some deference to [EPA's] technical findings concerning the nature and extent of endangerment.\" S.Rep. No. 98-284, <i>supra,</i> at 56. But we do not think that \"some deference\" means either total obeisance or blind allegiance. Congress desired a \"tough enforcement program\" and found that EPA had not been \"diligent in vigorously pursuing\" one. Citizen suits were meant to fill the resultant void.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unimpressed by Mallinckrodt's citation to language in the House Report to the effect that section 7002(a)(1)(B) was designed to create a \"limited right\" for citizens to sue. H.R.Rep. No. 98-198, <i>supra,</i> pt. 1, at 53, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5612. The very next sentence in that report explains the nature of the limitation, namely, that this \"right can only be exercised if the Administrator (following notice of the intended litigation) fails to file an action under 7003.\" <i>Id.</i> The conventional interpretation of the statute does not in any way offend this directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mallinckrodt spotlights a comment from the floor debate on section 7002, in which the bill's sponsor characterized the provision as giving citizens the power \"to abate the most serious kinds of hazardous waste situations: Those that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment.\" 130 Cong. Rec.2081, 2815 (1984) (statement of Sen. Mitchell). This one remark cannot outweigh the substantial countervailing evidence that the citizen suit provision was intended to empower private citizens by granting them relatively broad authority to litigate when EPA had not acted in the face of a reasonable prospect of serious, near-term harm. <i>See Weinberger v. Rossi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110687\"><a href=\"/opinion/110687/weinberger-v-rossi/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110687\"><a href=\"/opinion/110687/weinberger-v-rossi/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Parties frequently are able to mine nuggets from it selectively, picking and choosing isolated statements that serve particular (sometimes conflicting) ends. Here, the legislative history is less than pellucid. On the whole, however, it tends to support an expansive reading of the \"imminent and substantial endangerment\" standard for liability under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the combination of the word \"may\" with the word \"endanger,\" both of which are probabilistic, leads us to conclude that a reasonable prospect of future harm is adequate to engage the gears of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) so long as the threat is near-term and involves potentially serious harm. The language, structure, purpose, and legislative history of the provision will not comfortably accommodate the more restricted reading that Mallinckrodt espouses. While there may be good and wise reasons to adopt a regime in which EPA determinations of environmental liability are exclusive, it is Congress's place, not ours, to construct such a regime. To this date, Congress has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusion that the conventional interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) is correct, the remainder of the liability inquiry falls neatly into place. None of Mallinckrodt's arguments persuade us that the district court either misconstrued this standard or misapplied it to the facts of this case. While an imminent and substantial endangerment requires a reasonable prospect of a near-term threat of serious potential harm, the court below made supportable findings that suffice to bring this case within the compass of that standard. <i>See, e.g., Me. People's Alliance,</i> 211 F.Supp.2d at 245 (concluding that methylmercury is a \"highly toxic substance\"); <i>id.</i> at 251 (concluding that, in an aquatic system, \"methylation is a continuous process that can go on for decades\"). Based on these and other well-founded findings, the plaintiffs established that the potential risk from mercury is serious and likely to be present here and now. In turn, these findings support a conclusion that, as the district court held, there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the lower Penobscot River. No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE REMEDY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our environmental odyssey is not yet finished. Mallinckrodt contends that the district court committed an abuse of discretion in ordering it to fund a study of the lower Penobscot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is rooted in the notion that a court must balance the relevant harms before granting injunctive relief under an environmental statute &#8212; even if the statute specifically authorizes that type of relief. <i>See United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681032\"><a href=\"/opinion/681032/united-states-v-bethlehem-steel-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span>, 867 (7th Cir.1994). Mallinckrodt would have us achieve this balance by applying the familiar four-part framework for determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief. Under that framework, the injunction-seeker \"must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the [parties], a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\" <i>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145655\"><a href=\"/opinion/145655/ebay-inc-v-mercexchange-ll/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1837</span></a></span>, 1839, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145655\"><a href=\"/opinion/145655/ebay-inc-v-mercexchange-ll/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span> (2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceptually, we agree with Mallinckrodt that a trial court, in an environmental case, should consider the balance of relevant harms before granting injunctive relief, even though the statute itself authorizes such relief. The familiar four-part framework for injunctive relief is a suitable guide in such situations. We caution, however, that the operation of that framework is inevitably colored by the nature of the case and the purposes of the underlying environmental statute (here, RCRA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, Mallinckrodt insists that the district court mishandled the third of the four enumerated elements by failing adequately to account for the onerous hardships that the study would impose and contrast those hardships with the meager benefits that the study might generate. In a nutshell, Mallinckrodt's position is that the study will saddle it with a staggering economic burden &#8212; a burden so open-ended that the overall cost cannot be predicted with any assurance &#8212; yet will yield supposed benefits to the plaintiffs' members that are at best speculative and at worst ephemeral. In this regard, Mallinckrodt stresses that it is an open question whether the lower Penobscot is actually in need of any remediation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One difficulty with Mallinckrodt's position is that it treats this injunction like a garden-variety injunction and, in the bargain, undervalues the extent of the equitable discretion possessed by a district court after a finding of liability under RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B). While Mallinckrodt's hardships are relevant to the acceptability of a RCRA remedy, the argument that hardship must always be outweighed by deliverable benefits offends the logic of <i>Price.</i> Even on Mallinckrodt's restrictive reading of that decision, <i>Price</i> holds that \"Congress sought to invoke the broad and flexible equity powers of the federal courts in instances where hazardous wastes threaten [] human health.\" 688 F.2d at 211.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ironically, Mallinckrodt dresses this argument in the raiment of a defense of judicial prerogatives. It cites <i>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110699\"><a href=\"/opinion/110699/weinberger-v-romero-barcelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 313, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110699\"><a href=\"/opinion/110699/weinberger-v-romero-barcelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span> (1982), for the proposition that judges should not lightly assume that Congress has stripped courts of their equitable discretion. But that is a red herring: while it is true that a district court is not commanded, regardless of the circumstances, to issue an injunction after a finding of liability, the court below was under no misapprehension on this score. In reality, Mallinckrodt wishes to restrict, not preserve, the equitable discretion of the district courts, and the case law that it cites is therefore beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a district courts exercise of its equitable discretion under such circumstances, we think it fully appropriate to acknowledge the statutory scheme under which liability was found. Given the strong statement in <i>Price,</i> embraced by the Senate Report, advocating the exercise of equitable remediation of environmental hazards, we perceive a congressional thumb on the scale in favor of remediation. With this backdrop in place, we are unwilling to say that the district court abused its discretion either by starting with the proposition that its primary concern ought to be how best to remedy a potentially serious near-term environmental hazard or by granting relief notwithstanding the absence of a showing that the remedy's demonstrable benefits exceeded its probable costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that the costs associated with injunctive relief are immaterial; we can imagine circumstances in which the expense entailed in carrying out a particular remedial plan might dwarf the potential benefits to the environment or to human health. Here, however, the anodyne chosen by the district court does not seem so vastly disproportionate to the threatened harm as to warrant, from the vantage point of a cold appellate record, a recalibration of the balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Mallinckrodt has not identified any less burdensome, more cost-effective remedy that the court could have imposed to address the perceived environmental harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Where, as here, a polluter has failed to articulate a \"nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs,\" <i>Hecht Co. v. Bowles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103944\"><a href=\"/opinion/103944/hecht-co-v-bowles/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 329, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span> (1944), a burdensomeness argument rarely will gain much traction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a slightly different tack, Mallinckrodt characterizes the study-plan order as unfair. It should not be forced to pay the entire cost of the study, it complains, because it is not the only entity to have contributed to the pollution of the lower Penobscot. That plaint rings hollow. While Mallinckrodt was not the sole source of mercury contamination, it was a dominant one, so in that sense its claim of inequitable treatment comprises more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, RCRA liability, generally speaking, is joint and several. <i>See Cox,</i> 256 F.3d at 301 n. 37. The joint and several nature of environmental liability makes it fitting to hold a single polluter responsible for the totality of the damage where, as here, the harm is indivisible. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. Once liability has been found, equitable relief in RCRA citizen suits is largely in the informed discretion of the trial court. For aught that appears, the court below did not abuse this discretion in its choice of a condign remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Despite an impressive array of arguments, skillfully presented by extraordinarily able counsel, Mallinckrodt has not persuaded us that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue, that its cramped interpretation of RCRA &#167; 7002(a)(1)(B) is what Congress had in mind, or that the district court acted outside the realm of its discretion in fashioning a remedy for the threatened harm. Consequently, we uphold the district court's rulings in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We use the phrase \"near-term threat\" advisedly.

The critical facts are laid out in the district court's rescript. Even though many of the facts are undisputed, the parties have woven them into widely dissimilar tapestries. On the plaintiffs' telling, Mallinckrodt is an unrepentant polluter, which consistently flouted governmental enforcement efforts and finally wore down the regulators. On Mallinckrodt's telling, the plaintiffs are overzealous environmentalists attempting an end run around the reasoned policymaking of an Executive Branch agency.

This argument focuses on the uncertainty attendant to the study's outcome (for example, the study may find that there is no endangerment or, if endangerment exists, that it cannot be rectified). But even in the absence of a demonstrated need for remediation, the information that the study will provide is adequate redress because it will allow the plaintiffs to tailor their behavior to the actual condition of the lower Penobscot. Consequently, Mallinckrodt's redressability argument is untenable</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Mallinckrodt's other citations-<i>National Lime Ass'n v.
