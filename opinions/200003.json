Plaintiff-appellant Aron\n\nLipman (\"Lipman\") appeals from an order of the district court\n\ndenying    his   motion   to    enforce   and   implement   the   terms   of   a\n\nsettlement agreement.          The underlying action was dismissed after\n\nthe parties represented to the court, on the eve of trial, that\n\ntheir dispute had been settled.           Fresh difficulties arose between\n\nthe parties, however, leading Lipman to move the district court to\n\nhelp implement the terms of the settlement agreement or to order\n\nbinding mediation.        The district court declined to re-open the\n\ncase.     We affirm.\n\nI.           PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n            On April 15, 1996, Lipman instituted an action for\nconversion in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawana County against\nthe Appellee, David Dye (\"Dye\") d/b/a Arms Merchant, Inc.1                 Dye\n\nremoved the action to the United States District Court for the\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania and promptly sought to transfer the\naction to the District of Massachusetts. Dye’s motion for transfer\n\nof venue was granted on March 13, 1997.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Lipman alleged that in April 1994 he entered into an\nagreement with Dye pursuant to which Lipman consigned to Dye 339\nfirearms which had a retail value of $300,000.      Lipman further\nalleged that Dye was to sell the weapons at \"established retail\nprices\" from which Dye would receive a ten percent commission, and\nthat the balance would be remitted to Lipman. According to Lipman,\nDye had neither made payments to him nor returned the consigned\ngoods.    Dye, of course, denied the allegations and brought\ncounterclaims against Lipman for breach of contract and abuse of\nprocess.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          After arriving in Massachusetts in April 1997, the case\n\nlay dormant for several months.    Finally, Dye’s attorney requested\n\nthe district court to hold a scheduling conference to pursue his\ncounterclaims.    In a letter dated September 26, 1997, Dye stated\n\nthat \"[t]he opposing party, Aron Lipman, . . . has failed to pursue\n\nhis claims.    David Dye is the plaintiff in the counterclaim and\nwishes to proceed and pursue this action.\"        A conference was\n\npromptly scheduled and discovery was ordered. A trial date was set\n\nfor October 13, 1998.      On October 5, 1998, Lipman’s attorney\n\nrequested a continuance of the trial date.     A new trial date was\n\nset for November 2, 1998.     Again, Lipman’s attorney requested a\n\ncontinuance.     After a delay of almost a year, trial was set for\n\nSeptember 13, 1999.   For reasons not clear on the record, the trial\ndid not go forward on this date, and the trial was rescheduled for\n\nJanuary 31, 2000.\n\n          Nearly four years after the complaint was filed, on\nJanuary 25, 2000, Lipman's attorney signed a settlement memorandum\n\nwritten by Dye's attorney.    Believing the case to be settled, the\n\ndistrict court promptly issued a Settlement Order of Dismissal, of\n\neven date, reading as follows:\n\n          IT IS ORDERED that this action is hereby dismissed\n          without prejudice to reconsideration and possible re-\n          opening if within 60 days of this order a motion is filed\n          which represents that the terms of the settlement\n          agreement have not been performed and there is good cause\n          for the non-performing party or parties to have failed to\n          perform.\n\n          If no such motion is filed within 60 days of this Order,\n          the case may only be reopened upon a meritorious motion\n          pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Procedure 60, See Pratt v.\n          Philbrook, 109 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                  -3-\n\fAlthough the settlement memorandum had provided that Dye’s attorney\n\nwould prepare a stipulation of dismissal, no such stipulation was\n\nfiled.   Neither the settlement memorandum itself nor any statement\nas to the terms of the settlement was incorporated into the court’s\n\norder or the record.\n\n            Within the sixty days allotted in the court's order,\nLipman filed a \"Motion to Reopen Case or to Enforce Settlement\n\nAgreement.\" In the motion, Lipman represented that the parties had\n\nreached a \"settlement in principle\" on or about January 25, 2000,\n\nbut that the terms of the settlement had not been performed by Dye.\n\nSpecifically, Lipman alleged that Dye had sold $10,000 worth of\n\nfirearms without Lipman’s consent or knowledge, thereby breaching\n\nthe terms of the settlement agreement.           Lipman requested that the\ncourt reopen the case or enforce the terms of the agreement.            Dye,\n\nwhile    acknowledging   the    existence   of   a   settlement   agreement,\n\nopposed the motion, as well as the allegations made therein, and\nrequested an oral hearing.\n\n            On August 28, 2000, the district court held a hearing on\n\nLipman’s above motion.         The parties summarized the argument, in\n\ntheir papers and at the hearing, as a $10,000 dispute in the\n\nsettlement terms.   The court responded to the arguments by stating\n\n\"[i]t seems to me that is a different cause of action.            Sue him if\n\nyou want.\"    When Lipman’s counsel protested, the court reiterated\n\nits position.   \"No, but, I mean, if there was a breach of contract,\n\nthat’s a breach of contract.         It’s a $10,000 case.         Sue him in\n\nSuperior Court or the BMC.       Okay.    I am not going to open the case,\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\freopen it.\"     Thereafter, on the same day, August 28, 2000, the\n\ndistrict judge signed and caused to be entered an order denying\n\nLipman’s motion to reopen the case or to enforce the settlement\nagreement.    Lipman did not file a timely notice of appeal from the\n\ncourt’s August 28, 2000, order nor did he institute an action in\n\nstate court.\n          Seven months later, on April 20, 2001, Lipman again filed\n\na motion, this one called a \"Motion to Enforce and Implement the\n\nTerms of the Settlement Agreement.\" The motion did not mention the\n\n$10,000 discrepancy discussed at the time of Lipman’s prior motion\n\nbut claimed that \"[t]here is a problem with what is to be included\n\nin the Releases, what documents are necessary to transfer the\n\nfirearms at issue and how to make the actual physical transfer of\nsaid firearms.\"      Lipman requested the district court \"to direct in\n\nspecificity    how   to   implement   the   terms   of   the   Settlement   in\n\nPrinciple or order Binding Mediation to achieve the same.\"                  On\nAugust 13, 2001, the court, in a margin order, denied the motion\n\nwithout a hearing.\n\n             Thereafter, Lipman filed in this court what he styled as\n\na petition for writ of mandamus.       On September 10, 2001, this court\n\ndenied the mandamus petition, suggesting that any available remedy\n\nwould be by appeal.        Lipman thereupon filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal from the district court's order of August 13, 2001.             It is\n\nthis notice of appeal that is currently before us.                Lipman has\n\nfiled essentially the same brief in connection with this appeal as\n\nhe did in support of his earlier petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fI.          DISCUSSION\n\n            In the motion denied on August 13, 2001, to which this\n\nappeal pertains, Lipman sought the district court's assistance to\n\nenforce, or have mediated, the original settlement agreement.\n\nLipman did not, as in his earlier motion, seek to reopen the\n\ndismissed action. Nor, indeed, would a request to reopen have been\n\nappropriate absent compliance with the strictures of Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 60(b).    Lipman had taken no appeal from the district court’s\n\nearlier order dated August 28, 2000, refusing, inter alia, to\n\nreopen the case.      Without appeal, the court’s prior Settlement\nOrder of Dismissal became final thus barring any further attempt to\n\nreopen the case in ordinary course.\n            Perhaps recognizing that reopening was no longer an\noption, Lipman did not seek to reopen the case in his August 13,\n\n2001, motion, but rather requested the district court’s help with\nthe enforcement or mediation of the settlement agreement. However,\nsuch assistance goes beyond the district court’s jurisdiction at\n\nthis time.     The Supreme Court has held that enforcement of a\nsettlement agreement, whether through an award of damages or decree\nof specific performance \"is more than just a continuation or\n\nrenewal of the dismissed suit and hence requires its own basis for\njurisdiction.\" Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S.\n\n375, 378 (1994).         Neither party addresses this jurisdictional\n\nbarrier.\n            Subject   matter   jurisdiction   may   be   independent   or\n\nancillary.    Absent an independent basis for federal jurisdiction,\n\n                                   -6-\n\fdismissal-producing settlement agreements are not enforceable in\n\nfederal court unless the district court has ensured its continuing\n\nancillary jurisdiction by making \"the parties’ obligation to comply\nwith    the   settlement       agreement       .   .    .   part    of    the    order    of\n\ndismissal.\"         Id. at 380.      A district court can do so by either\n\nincluding a provision explicitly retaining jurisdiction over the\nsettlement         agreement   or    by   incorporating            the   terms    of     the\n\nsettlement agreement in the court's order.                   Id. at 380-81.        This is\n\nso whether the dismissal is by order of the court pursuant to Rule\n\n41(a)(2)      or    by   stipulation      of   the     parties      pursuant      to   Rule\n\n41(a)(1)(ii).         Id. at 381.\n\n              The Settlement Order of Dismissal entered on January 25,\n\n2000,    purported       to    retain     jurisdiction        over       the    settlement\nagreement for no more than sixty days.                 See Pratt v. Philbrook, 109\n\nF.3d 18, 21 n.5 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that \"[t]he 60-day order\n\nprocedure has developed as a mechanism for the trial courts to\nbring cases to closure while retaining jurisdiction to enforce a\n\nsettlement     agreement       for   a    period       of   time    after      closure    is\nannounced\"); see also Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety\n\nProds., Inc., 183 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 1999).                     The order dismissed\n\nthe case without prejudice \"to reconsideration and possible re-\n\nopening if within sixty days of this order a motion is filed which\n\nrepresents that the terms of the settlement agreement have not been\n\nperformed and there is good cause for the non-performing party or\n\nparties to have failed to perform.\"                     Lipman, in fact, moved to\n\nreopen within 60 days, supra, and the court, after hearing, denied\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fLipman's motion on August 28, 2000. Lipman’s one timely effort to\n\nreopen had thus been denied without appeal long before Lipman\n\nbrought the present April 20, 2001, motion; and of course, the\nsixty days had expired likewise long before that motion.                To put\n\nmatters in a nutshell, by April 20, 2001, the case in question had,\n\nfor some time, been terminated.            The district court itself lacked\njurisdiction to resurrect it.\n\n              Lipman's April 20, 2001, motion from which the present\n\nappeal is taken was, of course, not a complaint instituting a new\n\nlaw suit. But even were it regarded as such, the complaint would\n\nhave failed, as it presented no independent basis for federal court\n\njurisdiction.        While there appears to be diversity of citizenship,\n\nwe find no evidence that the amount in controversy meets the\nfederal jurisdiction requirements. According to Lipman’s April 20,\n\n2001, motion, the dispute concerning the implementation of the\n\nsettlement agreement centered on \"what is to be included in the\nReleases, what documents are necessary to transfer the firearms at\n\nissue   and    how    to   take   actual   physical   transfer   of   the   said\n\nfirearms.\"      Such a dispute is ministerial rather than monetary.\n\nMoreover, even if the present dispute involves a conflict over\n\nmoney, the parties conceded at the hearing on Lipman’s earlier\n\nmotion that no more than $10,000 is at stake..\n\n              In the end, Lipman’s claim appears to be one for a breach\n\nof contract, part of the consideration for which was the dismissal\n\nof an earlier suit.          As the Supreme Court noted \"[n]o federal\n\nstatute makes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbasis for federal-court jurisdiction over the contract dispute.\"\n\nKokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381.    If the parties had wanted the district\n\ncourt to take appropriate steps to retain jurisdiction over the\nenforcement   of   the   settlement    agreement     they   could   have    so\n\nrequested.    They   did   not.       Lipman   can   presumably     bring   an\n\nindependent action for breach of contract in the state courts. See\n\nKinan v. Cohen, 268 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir. 2001); Malave v. Carney\n\nHosp., 170 F.3d 217, 220 (1st Cir. 1999).            The district court’s\n\nAugust 13, 2001, order denying Lipman’s \"Motion to Enforce and\n\nImplement the Terms of the Settlement Agreement\" is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the motion denied on August 13, 2001, to which this appeal pertains, Lipman sought the district court's assistance to enforce, or have mediated, the original settlement agreement. Lipman did not, as in his earlier motion, seek to reopen the dismissed action. Nor, indeed, would a request to reopen have been appropriate absent compliance with the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Lipman had taken no appeal from the district court's earlier order dated August 28, 2000, refusing, <i>inter alia,</i> to reopen the case. Without appeal, the court's prior Settlement Order of Dismissal became final thus barring any further attempt to reopen the case in ordinary course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps recognizing that reopening was no longer an option, Lipman did not seek to reopen the case in his August 13, 2001, motion, but rather requested the district court's help with the enforcement or mediation of the settlement agreement. However, such assistance goes beyond the district court's jurisdiction at this time. The Supreme Court has held that enforcement of a settlement agreement, whether through an award of damages or decree of specific performance \"is more than just a continuation or renewal of the dismissed suit and hence requires its own basis for jurisdiction.\" <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 378, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Neither party addresses this jurisdictional barrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject matter jurisdiction may be independent or ancillary. Absent an independent basis for federal jurisdiction, dismissal-producing settlement agreements are not enforceable in federal court unless the district court has ensured its continuing ancillary jurisdiction by making \"the parties' obligation to comply with the settlement agreement... part of the order of dismissal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380, 114 S.Ct. 1673. A district court can do so by either including a provision explicitly retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the court's order. <i>Id.</i> at 380-81, 114 S.Ct. 1673. This is so whether the dismissal is by order of the court pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) or by stipulation of the parties pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii). <i>Id.</i> at 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Settlement Order of Dismissal entered on January 25, 2000, purported to retain jurisdiction over the settlement agreement for no more than sixty days. <i>See Pratt v. Philbrook,</i> 109 F.3d 18, 21 n. 5 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that \"[t]he 60-day order procedure has developed as a mechanism for the trial courts to bring cases to closure while retaining jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement for a period of time after closure is announced\"); <i>see also Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety Prods., Inc.,</i> 183 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.1999). The order dismissed the case without prejudice \"to reconsideration and possible re-opening if within sixty days of this order a motion is filed which represents that the terms of the settlement agreement have not been performed and there is good cause for the non-performing party or parties to have failed to perform.\" Lipman, in fact, moved to reopen within 60 days, <i>supra,</i> and the court, after hearing, denied Lipman's motion on August 28, 2000. Lipman's one timely effort to reopen had thus been denied without appeal long before Lipman brought the present April 20, 2001, motion; and of course, the sixty days had expired likewise long before that motion. To put matters in a nutshell, by April 20, 2001, the case in question had, for some time, been terminated. The district court itself lacked jurisdiction to resurrect it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lipman's April 20, 2001, motion from which the present appeal is taken was, of course, not a complaint instituting a new law suit. But even were it regarded as such, the complaint would have failed, as it presented no independent basis for federal court jurisdiction. While there appears to be diversity of citizenship, we find no evidence that the amount in controversy meets the federal jurisdiction requirements. According to Lipman's April 20, 2001, motion, the dispute concerning the implementation of the settlement agreement centered on \"what is to be included in the Releases, what documents are necessary to transfer the firearms at issue and how to take actual physical transfer of the said firearms.\" Such a dispute is ministerial rather than monetary. Moreover, even if the present dispute involves a conflict over money, the parties conceded at the hearing on Lipman's earlier motion that no more than $10,000 is at stake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, Lipman's claim appears to be one for a breach of contract, part of the consideration for which was the dismissal of an earlier suit. As the Supreme Court noted \"[n]o federal statute makes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the basis for federal-court jurisdiction over the contract dispute.\" <i>Kokkonen,</i> 511 U.S. at 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673. If the parties had wanted the district court to take appropriate steps to retain jurisdiction over the enforcement of the settlement agreement they could have so requested. They did not. Lipman can presumably bring an independent action for breach of contract in the state courts. <i>See Kinan v. Cohen,</i> 268 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Malave v. Carney Hosp.,</i> 170 F.3d 217, 220 (1st Cir. 1999). The district court's August 13, 2001, order denying Lipman's \"Motion to Enforce and Implement the Terms of the Settlement Agreement\" is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lipman alleged that in April 1994 he entered into an agreement with Dye pursuant to which Lipman consigned to Dye 339 firearms which had a retail value of $300,000. Lipman further alleged that Dye was to sell the weapons at \"established retail prices\" from which Dye would receive a ten percent commission, and that the balance would be remitted to Lipman. According to Lipman, Dye had neither made payments to him nor returned the consigned goods. Dye, of course, denied the allegations and brought counterclaims against Lipman for breach of contract and abuse of process</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The underlying action was dismissed after the parties represented to the court, on the eve of trial, that their dispute had been settled. Fresh difficulties arose between the parties, however, leading Lipman to move the district court to help implement the terms of the settlement agreement or to order binding mediation. The district court declined to re-open the case. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 1996, Lipman instituted an action for conversion in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawana County against the Appellee, David Dye (\"Dye\") d/b/a Arms Merchant, Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Dye removed the action to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and promptly sought to transfer the action to the District of Massachusetts. Dye's motion for transfer of venue was granted on March 13, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After arriving in Massachusetts in April 1997, the case lay dormant for several months. Finally, Dye's attorney requested the district court to hold a scheduling conference to pursue his counterclaims. In a letter dated September 26, 1997, Dye stated that \"[t]he opposing party, Aron Lipman, ... has failed to pursue his claims. David Dye is the plaintiff in the counterclaim and wishes to proceed and pursue this action.\" A conference was promptly scheduled and discovery was ordered. A trial date was set for October 13, 1998. On October 5, 1998, Lipman's attorney requested a continuance of the trial date. A new trial date was set for November 2, 1998. Again, Lipman's attorney requested a continuance. After a delay of almost a year, trial was set for September 13, 1999. For reasons not clear on the record, the trial did not go forward on this date, and the trial was rescheduled for January 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly four years after the complaint was filed, on January 25, 2000, Lipman's attorney signed a settlement memorandum written by Dye's attorney. Believing the case to be settled, the district court promptly issued a Settlement Order of Dismissal, of even date, reading as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IT IS ORDERED that this action is hereby dismissed without prejudice to reconsideration and possible re-opening if within 60 days of this order a motion is filed which represents that the terms of the settlement agreement have not been performed and there is good cause for the non-performing party or parties to have failed to perform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If no such motion is filed within 60 days of this Order, the case may only be reopened upon a meritorious motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Procedure 60, See <i>Pratt v. Philbrook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197254\"><a href=\"/opinion/197254/pratt-v-philbrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the settlement memorandum had provided that Dye's attorney would prepare a stipulation of dismissal, no such stipulation was filed. Neither the settlement memorandum itself nor any statement as to the terms of the settlement was incorporated into the court's order or the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the sixty days allotted in the court's order, Lipman filed a \"Motion to Reopen Case or to Enforce Settlement Agreement.\" In the motion, Lipman represented that the parties had reached a \"settlement in principle\" on or about January 25, 2000, but that the terms of the settlement had not been performed by Dye. Specifically, Lipman alleged that Dye had sold $10,000 worth of firearms without Lipman's consent or knowledge, thereby breaching the terms of the settlement agreement. Lipman requested that the court reopen the case or enforce the terms of the agreement. Dye, while acknowledging the existence of a settlement agreement, opposed the motion, as well as the allegations made therein, and requested an oral hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 28, 2000, the district court held a hearing on Lipman's above motion. The parties summarized the argument, in their papers and at the hearing, as a $10,000 dispute in the settlement terms. The court responded to the arguments by stating \"[i]t seems to me that is a different cause of action. Sue him if you want.\" When Lipman's counsel protested, the court reiterated its position. \"No, but, I mean, if there was a breach of contract, that's a breach of contract. It's a $10,000 case. Sue him in Superior Court or the BMC. Okay. I am not going to open the case, reopen it.\" Thereafter, on the same day, August 28, 2000, the district judge signed and caused to be entered an order denying Lipman's motion to reopen the case or to enforce the settlement agreement. Lipman did not file a timely notice of appeal from the court's August 28, 2000, order nor did he institute an action in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven months later, on April 20, 2001, Lipman again filed a motion, this one called a \"Motion to Enforce and Implement the Terms of the Settlement Agreement.\" The motion did not mention the $10,000 discrepancy discussed at the time of Lipman's prior motion but claimed that \"[t]here is a problem with what is to be included in the Releases, what documents are necessary to transfer the firearms at issue and how to make the actual physical transfer of said firearms.\" Lipman requested the district court \"to direct in specificity how to implement the terms of the Settlement in Principle or order Binding Mediation to achieve the same.\" On August 13, 2001, the court, in a margin order, denied the motion without a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Lipman filed in this court what he styled as a petition for writ of mandamus. On September 10, 2001, this court denied the mandamus petition, suggesting that any available remedy would be by appeal. Lipman thereupon filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court's order of August 13, 2001. It is this notice of appeal that is currently before us. Lipman has filed essentially the same brief in connection with this appeal as he did in support of his earlier petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the motion denied on August 13, 2001, to which this appeal pertains, Lipman sought the district court's assistance to enforce, or have mediated, the original settlement agreement. Lipman did not, as in his earlier motion, seek to reopen the dismissed action. Nor, indeed, would a request to reopen have been appropriate absent compliance with the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Lipman had taken no appeal from the district court's earlier order dated August 28, 2000, refusing, <i>inter alia,</i> to reopen the case.
