Gene Carter, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert J. Ruffner and Vincent, Kantz & Ruffner on brief for\nappellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                       September 13, 2006\n\f                Per   Curiam.      Defendant       Mauricio   Beriguete1   Meran\n\n(\"Beriguete\") appeals from his sentence, imposed on remand from\n\nthis court for resentencing after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220 (2005).       See United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 503-04 (1st\n\nCir.)        (vacating   Beriguete's   95-month       sentence   because   of   a\n\nguidelines calculation error and remanding for resentencing without\n\nreaching his Booker claims), cert. denied, 126 U.S. 466 (2005). In\n\nthis        appeal,   Beriguete   argues    that   the   75-month   sentence2   he\n\nreceived on remand was unreasonably high because the district court\n\nfailed (i) to explain why its use of the 100:1 crack/powder cocaine\n\nratio3 was appropriate in this case and (ii) to take into account\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      According to the Presentence Report, this is the correct\nspelling of defendant's surname, although it was spelled\n\"Berguette\" in most of the filings in the district court, in this\ncourt, and in our decision on defendant's first appeal.\n        2\n      The underlying guidelines calculations, which are not\ndisputed here, were as follows:    the original adjusted offense\nlevel was reduced another two levels, from level 33 to level 31,\nbased on this court's determination that Beriguete was entitled to\nthe safety valve, McLean, 409 F.3d at 503-04, resulting in a\nguideline sentencing range of 108 to 135 months. The sentence was\nthen reduced to 76 months, based on the government's motion for a\ndownward departure for substantial assistance. U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.\nThe ultimate sentence was lowered to 75 months to account for the\ngood-time credit that Beriguete lost while awaiting sentencing\npending his testimony at his codefendants' trial.\n        3\n      Under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c) (Drug Quantity Table), the base\noffense level for crack cocaine (cocaine base) is the same as that\nfor 100 times the same amount of powdered cocaine.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fhis impending deportation.4       For the reasons explained below, we\n\nreject those arguments and affirm the sentence.\n\n            As Beriguete correctly concedes, our decision in United\n\nStates v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 64 (1st Cir. 2006), precludes his\n\nargument, made below, that the district court should disregard the\n\ncrack cocaine sentencing guideline as irrational in light of the\n\nSentencing Commission's (unaccepted) recommendation to Congress\n\nthat a 20:1 ratio apply instead of the 100:1 ratio presently used\n\nin the guidelines.     Nevertheless, he argues that the crack cocaine\n\nguideline   is   not   entitled   to   the   same   weight   as   the   other\n\nguidelines and that, therefore, the sentencing court should not\n\nrely on it without explaining why such reliance is appropriate in\n\na given case.\n\n            Assuming, despite the government's colorable arguments to\n\nthe contrary, that this argument was not forfeited or waived below,\n\nit fails on the merits.     The proposition that the sentencing court\n\nshould give less weight to some guidelines than to others based on\n\npolicy considerations (such as the relative dangerousness of crack\n\nand powdered cocaine) is antithetical to the separation of powers\n\nprinciples underlying Pho, if not to its direct holding.           See Pho,\n\n433 F.3d at 61-63; see also United States v. Caraballo, 447 F.3d\n\n26, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2006) (per curiam).              As we more recently\n\n\n     4\n      Under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), an alien who is convicted of\ncertain crimes, including controlled substances offenses, is\ndeportable.\n\n                                   -3-\n\freiterated, \"A court may sentence below the guidelines because the\n\nguideline sentence appears unreasonable in the 'particular case[],\n\nbut not because of 'general disagreement with broad-based policies\n\nenunciated by Congress . . . .'\"          United States v. Thurston, No.\n\n05-2271, 2006 WL 2065404, at *7 (1st Cir. July 26, 2006).               The\n\ndistrict court therefore did not err in eschewing reliance on the\n\ncrack/powder disparity in crafting an appropriate sentence.\n\n          The   district    court    did    not   expressly   respond   to\n\nBeriguete's second argument--that his status as a deportable alien\n\nwill make his sentence effectively more harsh than a similar\n\nsentence imposed on a non-alien since that status will make him\n\nineligible for placement in a minimum security facility regardless\n\nof his good behavior.      However, one can infer that the judge was\n\nnot persuaded by that argument from his direction that defense\n\ncounsel move on to the next factor.        See United States v. Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc) (permitting\n\nsuch inferences).   The court's implicit rejection of that argument\n\nwas not unreasonable.   See United States v. Guzman, 236 F.3d 830,\n\n834 (2d Cir. 2001) (stating, pre-Booker, that \"the differences in\n\nthe conditions of confinement . . . between deportable aliens and\n\nother . . . defendants . . . are not great\").           Moreover, to the\n\nextent that such differences are attributable to generic policy\n\njudgments as to the increased flight risk posed by aliens facing\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdeportation, id., such policy judgments should not be second-\n\nguessed by sentencing courts for the reasons discussed above.\n\n              After rejecting these arguments (and others not pressed\n\non appeal) for a lower sentence, the district court explained, at\n\nlength, why the 75-month sentence imposed was appropriate in light\n\nof the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).             In particular,\n\nthe court emphasized that the sentence was justified by both the\n\nseriousness of the offense conduct (which it characterized as\n\n\"outrageous\" and \"reprehensible . . . in the extreme\") and the\n\ndanger of harm it created to the safety and well-being of other\n\npeople   in    Maine.    Without   \"minimiz[ing]   in    any    respect    the\n\napplication . . . of other factors listed in [section 3553(a)],\"\n\nthe court also emphasized the need to promote respect for the law\n\nand to provide just punishment for the offense. Finally, the court\n\nappropriately     afforded   \"significant   weight\"     to    the    guideline\n\ncomputations.      See Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.             No further\n\nexplanation was required.\n\n              Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.         See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
