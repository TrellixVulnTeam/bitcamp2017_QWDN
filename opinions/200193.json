Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert Girard on brief pro se.\n     Dennis T. Grieco II and Gidley, Sarli & Marusak, LLP on brief\nfor non-party    appellees   Central   Falls  Detention   Facility\nCorporation, Cornell Corrections of Rhode Island, Inc. and Cornell\nCompanies, Inc.\n\n\n                        November 5, 2002\n\f          Per Curiam.       From August 1995 to February 1996, pro se\n\nplaintiff Girard was an inmate at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention\n\nCenter (\"Wyatt\").     Wyatt is a correctional facility owned by the\n\nCentral Falls Detention Facility (\"CFDF\"), a public corporation\n\ncontrolled by the City of Central Falls, and operated by Cornell\n\nCorrections    of   Rhode   Island   (\"CCRI\"),   a   private   corporation\n\ncontrolled by Cornell Companies, Inc. (\"CCI\"), itself a private\n\ncorporation.   Girard allegedly filed a complaint with the district\n\ncourt against Wyatt on December 4, 1997.             The district court,\n\nhowever, has no record of this complaint, and Girard makes no claim\n\nthat service of process was ever executed with respect to the 1997\n\ncomplaint on Wyatt, CFDF, CCRI, CCI or entities related to them.\n\n          Nothing happened for more than two years, until Girard\n\nwrote to the district court in March 2000 to inquire about the\n\nstatus of his 1997 complaint.        The court informed Girard that it\n\nhad no record of the 1997 complaint, but invited him to refile a\n\n\"new case.\"    He did so on April 18, 2000, paid the filing fee on\n\nApril 24, 2000, and service of process was executed on the warden\n\nof Wyatt on June 1, 2000.        His complaint alleged various civil\n\nrights violations under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985 (2000), and\n\nasked for damages in the amount of $100,000.\n\n          The applicable Rhode Island statute of limitations is\n\nthree years, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14, and (absent tolling) would\n\nhave expired in February 1999. With his re-filed complaint, Girard\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fmade a self-styled \"nunc pro tunc\" motion to treat his 2000 filing\n\nas timely because of the alleged clerical error in mishandling his\n\n1997 complaint.     In support of the motion, he included a copy of\n\nthe certified mail return receipt indicating delivery to the\n\ndistrict court on December 4, 1997.       The district court denied the\n\nmotion \"without prejudice to renew the motion if and when the\n\ndefendants are served and file a motion to dismiss on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds.\"\n\n           CCRI, a self-styled \"non-party\" to the action, made a\n\nRule   12(b)(6)   motion   in   June   2000    to   dismiss   Girard's   2000\n\ncomplaint as untimely. Girard filed objections, apparently relying\n\non the \"without prejudice\" language in the district court's denial\n\nof his nunc pro tunc motion.     The Rule 12(b)(6) motion was referred\n\nto a magistrate judge, who issued a report on February 5, 2001\n\nrecommending dismissal. The magistrate reasoned that the certified\n\nmail return receipt did not show that the mailing actually included\n\na complaint, and, in any case, Girard had abandoned his suit by\n\nfailure to prosecute.       Girard objected to the report, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19 (as it existed prior to\n\nits amendment in July 2001) tolled the statute of limitations for\n\nprisoners.    The    district   court    did   not   address   the   tolling\n\nargument, but sustained Girard's objections, explaining that there\n\nwas a question of fact whether Girard had filed a timely complaint\n\nin 1997.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            On remand to the magistrate judge, Girard moved on March\n\n27, 2001, to amend the complaint to add CFDF, CCRI and CCI as\n\ndefendants, and to increase the amount of damages to $500,000. The\n\nparties sought to be added objected, and again the magistrate judge\n\nissued a memorandum and order on May 7, 2001, denying the motion to\n\namend.   The magistrate judge treated the date of the original\n\nfiling as December 4, 1997, but found that the three-year statute\n\nof limitations had expired before Girard sought to add the new\n\nparties. The magistrate judge then found that the requirements for\n\nrelation back under Rule 15(c)(3) were not met because none of the\n\nproposed defendants had knowledge of the complaint within the time\n\nperiod allowed by Rule 4(m), which is 120 days.    Girard filed his\n\nobjections on May 15, 2001, arguing that the requirements of\n\nRule 4(m) had in fact been satisfied.   The district court accepted\n\nthe magistrate's recommendation denying the motion to amend on June\n\n18, 2001.\n\n             On January 8, 2002, the district court issued a show\n\ncause order, directing Girard to show \"why this case should not be\n\ndismissed for failure to name a legal entity in the complaint.\"   In\n\nresponse, Girard argued that Wyatt is a suable legal entity and\n\nthat, in the interest of justice, he should be allowed to amend his\n\ncomplaint.     On February 11, 2002, the district court entered an\n\norder dismissing the complaint, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          On appeal, Girard continued to press the arguments that\n\nfailed him below: namely (1) that Wyatt is a suable entity, and (2)\n\nthe   requirements   of   Rule   15(c)(3)    were   satisfied.    These\n\ncontentions are without merit.      Wyatt is merely the name of the\n\nbuilding in which Girard was detained, not a suable legal entity.\n\nMoreover, no service of process on a properly suable party was\n\nexecuted until June 2000, well after the allowable time under\n\nRule 4(m) had expired.      Service would be timely executed with\n\nrespect to the 2000 complaint, but there the predicate complaint\n\nitself was out of time.\n\n          In his reply brief on appeal, Girard again argued that\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 19-1-9 would make his attempted amendment timely,\n\nbecause his continuous imprisonment since his stay at Wyatt would\n\ntoll the statute of limitations.            Under both the applicable\n\nstatute and the District of Rhode Island's local rules, however,\n\nGirard must object to the magistrate's report in order to preserve\n\nhis arguments in the district court and on appeal.         28 U.S.C. §\n\n636(b)(1) (2000); D.R.I. Local R. 32(b).       This is so in order that\n\nthe district judge may \"focus attention on those issues--factual\n\nand legal--that are at the heart of the parties' dispute.\"       Thomas\n\nv. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 147 (1985).           Although Girard raised the\n\ntolling argument in objecting to the magistrate judge's February\n\norder, he failed to pursue that argument after the district judge\n\nsustained his objections on other grounds and remanded the matter\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fback to the magistrate judge.   Just like an argument once raised on\n\nappeal but not pressed again on remand or on a subsequent appeal,\n\nthe tolling argument is now forfeited.     Cf. id. at 148 (applying\n\nthe rationale of appellate waivers to the Federal Magistrate Act).\n\n            Our special solicitude toward pro se litigants is not\n\na license for disregarding long established procedural rules.\n\nEagle Eye Fishing Corp. v. United States Dep't of Commerce, 20 F.3d\n\n504, 506 (1st Cir. 1994).     Where (as here in the May 2001 order)\n\nthe magistrate judge failed to notify a pro se plaintiff of the\n\npossibility of forfeiture, we have excused default.   United States\n\nv. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986).         However,\n\nValencia itself makes clear that relief is provided for untimely\n\nobjections, not for arguments that were not raised in the district\n\ncourt at all.   Id. at 5-6.     Here, after the matter was remanded\n\nback to the magistrate judge, Girard never mentioned the tolling\n\nargument again, whether in his motion to amend, his opposition to\n\nthe motion to dismiss, his brief in response to the show cause\n\norder, or his opening brief to this court.      His attempt now to\n\nrevive this argument in his reply brief comes simply too late.\n\nKeeler v. Putnam Fiduciary Trust Co., 238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n          Of course, even forfeited errors are subject to review\n\nfor plain error, but the plain error standard is stringent, United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-35 (1993), and relief in civil\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fcases is exceedingly rare, Chestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc).    Even assuming arguendo that the\n\nRhode Island statute may apply, this case does not involve a\n\nmiscarriage of injustice.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
