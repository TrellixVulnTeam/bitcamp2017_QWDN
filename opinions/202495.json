Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge.\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     William W. Fick and Foley Hoag LLP on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 14, 2006\n\f            SELYA,     Circuit         Judge.         Defendant-appellant       Rafael\n\nTurbides-Leonardo         (Turbides)      pleaded      guilty   to   one     count    of\n\nillegally   reentering          the    United    States    following    an     earlier\n\ndeportation after his conviction for an aggravated felony. In this\n\nsentencing appeal, Turbides attacks both the district court's\n\ncalculation   of     his    guideline         sentencing   range     (GSR)    and    the\n\nreasonableness       of     his       48-month     sentence.         After     careful\n\nperscrutation, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Turbides       is   a     native    and   citizen   of   the     Dominican\n\nRepublic.     In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\ndeported him from the United States following his 1997 felony\n\nconviction in the Puerto Rico courts.                  He illegally reentered the\n\nUnited States sometime between July 2003 and July 2004. On January\n\n31, 2005, the authorities apprehended him as part of an ongoing\n\ninvestigation into drug smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and money\n\nlaundering.    An indictment for illegal reentry followed.                     See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1326.\n\n            Once Turbides pleaded guilty to the charge, a probation\n\nofficer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI Report).\n\nThe PSI Report contemplated a total offense level (TOL) of 21, a\n\ncriminal history category of II, and a GSR of 41-51 months.                          In\n\narriving at the TOL, the probation officer factored in a 16-level\n\nenhancement    pursuant         to     USSG     §2L1.2(b)(1)(A)      (2004).         The\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fenhancement      rested   upon   a   determination   that   Turbides's   1997\n\nconviction, which carried a sentence in excess of 13 months,\n\nconstituted a conviction for a drug trafficking offense within the\n\npurview of the aforementioned sentencing guideline.\n\n              Turbides did not object to this determination, nor did he\n\nprotest any of the other guideline calculations limned in the PSI\n\nReport.      He did, however, beseech the sentencing court to deviate\n\ndownward from the GSR.       The court demurred and imposed a 48-month\n\nincarcerative term.       This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n              In this forum, the appellant calumnizes both the 16-level\n\nenhancement and the overall sentence.          We discuss these claims of\n\nerror sequentially.\n\n                            A.   The Enhancement.\n\n              USSG §2L1.2 directs a 16-level increase in offense level\n\nfor illegal reentry cases \"[i]f the defendant previously was\n\ndeported . . . [after] a conviction for a felony that is . . . a\n\ndrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13\n\nmonths . . . .\"     The commentary to this guideline, set forth in the\n\nmargin,1 defines the term \"drug trafficking offense\" broadly.            The\n\n\n      1\n          The commentary states:\n\n      [A]n offense under federal, state, or local law that\n      prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution,\n      or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit\n      substance) or the possession of a controlled substance\n      (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture,\n\n                                       -3-\n\fPSI Report recommended such an enhancement on the ground that the\n\nappellant   had    committed     the    charged   crime     after       an   earlier\n\n\"conviction for a drug trafficking offense.\"\n\n            In support of that recommendation, the PSI Report stated\n\nthat, in 1997, Turbides, while represented by counsel, had been\n\nconvicted   in    the   Puerto   Rico    Superior   Court    of     a   controlled\n\nsubstance violation.        Although the PSI Report explained that\n\ndetails concerning the prior conviction were not readily available,\n\nit described the underlying offense as a possession with intent to\n\ndistribute violation, which had been reduced to two counts of\n\n\"conspiracy w/intent to dist[ribute] cocaine.\"                 The PSI Report\n\nfurther noted that, on December 15, 1997, the appellant received a\n\nsentence of \"4 years in prison as to each count to be served\n\nconcurrently with each other.\"\n\n            The appellant offered no objection either to the PSI\n\nReport's description of his prior conviction or to its proposed 16-\n\nlevel enhancement.        At sentencing, the district court, again\n\nwithout objection, embraced the PSI Report's characterization of\n\nthe prior conviction as a drug trafficking offense, adopted the\n\nsuggested GSR, and imposed a within-the-range sentence (48 months).\n\n            Before us, the appellant sings a significantly different\n\ntune.   He argues, for the first time, that there was no information\n\n\n     import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n\nUSSG §2L1.2, cmt. (n.1(B)(iv)).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fin the district court record concerning his specific offense\n\nconduct in relation to the 1997 conviction.                       He adds that the\n\nPuerto Rico statute undergirding that conviction encompasses not\n\nonly conduct that would qualify as drug trafficking but also\n\nconduct that would not qualify;2 and that the district court\n\ntreated his prior conviction as a conviction for a drug trafficking\n\noffense without examining either the court documents in the earlier\n\ncase       or    the   elements    of   the   applicable     Puerto   Rico   statute.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, he asserts that, absent an inquiry\n\ninto       the    record   of     conviction,       his   prior   offense    —   though\n\nadmittedly an aggravated felony — could not be deemed a drug\n\ntrafficking offense.            Thus, it should have carried no more than an\n\n8-level enhancement, see USSG §2L1.2(b)(1)(C), which would have\n\nresulted in a GSR of 15-21 months and, presumably, a more lenient\n\nsentence.\n\n                 The appellant concedes that he neither objected to the\n\nPSI Report's guidelines calculations nor favored the lower court\n\nwith the argument that he now stitches together.                      He nonetheless\n\nimplores us to treat the argument as forfeited, not waived, and\n\n\n       2\n      The principal statute of conviction, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24,\n§ 2401, criminalizes not only paradigmatic drug trafficking\noffenses (e.g., distribution, dispersal, and possession with intent\nto distribute of controlled substances) but also actions that are\nless obviously drug trafficking offenses (e.g., concealment of a\ncontrolled substance).    The other statute mentioned in the PSI\nReport, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, § 2406, refers to attempts or\nconspiracies to commit offenses such as those limned in section\n2401.\n\n                                              -5-\n\ftherefore to review it for plain error.               See United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 733-34 (1991) (differentiating between waivers\n\nand forfeitures); United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (same).            The government disagrees; it sees the\n\nappellant's serial failures as a waiver, which would preclude him\n\nfrom raising the argument on appeal.            See Rodriguez, 311 F.3d at\n\n437.3\n\n                There is a powerful case for waiver here.           See D.P.R.R.\n\n132 (stating that objections to a PSI Report must be filed \"within\n\n14 days of its disclosure\" and warning that, absent a finding \"that\n\nthe basis for the objection was not reasonably available prior to\n\nth[at] deadline,\" the affected party \"waives any objection to the\n\n[report] by failing to comply with this rule\").                This rule cries\n\nout     for     enforcement:   a   defendant   who   eschews    a    warrantable\n\nobjection to a conclusion reached in a presentence report lulls\n\nboth the prosecution and the sentencing court into what will prove\n\n\n\n\n        3\n            In Rodriguez, we wrote:\n\n                     A   party  waives   a   right  when   he\n                intentionally relinquishes or abandons it.\n                This is to be distinguished from a situation\n                in which a party fails to make a timely\n                assertion of a right — what courts typically\n                call a \"forfeiture.\"      The difference is\n                critical: a waived issue ordinarily cannot be\n                resurrected on appeal, whereas a forfeited\n                issue may be reviewed for plain error.\n\n311 F.3d at 437 (citations omitted).\n\n                                       -6-\n\fto be a false sense of security if he is later allowed to do an\n\nabout-face.\n\n            This case is a good example: given the appellant's ready\n\nacquiescence in the characterization of his earlier conviction as\n\na drug trafficking offense, few prosecutors would have felt a need\n\nto bring in the original record of conviction and few judges would\n\nhave felt a responsibility to probe the point more deeply.              As we\n\nobserved in United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872-73 (1st Cir.\n\n1993),    \"[a]   defendant   who   accepts    the   probation    department's\n\nconfiguration of the sentencing record without contesting the facts\n\nset forth in the PSI Report can scarcely be heard to complain when\n\nthe sentencing court uses those facts in making its findings.\" All\n\nthings considered, we think that what transpired here amounted to\n\na waiver.\n\n            Even    were     we    to    assume     that   the    appellant's\n\ntergiversation comprised no more than a forfeiture, his late-\n\nblooming argument would not flourish in the hothouse of plain error\n\nreview.     Such review \"entails four showings: (1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceedings.\"       United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).     As we explain below, the appellant cannot carry\n\nthe burden that this standard of review imposes.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f            To put the appellant's claim of error into perspective,\n\nwe must take a step backward.     The Supreme Court has devised a\n\ncategorical approach for determining whether a prior conviction\n\nsubsumes a predicate offense.    See Taylor v. United States, 495\n\nU.S. 575, 600 (1990); see generally Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d\n\n45, 53 (1st Cir. 2006).   The categorical approach consists of two\n\nsteps.   See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602.\n\n            Where a violation of the statute underlying the prior\n\nconviction necessarily involves every element of an enumerated\n\npredicate offense, the mere fact of conviction establishes that the\n\nprior conviction qualifies as a conviction for the predicate\n\noffense.    Where, however, the underlying statute spans, but is\n\nbroader than, the elements of the enumerated offense (i.e., where\n\nthe statute encompasses both conduct that would constitute a\n\npredicate offense and conduct that would not), the prior conviction\n\nqualifies as a conviction for the predicate offense only when \"the\n\njury was actually required to find all of the elements\" of the\n\npredicate   offense.    Id.    This    same   approach   applies,   with\n\nvariations necessitated by context, to cases in which the prior\n\nconviction resulted from a guilty plea rather than a jury verdict.\n\nSee Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 19-20 (2005).\n\n            At the second step of the Taylor analysis, an inquiring\n\ncourt cannot retry the original case but, rather, must restrict its\n\nprobing to the record of conviction.     See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602;\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fConteh, 461 F.3d at 53.    In a tried case, the record of conviction\n\nwill consist mainly of the charging document, jury instructions,\n\nand verdict form; in the guilty plea context, the record of\n\nconviction will consist mainly of the charging document, written\n\nplea agreement, and transcript of the change-of-plea colloquy. See\n\nShepard, 544 U.S. at 26.    In all events, the information used to\n\ncharacterize the putative predicate offense must be \"confined to\n\nthe records of the convicting court.\"        Id. at 23.     Thus, a\n\npresentence report in a subsequent case ordinarily may not be used\n\nto prove the details of the offense conduct that underlies a prior\n\nconviction. See, e.g., United States v. Sanders, 404 F.3d 980, 989\n\n(6th Cir. 2005); United States v. Pimentel-Flores, 339 F.3d 959,\n\n968 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Conteh, 461 F.3d at 59 (applying the\n\nTaylor-Shepard analysis in the immigration context).\n\n          In light of the appellant's agreeable acquiescence in the\n\ncharacterizations and computations contained in the PSI Report, it\n\nis difficult to find any error.        See, e.g., United States v.\n\nArrieta-Buendia, 372 F.3d 953, 955-56 (8th Cir. 2004) (explaining\n\nthat, absent an objection, a PSI Report may be a permissible source\n\nof information about a prior conviction for sentence enhancement\n\npurposes).   Under the circumstances, the district court's approach\n\nseems perfectly reasonable.    And, even were we to assume, for the\n\nsake of argument, that the sentencing court committed clear or\n\nobvious Shepard error, see Shepard, 544 U.S. at 19-20, that would\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fonly get the appellant halfway home: a party asserting plain error\n\nmust carry the devoir of persuasion as to all four elements of the\n\nformulation.    United States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 218 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (en banc); United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 521\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    Here, regardless of how we resolve the first two\n\nelements, the appellant stumbles over the third.\n\n           Under plain error review, the third required showing is\n\nthat the claimed error affected the complaining party's substantial\n\nrights.    See Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60.              The Supreme Court has\n\nexplained that \"in most cases [this phrase] means that the error\n\nmust have been prejudicial: it must have affected the outcome of the\n\ndistrict   court   proceedings.\"        Olano,     507   U.S.   at   734.   This\n\nprejudicial    effect    on   the   outcome   of   the   proceeding    must   be\n\n\"substantial and injurious.\"         United States v. Dominguez Benitez,\n\n542 U.S. 74, 81 (2004) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S.\n\n750, 776 (1946)).       In other words, the complaining party must show\n\n\"a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\"             Padilla, 415\n\nF.3d at 221 (quoting Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 81). This means\n\nthat, in a sentencing appeal, a defendant who presses a forfeited\n\nclaim of error must limn circumstances indicating a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for the error, the district court would have\n\nimposed a different, more favorable sentence.              United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 78 (1st Cir. 2005).            Put another way,\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe \"defendant must . . . satisfy the judgment of the reviewing\n\ncourt, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a\n\ndifferent result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n\noutcome of the proceeding.\"           Id.\n\n              The appellant cannot surmount this hurdle.                His argument,\n\ntaken in its most attractive light, presents us with an unknown\n\nvariable: the contents of the record of the prior conviction.                              He\n\ndoes not claim that this record, if obtained, would show that his\n\nprior offense was other than a drug trafficking offense; he does not\n\nclaim that the record would be either ambiguous or inscrutable as\n\nto this point; and, finally, he nowhere asserts that, factually,\n\nhis   prior    offense   conduct      would    fall      outside    the       guidelines'\n\ndefinition of a drug trafficking offense.                     Rather, he claims only\n\nthat, under the statute of conviction, see supra note 2, his prior\n\noffense   —    about   which    we    know    next       to   nothing     —    would      not\n\nnecessarily encompass all the elements needed to constitute a drug\n\ntrafficking offense under USSG §2L1.2.\n\n              At bottom, then, we are left to guess whether, had a\n\ntimely objection sparked a thorough examination of the record of\n\nconviction, the district court would or would not have found that\n\nthe   prior    conviction      qualified      as     a    conviction      for       a    drug\n\ntrafficking      offense.            With     no     articulation,            let       alone\n\nsubstantiation, of what the record of conviction might reveal, there\n\nis no way for the appellant to show a reasonable probability that\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fhe would be better off from a sentencing standpoint had the district\n\ncourt       not    committed   the    claimed    Shepard   error.     It     follows\n\ninexorably that the appellant has not satisfied the third prong of\n\nthe plain error test.4           See Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373,\n\n394-95      (1999)     (\"Where    the   effect   of   an   alleged   error    is   so\n\nuncertain, a defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that the\n\nerror actually affected his substantial rights.\"); Padilla, 415 F.3d\n\nat 221 (holding that where the defendant could not show a likelihood\n\nthat he was worse off because of the alleged sentencing error, he\n\nperforce could not show that the error affected his substantial\n\nrights).\n\n                                 B.   Reasonableness.\n\n                  The appellant has a fallback position. He maintains that,\n\neven if the district court correctly calculated the GSR, his 48-\n\nmonth sentence is unreasonable.             Relatedly, he suggests that the\n\ndistrict court erred in not explaining why that long a sentence was\n\nwarranted.\n\n                  In United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), the\n\nSupreme Court rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory.                   See id.\n\nat 245.       We review sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines\n\nregime for reasonableness, regardless of whether they fall inside\n\n\n\n        4\n      Since a defendant must carry the devoir of persuasion on all\nfour aspects of plain error review, Padilla, 415 F.3d at 218, this\nfailing renders it unnecessary for us to consider the fourth prong\nof the test.\n\n                                         -12-\n\for outside the applicable GSR. See United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,\n\n440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            We start this aspect of our analysis with a bow to the\n\nstatutory requirement that a sentencing court must \"state in open\n\ncourt the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).             This directive does not mean that the\n\nsentencing court's explanation need be precise to the point of\n\npedantry.     While the court ordinarily should identify the main\n\nfactors upon which it relies, its statement need not be either\n\nlengthy or detailed.          United States v. Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d\n\n54, 58 (1st Cir. 2006).          By the same token, a sentencing court is\n\nnot required to address frontally every argument advanced by the\n\nparties, nor need it dissect every factor made relevant by 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3553   \"one   by   one,    in   some       sort   of   rote   incantation,   when\n\nexplicating its sentencing decision.\"                 United States v. Dixon, 449\n\nF.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006).                 Even silence is not necessarily\n\nfatal; \"a court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what\n\nwas argued by the parties or contained in the presentence report\n\nwith what the judge did.\"           Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.\n\n            Of particular pertinence here, we have recognized that\n\nsentences    that      fall    inside      a    properly     calculated   guideline\n\nsentencing range require a lesser degree of explanation than those\n\nthat fall outside the guideline sentencing range (whether above or\n\nbelow).     United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fAccordingly, a district court's statement of reasons for imposing\n\na within-the-range sentence need not be as cogent as its reasons for\n\nimposing an outside-the-range sentence.         Cf. id. (explaining that\n\n\"the farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines\n\nsentence . . . the more compelling the justification . . . the judge\n\nmust offer\" (citation omitted)).\n\n           This is consistent with pre-Booker practice. In that era,\n\nwhen the guidelines calculations were correct, the sentence imposed\n\nwas within the computed range, and the range encompassed less than\n\na 24-month spread, a sentencing court was not obliged to give any\n\nreasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Mansur-Ramos, 348 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(c)).      After Booker, when those preconditions are\n\nsatisfied a district court arguably is not required to cite any\n\nreasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence.            See Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519 (suggesting that, post-Booker, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(c) remains in full force); see also Booker, 543 U.S. at 258-65\n\n(striking down certain provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act but\n\nleaving section 3553(c) intact). We say \"arguably\" because, in this\n\ncase, we need not answer that interesting question.           For now, it\n\nsuffices that the sentencing transcript and the PSI Report make the\n\ndistrict   court's    rationale   for    the   length   of   the   sentence\n\nsufficiently clear.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f            Beyond a lack of explanation, the appellant's campaign\n\nagainst the reasonableness of his sentence is waged on three fronts.\n\nNone of his forays is persuasive.\n\n            First, the appellant claims that the               district court\n\nviolated the parsimony principle — the statutory directive that\n\nsentences    should    be   no   higher    than   necessary    to    achieve   the\n\nstatutory goals of sentencing.            See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); see also\n\nUnited States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 95 (1st Cir. 2006) (en\n\nbanc).    This claim is baseless.         It will be the rare case in which\n\na within-the-range sentence can be found to transgress the parsimony\n\nprinciple.\n\n            In   all   events,    the     sentencing   court    in    this     case\n\nacknowledged its awareness of the parsimony principle during the\n\ndisposition hearing, stating that it had taken section 3553(a) into\n\naccount in arriving at the 48-month sentence.             On these facts, no\n\nmore is exigible.\n\n            Next, the appellant asserts that the district court failed\n\nto consider several mitigatory arguments that he made at sentencing.\n\nThe record does not bear out this assertion.             At the disposition\n\nhearing, the district court began appropriately by calculating the\n\nGSR.     See United States v. Rivera Rangel, ___ F.3d ___; ___ (1st\n\nCir. 2006) [No. 06-2042, slip op. at 14-15]; Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d at 518.       The court then addressed, albeit briefly, the\n\narguments advanced by the appellant.              We discern no failure of\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fconsideration. After all, with respect to a sentencing court's duty\n\nof explanation, brevity is not to be confused with inattention.\n\n            Finally, the appellant argues that the district court\n\nfailed to appreciate that he posed a reduced risk of recidivism.\n\nIn mounting this self-serving argument, the appellant theorized that\n\nbecause he was an older person (49) who had learned a painful\n\nlesson, he would never again return to the United States for fear\n\nof what might ensue.      While the district court did not address this\n\ntheorem directly, the record permits a commonsense inference that\n\nthe court was unimpressed.\n\n            The     appellant's       illegal   entry     followed   a   recent\n\ndeportation, which indicates that he was aware of some of the\n\npotential     consequences       of   illegal   entry,    yet,   persisted    in\n\nreturning.     On these facts, it suffices that the district court's\n\nunwillingness      to   accept   this    argument   was   both   plausible   and\n\ndefensible.       See Dixon, 449 F.3d at 204; Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\nat 519.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.        For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reject the appellant's assignments of error.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f",

In this sentencing appeal, Turbides attacks both the district court's calculation of his guideline sentencing range (GSR) and the reasonableness of his 48-month sentence. After careful perscrutation, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turbides is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic. In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service deported him from the United States following his 1997 felony conviction in the Puerto Rico courts. He illegally reentered the United States sometime between July 2003 and July 2004. On January 31, 2005, the authorities apprehended him as part of an ongoing investigation into drug smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering. An indictment for illegal reentry followed. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Turbides pleaded guilty to the charge, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI Report). The PSI Report contemplated a total offense level (TOL) of 21, a criminal history category of II, and a GSR of 41-51 months. In arriving at the TOL, the probation officer factored in a 16-level enhancement pursuant to USSG &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2004). The enhancement rested upon a determination that Turbides's 1997 conviction, which carried a sentence in excess of 13 months, constituted a conviction for a drug trafficking offense within the purview of the aforementioned sentencing guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turbides did not object to this determination, nor did he protest any of the other guideline calculations limned in the PSI Report. He did, however, beseech the sentencing court to deviate downward from the GSR. The court demurred and imposed a 48-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this forum, the appellant calumnizes both the 16-level enhancement and the overall sentence. We discuss these claims of error sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Enhancement.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 2L1.2 directs a 16-level increase in offense level for illegal reentry cases \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported . . . [after] a conviction for a felony that is . . . a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. . . .\" The commentary to this guideline, set forth in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> defines the term \"drug trafficking offense\" broadly. The PSI Report recommended such an enhancement on the ground that the appellant had committed the charged crime after an earlier \"conviction for a drug trafficking offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of that recommendation, the PSI Report stated that, in 1997, Turbides, while represented by counsel, had been convicted in the Puerto Rico Superior Court of a controlled substance violation. Although the PSI Report explained that details concerning the prior conviction were not readily available, it described the underlying offense as a possession with intent to distribute violation, which had been reduced to two counts of \"conspiracy w/intent to dist[ribute] cocaine.\" The PSI Report further noted that, on December 15, 1997, the appellant received a sentence of \"4 years in prison as to each count to be served concurrently with each other.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant offered no objection either to the PSI Report's description of his prior conviction or to its proposed 16-level enhancement. At sentencing, the district court, again without objection, embraced the PSI Report's characterization of the prior conviction as a drug trafficking offense, adopted the suggested GSR, and imposed a within-the-range sentence (48 months).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant sings a significantly different tune. He argues, for the first time, that there was no information in the district court record concerning his specific offense conduct in relation to the 1997 conviction. He adds that the Puerto Rico statute undergirding that conviction encompasses not only conduct that would qualify as drug trafficking but also conduct that would not qualify;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and that the district court treated his prior conviction as a conviction for a drug trafficking offense without examining either the court documents in the earlier case or the elements of the applicable Puerto Rico statute. Building on this foundation, he asserts that, absent an inquiry into the record of conviction, his prior offense&#8212;though admittedly an aggravated felony&#8212;could not be deemed a drug trafficking offense. Thus, it should have carried no more than an 8-level enhancement, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), which would have resulted in a GSR of 15-21 months and, presumably, a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant concedes that he neither objected to the PSI Report's guidelines calculations nor favored the lower court with the argument that he now stitches together. He nonetheless implores us to treat the argument as forfeited, not waived, and therefore to review it for plain error. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (differentiating between waivers and forfeitures); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002) (same). The government disagrees; it sees the appellant's serial failures as a waiver, which would preclude him from raising the argument on appeal. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a powerful case for waiver here. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 132 (stating that objections to a PSI Report must be filed \"within 14 days of its disclosure\" and warning that, absent a finding \"that the basis for the objection was not reasonably available prior to th[at] deadline,\" the affected party \"waives any objection to the [report] by failing to comply with this rule\"). This rule cries out for enforcement: a defendant who eschews a warrantable objection to a conclusion reached in a presentence report lulls both the prosecution and the sentencing court into what will prove to be a false sense of security if he is later allowed to do an about-face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a good example: given the appellant's ready acquiescence in the characterization of his earlier conviction as a drug trafficking offense, few prosecutors would have felt a need to bring in the original record of conviction and few judges would have felt a responsibility to probe the point more deeply. As we observed in <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d 864, 872-73 (1st Cir.1993), \"[a] defendant who accepts the probation department's configuration of the sentencing record without contesting the facts set forth in the PSI Report can scarcely be heard to complain when the sentencing court uses those facts in making its findings.\" All things considered, we think that what transpired here amounted to a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume that the appellant's tergiversation comprised no more than a forfeiture, his late-blooming argument would not flourish in the hothouse of plain error review. Such review \"entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). As we explain below, the appellant cannot carry the burden that this standard of review imposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put the appellant's claim of error into perspective, we must take a step backward. The Supreme Court has devised a categorical approach for determining whether a prior conviction subsumes a predicate offense. <i>See Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <i>see generally Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 2006). The categorical approach consists of two steps. <i>See Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a violation of the statute underlying the prior conviction necessarily involves every element of an enumerated predicate offense, the mere fact of conviction establishes that the prior conviction qualifies as a conviction for the predicate offense. Where, however, the underlying statute spans, but is broader than, the elements of the enumerated offense (i.e., where the statute encompasses both conduct that would constitute a predicate offense and conduct that would not), the prior conviction qualifies as a conviction for the predicate offense only when \"the jury was actually required to find all of the elements\" of the predicate offense. <i>Id.</i> This same approach applies, with variations necessitated by context, to cases in which the prior conviction resulted from a guilty plea rather than a jury verdict. <i>See</i> <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 19-20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second step of the <i>Taylor</i> analysis, an inquiring court cannot retry the original case but, rather, must restrict its probing to the record of conviction. <i>See Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <i>Conteh,</i> 461 F.3d at 53. In a tried case, the record of conviction will consist mainly of the charging document, jury instructions, and verdict form; in the guilty plea context, the record of conviction will consist mainly of the charging document, written plea agreement, and transcript of the change-of-plea colloquy. <i>See Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. In all events, the information used to characterize the putative predicate offense must be \"confined to the records of the convicting court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Thus, a presentence report in a subsequent case ordinarily may not be used to prove the details of the offense conduct that underlies a prior conviction. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sanders,</i> 404 F.3d 980, 989 (6th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Pimentel-Flores,</i> 339 F.3d 959, 968 (9th Cir.2003); <i>see also Conteh,</i> 461 F.3d at 59 (applying the <i>Taylor-Shepard</i> analysis in the immigration context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the appellant's agreeable acquiescence in the characterizations and computations contained in the PSI Report, it is difficult to find any error. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Arrieta-Buendia,</i> 372 F.3d 953, 955-56 (8th Cir.2004) (explaining that, absent an objection, a PSI Report may be a permissible source of information about a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes). Under the circumstances, the district court's approach seems perfectly reasonable. And, even were we to assume, for the sake of argument, that the sentencing court committed clear or obvious <i>Shepard</i> error, <i>see Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 19-20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, that would only get the appellant halfway home: a party asserting plain error must carry the devoir of persuasion as to all four elements of the formulation. <i>United States v. Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d 211, 218 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc); <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 521 (1st Cir.2005). Here, regardless of how we resolve the first two elements, the appellant stumbles over the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under plain error review, the third required showing is that the claimed error affected the complaining party's substantial rights. <i>See Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. The Supreme Court has explained that \"in most cases [this phrase] means that the error must have been prejudicial: it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. This prejudicial effect on the outcome of the proceeding must be \"substantial and injurious.\" <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. 74, 81, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (quoting <i>Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). In other words, the complaining party must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 221 (quoting <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 81, 124 S.Ct. 2333). This means that, in a sentencing appeal, a defendant who presses a forfeited claim of error must limn circumstances indicating a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the district court would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 78 (1st Cir.2005). Put another way, the \"defendant must . . . satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant cannot surmount this hurdle. His argument, taken in its most attractive light, presents us with an unknown variable: the contents of the record of the prior conviction. He does not claim that this record, if obtained, would show that his prior offense was other than a drug trafficking offense; he does not claim that the record would be either ambiguous or inscrutable as to this point; and, finally, he nowhere asserts that, factually, his prior offense conduct would fall outside the guidelines' definition of a drug trafficking offense. Rather, he claims only that, under the statute of conviction, <i>see supra</i> note 2, his prior offense&#8212;about which we know next to nothing&#8212;would not <i>necessarily</i> encompass all the elements needed to constitute a drug trafficking offense under USSG &#167; 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, then, we are left to guess whether, had a timely objection sparked a thorough examination of the record of conviction, the district court would or would not have found that the prior conviction qualified as a conviction for a drug trafficking offense. With no articulation, let alone substantiation, of what the record of conviction might reveal, there is no way for the appellant to show a reasonable probability that he would be better off from a sentencing standpoint had the district court not committed the claimed <i>Shepard</i> error. It follows inexorably that the appellant has not satisfied the third prong of the plain error test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Jones v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 373, 394-95, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (\"Where the effect of an alleged error is so uncertain, a defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that the error actually affected his substantial rights.\"); <i>Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 221 (holding that where the defendant could not show a likelihood that he was worse off because of the alleged sentencing error, he perforce could not show that the error affected his substantial rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Reasonableness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position. He maintains that, even if the district court correctly calculated the GSR, his 48-month sentence is unreasonable. Relatedly, he suggests that the district court erred in not explaining why that long a sentence was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory. <i>See id.</i> at 245. We review sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines regime for reasonableness, regardless of whether they fall inside or outside the applicable GSR. <i>See United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start this aspect of our analysis with a bow to the statutory requirement that a sentencing court must \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). This directive does not mean that the sentencing court's explanation need be precise to the point of pedantry. While the court ordinarily should identify the main factors upon which it relies, its statement need not be either lengthy or detailed. <i>United States v. Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> 450 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir.2006). By the same token, a sentencing court is not required to address frontally every argument advanced by the parties, nor need it dissect every factor made relevant by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553 \"one by one, in some sort of rote incantation, when explicating its sentencing decision.\" <i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir.2006). Even silence is not necessarily fatal; \"a court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the presentence report with what the judge did.\" <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of particular pertinence here, we have recognized that sentences that fall inside a properly calculated guideline sentencing range require a lesser degree of explanation than those that fall outside the guideline sentencing range (whether above or below). <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2006). Accordingly, a district court's statement of reasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence need not be as cogent as its reasons for imposing an outside-the-range sentence. <i>Cf. id.</i> (explaining that \"the farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines sentence . . . the more compelling the justification . . . the judge must offer\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is consistent with pre-<i>Booker</i> practice. In that era, when the guidelines calculations were correct, the sentence imposed was within the computed range, and the range encompassed less than a 24-month spread, a sentencing court was not obliged to give <i>any</i> reasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mansur-Ramos,</i> 348 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.2003) (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c)). After <i>Booker,</i> when those preconditions are satisfied a district court arguably is not required to cite any reasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence. <i>See Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519 (suggesting that, post-<i>Booker,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c) remains in full force); <i>see also Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 258-65, 125 S.Ct. 738 (striking down certain provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act but leaving section 3553(c) intact). We say \"arguably\" because, in this case, we need not answer that interesting question. For now, it suffices that the sentencing transcript and the PSI Report make the district court's rationale for the length of the sentence sufficiently clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond a lack of explanation, the appellant's campaign against the reasonableness of his sentence is waged on three fronts. None of his forays is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellant claims that the district court violated the parsimony principle&#8212;the statutory directive that sentences should be no higher than necessary to achieve the statutory goals of sentencing. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a); <i>see also United States v. Scherrer,</i> 444 F.3d 91, 95 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). This claim is baseless. It will be the rare case in which a within-the-range sentence can be found to transgress the parsimony principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the sentencing court in this case acknowledged its awareness of the parsimony principle during the disposition hearing, stating that it had taken section 3553(a) into account in arriving at the 48-month sentence. On these facts, no more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the appellant asserts that the district court failed to consider several mitigatory arguments that he made at sentencing. The record does not bear out this assertion. At the disposition hearing, the district court began appropriately by calculating the GSR. <i>See United States v. Rivera Rangel,</i> 466 F.3d 158, 165 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518. The court then addressed, albeit briefly, the arguments advanced by the appellant. We discern no failure of consideration. After all, with respect to a sentencing court's duty of explanation, brevity is not to be confused with inattention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellant argues that the district court failed to appreciate that he posed a reduced risk of recidivism. In mounting this self-serving argument, the appellant theorized that because he was an older person (49) who had learned a painful lesson, he would never again return to the United States for fear of what might ensue. While the district court did not address this theorem directly, the record permits a commonsense inference that the court was unimpressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's illegal entry followed a recent deportation, which indicates that he was aware of some of the potential consequences of illegal entry, yet, persisted in returning. On these facts, it suffices that the district court's unwillingness to accept this argument was both plausible and defensible. <i>See Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d at 204; <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

In this sentencing appeal, Turbides attacks both the district court's calculation of his guideline sentencing range (GSR) and the reasonableness of his 48-month sentence. After careful perscrutation, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turbides is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic. In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service deported him from the United States following his 1997 felony conviction in the Puerto Rico courts. He illegally reentered the United States sometime between July 2003 and July 2004. On January 31, 2005, the authorities apprehended him as part of an ongoing investigation into drug smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering. An indictment for illegal reentry followed. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Turbides pleaded guilty to the charge, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI Report). The PSI Report contemplated a total offense level (TOL) of 21, a criminal history category of II, and a GSR of 41-51 months. In arriving at the TOL, the probation officer factored in a 16-level enhancement pursuant to USSG &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2004). The enhancement rested upon a determination that Turbides's 1997 conviction, which carried a sentence in excess of 13 months, constituted a conviction for a drug trafficking offense within the purview of the aforementioned sentencing guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turbides did not object to this determination, nor did he protest any of the other guideline calculations limned in the PSI Report. He did, however, beseech the sentencing court to deviate downward from the GSR. The court demurred and imposed a 48-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this forum, the appellant calumnizes both the 16-level enhancement and the overall sentence. We discuss these claims of error sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Enhancement.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 2L1.2 directs a 16-level increase in offense level for illegal reentry cases \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported . . . [after] a conviction for a felony that is . . . a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. . . .\" The commentary to this guideline, set forth in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> defines the term \"drug trafficking offense\" broadly. The PSI Report recommended such an enhancement on the ground that the appellant had committed the charged crime after an earlier \"conviction for a drug trafficking offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of that recommendation, the PSI Report stated that, in 1997, Turbides, while represented by counsel, had been convicted in the Puerto Rico Superior Court of a controlled substance violation. Although the PSI Report explained that details concerning the prior conviction were not readily available, it described the underlying offense as a possession with intent to distribute violation, which had been reduced to two counts of \"conspiracy w/intent to dist[ribute] cocaine.\" The PSI Report further noted that, on December 15, 1997, the appellant received a sentence of \"4 years in prison as to each count to be served concurrently with each other.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant offered no objection either to the PSI Report's description of his prior conviction or to its proposed 16-level enhancement. At sentencing, the district court, again without objection, embraced the PSI Report's characterization of the prior conviction as a drug trafficking offense, adopted the suggested GSR, and imposed a within-the-range sentence (48 months).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant sings a significantly different tune. He argues, for the first time, that there was no information in the district court record concerning his specific offense conduct in relation to the 1997 conviction. He adds that the Puerto Rico statute undergirding that conviction encompasses not only conduct that would qualify as drug trafficking but also conduct that would not qualify;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and that the district court treated his prior conviction as a conviction for a drug trafficking offense without examining either the court documents in the earlier case or the elements of the applicable Puerto Rico statute. Building on this foundation, he asserts that, absent an inquiry into the record of conviction, his prior offense&#8212;though admittedly an aggravated felony&#8212;could not be deemed a drug trafficking offense. Thus, it should have carried no more than an 8-level enhancement, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), which would have resulted in a GSR of 15-21 months and, presumably, a more lenient sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant concedes that he neither objected to the PSI Report's guidelines calculations nor favored the lower court with the argument that he now stitches together. He nonetheless implores us to treat the argument as forfeited, not waived, and therefore to review it for plain error. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 733-34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government disagrees; it sees the appellant's serial failures as a waiver, which would preclude him from raising the argument on appeal. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d at 437.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a powerful case for waiver here. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 132 (stating that objections to a PSI Report must be filed \"within 14 days of its disclosure\" and warning that, absent a finding \"that the basis for the objection was not reasonably available prior to th[at] deadline,\" the affected party \"waives any objection to the [report] by failing to comply with this rule\"). This rule cries out for enforcement: a defendant who eschews a warrantable objection to a conclusion reached in a presentence report lulls both the prosecution and the sentencing court into what will prove to be a false sense of security if he is later allowed to do an about-face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a good example: given the appellant's ready acquiescence in the characterization of his earlier conviction as a drug trafficking offense, few prosecutors would have felt a need to bring in the original record of conviction and few judges would have felt a responsibility to probe the point more deeply. As we observed in <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 872-73 (1st Cir.1993), \"[a] defendant who accepts the probation department's configuration of the sentencing record without contesting the facts set forth in the PSI Report can scarcely be heard to complain when the sentencing court uses those facts in making its findings.\" All things considered, we think that what transpired here amounted to a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume that the appellant's tergiversation comprised no more than a forfeiture, his late-blooming argument would not flourish in the hothouse of plain error review. Such review \"entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). As we explain below, the appellant cannot carry the burden that this standard of review imposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put the appellant's claim of error into perspective, we must take a step backward. The Supreme Court has devised a categorical approach for determining whether a prior conviction subsumes a predicate offense. <i>See Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 600, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Where, however, the underlying statute spans, but is broader than, the elements of the enumerated offense (i.e., where the statute encompasses both conduct that would constitute a predicate offense and conduct that would not), the prior conviction qualifies as a conviction for the predicate offense only when \"the jury was actually required to find all of the elements\" of the predicate offense. <i>Id.</i> This same approach applies, with variations necessitated by context, to cases in which the prior conviction resulted from a guilty plea rather than a jury verdict. <i>See</i> <i>Shepard v.

In a tried case, the record of conviction will consist mainly of the charging document, jury instructions, and verdict form; in the guilty plea context, the record of conviction will consist mainly of the charging document, written plea agreement, and transcript of the change-of-plea colloquy. <i>See Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Arrieta-Buendia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786661\"><a href=\"/opinion/786661/united-states-v-rafael-arrieta-buendia/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 955-56 (8th Cir.2004) (explaining that, absent an objection, a PSI Report may be a permissible source of information about a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes). Under the circumstances, the district court's approach seems perfectly reasonable. And, even were we to assume, for the sake of argument, that the sentencing court committed clear or obvious <i>Shepard</i> error, <i>see Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 19-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, regardless of how we resolve the first two elements, the appellant stumbles over the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under plain error review, the third required showing is that the claimed error affected the complaining party's substantial rights. <i>See Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. The Supreme Court has explained that \"in most cases [this phrase] means that the error must have been prejudicial: it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 734, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In other words, the complaining party must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d at 221 (quoting <i>Dominguez Benitez,</i> 542 U.S. at 81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136986\"><a href=\"/opinion/136986/united-states-v-dominguez-benitez/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2333</span></a></span>). This means that, in a sentencing appeal, a defendant who presses a forfeited claim of error must limn circumstances indicating a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the district court would have imposed a different, more favorable sentence. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.2005). Put another way, the \"defendant must . . . satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant cannot surmount this hurdle. His argument, taken in its most attractive light, presents us with an unknown variable: the contents of the record of the prior conviction. He does not claim that this record, if obtained, would show that his prior offense was other than a drug trafficking offense; he does not claim that the record would be either ambiguous or inscrutable as to this point; and, finally, he nowhere asserts that, factually, his prior offense conduct would fall outside the guidelines' definition of a drug trafficking offense. Rather, he claims only that, under the statute of conviction, <i>see supra</i> note 2, his prior offense&#8212;about which we know next to nothing&#8212;would not <i>necessarily</i> encompass all the elements needed to constitute a drug trafficking offense under USSG &#167; 2L1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, then, we are left to guess whether, had a timely objection sparked a thorough examination of the record of conviction, the district court would or would not have found that the prior conviction qualified as a conviction for a drug trafficking offense. With no articulation, let alone substantiation, of what the record of conviction might reveal, there is no way for the appellant to show a reasonable probability that he would be better off from a sentencing standpoint had the district court not committed the claimed <i>Shepard</i> error. It follows inexorably that the appellant has not satisfied the third prong of the plain error test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Jones v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), the Supreme Court rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory. <i>See id.</i> at 245. We review sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines regime for reasonableness, regardless of whether they fall inside or outside the applicable GSR. <i>See United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start this aspect of our analysis with a bow to the statutory requirement that a sentencing court must \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). This directive does not mean that the sentencing court's explanation need be precise to the point of pedantry. While the court ordinarily should identify the main factors upon which it relies, its statement need not be either lengthy or detailed. <i>United States v. Navedo-Concepci&#243;n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202256\"><a href=\"/opinion/202256/united-states-v-navedo-concepcion/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2006). By the same token, a sentencing court is not required to address frontally every argument advanced by the parties, nor need it dissect every factor made relevant by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553 \"one by one, in some sort of rote incantation, when explicating its sentencing decision.\" <i>United States v. Dixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202231\"><a href=\"/opinion/202231/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.2006). Even silence is not necessarily fatal; \"a court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the presentence report with what the judge did.\" <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of particular pertinence here, we have recognized that sentences that fall inside a properly calculated guideline sentencing range require a lesser degree of explanation than those that fall outside the guideline sentencing range (whether above or below). <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202151\"><a href=\"/opinion/202151/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2006). Accordingly, a district court's statement of reasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence need not be as cogent as its reasons for imposing an outside-the-range sentence. <i>Cf. id.</i> (explaining that \"the farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines sentence . . . the more compelling the justification . . . the judge must offer\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is consistent with pre-<i>Booker</i> practice. In that era, when the guidelines calculations were correct, the sentence imposed was within the computed range, and the range encompassed less than a 24-month spread, a sentencing court was not obliged to give <i>any</i> reasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mansur-Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200710\"><a href=\"/opinion/200710/united-states-v-mansur-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2003) (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c)). After <i>Booker,</i> when those preconditions are satisfied a district court arguably is not required to cite any reasons for imposing a within-the-range sentence. <i>See Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519 (suggesting that, post-<i>Booker,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c) remains in full force); <i>see also Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at 258-65, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span> (striking down certain provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act but leaving section 3553(c) intact). We say \"arguably\" because, in this case, we need not answer that interesting question. For now, it suffices that the sentencing transcript and the PSI Report make the district court's rationale for the length of the sentence sufficiently clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond a lack of explanation, the appellant's campaign against the reasonableness of his sentence is waged on three fronts. None of his forays is persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellant claims that the district court violated the parsimony principle&#8212;the statutory directive that sentences should be no higher than necessary to achieve the statutory goals of sentencing. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a); <i>see also United States v. Scherrer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202150\"><a href=\"/opinion/202150/united-states-v-scherrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). This claim is baseless. It will be the rare case in which a within-the-range sentence can be found to transgress the parsimony principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the sentencing court in this case acknowledged its awareness of the parsimony principle during the disposition hearing, stating that it had taken section 3553(a) into account in arriving at the 48-month sentence. On these facts, no more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the appellant asserts that the district court failed to consider several mitigatory arguments that he made at sentencing. The record does not bear out this assertion. At the disposition hearing, the district court began appropriately by calculating the GSR. <i>See United States v. Rivera Rangel,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span>, 165 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518. The court then addressed, albeit briefly, the arguments advanced by the appellant. We discern no failure of consideration. After all, with respect to a sentencing court's duty of explanation, brevity is not to be confused with inattention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellant argues that the district court failed to appreciate that he posed a reduced risk of recidivism. In mounting this self-serving argument, the appellant theorized that because he was an older person (49) who had learned a painful lesson, he would never again return to the United States for fear of what might ensue. While the district court did not address this theorem directly, the record permits a commonsense inference that the court was unimpressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's illegal entry followed a recent deportation, which indicates that he was aware of some of the potential consequences of illegal entry, yet, persisted in returning. On these facts, it suffices that the district court's unwillingness to accept this argument was both plausible and defensible. <i>See Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d at 204; <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reject the appellant's assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The commentary states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[A]n offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 2L1.2, cmt.
