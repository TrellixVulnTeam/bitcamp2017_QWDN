This case concerns the tragic\n\ndeath of Antonio Vélez-García (\"Vélez\"), an undercover Federal\n\nBureau    of    Investigation     (\"FBI\")      cooperating     witness,    who    was\n\nmurdered by a gang member while assisting the FBI in a criminal\n\ninvestigation       into    Puerto   Rico      gang-related    drug    trafficking\n\ninvolving the use of firearms.\n\n               Vélez's parents, Antonio Vélez-Díaz and Santa García-\n\nHernández,      his   widow,     Yahaira    Fajardo-Correa,      and     his    minor\n\ndaughter, Antonecha Vélez-Fajardo (\"Vélez's relatives\"), brought an\n\naction for money damages in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico against the individual law enforcement\n\nagents with whom Vélez was cooperating at the time of his death --\n\nFBI   agents     Amado     Vega-Irizarry,      Miguel   A.    Marrero,    and    Jane\n\nErickson, and Puerto Rico police officers Víctor M. López and\n\nTeodoro    Lebrón     --    in   their   individual     capacities.        Vélez's\n\nrelatives seek over ten million dollars in damages based on two\n\nprincipal claims for monetary relief: (1) a claim pursuant to\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388\n\n(1971), alleging a violation of the Fifth Amendment; and (2) a\n\nnegligence claim arising under the Puerto Rico Constitution and\n\nPuerto Rico statutory law.\n\n               The United States and the individual defendants now bring\n\nthe present interlocutory appeal challenging the district court's\n\nopinion and order, which denied a motion to substitute the United\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fStates as defendant for the state law claim pursuant to the\n\nWestfall Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2679, and to dismiss the Bivens claim.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n            On or about January 16, 2003, federal agents arrested\n\nVélez for possession of controlled substances and informed him that\n\nhe might serve a long prison sentence for his criminal activity.\n\nVélez told the agents that he did not want to go to prison, and the\n\nagents asked Vélez if he was interested in cooperating with them.\n\nVélez later accepted the offer to cooperate and worked with the FBI\n\nas a cooperating witness for nearly two months until he was killed\n\nin the early morning of March 5, 2003.\n\n            On the evening of March 4, 2003, Vélez was working with\n\nthe   defendant   agents    to   set    up   large-scale    transactions    of\n\ncontrolled substances and/or firearms in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.\n\nThe agents installed a video camera in the van Vélez used for the\n\ntransaction and attached a recording device to Vélez's body. Vélez\n\nremained    in   constant   communication      with   the   agents   via   the\n\nrecording device.    After about four hours of contact with the gang\n\nmembers, including David Gómez-Olmeda, Vélez repeatedly stated\n\nthrough the body-recording device that he was tired and wanted to\n\nleave.     Shortly thereafter, Gómez, without warning, shot Vélez\n\napproximately eight times at close range and killed him.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           In their complaint, plaintiffs aver that Vélez's murder\n\nwas the direct result of the failure of the defendant agents to\n\nfollow unspecified FBI and Puerto Rico police regulations, policies\n\nand   directives   in   the   handling   of   informants   and   witnesses\n\ncooperating with the government. In particular, plaintiffs contend\n\nthat the agents were reckless in failing to protect Vélez, \"because\n\nthey left [Vélez], by himself, far away from themselves.\"           Compl.\n\n¶ 21.    Plaintiffs thus claimed damages pursuant to the Fifth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution as well as Article II,\n\nSections 8 and 10 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico and the Puerto Rico statutory law of negligence, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. Tit. 31, § 5141.1\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n           The individual defendants and the United States moved to\n\ndismiss both the state law and federal constitutional claims. With\n\nrespect to the claims arising under Puerto Rico statutory and\n\nconstitutional law, the United States moved to substitute itself\n\nfor the individual defendants pursuant to Section 6 of the Westfall\n\nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d), by certifying that the defendants were\n\nacting within the scope of their federal employment.         At the same\n\n\n\n1\n  Plaintiffs also made a claim against Puerto Rico police officers\nLópez and Lebrón pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, but that claim was\ndismissed by the district court on the ground that these defendants\nwere acting under color of federal law, rather than state law, as\nfederally deputized agents. That ruling is not at issue in this\ninterlocutory appeal.\n\n                                   -4-\n\ftime, the individual defendants moved to dismiss the federal\n\nconstitutional claim on the grounds that plaintiffs' complaint did\n\nnot state a constitutional violation and, alternatively, that the\n\nofficers were entitled to qualified immunity.        Plaintiffs did not\n\noppose the motion to dismiss.          On March 25, 2004, the district\n\ncourt   issued   an   opinion   and    order   denying   the   motion   for\n\nsubstitution and dismissal.\n\n           The issues before us in this interlocutory appeal are (1)\n\nwhether the district court erred by not substituting the United\n\nStates as the defendant for plaintiffs' damages claim based on\n\nPuerto Rico law, and (2) whether the district court erred in\n\ndenying the individual agents qualified immunity from this Bivens\n\nclaim; this encompasses, as the first part of the immunity test,\n\nwhether a constitutional claim has been stated at all.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.   Westfall Act Substitution\n\n           In the case below, the United States certified that the\n\nindividual defendants were acting within the scope of their federal\n\nemployment and moved to substitute itself for the individual\n\ndefendants pursuant to Section 6 of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2679(d).\n\n           \"Under the Westfall Act, the Attorney General can certify\n\nthat a federal employee named as a defendant in a civil case was\n\n'acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe incident' that serves as the basis for a tort claim against\n\nthat employee.\"     Lyons v. Brown, 158 F.3d 605, 606 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d)(1)).             The Act provides that \"[u]pon\n\ncertification . . . any civil action or proceeding commenced upon\n\nsuch claim in a United States district court shall be deemed an\n\naction against the United States . . . and the United States shall\n\nbe substituted as the party defendant.\"               28 U.S.C. § 2679(d)(1).\n\nWhile certification is sufficient to substitute the United States\n\nas defendant and dismiss the federal employees from the case, the\n\ncertification is \"provisional and subject to judicial review.\"\n\nDavric Me. Corp. v. United States Postal Serv., 238 F.3d 58, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (citing Gutiérrez de Martínez v. Lamagno, 515 U.S.\n\n417, 434 (1995)).         Where plaintiffs are able to show that the\n\nemployees   acted       outside   the   scope    of   their   employment,     the\n\nemployees may be re-substituted as the party defendants.               Davric,\n\n238 F.3d at 65; Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1208 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n            1.    Jurisdiction\n\n            At the threshold, plaintiffs-appellees argue that the\n\nUnited States does not have standing to appeal the district court's\n\ndenial because the United States is not a party to the suit and has\n\nnot   attempted    to    intervene.      We     disagree.     In   addition    to\n\nrecognizing \"an exception to the only a party may appeal rule that\n\nallows a nonparty to appeal the denial of a motion to intervene,\"\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fMicrosystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB, 226 F.3d 35,\n\n40 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), this court\n\nand others have entertained the United States' right to appeal\n\nimmediately from orders denying Westfall Act substitution.                   See,\n\ne.g., Lyons, 158 F.3d at 606-07 (allowing interlocutory appeal of\n\ndistrict court order denying Westfall Act substitution brought by\n\nboth the United States and the individual defendant); Taboas v.\n\nMlynczak, 149 F.3d 576, 579 (7th Cir. 1998) (treating Westfall Act\n\nimmunity in the same fashion as qualified immunity in federal civil\n\nrights    actions,   denials   of    which    are   customarily    subject     to\n\nimmediate interlocutory appeal).\n\n            Plaintiffs also argue that the district court's order\n\ndenying   substitution   is    not   yet     ripe   for   appeal   because    the\n\ngovernment’s certification is not conclusive and plaintiffs require\n\ndiscovery to challenge the certification.\n\n            While we agree that the government's certification is\n\nsubject to judicial review such that the individual agents might be\n\nlater re-instated as defendants in this case, see Davric, 238 F.3d\n\nat 65; Aversa, 99 F.3d at 1208, this does not alter the fact that\n\nthe initial step \"[u]pon certification\" is that \"any civil action\n\nor proceeding commenced . . . in . . . district court shall be\n\ndeemed an action against the United States . . . and the United\n\nStates shall be substituted as the party defendant.\"                 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2679(d)(1).\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          Plaintiffs contend that the word \"shall\" in 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2679(d)(1), is not mandatory, citing Gutiérrez de Martínez, 515\n\nU.S. at 432 n.9, which indicates in a footnote that the term\n\n\"shall\" is sometimes used to mean \"may.\"          This reference by the\n\nSupreme Court, however, merely explains that the certification does\n\nnot \"conclusively establish as correct the substitution of the\n\nUnited States as defendant in place of the employee.\"       Id. at 434.\n\nIn Gutiérrez de Martínez, the Supreme Court, in a divided decision,\n\ndetermined   that   the   Attorney    General's   certification   is   not\n\nconclusive and that district courts may review the certification of\n\nscope of employment in light of plaintiffs' objections.           This is\n\nnot irreconcilable with the process that has been established by\n\nthe courts -- that the United States is initially substituted upon\n\ncertification, and the defendants may be re-substituted later if\n\nthe court determines that they were not acting within the scope of\n\ntheir federal employment.\n\n          Plaintiffs' stated intent to challenge the filing and\n\nservice of a certification in the appropriate form, and their need\n\nfor discovery to mount this challenge are irrelevant to this\n\ninterlocutory appeal.     The United States and individual defendants\n\nchallenge the substance of the district court's denial of the\n\ninitial substitution of the United States upon certification, as\n\nprovided for in § 2679(d)(1).        The possibility that the district\n\ncourt may later determine that a federal employee was acting\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\foutside the scope of his or her employment, contrary to the\n\ngovernment's certification and should be \"re-substituted,\" has no\n\nbearing on the fact that the district court should have initially\n\nsubstituted the United States as defendant \"[u]pon certification.\"\n\nId.\n\n             For these reasons, we find that the United States has\n\nstanding to appeal the denial of Westfall Act substitution along\n\nwith the individual defendants.\n\n             2.   Merits\n\n             The district court denied the motion to substitute the\n\nUnited States on the basis of its conclusion that an exception to\n\nsubstitution applied in this case because the plaintiffs asserted\n\na   Bivens   cause   of    action   under   the   federal   Constitution,   in\n\naddition to the state law claims.           We find that the fact that this\n\ncase raises both state law and federal constitutional claims does\n\nnot render inapplicable the Westfall Act's requirement for the\n\nsubstitution of the United States for the defendants with respect\n\nto the state law claims.\n\n             Section 5 of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2679(b),\n\nprovides that the remedy against the United States under the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for \"personal injury or death\n\narising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission\n\nof any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of\n\nhis office or employment is exclusive of any other civil action or\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fproceeding for money damages by reason of the same subject matter\"\n\nand shall \"preclude[]\" any other damages action \"arising out of or\n\nrelating to the same subject matter.\"             28 U.S.C. § 2679(b)(1)\n\n(emphases added).    The second paragraph of Section 5 then provides\n\ntwo exceptions to the exclusiveness of the remedy and preclusion of\n\nother damage suits, including that \"[p]aragraph (1) does not extend\n\nor apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government\n\n. . . which is brought for a violation of the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States.\"     Id. at § 2679(b)(2).\n\n           This exception for federal constitutional violations,\n\nhowever, applies only to paragraph (1) of Section 5, id. § 2679\n\n(b)(1), and not to the provision for substitution of the United\n\nStates   \"[u]pon   certification   by     the   Attorney   General,\"   which\n\nappears in § 2679(d).    Indeed, courts routinely order Westfall Act\n\nsubstitution of the United States as the defendant for state law\n\nclaims when both state law and federal constitutional damage claims\n\nare asserted against federal employees.           See, e.g., Davric, 238\n\nF.3d at 65 (affirming Westfall Act substitution only as to state\n\nlaw claims where plaintiff also asserted Bivens claims against\n\nfederal employee); Aversa, 99 F.3d at 1206 (same).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f              Thus, we find that the district court's failure to make\n\na partial substitution of the United States as party defendant as\n\nto the state law claims was error.2\n\nB.    Bivens claim\n\n              The individual agents contend that the district court\n\nshould have dismissed plaintiffs' federal Bivens claim against the\n\nagents because the individual agents are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).           We review the denial of\n\na motion to dismiss de novo, assuming plaintiffs' allegations are\n\ntrue    and     making    all     reasonable     inferences     in   favor   of   the\n\nplaintiffs.        See Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n              1.    Jurisdiction\n\n              Before reaching the merits, however, we must consider the\n\nthreshold issue of jurisdiction.                 This court would not normally\n\nhave interlocutory jurisdiction over the district court's denial of\n\nthe    motion      to   dismiss    for   failure   to   state   a    constitutional\n\nviolation because it is not a \"final decision\" in the sense\n\nrequired by 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (conferring appellate jurisdiction\n\nover \"final decisions\" of the district courts).                        This issue,\n\n\n\n2\n  While the United States argued below that the FTCA claim against\nit should be dismissed once the government is substituted as the\ndefendant party, that issue is not before this court.          Our\njurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal extends only to the\ncollateral order denying the United States' request for party\nstatus through substitution.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fhowever, is the first question courts must answer when considering\n\na claim qualified immunity. We will, therefore, address this issue\n\nin our qualified immunity analysis.\n\n           Appellate courts have jurisdiction over interlocutory\n\nappeals from denials of qualified immunity where \"the denial rests\n\non purely legal questions and not on disputed issues of fact.\"\n\nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\"The Supreme Court has held that the denial of a dispositive motion\n\nbottomed on qualified immunity cannot support an interlocutory\n\nappeal if the controlling question is 'whether or not the pretrial\n\nrecord sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.'\"            Camilo-\n\nRobles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Johnson\n\nv. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319-20 (1995)).          However, where the\n\n\"operative question is purely legal in nature,\" the denial of a\n\nproffered qualified immunity defense remains immediately appealable\n\nas a collateral order.    Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (citing Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319); accord Stella v.\n\nKelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           Plaintiffs contend that the individual defendants do not\n\nhave standing to appeal the district court's denial of defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss because the district court found that material\n\nquestions of fact remain on the issue of whether the defendants\n\nshould   be   granted   qualified    immunity.   The   district    court\n\ndetermined that there is a disputed factual issue as to whether\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdefendants' actions were sufficiently reckless to rise to the level\n\nof a constitutional violation and thus declined to grant qualified\n\nimmunity without further fact-finding.\n\n            Defendants appeal the district court's rejection of their\n\nargument that, as a matter of law, the facts alleged by the\n\nplaintiffs cannot amount to a violation of substantive due process\n\nunder   clearly    established    law.      In   other    words,   defendants-\n\nappellants frame the issue of whether plaintiffs have stated a\n\nclaim upon which relief may be granted as a purely legal rather\n\nthan factual issue.        We therefore find that appellate jurisdiction\n\nexists over the qualified immunity issue.\n\n            2.    Merits\n\n            The justification for the qualified immunity doctrine is\n\nthat \"public officials performing discretionary functions should be\n\nfree to act without fear of retributive suits for damages except\n\nwhen they should have understood that particular conduct was\n\nunlawful.\"       Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThus, the Supreme Court has held that qualified immunity \"is an\n\nimmunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\" and \"it\n\nis effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to\n\ntrial.\"    Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).\n\n            Determining whether officials are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity   involves    a    three-part   test.      See    Rivera-Jiménez   v.\n\nPierluisi, 362 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).               First, we must ask:\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f\"'Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the\n\ninjury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a\n\nconstitutional right?'\" Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d\n\n55, 61 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n\n(2001)).      Second,     we    ask   \"'whether    the     right   was   clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation' such that a\n\nreasonable officer would 'be on notice that [his] conduct [was]\n\nunlawful.'\"      Id. (quoting Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office, 298\n\nF.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002)) (brackets in original).               Finally, we\n\nmust determine \"whether a 'reasonable officer, similarly situated,\n\nwould understand that the challenged conduct violated' the clearly\n\nestablished right at issue.\"          Id. (quoting Suboh, 298 F.3d at 90).\n\n           Defendants'     qualified      immunity    defense      was   brought\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in a motion\n\nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.               The\n\nqualified immunity analysis must, therefore, be based solely on the\n\nfacts stated in plaintiffs' complaint.            Riverdale Mills, 392 F.3d\n\nat 61.\n\n           At the threshold, we consider whether the allegations,\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, could support\n\na   conclusion     that   the     individual      agents    violated     Vélez's\n\nconstitutional rights.         At this stage of the inquiry, \"courts must\n\nnot define the relevant constitutional right in overly general\n\nterms, lest they strip the qualified immunity defense of all\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fmeaning.\"       Butera v. District of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 646-50\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639\n\n(1987)).\n\n               Plaintiffs alleged that Vélez's murder was a direct\n\nresult of defendants' failure to follow unspecified FBI and local\n\npolice    regulations     concerning          the   handling       of    informants   and\n\nwitnesses      cooperating   with       the    government.          Thus,      plaintiffs\n\nasserted a Bivens claim alleging a violation of Fifth Amendment\n\nsubstantive due process. Defendants countered that there can be no\n\nDue Process violation when the government fails to protect an\n\nindividual from private violence and, therefore, the Bivens claim\n\nshould    be    dismissed.        The    district          court   acknowledged       that\n\n\"negligent or even wilfully reckless state action will not create\n\na constitutional violation when the government was only causally\n\nconnected to the harm.\"          Vélez-Díaz v. Vega-Irizarry, No. 04-1773,\n\nslip op. at 10 (D.P.R. Mar 25, 2004) (citing Monahan v. Dorchester\n\nCounseling      Ctr.,    Inc.,   961     F.2d       987,    993    (1st    Cir.   1992)).\n\nNevertheless,      the    district       court       concluded          that   plaintiffs\n\nsufficiently pled a violation of substantive due process based on\n\nthe court's view that the agents failed to protect Vélez after\n\ntheir actions and omissions rendered him \"more vulnerable to\n\nperil.\"    Id.\n\n               The Due Process Clause applies only to governmental\n\ndeprivations of life, liberty, or property and thus provides no\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fguarantee of government protection from harms caused by private\n\nparties.     See U.S. Const. amend. V.        (\"No person shall . . . be\n\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\n\nlaw.\").    This court has held that to establish a substantive due\n\nprocess claim plaintiffs must first establish a deprivation of a\n\n\"protected interest\" in life, liberty, or property.             Rivera v.\n\nRhode Island, 402 F.3d 27, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2005); accord Washington\n\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 722 (1997) (finding identification of\n\na fundamental right is a \"threshold requirement\" in establishing a\n\ndue process violation).      In this case, Vélez's relatives allege\n\nthat Vélez was deprived of his life as a result of the agents'\n\ninaction, and Vélez's life is a protected interest.\n\n           Plaintiffs must also show that the deprivation of the\n\nprotected right was caused by government conduct.             It is well-\n\nsettled that the due process provision of the Fifth Amendment\n\nserves as a limitation only on governmental, not private, action.\n\nSee Gerena v. P. R. Legal Servs., Inc., 697 F.2d 447, 449 (1st Cir.\n\n1983) (citing Pub. Utils. Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451, 461\n\n(1952)).   When a government official himself inflicts harm upon an\n\nindividual    or   his   property,     that   action   can   constitute   a\n\ndeprivation of a protected interest if the official's conduct\n\nshocks the conscience.      See Martínez v. Colón, 54 F.3d 980, 986\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"To be sure, violence is attributable to state\n\naction if the perpretrator is acting under color of state law.\");\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fcf. Cummings v. McIntire, 271 F.3d 341, 344-47 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(unnecessary and hard shove with abusive language by officer not\n\nconscience-shocking absent intent to harm). In this case, however,\n\nthe person who shot Vélez was clearly a private actor.\n\n          Nevertheless, in scenarios in which government officials\n\nactively direct or assist private actors in causing harm to an\n\nindividual, some courts have treated the government's involvement\n\nas amounting to government conduct.           For example, \"if the police\n\nhad handed [Gómez] the gun with instruction to shoot [Vélez], cf.\n\nHemphill v. Schott, 141 F.3d 412, 418-19 (2d Cir. 1998), or assured\n\n[Gómez] that he could attack [Vélez] with impunity, cf. Dwares v.\n\nCity of New York, 985 F.2d 94, 96-97 (2d Cir. 1993),\" these actions\n\nmay constitute government conduct.          Rivera, 402 F.3d at 34.        In\n\nsuch scenarios, the government officials and the private actor are\n\nessentially \"joint tortfeasors, and therefore, may incur shared\n\nconstitutional responsibility.\"        Martínez v. Colón, 54 F.3d 980,\n\n985 n.4 (1st Cir. 1995).   However, there is no claim of such joint\n\nenterprise   here.    In   this   case,       plaintiffs   claim    that   the\n\ngovernment involvement was a creation of risk and then a failure to\n\nprotect against that risk.\n\n          Outside    contexts   in    which    the   action   of   government\n\nofficials (or their joint tortfeasors) injure citizens, this court\n\nhas been careful to limit substantive due process to the parameters\n\narticulated by the Supreme Court in DeShaney v. Winnebago County\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fDepartment of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189, 197 (1989).                   There,\n\nthe Supreme Court stated that \"[a]s a general matter . . . a\n\nState's failure to protect an individual against private violence\n\nsimply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\"\n\nId. at 197.\n\n            The DeShaney Court also recognized a limited exception to\n\nthis rule which applies to circumstances in which the government\n\nhas a \"special relationship\" with the individual because government\n\naction has deprived that individual of the liberty needed to\n\nprotect himself.     Id. at 200.   In such situations a constitutional\n\nduty to protect may arise. \"The affirmative duty to protect arises\n\nnot from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament or\n\nfrom its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation\n\nwhich it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.\"                Id.\n\n\"This court has recognized that this [special] relationship, and\n\nthus a constitutional duty, may exist when the individual is\n\nincarcerated or is involuntarily committed to the custody of the\n\nstate.\"   Rivera, 402 F.3d at 34 (citing Monahan, 961 F.2d at 991-\n\n92).\n\n            Plaintiffs in this case, however, have not identified a\n\ncustodial     relationship    between     Vélez    and   the      agents    that\n\nconstitutes    a   \"special   relationship\"       creating   an    affirmative\n\nconstitutional duty to protect.           Vélez was not in custody or\n\ninvoluntarily committed while he was acting as an informant for the\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\ffederal agents, but rather was free to decline to cooperate further\n\nwith the agents at any point.\n\n             In addition to the special \"custodial\" relationships, the\n\nDeShaney Court suggested, but never expressly recognized, the\n\npossibility that liability might arise where the state creates or\n\nsubstantially     contributes       to    the   creation    of     a    danger.\n\nSpecifically, the Supreme Court stated that \"[w]hile the State may\n\nhave been aware of the dangers . . . it played no part in their\n\ncreation, nor did it do anything to render him more vulnerable to\n\nthem.\"     DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201 (emphasis added).\n\n             Most of the circuit courts have now acknowledged that the\n\nexistence of a constitutional violation is possible, on particular\n\nfacts, under a \"state-created danger\" theory of liability.                    See\n\nButera, 235 F.3d at 648-51 (joining other circuits \"in holding\n\nthat, under the State endangerment concept, an individual can\n\nassert a substantive due process right to protection by [state]\n\nfrom third-party violence when [state] officials affirmatively act\n\nto increase or create the danger that ultimately results in the\n\nindividual's harm\"). See, e.g., Kallstrom v. City of Columbus, 136\n\nF.3d 1055, 1066-67 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that the City of\n\nColumbus's release of information from undercover officers' files\n\nto defense counsel, which substantially increased the vulnerability\n\nof   the    officers   to   private      acts   of   vengeance,    created      a\n\nconstitutionally       cognizable     state-created     danger);       Wood    v.\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fOstrander, 879 F.2d 583, 589-90 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that\n\nplaintiff raised a genuine factual dispute whether state trooper\n\ndeprived her of a constitutional liberty interest by abandoning\n\nher, after impounding her vehicle, at night in a high-crime area,\n\nresulting in her rape by a stranger from whom she accepted a ride).\n\n           The Fifth Circuit, however, has flatly rejected the\n\n\"state-created danger\" theory of liability. See Beltrán v. City of\n\nEl Paso, 367 F.3d 299, 307 (5th Cir. 2004).\n\n           \"This court has, to date, discussed the state created\n\ndanger theory, but never found it actionable on the facts alleged.\"\n\nRivera, 402 F.3d at 35 (collecting cases).3\n\n           In determining whether Vélez's relatives have alleged a\n\nsubstantive due process violation, we keep in mind that \"in a state\n\ncreation of risk situation, where the ultimate harm is caused by a\n\nthird   party,   'courts   must   be   careful   to   distinguish   between\n\nconventional     torts   and   constitutional    violations,   as   well   as\n\n\n\n\n3\n    This court recently noted that\n\n      [i]t is not clear from the \"creation of danger\" language\n      in DeShaney whether a state action which enhances or\n      creates danger to an individual would provide a separate\n      exception to the general rule of no duty to protect, or\n      whether the language is simply in service of the special\n      relationship   exception   and   provides   a   set   of\n      circumstances where the state's actions might create a\n      \"special relationship\" and thus a duty to protect.\n\nRivera, 402 F.3d at 35 n.5.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fbetween state inaction and action.\"             Id. at 36 (quoting Soto v.\n\nFlores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1064 (1st Cir. 1997)).\n\n               We hold that plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support\n\na claim based on the state created danger theory.                    Plaintiffs'\n\ntheory may be that the government owes a duty to all cooperating\n\nwitnesses to protect them from harm.           There are risks inherent in\n\nbeing a cooperating witness, but the state does not create those\n\ndangers, others do, and the witness voluntarily assumes those\n\nrisks.    See Summar v. Bennett, 157 F.3d 1054, 1059 & n.2 (6th Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n               We leave open the question whether, nonetheless, the\n\nstate    may    violate    substantive   due   process    as    to   cooperating\n\nwitnesses       if   it   takes   certain    actions,    such   as   sending   a\n\ncooperating witness to what the state knows would be his certain\n\ndeath.     Such action may shock the conscience by demonstrating\n\n\"deliberate indifference.\" See Butera, 235 F.3d at 652. This case\n\ndoes not come close.         There is no allegation the government knew\n\nVélez would be murdered.          At most, the allegation is that Vélez\n\nsaid that he was tired, not that he said he was under imminent\n\nrisk.    The attempt to show a substantive due process violation\n\nbased on a claim that some yet unknown regulation required the\n\nstate to promptly remove \"tired\" cooperating witnesses fails.\n\n               Plaintiffs have therefore failed to carry their burden\n\nunder the threshold inquiry for qualified immunity.                    Absent a\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fshowing that the agents' conduct violated a constitutional right,\n\nqualified immunity applies.\n\n                                III.\n\n          For the reasons stated, the order of the district court\n\nis reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n          Reversed and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f",

V&#233;lez told the agents that he did not want to go to prison, and the agents asked V&#233;lez if he was interested in cooperating with them. V&#233;lez later accepted the offer to cooperate and worked with the FBI as a cooperating witness for nearly two months until he was killed in the early morning of March 5, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of March 4, 2003, V&#233;lez was working with the defendant agents to set up large-scale transactions of controlled substances and/or firearms in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. The agents installed a video camera in the van V&#233;lez used for the transaction and attached a recording device to V&#233;lez's body. V&#233;lez remained in constant communication with the agents via the recording device. After about four hours of contact with the gang members, including David G&#243;mez-Olmeda, V&#233;lez repeatedly stated through the body-recording device that he was tired and wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, G&#243;mez, without warning, shot V&#233;lez approximately eight times at close range and killed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their complaint, plaintiffs aver that V&#233;lez's murder was the direct result of the failure of the defendant agents to follow unspecified FBI and Puerto Rico police regulations, policies and directives in the handling of informants and witnesses cooperating with the government. In particular, plaintiffs contend that the agents were reckless in failing to protect V&#233;lez, \"because they left [V&#233;lez], by himself, far away from themselves.\" Compl. &#182; 21.

At the same time, the individual defendants moved to dismiss the federal constitutional claim on the grounds that plaintiffs' complaint did not state a constitutional violation and, alternatively, that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.

We disagree. In addition to recognizing \"an exception to the only a party may appeal rule that allows a nonparty to appeal the denial of a motion to intervene,\" <i>Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB,</i> 226 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), this court and others have entertained the United States' right to appeal immediately from orders denying Westfall Act substitution. <i>See, e.g., Lyons,</i> 158 F.3d at 606-07 (allowing interlocutory appeal of district court order denying Westfall Act substitution brought by both the United States and the individual defendant); <i>Taboas v. Mlynczak,</i> 149 F.3d 576, 579 (7th Cir.1998) (treating Westfall Act immunity in the same fashion as qualified immunity in federal civil rights actions, denials of which are customarily subject to immediate interlocutory appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the district court's order denying substitution is not yet ripe for appeal because the government's certification is not conclusive and plaintiffs require discovery to challenge the certification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we agree that the government's certification is subject to judicial review such that the individual agents might be later re-instated as defendants in this case, <i>see Davric,</i> 238 F.3d at 65; <i>Aversa,</i> 99 F.3d at 1208, this does not alter the fact that the initial step \"[u]pon certification\" is that \"any civil action or proceeding commenced ... in ... district court <i>shall</i> be deemed an action against the United States ... and the United States <i>shall</i> be substituted as the party defendant.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that the word \"shall\" in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1), is not mandatory, citing <i>Guti&#233;rrez de Mart&#237;nez,</i> 515 U.S. at 432 n. 9, 115 S.Ct. 2227, which indicates in a footnote that the term \"shall\" is sometimes used to mean \"may.\" This reference by the Supreme Court, however, merely explains that the certification does not \"conclusively establish as correct the substitution of the United States as defendant in place of the employee.\" <i>Id.</i> at 434, 115 S.Ct. 2227. In <i>Guti&#233;rrez de Mart&#237;nez,</i> the Supreme Court, in a divided decision, determined that the Attorney General's certification is not conclusive and that district courts may review the certification of scope of employment in light of plaintiffs' objections. This is not irreconcilable with the process that has been established by the courts &#8212; that the United States is initially substituted upon certification, and the defendants may be re-substituted later if the court determines that they were not acting within the scope of their federal employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' stated intent to challenge the filing and service of a certification in the appropriate form, and their need for discovery to mount this challenge are irrelevant to this interlocutory appeal. The United States and individual defendants challenge the substance of the district court's denial of the initial substitution of the United States upon certification, as provided for in &#167; 2679(d)(1). The possibility that the district court may later determine that a federal employee was acting outside the scope of his or her employment, contrary to the government's certification and should be \"re-substituted,\" has no bearing on the fact that the district court should have initially substituted the United States as defendant \"[u]pon certification.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that the United States has standing to appeal the denial of Westfall Act substitution along with the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion to substitute the United States on the basis of its conclusion that an exception to substitution applied in this case because the plaintiffs asserted a <i>Bivens</i> cause of action under the federal Constitution, in addition to the state law claims. We find that the fact that this case raises both state law and federal constitutional claims does not render inapplicable the Westfall Act's requirement for the substitution of the United States for the defendants with respect to the state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5 of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b), provides that the remedy against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for \"personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment is <i>exclusive</i> of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages by reason of the same subject matter\" and shall \"<i>preclude</i> []\" any other damages action \"arising out of or relating to the same subject matter.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b)(1) (emphases added). The second paragraph of Section 5 then provides two exceptions to the exclusiveness of the remedy and preclusion of other damage suits, including that \"[p]aragraph (1) does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government ... which is brought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 2679(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exception for federal constitutional violations, however, applies only to paragraph (1) of Section 5, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2679(b)(1), and not to the provision for substitution of the United States \"[u]pon certification by the Attorney General,\" which appears in &#167; 2679(d). Indeed, courts routinely order Westfall Act substitution of the United States as the defendant for state law claims when both state law and federal constitutional damage claims are asserted against federal employees. <i>See, e.g., Davric,</i> 238 F.3d at 65 (affirming Westfall Act substitution only as to state law claims where plaintiff also asserted <i>Bivens</i> claims against federal employee); <i>Aversa,</i> 99 F.3d at 1206 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we find that the district court's failure to make a partial substitution of the United States as party defendant as to the state law claims was error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Bivens</i> claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual agents contend that the district court should have dismissed plaintiffs' federal <i>Bivens</i> claim against the agents because the individual agents are entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review the denial of a motion to dismiss <i>de novo,</i> assuming plaintiffs' allegations are true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. <i>See Garrett v.

Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching the merits, however, we must consider the threshold issue of jurisdiction. This court would not normally have interlocutory jurisdiction over the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss for failure to state a constitutional violation because it is not a \"final decision\" in the sense required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (conferring appellate jurisdiction over \"final decisions\" of the district courts). This issue, however, is the first question courts must answer when considering a claim qualified immunity. We will, therefore, address this issue in our qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate courts have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from denials of qualified immunity where \"the denial rests on purely legal questions and not on disputed issues of fact.\" <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir.2004). \"The Supreme Court has held that the denial of a dispositive motion bottomed on qualified immunity cannot support an interlocutory appeal if the controlling question is `whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.'\" <i>Camilo-Robles v. Zapata,</i> 175 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995)). However, where the \"operative question is purely legal in nature,\" the denial of a proffered qualified immunity defense remains immediately appealable as a collateral order. <i>Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,</i> 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1998) (citing <i>Johnson,</i> 515 U.S. at 319, 115 S.Ct. 2151); <i>accord Stella v.

The district court determined that there is a disputed factual issue as to whether defendants' actions were sufficiently reckless to rise to the level of a constitutional violation and thus declined to grant qualified immunity without further fact-finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants appeal the district court's rejection of their argument that, as a matter of law, the facts alleged by the plaintiffs cannot amount to a violation of substantive due process under clearly established law. In other words, defendants-appellants frame the issue of whether plaintiffs have stated a claim upon which relief may be granted as a purely legal rather than factual issue. We therefore find that appellate jurisdiction exists over the qualified immunity issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The justification for the qualified immunity doctrine is that \"public officials performing discretionary functions should be free to act without fear of retributive suits for damages except when they should have understood that particular conduct was unlawful.\" <i>Limone v. Condon,</i> 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.2004). Thus, the Supreme Court has held that qualified immunity \"is an <i>immunity from suit</i> rather than a mere defense to liability\" and \"it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\" <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining whether officials are entitled to qualified immunity involves a three-part test. <i>See Rivera-Jim&#233;nez v. Pierluisi,</i> 362 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir.2004). First, we must ask: \"`Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right?'\" <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). Second, we ask \"`whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation' such that a reasonable officer would `be on notice that [his] conduct [was] unlawful.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002)) (brackets in original). Finally, we must determine \"whether a `reasonable officer, similarly situated, would understand that the challenged conduct violated' the clearly established right at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' qualified immunity defense was brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in a motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The qualified immunity analysis must, therefore, be based solely on the facts stated in plaintiffs' complaint. <i>Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, we consider whether the allegations, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, could support a conclusion that the individual agents violated V&#233;lez's constitutional rights. At this stage of the inquiry, \"courts must not define the relevant constitutional right in overly general terms, lest they strip the qualified immunity defense of all meaning.\" <i>Butera v. District of Columbia,</i> 235 F.3d 637, 646-50 (D.C.Cir.2001) (citing <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs alleged that V&#233;lez's murder was a direct result of defendants' failure to follow unspecified FBI and local police regulations concerning the handling of informants and witnesses cooperating with the government. Thus, plaintiffs asserted a <i>Bivens</i> claim alleging a violation of Fifth Amendment substantive due process. Defendants countered that there can be no Due Process violation when the government fails to protect an individual from private violence and, therefore, the <i>Bivens</i> claim should be dismissed. The district court acknowledged that \"negligent or even wilfully reckless state action will not create a constitutional violation when the government was only causally connected to the harm.\" <i>V&#233;lez-D&#237;az v. Vega-Irizarry,</i> No. 04-1773, slip op. at 10 (D.P.R. Mar 25, 2004) (citing <i>Monahan v. Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc.,</i> 961 F.2d 987, 993 (1st Cir.1992)). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that plaintiffs sufficiently pled a violation of substantive due process based on the court's view that the agents failed to protect V&#233;lez after their actions and omissions rendered him \"more vulnerable to peril.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause applies only to governmental deprivations of life, liberty, or property and thus provides no guarantee of government protection from harms caused by private parties. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. V. (\"No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"). This court has held that to establish a substantive due process claim plaintiffs must first establish a deprivation of a \"protected interest\" in life, liberty, or property. <i>Rivera v. Rhode Island,</i> 402 F.3d 27, 33-34 (1st Cir.2005); <i>accord Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 722, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (finding identification of a fundamental right is a \"threshold requirement\" in establishing a due process violation). In this case, V&#233;lez's relatives allege that V&#233;lez was deprived of his life as a result of the agents' inaction, and V&#233;lez's life is a protected interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs must also show that the deprivation of the protected right was caused by government conduct. It is well-settled that the due process provision of the Fifth Amendment serves as a limitation only on governmental, not private, action. <i>See Gerena v. P.R. Legal Servs., Inc.,</i> 697 F.2d 447, 449 (1st Cir.1983) (citing <i>Pub. Utils. Comm'n v. Pollak,</i> 343 U.S. 451, 461, 72 S.Ct. 813, 96 L.Ed. 1068 (1952)). When a government official himself inflicts harm upon an individual or his property, that action can constitute a deprivation of a protected interest if the official's conduct shocks the conscience. <i>See Mart&#237;nez v. Col&#243;n,</i> 54 F.3d 980, 986 (1st Cir.1995) (\"To be sure, violence is attributable to state action if the perpetrator is acting under color of state law.\"); <i>cf. Cummings v. McIntire,</i> 271 F.3d 341, 344-47 (1st Cir.2001) (unnecessary and hard shove with abusive language by officer not conscience-shocking absent intent to harm). In this case, however, the person who shot V&#233;lez was clearly a private actor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in scenarios in which government officials actively direct or assist private actors in causing harm to an individual, some courts have treated the government's involvement as amounting to government conduct. For example, \"if the police had handed [G&#243;mez] the gun with instruction to shoot [V&#233;lez], <i>cf. Hemphill v. Schott,</i> 141 F.3d 412, 418-19 (2d Cir.1998), or assured [G&#243;mez] that he could attack [V&#233;lez] with impunity, <i>cf. Dwares v. City of New York,</i> 985 F.2d 94, 96-97 (2d Cir.1993),\" these actions may constitute government conduct. <i>Rivera,</i> 402 F.3d at 34. In such scenarios, the government officials and the private actor are essentially \"joint tortfeasors, and therefore, may incur shared constitutional responsibility.\" <i>Mart&#237;nez v. Col&#243;n,</i> 54 F.3d 980, 985 n. 4 (1st Cir.1995). However, there is no claim of such joint enterprise here. In this case, plaintiffs claim that the government involvement was a creation of risk and then a failure to protect against that risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Outside contexts in which the action of government officials (or their joint tortfeasors) injure citizens, this court has been careful to limit substantive due process to the parameters articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services,</i> 489 U.S. 189, 197, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). There, the Supreme Court stated that \"[a]s a general matter ... a State's failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>DeShaney</i> Court also recognized a limited exception to this rule which applies to circumstances in which the government has a \"special relationship\" with the individual because government action has deprived that individual of the liberty needed to protect himself. <i>Id.</i> at 200. In such situations a constitutional duty to protect may arise. \"The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.\" <i>Id.</i> \"This court has recognized that this [special] relationship, and thus a constitutional duty, may exist when the individual is incarcerated or is involuntarily committed to the custody of the state.\" <i>Rivera,</i> 402 F.3d at 34 (citing <i>Monahan,</i> 961 F.2d at 991-92).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs in this case, however, have not identified a custodial relationship between V&#233;lez and the agents that constitutes a \"special relationship\" creating an affirmative constitutional duty to protect. V&#233;lez was not in custody or involuntarily committed while he was acting as an informant for the federal agents, but rather was free to decline to cooperate further with the agents at any point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the special \"custodial\" relationships, the <i>DeShaney</i> Court suggested, but never expressly recognized, the possibility that liability might arise where the state creates or substantially contributes to the creation of a danger. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that \"[w]hile the State may have been aware of the dangers ... <i>it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him more vulnerable to them.\" DeShaney,</i> 489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. 998 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the circuit courts have now acknowledged that the existence of a constitutional violation is possible, on particular facts, under a \"state-created danger\" theory of liability. <i>See Butera,</i> 235 F.3d at 648-51 (joining other circuits \"in holding that, under the State endangerment concept, an individual can assert a substantive due process right to protection by [state] from third-party violence when [state] officials affirmatively act to increase or create the danger that ultimately results in the individual's harm\"). <i>See, e.g., Kallstrom v. City of Columbus,</i> 136 F.3d 1055, 1066-67 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that the City of Columbus's release of information from undercover officers' files to defense counsel, which substantially increased the vulnerability of the officers to private acts of vengeance, created a constitutionally cognizable state-created danger); <i>Wood v. Ostrander,</i> 879 F.2d 583, 589-90 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that plaintiff raised a genuine factual dispute whether state trooper deprived her of a constitutional liberty interest by abandoning her, after impounding her vehicle, at night in a high-crime area, resulting in her rape by a stranger from whom she accepted a ride).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit, however, has flatly rejected the \"state-created danger\" theory of liability. <i>See Beltr&#225;n v.

Plaintiffs' theory may be that the government owes a duty to all cooperating witnesses to protect them from harm. There are risks inherent in being a cooperating witness, but the state does not create those dangers, others do, and the witness voluntarily assumes those risks. <i>See Summar v. Bennett,</i> 157 F.3d 1054, 1059 &amp; n. 2 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We leave open the question whether, nonetheless, the state may violate substantive due process as to cooperating witnesses if it takes certain actions, such as sending a cooperating witness to what the state knows would be his certain death. Such action may shock the conscience by demonstrating \"deliberate indifference.\" <i>See Butera,</i> 235 F.3d at 652. This case does not come close.

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about January 16, 2003, federal agents arrested V&#233;lez for possession of controlled substances and informed him that he might serve a long prison sentence for his criminal activity. V&#233;lez told the agents that he did not want to go to prison, and the agents asked V&#233;lez if he was interested in cooperating with them. V&#233;lez later accepted the offer to cooperate and worked with the FBI as a cooperating witness for nearly two months until he was killed in the early morning of March 5, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of March 4, 2003, V&#233;lez was working with the defendant agents to set up large-scale transactions of controlled substances and/or firearms in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. The agents installed a video camera in the van V&#233;lez used for the transaction and attached a recording device to V&#233;lez's body. V&#233;lez remained in constant communication with the agents via the recording device. After about four hours of contact with the gang members, including David G&#243;mez-Olmeda, V&#233;lez repeatedly stated through the body-recording device that he was tired and wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, G&#243;mez, without warning, shot V&#233;lez approximately eight times at close range and killed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their complaint, plaintiffs aver that V&#233;lez's murder was the direct result of the failure of the defendant agents to follow unspecified FBI and Puerto Rico police regulations, policies and directives in the handling of informants and witnesses cooperating with the government. In particular, plaintiffs contend that the agents were reckless in failing to protect V&#233;lez, \"because they left [V&#233;lez], by himself, far away from themselves.\" Compl. &#182; 21. Plaintiffs thus claimed damages pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution as well as Article II, Sections 8 and 10 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico statutory law of negligence, P.R.

With respect to the claims arising under Puerto Rico statutory and constitutional law, the United States moved to substitute itself for the individual defendants pursuant to Section 6 of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d), by certifying that the defendants were acting within the scope of their federal employment. At the same time, the individual defendants moved to dismiss the federal constitutional claim on the grounds that plaintiffs' complaint did not state a constitutional violation and, alternatively, that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Plaintiffs did not oppose the motion to dismiss. On March 25, 2004, the district court issued an opinion and order denying the motion for substitution and dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues before us in this interlocutory appeal are (1) whether the district court erred by not substituting the United States as the defendant for plaintiffs' damages claim based on Puerto Rico law, and (2) whether the district court erred in denying the individual agents qualified immunity from this <i>Bivens</i> claim; this encompasses, as the first part of the immunity test, whether a constitutional claim has been stated at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

In <i>Guti&#233;rrez de Mart&#237;nez,</i> the Supreme Court, in a divided decision, determined that the Attorney General's certification is not conclusive and that district courts may review the certification of scope of employment in light of plaintiffs' objections. This is not irreconcilable with the process that has been established by the courts &#8212; that the United States is initially substituted upon certification, and the defendants may be re-substituted later if the court determines that they were not acting within the scope of their federal employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' stated intent to challenge the filing and service of a certification in the appropriate form, and their need for discovery to mount this challenge are irrelevant to this interlocutory appeal. The United States and individual defendants challenge the substance of the district court's denial of the initial substitution of the United States upon certification, as provided for in &#167; 2679(d)(1). The possibility that the district court may later determine that a federal employee was acting outside the scope of his or her employment, contrary to the government's certification and should be \"re-substituted,\" has no bearing on the fact that the district court should have initially substituted the United States as defendant \"[u]pon certification.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that the United States has standing to appeal the denial of Westfall Act substitution along with the individual defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion to substitute the United States on the basis of its conclusion that an exception to substitution applied in this case because the plaintiffs asserted a <i>Bivens</i> cause of action under the federal Constitution, in addition to the state law claims. We find that the fact that this case raises both state law and federal constitutional claims does not render inapplicable the Westfall Act's requirement for the substitution of the United States for the defendants with respect to the state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5 of the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b), provides that the remedy against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for \"personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment is <i>exclusive</i> of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages by reason of the same subject matter\" and shall \"<i>preclude</i> []\" any other damages action \"arising out of or relating to the same subject matter.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b)(1) (emphases added). The second paragraph of Section 5 then provides two exceptions to the exclusiveness of the remedy and preclusion of other damage suits, including that \"[p]aragraph (1) does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government ... which is brought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 2679(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exception for federal constitutional violations, however, applies only to paragraph (1) of Section 5, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2679(b)(1), and not to the provision for substitution of the United States \"[u]pon certification by the Attorney General,\" which appears in &#167; 2679(d). Indeed, courts routinely order Westfall Act substitution of the United States as the defendant for state law claims when both state law and federal constitutional damage claims are asserted against federal employees. <i>See, e.g., Davric,</i> 238 F.3d at 65 (affirming Westfall Act substitution only as to state law claims where plaintiff also asserted <i>Bivens</i> claims against federal employee); <i>Aversa,</i> 99 F.3d at 1206 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we find that the district court's failure to make a partial substitution of the United States as party defendant as to the state law claims was error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Bivens</i> claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The individual agents contend that the district court should have dismissed plaintiffs' federal <i>Bivens</i> claim against the agents because the individual agents are entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).

This court would not normally have interlocutory jurisdiction over the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss for failure to state a constitutional violation because it is not a \"final decision\" in the sense required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (conferring appellate jurisdiction over \"final decisions\" of the district courts). This issue, however, is the first question courts must answer when considering a claim qualified immunity.
