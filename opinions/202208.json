Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Claudio Aliff Ortiz, with whom Pablo Landrau Pirazzi and\nAldarondo & López Bras were on brief, for appellants.\n     Jorge Martínez-Luciano, with whom Gina Ismalia Gutiérrez-\nGalang, Law Offices Pedro Ortiz Alvarez, Alfredo Acevedo-Cruz,\nand Civil Rights Legal Task Force were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          May 11, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           Plaintiffs and appellants are\n\ntwenty-two   former     temporary   employees       of    the    Municipality      of\n\nAguada, Puerto Rico.      Each held a contract stating that the term of\n\nemployment was effective through June 30, 2001, but also stating\n\nthat the employment was \"by way\" of a particular financial grant (a\n\n\"Law 52\" grant, explained further below) that the Municipality had\n\nreceived from the Commonwealth.             Funding under that grant was\n\nexhausted on December 31, 2000, and the Municipality, under a new\n\nMayor, terminated plaintiffs' contracts one month later on the\n\nbasis of lack of Law 52 funding.\n\n            Plaintiffs sued the Municipality and individual municipal\n\nofficers (in their official and personal capacities) under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 on two federal claims and related state claims.                    They\n\nalleged    that   the   termination    of    their       contracts      before    the\n\nexpiration dates, without a pretermination hearing, violated their\n\nprocedural due process rights under the U. S. Constitution.                      They\n\nalso alleged that their contracts were terminated because they\n\nbelonged to a different political party, the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP), than the newly elected Popular Democratic Party (PDP) mayor\n\nof   the   Municipality     in   violation     of    the        First   Amendment.\n\nPlaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, back pay,\n\nfront pay, economic and punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment\n\ninterest, and other relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          At trial on June 16, 2003, after the close of plaintiffs'\n\nevidence, the district court granted judgment under Rule 50, Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P., for defendants on the procedural due process claim.\n\nThe court held that the plaintiffs had no property interest in\n\nfurther employment inasmuch as the program in which they were\n\nemployed depended upon receipt of the Law 52 funding from the\n\nCommonwealth which had expired on December 31, 2000.       The jury\n\nconsidered the First Amendment claim and returned a verdict for\n\ndefendants.\n\n          On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge both the Rule 50\n\nprocedural due process ruling and the denial of a motion for\n\nmistrial based on a nearly three-month delay in the middle of the\n\ntrial proceedings.   They do not challenge the jury verdict.   As to\n\nthe denial of the motion for mistrial, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion and affirm.    As to the procedural due process claim,\n\nhowever, we vacate and remand for further consideration.\n\n                                I.\n\n          The Commonwealth established the Law 52 program more than\n\ntwenty-five years ago.   Under the program, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n29, § 711c, Puerto Rico \"subsidize[s] locally managed programs to\n\nameliorate unemployment.\" Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez, 344 F.3d 103,\n\n107 (1st Cir. 2003).     Municipalities do not have an automatic\n\nentitlement to Law 52 grants: a municipality must submit a proposal\n\ndescribing how it will use the money; such proposals must be\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fapproved by the Commonwealth's Department of Labor and Human\n\nResources (DLHR).     Id.    Once a grant is approved, the Commonwealth\n\nand the municipality sign a contract specifying how much money the\n\nmunicipality will receive, over what term, and how many jobs it\n\nwill   subsidize.      The    various     Law    52   contracts     between    the\n\nMunicipality of Aguada and the DLHR contained standard clauses\n\nstating that the Municipality \"commit[ted] itself to create\" the\n\nnumber of jobs specified, and that \"[u]nder no circumstances will\n\nit be construed that people hired [by virtue of the Law 52\n\ncontract] are or act as employees of the [DLHR].\"\n\n           On July 1, 2000, a new Law 52 agreement (\"the Law 52\n\ncontract\") between the Municipality and the DLHR took effect.\n\nUnder the contract's provisions, the DLHR awarded the Municipality\n\n$295,908   to   pay   the    salaries    and    benefits   of    the    forty-five\n\nemployees through December 31, 2000.            The Law 52 contract required\n\nthe Municipality to keep the Law 52 funds separate from other\n\nmunicipal funds.\n\n           The plaintiffs are among the forty-five workers hired by\n\nthe Municipality in connection with this Law 52 grant.                    Between\n\nJune 20 and September 1, 2000, each of the plaintiffs received\n\nletters (\"the hiring letters\") signed by then-Mayor Julio César\n\nRomán,   appointing    them    to   various      municipal      jobs,   including\n\ncarpentry and labor positions. The stated starting dates for these\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fjobs       ranged   from    July   1   to   September   6,   2000.   The   stated\n\ntermination date for each job was the same: June 30, 2001.\n\n               Mayor Román was a member of the NPP, as is each of the\n\nplaintiffs.         It is noteworthy that the Mayor's letter used an\n\nemployment date for the plaintiffs through June 2001, despite the\n\nfact the Law 52 funding lasted only through December 2000, and that\n\nhe did so in the face of an upcoming municipal election in which\n\ncontrol of the municipal government might switch to the opposing\n\npolitical party.           Defendants rely on this to argue that the Mayor\n\nacted ultra vires in using a termination date of June 30.\n\n               The hiring letters signed by Mayor Román varied only\n\nslightly in their terms.           A typical letter, such as the one sent to\n\nplaintiff José Méndez Valle, stated:\n\n               Allow me by these means [to] appoint you to\n               hold the post of Laborer by way of the Labor\n               Department   Proposal1 for   this  Municipal\n               Administration.\n\n               The same shall be effective September 6, 2000\n               until June 30, 2001. You shall earn a monthly\n               salary of $837.00.\n\n               As of the autumn of 2000, then, the twenty-two plaintiffs\n\nwere all employed by the Municipality and receiving salaries paid\n\nout of Law 52 funds.          On November 7, 2000, elections were held in\n\nAguada, and a new mayor, defendant Miguel Ruiz-Hernández of the\n\n\n\n       1\n       It is clear that \"the Labor Department Proposal\" is a\nreference to the Municipality's request for Law 52 funding from the\nDLHR.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fPDP, was elected.   The twenty-two plaintiffs had supported the new\n\nMayor's opponent in the mayoral race.2\n\n           Mayor Ruiz-Hernández was sworn into office on January 9,\n\n2001.    By this time, the funding provided by the Law 52 contract\n\nhad expired.    The Municipality nonetheless continued plaintiffs'\n\nemployment through the month of January, paying their salaries out\n\nof municipal funds.   On January 31, however, Mayor Ruiz-Hernández\n\nsent letters to the plaintiffs (\"the firing letters\") informing\n\nthem that the Law 52 funds had expired a month earlier and that\n\ntheir jobs were therefore being terminated.      A typical firing\n\nletter, this one addressed to plaintiff Edwin Acevedo Acevedo, read\n\nas follows:\n\n           I hereby inform you that your work contract\n           through the Proposal of the Department of\n           Labor and Human Resources (Law 52) expired on\n           December    31,   2000.       The    previous\n           administration failed in not informing you\n           that your contract expired and that your\n           functions ceased on the aforementioned date.\n\n           We do not have the funds that the Department\n           of Labor and Human Resources provided for\n           these contracts.    That is why we have to\n           dispense with your services.   We regret the\n           inconveniences this may cause you.\n\nAll of the plaintiffs' jobs were terminated on January 31; none of\n\nthe plaintiffs were granted a pre-termination hearing, although\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The opponent was not Mayor Román; he had not run for\nreelection.\n\n                                -6-\n\feach had notice (via the firing letters) that the stated reason for\n\ntermination was the expiration of Law 52 funding.\n\n            On February 12, 2001, less than two weeks later, the\n\nMunicipality and the DLHR entered into a new Law 52 contract, which\n\nprovided funding for forty positions from February 16 through June\n\n30, 2001.      None of the plaintiffs were offered any of the jobs\n\ncreated by these funds, despite the fact that defendant Glenda\n\nPeña-Muñoz, the new municipal human resources director appointed by\n\nMayor Ruiz-Hernández, had promised them they would be recalled when\n\nnew Law 52 funds were procured.\n\n            The plaintiffs filed suit on April 12, 2001, against the\n\nMunicipality, Mayor Ruiz-Hernández, and Human Resources Director\n\nPeña-Muñoz.3    In response to plaintiffs' political discrimination\n\nclaim, defendants countered that the terminations had nothing to do\n\nwith political animus, but were instead inevitable and proper given\n\nthe cessation of Law 52 funding.         And as to the procedural due\n\nprocess claim, defendants argued that Mayor Román had had no\n\nauthority to offer the plaintiffs contracts that outlasted the Law\n\n52   funding;   thus   the   contracts   were   void   as   to   a   June   30\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       Plaintiffs also sued municipal Director of Public Works\nAníbal Mendoza, but the district court dismissed Mendoza from the\ncase prior to the verdict, and plaintiffs do not appeal as to him.\nThe defendants filed a third-party complaint against former Mayor\nRomán; this complaint likewise was dismissed by the district court,\nand Mayor Román is not a party on appeal.\n\n                                   -7-\n\ftermination date, and no pre-termination hearing was required under\n\nthe Due Process Clause.4\n\n           Jury    trial       began    on    March   19,   2003.      On   April   4,\n\nplaintiffs rested.           Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw   pursuant    to    Fed.    R.     Civ.   P.   50(a)    as   to   the   political\n\ndiscrimination and procedural due process claims.                       On June 16,\n\n2003, during an extended hiatus in the trial (discussed further\n\nbelow), the district court entered judgment for the defendants on\n\nthe   procedural       due    process    claim     but     allowed    the   political\n\ndiscrimination claim to proceed.                Trial resumed on July 1 on the\n\nplaintiffs' remaining claims and the jury rejected the political\n\ndiscrimination claim on July 18.5\n\n\n      4\n      Defendants also argued, in the district court and on appeal,\nthat some of the Municipality's Law 52 employees had not just a\nhiring letter in their personnel files, but also a second letter\nfrom Mayor Román, identical to the first except for the fact that\nit stated a term of employment through December 31, 2000.\nDefendants imply that Mayor Román knew he had to shorten\nplaintiffs' terms of employment, that he took steps to do so, but\nthat he reversed course after his party lost the election, either\nby removing the second letter from the plaintiffs' files or by\ninserting a third letter with identical terms to the first.\nDefendants point to a smattering of evidence in the record that\nlends support to this idea. The district court did not mention\nthis evidence in granting judgment on the due process claims.\n      5\n       As to the negligence issue, the jury found for the\nplaintiffs only against the Municipality itself, not defendants\nMayor Ruiz-Hernández and Peña-Muñoz.     On August 12, 2003, the\nMunicipality moved for post-trial judgment as a matter of law\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). It argued that since plaintiffs\nhad centered their negligence claim on the actions of Mayor Ruiz-\nHernández and Peña-Muñoz, and since the jury had found both not\nliable, the Municipality itself could not be liable either. In a\nDecember 19, 2003 order, the district court agreed and entered\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                                 II.\n\nA.        Denial of Mistrial Based on The Trial Delay\n\n          Plaintiffs argue the district court erred in not granting\n\ntheir motion for mistrial.\n\n          On April 4, 2003, the day the plaintiffs rested, the\n\ndistrict court authorized the jury forewoman to take a previously\n\nscheduled vacation from April 11 through April 27 and halted the\n\ntrial pending her return.      None of the parties objected to this\n\ncontinuance, despite having had the chance to do so both on April\n\n4 and at sidebar on April 2.\n\n          On April 24, the district court announced a date for\n\nresumption of the trial, noting that it had two additional trials\n\nscheduled for May and that another juror had told the court he\n\nwould be away from May 30 to June 22.    The district court decided\n\nthat the trial would not reconvene until June 23.      Again, there\n\nwere no objections.\n\n          On June 17, after the trial had already been on hold for\n\ntwo-and-a-half months and only a week before it was to resume,\n\nplaintiffs raised their first objection to the delay, moving for a\n\n\n\n\njudgment for the Municipality.     The plaintiffs have not appealed\nfrom this ruling.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fmistrial.6     The district court rejected the motion three days\n\nlater.     In a June 26 explanatory order, the court stated that\n\n             calendar exigencies and the unopposed absence\n             of two jurors in this case were the only\n             reasons for the interruption . . . .       The\n             adjournment    was   compelled    under    the\n             circumstances since the Court could neither\n             vacate the trial settings in the other cases\n             nor did the plaintiffs in this case oppose the\n             absence of the two jurors who took annual\n             leave.\n\n             Review of denial of a motion for mistrial is for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc., 399\n\nF.3d 52, 62 (1st Cir. 2005).          We will not reverse if there is no\n\nshowing of prejudice.        See, e.g., Ferrara & DiMercurio v. St. Paul\n\nMercury Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2001); Clemente v.\n\nCarnicon-P.R. Mgmt. Assocs., 52 F.3d 383, 388 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(finding no abuse of discretion in part because appellant did not\n\n\"demonstrate[] actual prejudice\"). Plaintiffs argue that prejudice\n\nmay   be   presumed   from    a   protracted   delay   after   the   close   of\n\nplaintiffs' evidence. They cite supporting case law to this effect\n\nfrom other courts.     See Young & Simon, Inc. v. Merritt Sav. & Loan,\n\nInc., 672 F.2d 401 (4th Cir. 1982); Citron v. Aro Corp., 377 F.2d\n\n750 (3d Cir. 1967).     But whether prejudice may be presumed or not\n\nis not the point.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n       The belated objection came a day after the district court\ngranted judgment in favor of the defendants as to the due process\nclaims.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f              More important here is that plaintiffs did not offer any\n\nobjection when consulted about the time off requested by the two\n\njurors.   As the district court pointed out in denying the mistrial\n\nrequest, plaintiffs had multiple opportunities to object to the\n\ninitial three-week hiatus, and they did not do so.                     To the\n\ncontrary, they explicitly told the district court they had no\n\nobjection.      Plaintiffs argue that their lack of objection \"may\"\n\nhave stemmed from their concern \"that the vacationing juror . . .\n\ncould have become indisposed with plaintiffs for ruining her\n\nleisure time.\"       If that were so, then plaintiffs made a tactical\n\nchoice with which they must live.            It may not be so: the record\n\nmakes clear that the district court offered plaintiffs the chance\n\nto   object    at   sidebar,   out   of   the   jury's   presence,   and   they\n\ndeclined.      This was still a tactical choice.           As to the second\n\nportion of the continuance, the plaintiffs did not object until\n\nJune 17, one week before trial was scheduled to resume.\n\n              Plaintiffs did too little, too late.          See Clemente, 52\n\nF.3d at 388 (refusing to find an abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's denial of a mistrial where appellant had not\n\n\"preserved her rights\"); id. at 388 n.5 (noting that \"the time to\n\ncomplain . . . is at the outset\" and that \"plaintiff did not make\n\na peep\" when the district court took the action which plaintiff\n\nlater said warranted a mistrial).          The cases plaintiffs rely on do\n\nnot help them in the face of their failure to object.            See Young &\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fSimon, 672 F.2d at 402 n.2 (ordering a new trial and repeatedly\n\nemphasizing that \"counsel timely and persistently objected to the\n\n[delay] when it was proposed, when it occurred, and after the trial\n\nended\"); Citron, 377 F.2d at 753 (ordering a new trial despite a\n\nlack of objection to the delay, but emphasizing that the trial\n\njudge had told counsel that he was not going to cancel a planned\n\ntrip \"for this case or any other case,\" thus making clear in\n\nadvance that objection would be futile).     The district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion.\n\nB.          Rule 50 Motion Re: Procedural Due Process\n\n            The district court's grant of defendants' Rule 50(a)\n\nmotion as to the procedural due process claim is subject to de novo\n\nreview.    Burton v. Town of Littleton, 426 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    \"We review the evidence, taking all inferences in favor of\n\n[plaintiffs], and ask whether a reasonable jury could have found\n\ndefendants liable based on the evidence presented.\"     Id.\n\n            In a due process claim stemming from the termination of\n\nemployment, \"a public employee must first demonstrate that he has\n\na reasonable expectation, arising out of a statute, policy, rule,\n\nor contract, that he will continue to be employed.\"        Wojcik v.\n\nMass. State Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir. 2002).     We\n\ndetermine whether such a property interest exists \"by reference to\n\nstate law.\"    Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 344 (1976).\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f          While state law may create property interests, it is a\n\nseparate question of federal law whether those interests rise to\n\nthe level of a legitimate claim of entitlement sufficient to\n\ntrigger procedural due process protections. See Memphis Light, Gas\n\n& Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 9 (1978) (\"Although the\n\nunderlying substantive interest is created by 'an independent\n\nsource such as state law,' federal constitutional law determines\n\nwhether an interest rises to the level of a 'legitimate claim of\n\nentitlement' protected by the Due Process Clause.\" (quoting Bd. of\n\nRegents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972))).\n\n          If the employee has such a state property interest, and\n\nthat property interest rises to the level of a \"legitimate claim of\n\nentitlement,\" id., then the employer cannot dismiss the employee\n\nwithout affording him due process of law.     See, e.g., Gomez v.\n\nRivera Rodriguez, 344 F.3d 103, 111 (1st Cir. 2003).   In the public\n\nemployment context, the required process typically includes \"some\n\nkind of hearing\" and \"some pretermination opportunity to respond.\"\n\nCleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985).\n\n          Under our case law a one-year contract of employment with\n\na Puerto Rico government body usually suffices to show a property\n\ninterest sufficient under Commonwealth law.    See, e.g., Caro v.\n\nAponte-Roque, 878 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1989). Plaintiffs here argue\n\nthat they had approximately one-year contracts of employment, that\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthose contracts had not yet expired, and therefore that defendants\n\nwere required to give them pre-termination hearings.\n\n          The district court disagreed, finding that plaintiffs had\n\nno property interest in their employment past December 31, 2000,\n\nthe day Law 52 funding expired.        As we understand the ruling, the\n\ndistrict court determined that either the Law 52 contract or\n\nmunicipal law required that each plaintiff's hiring contract be\n\nread to include the implicit condition that the term of employment\n\nwas conditioned on the Municipality's receipt of Law 52 funding.\n\n          The district court's stated reasoning was as follows.\n\nThe former mayor, it held, \"lacked authority under the Law 52\n\ncontract then in effect\" between the Municipality and the DLHR to\n\nextend the appointments beyond the term of funding specifically set\n\nforth in the award under Law 52.        In response to the plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the former mayor could have \"extended\" plaintiffs'\n\nappointments and paid them using municipal funds, the district\n\ncourt stated that it \"need not delve into that possibility\" because\n\n\"in making the appointments the former Mayor made sole and express\n\nreference to the Law 52 'proposal' as the mechanism which made them\n\npossible.\"    The court relied on the hiring letters and their\n\nreferences   to   appointments   \"by    way   of\"   the   Law   52   funding\n\nagreement.   The court concluded:\n\n          [T]he former Mayor clearly acted ultra vires\n          in making appointments to Law 52 posts for\n          terms that exceeded the duration of the Law 52\n          grant, and in so doing failed to extend\n\n                                 -14-\n\f                plaintiffs' property interest in continued\n                employment in their positions beyond the term\n                established in the Law 52 contract.\n\nThe court correctly referred to precedent to the effect that (1)\n\nillegally obtained public employment confers no property interest\n\non the employee, see Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d\n\n314, 319-20 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc), and (2) written assurances\n\nin    a    letter   of     engagement      are    insufficient    to   contravene      a\n\n\"comprehensive           network    of   statutory    and   regulatory      directives\n\ngoverning the terms of . . . employment,\" Correa-Martinez v.\n\nArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 54-55 (1st Cir. 1990), overruled\n\non    other     grounds     by     Educadores     Puertorriqueños      en   Accion    v.\n\nHernández, 367 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the due process interest\n\nwas       created   by    the    hiring    letters,    which    themselves     do    not\n\nexplicitly limit the terms of the appointments to the limits on Law\n\n52 funding.         They say the Mayor had authority to enter into a\n\ncontract of a term of one year legally, without limits under Law\n\n52, by providing additional funding from the municipal budget.\n\n                We understand the district court to have ruled as a\n\nmatter of law that Law 52, by its terms, prohibits the extension of\n\nLaw 52-funded jobs using municipal funds.                       But the law itself\n\ncontains no such prohibition.                    Indeed, the law speaks only in\n\ngeneral terms: it states that funds disbursed thereunder shall be\n\nused       to   promote,        inter    alia,    \"employment    opportunities        in\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\foccupations with future possibilities,\" \"jobs that are in demand in\n\nthe   present    market,\"       and   \"the    creation   of   high    productivity\n\nemployment opportunities.\"            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 711c(b).        It\n\nfurther states that \"[s]aid moneys may also be used to maintain\n\nexisting jobs, extend their duration, modify compensation as [a]\n\ntransitory remedial measure in situations that may involve possible\n\njob   loss,    when   it   is    deemed      justifiable   in   the   Secretary's\n\njudgment.\"      Id. § 711c(c).           The statute does not support the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion.7\n\n              Nothing in the terms of the Law 52 contract between the\n\nCommonwealth and the Municipality adds such a prohibition.                  It is\n\ntrue that the Law 52 contract was effective only \"until December\n\n31, 2000,\" that it listed the \"number of months\" per worker as six,\n\nand that it required that the Law 52 funds be held in a separate\n\naccount and that no expenditures be made from that account beyond\n\nthe sum in the grant.             But none of these provisions forbids,\n\nexpressly or impliedly, the use of other funds to fill out a\n\ncontract as to which Law 52 funds had been exhausted.                  Indeed, the\n\nseventh paragraph of Agreement provides:\n\n              The incentive approved shall be applied to the\n              salary and fringe benefit costs of the\n\n\n      7\n       Defendants cite Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez, 344 F.3d 103, 107\n(1st Cir. 2003), for the proposition that \"Law 52 employment is\ncontingent upon Law 52 funding.\" Whether or not this is true, it\nis not the question here. The question is whether a job that began\nas Law 52 employment may be continued, using municipal funds, after\nthe Law 52 funding expires.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f          employments agreed upon in this contract. If\n          the Municipality offers to the employees other\n          benefits which are not part of this agreement,\n          the   Municipality   assumes    responsibility\n          therefore and pays them with its funds.\n\n          Of considerable significance is that the Municipality\n\ndid, in fact, provide non-Law 52 money from municipal coffers to\n\nfund the plaintiffs' contracts for one month, January 2001.      The\n\ndefendants explain this on the ground that they continued to pay\n\nthe plaintiffs only while they investigated whether the Law 52\n\nfunding had in fact been exhausted.      Perhaps a jury could so\n\nconclude, but because municipal funds were used, it is difficult to\n\nconclude as a matter of law that there was a prohibition on the use\n\nof municipal funds to fund plaintiffs' employment through June 30.\n\nThe same is true for the rationale, used by the district court,\n\nthat the contract mentioned only Law 52 funding.           Given the\n\nglancing nature of the reference in the hiring letters to Law 52\n\nfunding, that rationale is not dispositive.\n\n          The district court's opinion also appears to say that\n\nunder municipal law, the Mayor was forbidden from creating jobs (or\n\nextending the duration of jobs) unless he had secured, in advance,\n\nall of the necessary funds.    It may be that under Puerto Rican\n\nmunicipal law the Mayor was acting ultra vires, as the district\n\ncourt found.   But at this stage we cannot resolve the question.\n\nThe district court did not explain why the Mayor's actions should\n\nbe deemed ultra vires.   While the Mayor could not expend more Law\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f52 monies than he had available, there is no explanation so far as\n\nto why the Municipality was precluded from using other sources of\n\nfunds to meet the commitment to the plaintiffs.             The plaintiffs'\n\nbrief on appeal argues, in contrast, that the former mayor was\n\nfully    empowered   to   use   municipal   funds   (even   those   not   yet\n\nallocated) to extend the duration of jobs created by other means.\n\nBut it, too, has cited to no law that supports its conclusion.8\n\n            Absent clarity on these issues of Puerto Rico municipal\n\nlaw, the best course is to vacate the judgment and remand to the\n\ndistrict court.      Since a new trial on the procedural due process\n\nissue may not be necessary -- for example, the legal questions may\n\nbe susceptible to resolution, in whole or in part, via summary\n\njudgment -- we leave it to the district court to determine the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        Plaintiffs argue that the mayor unquestionably had such\nauthority because under \"basic principles of budgeting,\" he could\nhave taken note of the fact that the Municipality had received Law\n52 grants for many years in a row and anticipated that the\nMunicipality would receive another such grant in 2001.       We are\nunconvinced.    Defendants, for their part, argue that \"[i]n the\nabsence of funds earmarked for the salaries of improperly appointed\nLaw 52 employees, the Municipality cannot pay for such expenses\nunless it makes a readjustment based on a budgetary surplus.\" But\nthe law defendants cite for this proposition, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n21, § 4309, does not support it. The provision merely states when\nand under what circumstances a legislature may adjust a municipal\nbudget; it contains no other express limitations or proscriptions.\nSee id.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fnature of the proceedings to follow.9    See Rivera Alicea v. United\n\nStates, 404 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          We add a few points.    What we have been discussing is\n\nwhether Puerto Rican law supplies any sort of property interest\n\nonce the Law 52 funding ceased.\n\n          That still leaves the question, assuming plaintiffs have\n\nsome property interest under Commonwealth law, of whether such\n\nstate property interests are among those which give rise to a\n\n\"legitimate claim to entitlement protected by the federal due\n\nprocess clause\" and whether existing state remedies are adequate.\n\nSee Lujan v. G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 532 U.S. 189, 195-96\n\n(2001).\n\n                               III.\n\n          We affirm the denial of the mistrial motion.    We vacate\n\nthe judgment of the district court for defendants with respect to\n\nthe procedural due process claim and remand the case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.    No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       We also note an admission in plaintiffs' brief: \"Plaintiffs\nsubmit . . . that, although clearly related, plaintiffs' employment\ncontracts' effectiveness was not contingent on the availability of\nLaw 52 funds. This is not to say that termination of those funds\nwould not have given rise to good cause to terminate the relevant\nemployment contracts.\"\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

Each held a contract stating that the term of employment was effective through June 30, 2001, but also stating that the employment was \"by way\" of a particular financial grant (a \"Law 52\" grant, explained further below) that the Municipality had received from the Commonwealth. Funding under that grant was exhausted on December 31, 2000, and the Municipality, under a new Mayor, terminated plaintiffs' contracts one month later on the basis of lack of Law 52 funding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs sued the Municipality and individual municipal officers (in their official and personal capacities) under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 on two federal claims and related state claims. They alleged that the termination of their contracts before the expiration dates, without a pretermination hearing, violated their procedural due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. They also alleged that their contracts were terminated because they belonged to a different political party, the New Progressive Party (NPP), than the newly elected Popular Democratic Party (PDP) mayor of the Municipality in violation of the First Amendment. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, back pay, front pay, economic and punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and other relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial on June 16, 2003, after the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the district court granted judgment under Rule 50, Fed. R.Civ.P., for defendants on the procedural due process claim. The court held that the plaintiffs had no property interest in further employment inasmuch as the program in which they were employed depended upon receipt of the Law 52 funding from the Commonwealth which had expired on December 31, 2000.

They do not challenge the jury verdict. As to the denial of the motion for mistrial, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm. As to the procedural due process claim, however, we vacate and remand for further consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth established the Law 52 program more than twenty-five years ago. Under the program, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 711c, Puerto Rico \"subsidize[s] locally managed programs to ameliorate unemployment.\" <i>Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 107 (1st Cir. 2003). Municipalities do not have an automatic entitlement to Law 52 grants: a municipality must submit a proposal describing how it will use the money; such proposals must be approved by the Commonwealth's Department of Labor and Human Resources (DLHR). <i>Id.</i> Once a grant is approved, the Commonwealth and the municipality sign a contract specifying how much money the municipality will receive, over what term, and how many jobs it will subsidize. The various Law 52 contracts between the Municipality of Aguada and the DLHR contained standard clauses stating that the Municipality \"commit[ted] itself to create\" the number of jobs specified, and that \"[u]nder no circumstances will it be construed that people hired [by virtue of the Law 52 contract] are or act as employees of the [DLHR].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 2000, a new Law 52 agreement (\"the Law 52 contract\") between the Municipality and the DLHR took effect. Under the contract's provisions, the DLHR awarded the Municipality $295,908 to pay the salaries and benefits of the forty-five employees through December 31, 2000. The Law 52 contract required the Municipality to keep the Law 52 funds separate from other municipal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are among the forty-five workers hired by the Municipality in connection with this Law 52 grant. Between June 20 and September 1, 2000, each of the plaintiffs received letters (\"the hiring letters\") signed by then-Mayor Julio C&#233;sar Rom&#225;n, appointing them to various municipal jobs, including carpentry and labor positions. The stated starting dates for these jobs ranged from July 1 to September 6, 2000. The stated termination date for each job was the same: June 30, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n was a member of the NPP, as is each of the plaintiffs. It is noteworthy that the Mayor's letter used an employment date for the plaintiffs through June 2001, despite the fact the Law 52 funding lasted only through December 2000, and that he did so in the face of an upcoming municipal election in which control of the municipal government might switch to the opposing political party. Defendants rely on this to argue that the Mayor acted ultra vires in using a termination date of June 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hiring letters signed by Mayor Rom&#225;n varied only slightly in their terms. A typical letter, such as the one sent to plaintiff Jos&#233; M&#233;ndez Valle, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allow me by these means [to] appoint you to hold the post of Laborer by way of the Labor Department Proposal<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for this Municipal Administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same shall be effective September 6, 2000 until June 30, 2001.

On November 7, 2000, elections were held in Aguada, and a new mayor, defendant Miguel Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez of the PDP, was elected. The twenty-two plaintiffs had supported the new Mayor's opponent in the mayoral race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez was sworn into office on January 9, 2001. By this time, the funding provided by the Law 52 contract had expired. The Municipality nonetheless continued plaintiffs' employment through the month of January, paying their salaries out of municipal funds. On January 31, however, Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez sent letters to the plaintiffs (\"the firing letters\") informing them that the Law 52 funds had expired a month earlier and that their jobs were therefore being terminated. A typical firing letter, this one addressed to plaintiff Edwin Acevedo Acevedo, read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I hereby inform you that your work contract through the Proposal of the Department of Labor and Human Resources (Law 52) expired on December 31, 2000.

None of the plaintiffs were offered any of the jobs created by these funds, despite the fact that defendant Glenda Pe&#241;a-Mu&#241;oz, the new municipal human resources director appointed by Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez, had promised them they would be recalled when new Law 52 funds were procured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed suit on April 12, 2001, against the Municipality, Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez, and Human Resources Director Pe&#241;a-Mu&#241;oz.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In response to plaintiffs' political discrimination claim, defendants countered that the terminations had nothing to do with political animus, but were instead inevitable and proper given the cessation of Law 52 funding. And as to the procedural due process claim, defendants argued that Mayor Rom&#225;n had had no authority to offer the plaintiffs contracts that outlasted the Law 52 funding; thus the contracts were void as to a June 30 termination date, and no pre-termination hearing was required under the Due Process Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury trial began on March 19, 2003. On April 4, plaintiffs rested. Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) as to the political discrimination and procedural due process claims. On June 16, 2003, during an extended hiatus in the trial (discussed further below), the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the procedural due process claim but allowed the political discrimination claim to proceed. Trial resumed on July 1 on the plaintiffs' remaining claims and the jury rejected the political discrimination claim on July 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Denial of Mistrial Based on The Trial Delay</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue the district court erred in not granting their motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 2003, the day the plaintiffs rested, the district court authorized the jury forewoman to take a previously scheduled vacation from April 11 through April 27 and halted the trial pending her return.

The adjournment was compelled under the circumstances since the Court could neither vacate the trial settings in the other cases nor did the plaintiffs in this case oppose the absence of the two jurors who took annual leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of denial of a motion for mistrial is for abuse of discretion. <i>Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 62 (1st Cir.2005). We will not reverse if there is no showing of prejudice. <i>See, e.g., Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 240 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Clemente v. Carnicon-P.R. Mgmt. Assocs.,</i> 52 F.3d 383, 388 (1st Cir.1995) (finding no abuse of discretion in part because appellant did not \"demonstrate[] actual prejudice\"). Plaintiffs argue that prejudice may be presumed from a protracted delay after the close of plaintiffs' evidence. They cite supporting case law to this effect from other courts. <i>See Young &amp; Simon, Inc. v. Merritt Sav. &amp; Loan, Inc.,</i> 672 F.2d 401 (4th Cir.1982); <i>Citron v. Aro Corp.,</i> 377 F.2d 750 (3d Cir.1967).

As the district court pointed out in denying the mistrial request, plaintiffs had multiple opportunities to object to the initial three-week hiatus, and they did not do so. To the contrary, they explicitly told the district court they had no objection. Plaintiffs argue that their lack of objection \"may\" have stemmed from their concern \"that the vacationing juror . . . could have become indisposed with plaintiffs for ruining her leisure time.\" If that were so, then plaintiffs made a tactical choice with which they must live. It may not be so: the record makes clear that the district court offered plaintiffs the chance to object at sidebar, out of the jury's presence, and they declined. This was still a tactical choice. As to the second portion of the continuance, the plaintiffs did not object until June 17, one week before trial was scheduled to resume.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs did too little, too late. <i>See Clemente,</i> 52 F.3d at 388 (refusing to find an abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of a mistrial where appellant had not \"preserved her rights\"); <i>id.</i> at 388 n. 5 (noting that \"the time to complain . . . is at the outset\" and that \"plaintiff did not make a peep\" when the district court took the action which plaintiff later said warranted a mistrial). The cases plaintiffs rely on do not help them in the face of their failure to object. <i>See Young &amp; Simon,</i> 672 F.2d at 402 n. 2 (ordering a new trial and repeatedly emphasizing that \"counsel timely and persistently objected to the [delay] when it was proposed, when it occurred, and after the trial ended\"); <i>Citron,</i> 377 F.2d at 753 (ordering a new trial despite a lack of objection to the delay, but emphasizing that the trial judge had told counsel that he was not going to cancel a planned trip \"for this case or any other case,\" thus making clear in advance that objection would be futile). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Rule 50 Motion Re: Procedural Due Process</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of defendants' Rule 50(a) motion as to the procedural due process claim is subject to de novo review. <i>Burton v.

Rivera Rodriguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 111 (1st Cir.2003). In the public employment context, the required process typically includes \"some kind of hearing\" and \"some pretermination opportunity to respond.\" <i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our case law a one-year contract of employment with a Puerto Rico government body usually suffices to show a property interest sufficient under Commonwealth law. <i>See, e.g., Caro v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 878 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1989). Plaintiffs here argue that they had approximately one-year contracts of employment, that those contracts had not yet expired, and therefore that defendants were required to give them pre-termination hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court disagreed, finding that plaintiffs had no property interest in their employment past December 31, 2000, the day Law 52 funding expired. As we understand the ruling, the district court determined that either the Law 52 contract or municipal law required that each plaintiff's hiring contract be read to include the implicit condition that the term of employment was conditioned on the Municipality's receipt of Law 52 funding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's stated reasoning was as follows. The former mayor, it held, \"lacked authority under the Law 52 contract then in effect\" between the Municipality and the DLHR to extend the appointments beyond the term of funding specifically set forth in the award under Law 52. In response to the plaintiffs' argument that the former mayor could have \"extended\" plaintiffs' appointments and paid them using municipal funds, the district court stated that it \"need not delve into that possibility\" because \"in making the appointments the former Mayor made sole and express reference to the Law 52 `proposal' as the mechanism which made them possible.\" The court relied on the hiring letters and their references to appointments \"by way of\" the Law 52 funding agreement. The court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he former Mayor clearly acted ultra vires in making appointments to Law 52 posts for terms that exceeded the duration of the Law 52 grant, and in so doing failed to extend plaintiffs' property interest in continued employment in their positions beyond the term established in the Law 52 contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court correctly referred to precedent to the effect that (1) illegally obtained public employment confers no property interest on the employee, <i>see Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 889 F.2d 314, 319-20 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc), and (2) written assurances in a letter of engagement are insufficient to contravene a \"comprehensive network of statutory and regulatory directives governing the terms of . . . employment,\" <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> 903 F.2d 49, 54-55 (1st Cir. 1990), <i>overruled on other grounds by Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Accion v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 64 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the due process interest was created by the hiring letters, which themselves do not explicitly limit the terms of the appointments to the limits on Law 52 funding. They say the Mayor had authority to enter into a contract of a term of one year legally, without limits under Law 52, by providing additional funding from the municipal budget.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand the district court to have ruled as a matter of law that Law 52, by its terms, prohibits the extension of Law 52-funded jobs using municipal funds. But the law itself contains no such prohibition. Indeed, the law speaks only in general terms: it states that funds disbursed thereunder shall be used to promote, inter alia, \"employment opportunities in occupations with future possibilities,\" \"jobs that are in demand in the present market,\" and \"the creation of high productivity employment opportunities.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 711c(b). It further states that \"[s]aid moneys may also be used to maintain existing jobs, extend their duration, modify compensation as [a] transitory remedial measure in situations that may involve possible job loss, when it is deemed justifiable in the Secretary's judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 711c(c). The statute does not support the district court's conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the terms of the Law 52 contract between the Commonwealth and the Municipality adds such a prohibition. It is true that the Law 52 contract was effective only \"until December 31, 2000,\" that it listed the \"number of months\" per worker as six, and that it required that the Law 52 funds be held in a separate account and that no expenditures be made from that account beyond the sum in the grant. But none of these provisions forbids, expressly or impliedly, the use of other funds to fill out a contract as to which Law 52 funds had been exhausted. Indeed, the seventh paragraph of Agreement provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incentive approved shall be applied to the salary and fringe benefit costs of the employments agreed upon in this contract. If the Municipality offers to the employees other benefits which are not part of this agreement, the Municipality assumes responsibility therefore and pays them with its funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of considerable significance is that the Municipality did, in fact, provide non-Law 52 money from municipal coffers to fund the plaintiffs' contracts for one month, January 2001. The defendants explain this on the ground that they continued to pay the plaintiffs only while they investigated whether the Law 52 funding had in fact been exhausted. Perhaps a jury could so conclude, but because municipal funds were used, it is difficult to conclude as a matter of law that there was a prohibition on the use of municipal funds to fund plaintiffs' employment through June 30. The same is true for the rationale, used by the district court, that the contract mentioned only Law 52 funding. Given the glancing nature of the reference in the hiring letters to Law 52 funding, that rationale is not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion also appears to say that under municipal law, the Mayor was forbidden from creating jobs (or extending the duration of jobs) unless he had secured, in advance, all of the necessary funds. It may be that under Puerto Rican municipal law the Mayor was acting ultra vires, as the district court found. But at this stage we cannot resolve the question. The district court did not explain why the Mayor's actions should be deemed ultra vires. While the Mayor could not expend more <i>Law 52</i> monies than he had available, there is no explanation so far as to why the Municipality was precluded from using other sources of funds to meet the commitment to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' brief on appeal argues, in contrast, that the former mayor was fully empowered to use municipal funds (even those not yet allocated) to extend the duration of jobs created by other means. But it, too, has cited to no law that supports its conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent clarity on these issues of Puerto Rico municipal law, the best course is to vacate the judgment and remand to the district court. Since a new trial on the procedural due process issue may not be necessary &#8212; for example, the legal questions may be susceptible to resolution, in whole or in part, via summary judgment &#8212; we leave it to the district court to determine the nature of the proceedings to follow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Rivera Alicea v.

Municipalities do not have an automatic entitlement to Law 52 grants: a municipality must submit a proposal describing how it will use the money; such proposals must be approved by the Commonwealth's Department of Labor and Human Resources (DLHR). <i>Id.</i> Once a grant is approved, the Commonwealth and the municipality sign a contract specifying how much money the municipality will receive, over what term, and how many jobs it will subsidize. The various Law 52 contracts between the Municipality of Aguada and the DLHR contained standard clauses stating that the Municipality \"commit[ted] itself to create\" the number of jobs specified, and that \"[u]nder no circumstances will it be construed that people hired [by virtue of the Law 52 contract] are or act as employees of the [DLHR].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 2000, a new Law 52 agreement (\"the Law 52 contract\") between the Municipality and the DLHR took effect. Under the contract's provisions, the DLHR awarded the Municipality $295,908 to pay the salaries and benefits of the forty-five employees through December 31, 2000. The Law 52 contract required the Municipality to keep the Law 52 funds separate from other municipal funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are among the forty-five workers hired by the Municipality in connection with this Law 52 grant. Between June 20 and September 1, 2000, each of the plaintiffs received letters (\"the hiring letters\") signed by then-Mayor Julio C&#233;sar Rom&#225;n, appointing them to various municipal jobs, including carpentry and labor positions. The stated starting dates for these jobs ranged from July 1 to September 6, 2000. The stated termination date for each job was the same: June 30, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Rom&#225;n was a member of the NPP, as is each of the plaintiffs. It is noteworthy that the Mayor's letter used an employment date for the plaintiffs through June 2001, despite the fact the Law 52 funding lasted only through December 2000, and that he did so in the face of an upcoming municipal election in which control of the municipal government might switch to the opposing political party. Defendants rely on this to argue that the Mayor acted ultra vires in using a termination date of June 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hiring letters signed by Mayor Rom&#225;n varied only slightly in their terms. A typical letter, such as the one sent to plaintiff Jos&#233; M&#233;ndez Valle, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allow me by these means [to] appoint you to hold the post of Laborer by way of the Labor Department Proposal<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for this Municipal Administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same shall be effective September 6, 2000 until June 30, 2001.

On November 7, 2000, elections were held in Aguada, and a new mayor, defendant Miguel Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez of the PDP, was elected. The twenty-two plaintiffs had supported the new Mayor's opponent in the mayoral race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez was sworn into office on January 9, 2001. By this time, the funding provided by the Law 52 contract had expired. The Municipality nonetheless continued plaintiffs' employment through the month of January, paying their salaries out of municipal funds. On January 31, however, Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez sent letters to the plaintiffs (\"the firing letters\") informing them that the Law 52 funds had expired a month earlier and that their jobs were therefore being terminated. A typical firing letter, this one addressed to plaintiff Edwin Acevedo Acevedo, read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I hereby inform you that your work contract through the Proposal of the Department of Labor and Human Resources (Law 52) expired on December 31, 2000.

None of the plaintiffs were offered any of the jobs created by these funds, despite the fact that defendant Glenda Pe&#241;a-Mu&#241;oz, the new municipal human resources director appointed by Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez, had promised them they would be recalled when new Law 52 funds were procured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed suit on April 12, 2001, against the Municipality, Mayor Ruiz-Hern&#225;ndez, and Human Resources Director Pe&#241;a-Mu&#241;oz.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In response to plaintiffs' political discrimination claim, defendants countered that the terminations had nothing to do with political animus, but were instead inevitable and proper given the cessation of Law 52 funding. And as to the procedural due process claim, defendants argued that Mayor Rom&#225;n had had no authority to offer the plaintiffs contracts that outlasted the Law 52 funding; thus the contracts were void as to a June 30 termination date, and no pre-termination hearing was required under the Due Process Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury trial began on March 19, 2003. On April 4, plaintiffs rested. Defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) as to the political discrimination and procedural due process claims. On June 16, 2003, during an extended hiatus in the trial (discussed further below), the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the procedural due process claim but allowed the political discrimination claim to proceed. Trial resumed on July 1 on the plaintiffs' remaining claims and the jury rejected the political discrimination claim on July 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Denial of Mistrial Based on The Trial Delay</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue the district court erred in not granting their motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 2003, the day the plaintiffs rested, the district court authorized the jury forewoman to take a previously scheduled vacation from April 11 through April 27 and halted the trial pending her return.

As the district court pointed out in denying the mistrial request, plaintiffs had multiple opportunities to object to the initial three-week hiatus, and they did not do so. To the contrary, they explicitly told the district court they had no objection. Plaintiffs argue that their lack of objection \"may\" have stemmed from their concern \"that the vacationing juror . . . could have become indisposed with plaintiffs for ruining her leisure time.\" If that were so, then plaintiffs made a tactical choice with which they must live. It may not be so: the record makes clear that the district court offered plaintiffs the chance to object at sidebar, out of the jury's presence, and they declined. This was still a tactical choice.

In response to the plaintiffs' argument that the former mayor could have \"extended\" plaintiffs' appointments and paid them using municipal funds, the district court stated that it \"need not delve into that possibility\" because \"in making the appointments the former Mayor made sole and express reference to the Law 52 `proposal' as the mechanism which made them possible.\" The court relied on the hiring letters and their references to appointments \"by way of\" the Law 52 funding agreement.

The statute does not support the district court's conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the terms of the Law 52 contract between the Commonwealth and the Municipality adds such a prohibition. It is true that the Law 52 contract was effective only \"until December 31, 2000,\" that it listed the \"number of months\" per worker as six, and that it required that the Law 52 funds be held in a separate account and that no expenditures be made from that account beyond the sum in the grant. But none of these provisions forbids, expressly or impliedly, the use of other funds to fill out a contract as to which Law 52 funds had been exhausted. Indeed, the seventh paragraph of Agreement provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incentive approved shall be applied to the salary and fringe benefit costs of the employments agreed upon in this contract. If the Municipality offers to the employees other benefits which are not part of this agreement, the Municipality assumes responsibility therefore and pays them with its funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of considerable significance is that the Municipality did, in fact, provide non-Law 52 money from municipal coffers to fund the plaintiffs' contracts for one month, January 2001. The defendants explain this on the ground that they continued to pay the plaintiffs only while they investigated whether the Law 52 funding had in fact been exhausted. Perhaps a jury could so conclude, but because municipal funds were used, it is difficult to conclude as a matter of law that there was a prohibition on the use of municipal funds to fund plaintiffs' employment through June 30. The same is true for the rationale, used by the district court, that the contract mentioned only Law 52 funding. Given the glancing nature of the reference in the hiring letters to Law 52 funding, that rationale is not dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion also appears to say that under municipal law, the Mayor was forbidden from creating jobs (or extending the duration of jobs) unless he had secured, in advance, all of the necessary funds. It may be that under Puerto Rican municipal law the Mayor was acting ultra vires, as the district court found. But at this stage we cannot resolve the question. The district court did not explain why the Mayor's actions should be deemed ultra vires. While the Mayor could not expend more <i>Law 52</i> monies than he had available, there is no explanation so far as to why the Municipality was precluded from using other sources of funds to meet the commitment to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' brief on appeal argues, in contrast, that the former mayor was fully empowered to use municipal funds (even those not yet allocated) to extend the duration of jobs created by other means. But it, too, has cited to no law that supports its conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent clarity on these issues of Puerto Rico municipal law, the best course is to vacate the judgment and remand to the district court. Since a new trial on the procedural due process issue may not be necessary &#8212; for example, the legal questions may be susceptible to resolution, in whole or in part, via summary judgment &#8212; we leave it to the district court to determine the nature of the proceedings to follow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Rivera Alicea v.

Defendants imply that Mayor Rom&#225;n knew he had to shorten plaintiffs' terms of employment, that he took steps to do so, but that he reversed course after his party lost the election, either by removing the second letter from the plaintiffs' files or by inserting a third letter with identical terms to the first.
