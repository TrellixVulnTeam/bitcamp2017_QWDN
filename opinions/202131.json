Oroncz-Rodríguez, Deputy Solicitor General,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 5, 2006\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.         Myrta Nieves-Vega brought this\n\naction, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Puerto Rico law, against several\n\nemployees of the Puerto Rico Planning Board (Board).              She alleged\n\nthat the defendants discriminated against her on account of her\n\npolitical affiliation by reducing her salary.          The district court\n\ngranted the defendants summary judgment on the ground that Nieves'\n\nclaim was time barred.       We affirm.\n\n           Nieves was employed by the Board for over 20 years.\n\nUntil February 1999, Nieves, a member of the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP), worked for the Board as an Administrative Analyst VII, a\n\ncareer service position.       In February 1999, with the Board under\n\nNPP   leadership,   Nieves    was   appointed   to   serve   as    a   Special\n\nAssistant II, a trust position.\n\n           In 2000, the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) candidate\n\ndefeated the NPP candidate for governor. In the period between the\n\nelection and the PDP assuming control of the Board's leadership,\n\nNieves resigned her trust position and requested reinstatement to\n\nher career position.     Her request was granted and took effect on\n\nJuly 16, 2001, the day before the PDP assumed control of the Board.\n\nIn her reassigned post, Nieves earned a salary of $3,155 per month.\n\nThis was a \"salary by exception\" because it was higher than the\n\nsalary typically paid to an employee in Nieves' position.\n\n           After the PDP assumed control of the Board, new Board\n\nPresident Hermenegildo Ortiz-Quiñones ordered that the Office of\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fAdministration of Personnel and Human Resources review Nieves'\n\nsalary to determine if the grant of a salary by exception was\n\nproper.   This agency subsequently concluded that Nieves was not\n\nentitled to the salary by exception.\n\n          On June 13, 2002, Nieves received a letter from Ortiz\n\nexplaining that she was not entitled to the salary by exception and\n\nthat her salary would be reduced to $2,189 as of July 1, 2002.   The\n\nfollowing month, Nieves wrote to the new Board President Angel\n\nRodriguez to contest the salary reduction.   She claimed that Ortiz\n\nhad ordered the salary reduction to punish her for her membership\n\nin the NPP and requested that Rodriguez reinstate her prior salary.\n\nRodriguez replied that the salary reduction was not politically\n\nmotivated and would stand.\n\n          On July 1, 2003, exactly one year after the salary\n\nreduction took effect, Nieves filed an action claiming that the\n\nsalary reduction was an act of unlawful political discrimination.\n\nShe sought $1,000,0000 in compensatory damages, $2,000,000 in\n\npunitive damages, back pay, the reinstatement of her salary,\n\nattorney's fees and costs.\n\n          The defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment,\n\narguing that Nieves' claim was untimely under the applicable one-\n\nyear statute of limitations because the claim accrued on June 13,\n\n2002, the date that Nieves received notice of the salary reduction.\n\nNieves opposed, arguing that the claim did not accrue until July 1,\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f2002, the date that the salary reduction took effect, and, even if\n\nthe claim accrued when she received notice of the reduction, her\n\nletter to Rodriguez tolled the limitations period.        The district\n\ncourt granted the defendants' motion, ruling that the claim accrued\n\non the date that Nieves received notice of the salary reduction and\n\nthat Nieves' letter to Rodriguez did not toll the limitations\n\nperiod because it sought equitable relief while her lawsuit sought\n\nequitable relief and damages.\n\n            We review summary judgment rulings de novo.    See Guzman-\n\nRosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 397 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).\n\n            On appeal, Nieves renews the two arguments she made to\n\nthe district court: that her claim accrued on July 1, 2002 and that\n\nthe running of the statute of limitations was tolled by her letter\n\nto Rodriguez. The parties agree that Nieves' action is governed by\n\nPuerto Rico's one-year statute of limitations for personal injury\n\nclaims.    See Rodriguez-Garcia v. Caguas, 354 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            Federal law determines the date on which a § 1983 claim\n\naccrues.    See Lafont-Rivera v. Soler-Zapata, 984 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).   A claim accrues on the date that \"the plaintiff 'knows\n\nor has reason to know of the act which is the basis for the\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fclaim.'\"   Rodriguez-Garcia, 354 F.3d at 96-97 (quoting Rodriguez\n\nNarvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990)).      \"The\n\nrule in an employment discrimination case is that the limitations\n\nperiod begins to run when the [plaintiff] receives unambiguous and\n\nauthoritative notice of the discriminatory act (which is another\n\nway of saying that the period begins to run when the employee\n\nlearns of the adverse employment action).\"     Morris v. Gov't Dev.\n\nBank of P.R., 27 F.3d 746, 749 (1st Cir. 1994) (parentheses in\n\noriginal); see also Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8 (1981)\n\n(per curiam) (holding that the statute of limitations began to run\n\non the date that the employee received notice of the employer's\n\ndecision to terminate his employment); Lopez-Gonzalez v. Comerio,\n\n404 F.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir. 2005) (similar).\n\n           The June 13, 2002 letter from Ortiz to Nieves stated that\n\n\"effective on July 1, 2002,\" Nieves' salary by exception was\n\neliminated, and her salary would be reduced to $2,189 per month.\n\nThis letter provided Nieves with unequivocal notice that the Board\n\nhad decided to reduce her salary.      Accordingly, the statute of\n\nlimitations began to run on June 13, 2002, and therefore, unless\n\nthe letter to Rodriguez tolled the running of the limitations\n\nperiod, Nieves' July 1, 2003 complaint is time barred.\n\n           When a § 1983 action is brought in Puerto Rico, federal\n\nlaw borrows from Puerto Rico tolling law so long as the Puerto Rico\n\nlaw is consistent with underlying federal policy.    See Rodriguez-\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fGarcia, 354 F.3d at 97.            Under Puerto Rico law, \"extrajudicial\n\nclaims\" by a creditor may toll the running of a statute of\n\nlimitations. See 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5303; Benitez-Pons, v. Puerto\n\nRico, 136 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 1998).                    But because \"tolling\n\nprovisions    [are]     interpreted      restrictively      against     the   person\n\ninvoking     their    protection,\"       the    requirements      for   making   an\n\nextrajudicial claim are strict. Rodriguez Narvaez, 895 F.2d at 43.\n\nThe extrajudicial claim must be \"identical\" to the claim actually\n\nfiled in court.       Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 59.            It must seek the\n\nsame form of relief, be based on the same facts, and be asserted\n\nagainst    the   same   defendants       as    the   subsequent   lawsuit.       See\n\nRodriguez-Garcia, 354 F.3d at 97.\n\n            Nieves' letter to Rodriguez fails the first requirement:\n\nit seeks relief different from the relief later requested in the\n\nlawsuit.    In the letter, Nieves stated that she believed that her\n\nsalary    reduction     was   an   act    of    political   discrimination       and\n\nrequested that Rodriguez \"set [it] aside.\"                   In her subsequent\n\ncomplaint, however, Nieves sought $3,000,000 in damages, back pay,\n\nattorney's fees and costs in addition to requesting that the salary\n\nreduction be set aside.            We have held several times that an\n\nextrajudicial claim seeking only equitable relief does not toll the\n\nstatute of limitations where the subsequent complaint also seeks\n\ndamages.     See Benitez-Pons, 136 F.3d at 59-61; Riofrio Anda v.\n\nRalston Purina Co., 959 F.2d 1149, 1154 (1st Cir. 1992); Rodriguez-\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fNarvaez, 895 F.2d at 46; Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893\n\nF.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir. 1990); Hernandez del Valle v. Santa Aponte,\n\n575    F.2d    321,   323   (1st    Cir.   1978).      This   is   so     because   an\n\nextrajudicial claim requesting only injunctive relief does not give\n\nthe defendants \"fair notice that [they] might be called upon to\n\ndefend a damages suit, with different issues not applicable to a\n\nsuit for injunctive relief.\"1              Hernandez del Valle, 575 F.2d at\n\n324.       Accordingly, Nieves' letter to Rodriguez did not toll the\n\nstatute       of   limitations     and   her     complaint   was   time    barred.2\n\n\n\n       1\n      At oral argument, Nieves argued that, even if the letter to\nRodriguez was insufficient to toll the limitations period for her\ndamages claim, it was sufficient to toll the limitations period for\nher equitable relief claim.      This argument was not raised in\nNieves' brief and therefore is, at best, forfeit. See Suprenant v.\nRivas, 424 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir. 2005). In any event, even if plain\nerror review were available, there was no such error here.       In\nHernandez del Valle, 575 F.2d at 322-24, and Torres, 893 F.2d at\n407, the plaintiffs sought reinstatement and damages in their court\ncomplaints but sought only reinstatement in their extrajudicial\nclaims.   In both cases, we concluded that the entire cause of\naction was time barred. See Hernandez del Valle, 575 F.2d at 24;\nTorres, 893 F.2d at 407.\n       2\n      Nieves suggests also that her complaint stated a timely\nhostile work environment claim because it was based on events\noccurring after July 1, 2002. The district court rejected this\nargument on the ground that Nieves had disavowed any such claim\nduring the litigation.     We agree.    In her opposition to the\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, Nieves asserted that the allegations\nof discriminatory conduct in her complaint, aside from the\nreduction of salary allegation, were \"made not as a cause of action\n. . . but to support the contention that defendants' decision to\nsubstantially reduce plaintiff's salary was politically motivated.\"\nThis statement constitutes an abandonment of any additional\ndiscrimination claims that could have been raised by the facts\npleaded in Nieves' complaint. See Sheehan v. Marr, 207 F.3d 35, 42\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                           -7-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -8-\n\f",

She alleged that the defendants discriminated against her on account of her political affiliation by reducing her salary. The district court granted the defendants summary judgment on the ground that Nieves' claim was time barred. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves was employed by the Board for over 20 years. Until February 1999, Nieves, a member of the New Progressive Party (NPP), worked for the Board as an Administrative Analyst VII, a career service position. In February 1999, with the Board under NPP leadership, Nieves was appointed to serve as a Special Assistant II, a trust position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) candidate defeated the NPP candidate for governor. In the period between the election and the PDP assuming control of the Board's leadership, Nieves resigned her trust position and requested reinstatement to her career position. Her request was granted and took effect on July 16, 2001, the day before the PDP assumed control of the Board. In her reassigned post, Nieves earned a salary of $3,155 per month. This was a \"salary by exception\" because it was higher than the salary typically paid to an employee in Nieves' position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the PDP assumed control of the Board, new Board President Hermenegildo Ortiz-Qui&#241;ones ordered that the Office of Administration of Personnel and Human Resources review Nieves' salary to determine if the grant of a salary by exception was proper. This agency subsequently concluded that Nieves was not entitled to the salary by exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 2002, Nieves received a letter from Ortiz explaining that she was not entitled to the salary by exception and that her salary would be reduced to $2,189 as of July 1, 2002. The following month, Nieves wrote to the new Board President Angel Rodriguez to contest the salary reduction. She claimed that Ortiz had ordered the salary reduction to punish her for her membership in the NPP and requested that Rodriguez reinstate her prior salary. Rodriguez replied that the salary reduction was not politically motivated and would stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 2003, exactly one year after the salary reduction took effect, Nieves filed an action claiming that the salary reduction was an act of unlawful political discrimination. She sought $1,000,0000 in compensatory damages, $2,000,000 in punitive damages, back pay, the reinstatement of her salary, attorney's fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that Nieves' claim was untimely under the applicable one-year statute of limitations because the claim accrued on June 13, 2002, the date that Nieves received notice of the salary reduction. Nieves opposed, arguing that the claim did not accrue until July 1, 2002, the date that the salary reduction took effect, and, even if the claim accrued when she received notice of the reduction, her letter to Rodriguez tolled the limitations period. The district court granted the defendants' motion, ruling that the claim accrued on the date that Nieves received notice of the salary reduction and that Nieves' letter to Rodriguez did not toll the limitations period because it sought equitable relief while her lawsuit sought equitable relief and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review summary judgment rulings de novo. <i>See Guzman-Rosario v.

The parties agree that Nieves' action is governed by Puerto Rico's one-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims. <i>See Rodriguez-Garcia v.

This letter provided Nieves with unequivocal notice that the Board had decided to reduce her salary. Accordingly, the statute of limitations began to run on June 13, 2002, and therefore, unless the letter to Rodriguez tolled the running of the limitations period, Nieves' July 1, 2003 complaint is time barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a &#167; 1983 action is brought in Puerto Rico, federal law borrows from Puerto Rico tolling law so long as the Puerto Rico law is consistent with underlying federal policy. <i>See Rodriguez-Garcia,</i> 354 F.3d at 97. Under Puerto Rico law, \"extrajudicial claims\" by a creditor may toll the running of a statute of limitations. <i>See</i> 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5303; <i>Benitez-Pons, v.

But because \"tolling provisions [are] interpreted restrictively against the person invoking their protection,\" the requirements for making an extrajudicial claim are strict. <i>Rodriguez Narvaez,</i> 895 F.2d at 43. The extrajudicial claim must be \"identical\" to the claim actually filed in court. <i>Benitez-Pons,</i> 136 F.3d at 59. It must seek the same form of relief, be based on the same facts, and be asserted against the same defendants as the subsequent lawsuit. <i>See Rodriguez-Garcia,</i> 354 F.3d at 97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves' letter to Rodriguez fails the first requirement: it seeks relief different from the relief later requested in the lawsuit. In the letter, Nieves stated that she believed that her salary reduction was an act of political discrimination and requested that Rodriguez \"set [it] aside.\" In her subsequent complaint, however, Nieves sought $3,000,000 in damages, back pay, attorney's fees and costs in addition to requesting that the salary reduction be set aside. We have held several times that an extrajudicial claim seeking only equitable relief does not toll the statute of limitations where the subsequent complaint also seeks damages. <i>See Benitez-Pons,</i> 136 F.3d at 59-61; <i>Riofrio Anda v.
