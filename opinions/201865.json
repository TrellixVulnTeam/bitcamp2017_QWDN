Byrne for appellant Ivery.\n     Donald L. Cabell, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                         October 20, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            DYK, Circuit Judge.             Defendant-appellant Imauri Ivery\n\n(“Ivery”) pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by\n\na convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and was\n\nsentenced to 180 months in prison under the Armed Career Criminal\n\nAct (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).               The plea was conditioned on\n\nIvery’s retention of the right to appeal the denial of his motion\n\nto   suppress     a    firearm   and   ammunition    police      recovered   while\n\nsearching Ivery’s vehicle during a traffic stop.                 Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(a)(2) (2005). In addition to appealing the denial of the motion\n\nto suppress, Ivery challenges the district court’s enhancement of\n\nhis sentence under the ACCA.           We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            The       primary    question     here   goes   to    the   scope   of\n\npermissible police authority under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1\n\n(1968).\n\n            The facts found by the district court are as follows:\n\nAround 6:00 AM on August 11, 2002, Boston city police officer Grant\n\nCallender was on duty in Boston’s Chinatown, an area known for\n\ndrug-related crime, when he observed Ivery driving a white Mercedes\n\nwith no front license plate and a partially detached rear license\n\nplate.    Callender pulled Ivery over two blocks later, where he was\n\njoined by officer Kevin Ervin.           While approaching Ivery’s vehicle\n\n(Callender from the rear and Ervin from the front), the officers\n\nnoticed that Ivery was leaning to the right; that Ivery’s glove\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fcompartment was open, revealing “a box of ... plastic sandwich bags\n\nsticking out from the glove box[;]”; and that both front seats of\n\nIvery’s    car   were    fully     reclined,    obscuring    the    car’s    rear\n\nfloorboard.\n\n            Still standing near the Mercedes with Ivery inside, Ervin\n\ntold Callender that he recognized Ivery as a person who had\n\npreviously fled from police.          Hearing this, Ivery interjected “I\n\ndon’t run from the police” in a “quivering” voice.                 Both officers\n\nsaid that Ivery appeared nervous; Callender noted that Ivery was\n\n“actually shaking ... his hands were shaking.”              After this verbal\n\nexchange, Callender instructed Ivery to exit the car, frisked him,\n\nfound nothing, and then directed Ivery to the rear of the car where\n\nErvin was standing.       Callender next “frisked” the inside of the\n\nMercedes, searching the front and rear compartments, floorboards,\n\nand finally behind an armrest in the center of the rear seat-back,\n\nwhere he found a loaded pistol.              When Callender emerged, Ivery\n\nunsuccessfully attempted to flee and was placed under arrest.\n\n            On December 4, 2002, Ivery was indicted in one count for\n\nunlawful    possession    of   a   firearm     and   ammunition    by   a   person\n\npreviously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one\n\nyear or more in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).               Ivery moved to\n\nsuppress the pistol and ammunition on Fourth Amendment grounds,\n\narguing that they were obtained through an illegal search of the\n\nMercedes.    After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fIvery’s motion.\n\n           Relying on the officers’ observations of the character of\n\nthe   neighborhood,   Ivery’s   nervousness,   his   possession   of   the\n\nsuspicious plastic bags, and his concealment of the car’s rear\n\nfloorboard, the district court concluded that the officers’ search\n\nwas permissible under Terry, based on their “observations of the\n\nvehicle [and of] Mr. Ivery.”\n\n           While the district court credited Ervin’s testimony that\n\nhe recognized Ivery as someone who had previously run from police,\n\nthe district court did not rely on this testimony.         The district\n\ncourt neither credited nor relied on Ervin’s testimony that during\n\nthe traffic stop officer Chris Hamilton informed Ervin by telephone\n\nthat “there was a white Mercedes that frequents ... the Chinatown\n\narea” whose driver “had assaulted an officer.”         Ivery entered a\n\nconditional guilty plea to the sole count in the indictment on July\n\n2, 2003.\n\n           Ivery stipulated at sentencing that he had three earlier\n\nconvictions for “serious drug offense[s]” within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e).   This led the district court to calculate Ivery’s\n\nsentence under the ACCA. The district court sentenced Ivery to 180\n\nmonths in prison (the minimum sentence required by the ACCA),\n\nfollowed by 60 months of supervised release, and imposed a $100\n\nstatutory assessment. Though the district court made a calculation\n\nof Ivery’s sentence pursuant to the federal Sentencing Guidelines,\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fultimately    the    length   of   Ivery’s    sentence   was   determined   by\n\napplication of the ACCA, not the federal Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThus there was no Booker error.          See United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005) (“The error under Booker is ...\n\nthat the defendant was sentenced under a mandatory Guidelines\n\nsystem.”).\n\n                                      II.\n\n           In Terry, the Supreme Court held that police “may in\n\nappropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a\n\nperson for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior\n\neven though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.”            Terry,\n\n392 U.S. at 22.     We conduct a two-part inquiry to determine whether\n\na search complies with Terry.            First, we evaluate whether the\n\nofficers’ initial interference with the defendant was justified;\n\nsecond, we ask whether the ensuing search was “reasonably related\n\nin scope to the circumstances which justified the officers’ initial\n\ninterference.”       United States v. Nee, 261 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 19-20).            A search is “reasonable”\n\nunder the second part of this test where a law enforcement officer\n\n“conduct[s] a patdown to find weapons that he reasonably believes\n\nor suspects are then in the possession of the person he has\n\naccosted.”    Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93 (1979).            Vehicle\n\nsearches     are    also   permissible      where   officers   “possess[]   a\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\freasonable belief based on ‘specific and articulable facts which\n\n... reasonably warrant’ the officer in believing that the suspect\n\nis dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of ...\n\nweapons” in the vehicle.              Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049\n\n(1982) (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 21).                 Here, the legitimacy of\n\nthe traffic stop is undisputed, so the first part of the Terry test\n\nis satisfied.       Thus the only issue on appeal is whether searching\n\nthe car was permissible under the circumstances. See Nee, 261 F.3d\n\nat 83; United States v. Lott, 870 F.2d 778, 784 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n               In United States v. Lott, we held that the second part of\n\nthe    Terry    test    imposes   a    dual   requirement    for   a   permissible\n\nwarrantless search for weapons: (1) the officers must have actually\n\nharbored a suspicion that the suspect was armed; and (2) that\n\nsuspicion must have been reasonable under the circumstances.                   See\n\nLott, 870 F.2d at 783-84.                Here, the district court credited\n\nCallender’s and Ervin’s testimony that they frisked Ivery and\n\nsearched his car based on their observations of the circumstances\n\nand Ivery’s conduct.          In crediting this testimony, the district\n\ncourt also evidently concluded that the officers testified credibly\n\nthat    they    actually     feared     for     their   safety   based   on   these\n\nobservations.          Ivery contends that one of the professed factual\n\nbases for the officers’ concern –- Hamilton’s statement to Ervin\n\nabout a white Mercedes in the Chinatown area whose driver had\n\nassaulted an officer –- was discredited, so that it was error for\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthe district court to rely on the officers’ remaining testimony.\n\nIvery thus insists that the district court’s finding that the\n\nofficers actually feared for their safety lacked a proper factual\n\npredicate.     We disagree.\n\n          Whether the officers actually feared for their safety is\n\na question of fact.      On appeal from disposition of a motion to\n\nsuppress, we review the district court’s findings of fact only for\n\nclear error.    United States v. Pardue, 385 F.3d 101, 104 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (citing United States v. Maguire, 359 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)); United States v. Watson, 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n“Where evaluations of witnesses’ credibility are concerned, we are\n\nespecially deferential to the district court’s judgment; we may\n\noverturn its decision only if, after reviewing all of the evidence,\n\nwe have a ‘definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\ncommitted.’”     United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   We have no such conviction here, and thus no reason to\n\ndisturb the district court’s factual findings.    The fact that the\n\ndistrict court disbelieved one part of the officers’ testimony but\n\ncredited other parts does not render suspect the district court’s\n\ncredibility finding. Thus, we conclude that the district court did\n\nnot commit clear error in finding that the officers actually feared\n\nfor their safety.1    Having concluded that Lott’s actual suspicion\n\n\n     1\n          Ivery makes a related claim -- that the officers’\nprofessed safety concerns were based solely on the discredited\ntestimony about the phone call from Hamilton. We disagree. Both\n\n                                  -7-\n\frequirement     is    satisfied    here,      we   decline      the    government’s\n\ninvitation to reconsider the continuing validity of that aspect of\n\nLott in light of the Supreme Court’s holding in United States v.\n\nWhren, 517 U.S. 806 (1996).2\n\n          The district court also concluded, as indicated by its\n\nreference to Terry, that Callender’s and Ervin’s suspicions were\n\nreasonable    under     the   circumstances.            Ivery     challenges      this\n\nconclusion    as     well.        The   district        court’s       reasonableness\n\ndetermination is a decision of law based on factual findings.                      We\n\nreview the legal determination of reasonableness de novo.                    Pardue,\n\n385 F.3d at 104;       Maguire, 359 F.3d at 76.            We are mindful that\n\n“[t]he circumstances under which the officers acted ‘are to be\n\nviewed through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer\n\non the scene, guided by his experience and training.’” United\n\nStates v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 112 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Hall, 525 F.2d 857, 859 (D.C. Cir. 1976)).\n\n          The      district   court     relied     on    four   features     of    the\n\nsituation at the time of the search to conclude that the officers’\n\nsuspicion was reasonable: (1) Ivery’s presence in a high-crime\n\n\nCallender and Ervin clearly testified that their suspicions were\nprovoked primarily by their observations of Ivery.\n     2\n          In Whren, the Supreme Court concluded that precedent\n“foreclose[s] any argument that the constitutional reasonableness\nof traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the\nindividual officers involved.” Whren, 517 U.S. at 813. We have\npreviously declined an invitation to address Whren’s effect on\nLott. See Nee, 261 F.3d at 85.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fneighborhood; (2) Ivery’s nervousness; (3) Ivery’s concealment of\n\nthe car’s rear floorboard; and (4) Ivery’s possession of objects\n\nsuggesting illegal conduct. We have previously found circumstances\n\nsimilar    to     each      of    these    features    relevant     to   determining\n\nreasonable suspicion.               See, e.g., Trullo, 809 F.2d at 111-12\n\n(finding “the characteristics of the area in which [officers]\n\nencounter a vehicle” relevant to reasonableness of suspicion);\n\nUnited States v. Gilliard, 847 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1988) (finding\n\nsuspect’s nervousness relevant); United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d\n\n54,   56   (1st      Cir.    1990)      (concluding   that   defendant’s    nervous\n\nmovements and apparent attempt to conceal something supported\n\nreasonable suspicion); United States v. Cook, 277 F.3d 82, 86-87\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (officers’ observation that defendant “appeared to\n\nbe secreting some object in his pants or in the [car] seat beneath\n\nhim” supported reasonable suspicion); United States v. Moore, 235\n\nF.3d 700, 704 (1st Cir. 2000) (concluding suspicion was reasonable\n\nwhere officers observed both defendant “clench[ing] his hand in a\n\nmanner indicating that he was attempting to hide something” and a\n\nnumber of plastic bags in apartment building consistent with drug\n\ntrafficking).\n\n            Though Ivery is correct that any one of these features,\n\nstanding     alone,         may    be   insufficient    to    support     reasonable\n\nsuspicion,      we    have       repeatedly   held    that   when   evaluating   the\n\nvalidity of a Terry stop, we “must consider all of the relevant\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fcircumstances . . . which ‘are not to be dissected and viewed\n\nsingly; rather they must be considered as a whole.’” Gilliard, 847\n\nF.2d at 24-25; see Lott, 870 F.2d at 783; Trullo, 809 F.2d at 111.\n\nNo   case    has    been     brought    to        our    attention     holding     that\n\ncircumstances similar to those surrounding the search of Ivery’s\n\ncar, when viewed as a whole, were insufficient to justify a Terry\n\nsearch.\n\n             The only authority that comes close to supporting Ivery’s\n\nposition is Trullo, in which we observed that our finding of\n\nreasonable    suspicion      “represent[ed]         the    outermost     reach    of   a\n\npermissible Terry stop.”         Trullo, 809 F.2d at 111.                There, this\n\ncourt upheld the district court’s denial of a suppression motion\n\nwhere narcotics officers conducted a Terry stop based on their\n\nobservations of a suspect in a high-crime neighborhood engaging in\n\nseveral     short   conversations       that,       in    their   experience,      were\n\n“indicative of some sort of illegal transaction.”                      Id. at 110-12.\n\nThe court noted that the permissibility of the Terry stop was a\n\n“close” question on the facts of Trullo.                   Id. at 109.     If Trullo\n\nwas a close case, this one is not.                In addition to the high-crime\n\nlocation and nervous behavior, here Ivery was found in possession\n\nof objects suggesting illegal conduct and behaved in a manner that\n\nled the officers to believe he was concealing something.\n\n             Viewing   the    totality       of    the    circumstances     from    the\n\nperspective    of   experienced        police      officers,      we   conclude    that\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fCallender and Ervin had a reasonable basis for suspecting that\n\nIvery might be armed, and thus that their search of Ivery’s car was\n\nvalid under Terry.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          We next address Ivery’s Sixth Amendment challenge to the\n\ndistrict court’s use of Ivery’s prior convictions to enhance his\n\nsentence under the ACCA.      The ACCA enhances the sentence for a\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) to a minimum 15-year term of\n\nimprisonment when the defendant has “three previous convictions ...\n\nfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed\n\non occasions different from one another. . . .”               18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(e)(1) (2000).    At sentencing before the district court, Ivery\n\nstipulated to three prior convictions sufficient to require a\n\nminimum 15 year prison term under the ACCA.\n\n          On appeal, Ivery argues for the first time that the\n\ngovernment’s failure to prove the facts of his prior convictions to\n\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated his Sixth Amendment\n\nrights.   The question here is whether the district court erred in\n\nrelying on Ivery’s stipulations, rather than a jury finding, to\n\nestablish the existence of the prior convictions for ACCA purposes.\n\nIvery did not present his Sixth Amendment argument to the district\n\ncourt.     Thus,    we   review   the    district   court’s    sentencing\n\ndetermination for plain error.     United States v. Colon-Munoz, 192\n\nF.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied 529 U.S. 1055 (2000).\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            Ivery relies on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), in his\n\nfirst supplemental brief, and United States v. Booker in his second\n\nsupplemental brief. None of these cases supports Ivery’s position.\n\nIn Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that “[o]ther than the fact of\n\na prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\n\nbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”                    530 U.S. at 490\n\n(emphasis    added).      Apprendi’s       explicit     exemption    of   sentence\n\nenhancements based on prior criminal convictions from the scope of\n\nits constitutional holding left intact the Supreme Court’s earlier\n\ndecision in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224\n\n(1998).     There, the Court endorsed treating prior convictions as\n\nsentencing    factors    rather     than     elements      of   federal   criminal\n\noffenses.     See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U.S. at 226-27, 247.                  “We\n\nhave ruled with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that,\n\ngiven the explicit exception and force of Almendarez-Torres, the\n\nrationale    of   Apprendi   does      not    apply   to   sentence-enhancement\n\nprovisions based upon prior criminal convictions.”                  United States\n\nv.

Even where there\n\nare disputes concerning prior convictions, a jury trial is not\n\nrequired when the ACCA predicate question can be resolved by “the\n\nterms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or\n\ntranscript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the\n\nfactual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to\n\nsome comparable judicial record of this information.” Shepard, ___\n\nU.S. at ___, 125 S.

See Shepard, ___ U.S. at ___, 125 S.\n\nCt. at 1262-63 (emphasizing that its holding only “limit[s] the\n\nscope of judicial factfinding on the disputed ... character of a\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fprior plea” undertaken to determine ACCA applicability) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n           Ivery insists, relying on Justice Thomas’s concurrence in\n\nShepard, that Almendarez-Torres is inconsistent with Apprendi and\n\nBooker.   See Shepard, ___ U.S. at ___, 125 S. Ct. at 1264 (Thomas,\n\nJ., concurring) (advising that “in an appropriate case, this Court\n\nshould consider Almendarez-Torres’ continuing viability”).            We\n\ndisagree. The Shepard majority noted the possibility that Apprendi\n\nmay eventually be extended to require proof of prior convictions to\n\na jury, but cautioned that this “is up to the future to show.”        See\n\nid., ___ U.S. at ___, 125 S.

The plea was conditioned on Ivery's retention of the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress a firearm and ammunition police recovered while searching Ivery's vehicle during a traffic stop. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) (2005). In addition to appealing the denial of the motion to suppress, Ivery challenges the district court's enhancement of his sentence under the ACCA. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary question here goes to the scope of permissible police authority under <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts found by the district court are as follows: Around 6:00 AM on August 11, 2002, Boston city police officer Grant Callender was on duty in Boston's Chinatown, an area known for drug-related crime, when he observed Ivery driving a white Mercedes with no front license plate and a partially detached rear license plate. Callender pulled Ivery over two blocks later, where he was joined by officer Kevin Ervin. While approaching Ivery's vehicle (Callender from the rear and Ervin from the front), the officers noticed that Ivery was leaning to the right; that Ivery's glove compartment was open, revealing \"a box of ... plastic sandwich bags sticking out from the glove box[;]\"; and that both front seats of Ivery's car were fully reclined, obscuring the car's rear floorboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still standing near the Mercedes with Ivery inside, Ervin told Callender that he recognized Ivery as a person who had previously fled from police. Hearing this, Ivery interjected \"I don't run from the police\" in a \"quivering\" voice. Both officers said that Ivery appeared nervous; Callender noted that Ivery was \"actually shaking ... his hands were shaking.\" After this verbal exchange, Callender instructed Ivery to exit the car, frisked him, found nothing, and then directed Ivery to the rear of the car where Ervin was standing. Callender next \"frisked\" the inside of the Mercedes, searching the front and rear compartments, floorboards, and finally behind an armrest in the center of the rear seat-back, where he found a loaded pistol. When Callender emerged, Ivery unsuccessfully attempted to flee and was placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2002, Ivery was indicted in one count for unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition by a person previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). Ivery moved to suppress the pistol and ammunition on Fourth Amendment grounds, arguing that they were obtained through an illegal search of the Mercedes. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Ivery's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the officers' observations of the character of the neighborhood, Ivery's nervousness, his possession of the suspicious plastic bags, and his concealment of the car's rear floorboard, the district court concluded that the officers' search was permissible under <i>Terry,</i> based on their \"observations of the vehicle [and of] Mr. Ivery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court credited Ervin's testimony that he recognized Ivery as someone who had previously run from police, the district court did not rely on this testimony. The district court neither credited nor relied on Ervin's testimony that during the traffic stop officer Chris Hamilton informed Ervin by telephone that \"there was a white Mercedes that frequents... the Chinatown area\" whose driver \"had assaulted an officer.\" Ivery entered a conditional guilty plea to the sole count in the indictment on July 2, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ivery stipulated at sentencing that he had three earlier convictions for \"serious drug offense[s]\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). This led the district court to calculate Ivery's sentence under the ACCA. The district court sentenced Ivery to 180 months in prison (the minimum sentence required by the ACCA), followed by 60 months of supervised release, and imposed a $100 statutory assessment. Though the district court made a calculation of Ivery's sentence pursuant to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, ultimately the length of Ivery's sentence was determined by application of the ACCA, not the federal Sentencing Guidelines. Thus there was no <i>Booker</i> error. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005) (\"The error under <i>Booker</i> is ... that the defendant was sentenced under a <i>mandatory</i> Guidelines system.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Terry,</i> the Supreme Court held that police \"may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\" <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868. We conduct a two-part inquiry to determine whether a search complies with <i>Terry.</i> First, we evaluate whether the officers' initial interference with the defendant was justified; second, we ask whether the ensuing search was \"reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the officers' initial interference.\" <i>United States v. Nee,</i> 261 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868). A search is \"reasonable\" under the second part of this test where a law enforcement officer \"conduct[s] a patdown to find weapons that he reasonably believes or suspects are then in the possession of the person he has accosted.\" <i>Ybarra v. Illinois,</i> 444 U.S. 85, 93, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979). Vehicle searches are also permissible where officers \"possess[] a reasonable belief based on `specific and articulable facts which ... reasonably warrant' the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of ... weapons\" in the vehicle. <i>Michigan v. Long,</i> 463 U.S. 1032, 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) (quoting <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868). Here, the legitimacy of the traffic stop is undisputed, so the first part of the <i>Terry</i> test is satisfied. Thus the only issue on appeal is whether searching the car was permissible under the circumstances. <i>See Nee,</i> 261 F.3d at 83; <i>United States v. Lott,</i> 870 F.2d 778, 784 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Lott,</i> we held that the second part of the <i>Terry</i> test imposes a dual requirement for a permissible warrantless search for weapons: (1) the officers must have actually harbored a suspicion that the suspect was armed; and (2) that suspicion must have been reasonable under the circumstances. <i>See Lott,</i> 870 F.2d at 783-84. Here, the district court credited Callender's and Ervin's testimony that they frisked Ivery and searched his car based on their observations of the circumstances and Ivery's conduct. In crediting this testimony, the district court also evidently concluded that the officers testified credibly that they actually feared for their safety based on these observations. Ivery contends that one of the professed factual bases for the officers' concern &#8212; Hamilton's statement to Ervin about a white Mercedes in the Chinatown area whose driver had assaulted an officer &#8212; was discredited, so that it was error for the district court to rely on the officers' remaining testimony. Ivery thus insists that the district court's finding that the officers actually feared for their safety lacked a proper factual predicate. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the officers actually feared for their safety is a question of fact. On appeal from disposition of a motion to suppress, we review the district court's findings of fact only for clear error. <i>United States v. Pardue,</i> 385 F.3d 101, 104 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> 359 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.2004)); <i>United States v. Watson,</i> 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1996). \"Where evaluations of witnesses' credibility are concerned, we are especially deferential to the district court's judgment; we may overturn its decision only if, after reviewing all of the evidence, we have a `definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.' \"<i>United States v. Jones,</i> 187 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir.1999). We have no such conviction here, and thus no reason to disturb the district court's factual findings. The fact that the district court disbelieved one part of the officers' testimony but credited other parts does not render suspect the district court's credibility finding. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the officers actually feared for their safety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Having concluded that <i>Lott</i>'s actual suspicion requirement is satisfied here, we decline the government's invitation to reconsider the continuing validity of that aspect of <i>Lott</i> in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Whren v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also concluded, as indicated by its reference to <i>Terry,</i> that Callender's and Ervin's suspicions were reasonable under the circumstances. Ivery challenges this conclusion as well. The district court's reasonableness determination is a decision of law based on factual findings. We review the legal determination of reasonableness de novo. <i>Pardue,</i> 385 F.3d at 104; <i>Maguire,</i> 359 F.3d at 76. We are mindful that \"[t]he circumstances under which the officers acted `are to be viewed through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the scene, guided by his experience and training.'\" <i>United States v. Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d 108, 112 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting <i>United States v. Hall,</i> 525 F.2d 857, 859 (D.C.Cir.1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied on four features of the situation at the time of the search to conclude that the officers' suspicion was reasonable: (1) Ivery's presence in a high-crime neighborhood; (2) Ivery's nervousness; (3) Ivery's concealment of the car's rear floorboard; and (4) Ivery's possession of objects suggesting illegal conduct. We have previously found circumstances similar to each of these features relevant to determining reasonable suspicion. <i>See, e.g., Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 111-12 (finding \"the characteristics of the area in which [officers] encounter a vehicle\" relevant to reasonableness of suspicion); <i>United States v. Gilliard,</i> 847 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1988) (finding suspect's nervousness relevant); <i>United States v. Stanley,</i> 915 F.2d 54, 56 (1st Cir.1990) (concluding that defendant's nervous movements and apparent attempt to conceal something supported reasonable suspicion); <i>United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 86-87 (1st Cir.2002) (officers' observation that defendant \"appeared to be secreting some object in his pants or in the [car] seat beneath him\" supported reasonable suspicion); <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 235 F.3d 700, 704 (1st Cir.2000) (concluding suspicion was reasonable where officers observed both defendant \"clench[ing] his hand in a manner indicating that he was attempting to hide something\" and a number of plastic bags in apartment building consistent with drug trafficking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Ivery is correct that any one of these features, standing alone, may be insufficient to support reasonable suspicion, we have repeatedly held that when evaluating the validity of a <i>Terry</i> stop, we \"must consider all of the relevant circumstances ... which `are not to be dissected and viewed singly; rather they must be considered as a whole.'\" <i>Gilliard,</i> 847 F.2d at 24-25; <i>see Lott,</i> 870 F.2d at 783; <i>Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 111. No case has been brought to our attention holding that circumstances similar to those surrounding the search of Ivery's car, when viewed as a whole, were insufficient to justify a <i>Terry</i> search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only authority that comes close to supporting Ivery's position is <i>Trullo,</i> in which we observed that our finding of reasonable suspicion \"represent[ed] the outermost reach of a permissible <i>Terry</i> stop.\" <i>Trullo,</i> 809 F.2d at 111. There, this court upheld the district court's denial of a suppression motion where narcotics officers conducted a <i>Terry</i> stop based on their observations of a suspect in a high-crime neighborhood engaging in several short conversations that, in their experience, were \"indicative of some sort of illegal transaction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110-12. The court noted that the permissibility of the <i>Terry</i> stop was a \"close\" question on the facts of <i>Trullo. Id.</i> at 109. If <i>Trullo</i> was a close case, this one is not. In addition to the high-crime location and nervous behavior, here Ivery was found in possession of objects suggesting illegal conduct and behaved in a manner that led the officers to believe he was concealing something.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of experienced police officers, we conclude that Callender and Ervin had a reasonable basis for suspecting that Ivery might be armed, and thus that their search of Ivery's car was valid under <i>Terry.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next address Ivery's Sixth Amendment challenge to the district court's use of Ivery's prior convictions to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. The ACCA enhances the sentence for a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) to a minimum 15-year term of imprisonment when the defendant has \"three previous convictions... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) (2000). At sentencing before the district court, Ivery stipulated to three prior convictions sufficient to require a minimum 15 year prison term under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ivery argues for the first time that the government's failure to prove the facts of his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated his Sixth Amendment rights. The question here is whether the district court erred in relying on Ivery's stipulations, rather than a jury finding, to establish the existence of the prior convictions for ACCA purposes. Ivery did not present his Sixth Amendment argument to the district court. Thus, we review the district court's sentencing determination for plain error. <i>United States v. Colon-Munoz,</i> 192 F.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied</i> 529 U.S. 1055, 120 S.Ct. 1559, 146 L.Ed.2d 463 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ivery relies on <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in his first supplemental brief, and <i>United States v. Booker</i> in his second supplemental brief. None of these cases supports Ivery's position. In <i>Apprendi,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[<i>o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,</i> any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (emphasis added). <i>Apprendi</i>'s explicit exemption of sentence enhancements based on prior criminal convictions from the scope of its constitutional holding left intact the Supreme Court's earlier decision in <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). There, the Court endorsed treating prior convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of federal criminal offenses. <i>See Almendarez-Torres,</i> 523 U.S. at 226-27, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219. \"We have ruled with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that, given the explicit exception and force of <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> the rationale of <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply to sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions.\" <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 286 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir.2002). Nothing in <i>Blakely</i> or <i>Booker</i> alters the continuing vitality of the <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> exception to <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Blakely</i> relied on <i>Apprendi</i> to invalidate a state statutory sentencing scheme and reasserted <i>Apprendi</i>'s admonition that the Sixth Amendment requires proof to a jury of all facts affecting punishment \"other than the fact of a prior conviction.\" 542 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 2536 (quoting <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348). The <i>Booker</i> Court, applying <i>Apprendi</i> to hold the federal Sentencing Guidelines constitutionally invalid to the extent that they are mandatory, also took care to leave the \"prior conviction\" exception intact. <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. at ___, 125 S.Ct. at 756 (requiring proof to a jury of \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction)\" that supports a sentencing enhancement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed the scope of the prior conviction exception in <i>Shepard v.

Even where there are disputes concerning prior convictions, a jury trial is not required when the ACCA predicate question can be resolved by \"the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\" <i>Shepard,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 125 S.Ct. at 1263.

Callender pulled Ivery over two blocks later, where he was joined by officer Kevin Ervin. While approaching Ivery's vehicle (Callender from the rear and Ervin from the front), the officers noticed that Ivery was leaning to the right; that Ivery's glove compartment was open, revealing \"a box of ... plastic sandwich bags sticking out from the glove box[;]\"; and that both front seats of Ivery's car were fully reclined, obscuring the car's rear floorboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still standing near the Mercedes with Ivery inside, Ervin told Callender that he recognized Ivery as a person who had previously fled from police. Hearing this, Ivery interjected \"I don't run from the police\" in a \"quivering\" voice. Both officers said that Ivery appeared nervous; Callender noted that Ivery was \"actually shaking ... his hands were shaking.\" After this verbal exchange, Callender instructed Ivery to exit the car, frisked him, found nothing, and then directed Ivery to the rear of the car where Ervin was standing. Callender next \"frisked\" the inside of the Mercedes, searching the front and rear compartments, floorboards, and finally behind an armrest in the center of the rear seat-back, where he found a loaded pistol. When Callender emerged, Ivery unsuccessfully attempted to flee and was placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2002, Ivery was indicted in one count for unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition by a person previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). Ivery moved to suppress the pistol and ammunition on Fourth Amendment grounds, arguing that they were obtained through an illegal search of the Mercedes. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Ivery's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the officers' observations of the character of the neighborhood, Ivery's nervousness, his possession of the suspicious plastic bags, and his concealment of the car's rear floorboard, the district court concluded that the officers' search was permissible under <i>Terry,</i> based on their \"observations of the vehicle [and of] Mr. Ivery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court credited Ervin's testimony that he recognized Ivery as someone who had previously run from police, the district court did not rely on this testimony. The district court neither credited nor relied on Ervin's testimony that during the traffic stop officer Chris Hamilton informed Ervin by telephone that \"there was a white Mercedes that frequents... the Chinatown area\" whose driver \"had assaulted an officer.\" Ivery entered a conditional guilty plea to the sole count in the indictment on July 2, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ivery stipulated at sentencing that he had three earlier convictions for \"serious drug offense[s]\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). This led the district court to calculate Ivery's sentence under the ACCA. The district court sentenced Ivery to 180 months in prison (the minimum sentence required by the ACCA), followed by 60 months of supervised release, and imposed a $100 statutory assessment. Though the district court made a calculation of Ivery's sentence pursuant to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, ultimately the length of Ivery's sentence was determined by application of the ACCA, not the federal Sentencing Guidelines. Thus there was no <i>Booker</i> error. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus the only issue on appeal is whether searching the car was permissible under the circumstances. <i>See Nee,</i> 261 F.3d at 83; <i>United States v. Lott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520294\"><a href=\"/opinion/520294/united-states-v-george-e-lott-and-edward-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 784 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Lott,</i> we held that the second part of the <i>Terry</i> test imposes a dual requirement for a permissible warrantless search for weapons: (1) the officers must have actually harbored a suspicion that the suspect was armed; and (2) that suspicion must have been reasonable under the circumstances. <i>See Lott,</i> 870 F.2d at 783-84. Here, the district court credited Callender's and Ervin's testimony that they frisked Ivery and searched his car based on their observations of the circumstances and Ivery's conduct. In crediting this testimony, the district court also evidently concluded that the officers testified credibly that they actually feared for their safety based on these observations. Ivery contends that one of the professed factual bases for the officers' concern &#8212; Hamilton's statement to Ervin about a white Mercedes in the Chinatown area whose driver had assaulted an officer &#8212; was discredited, so that it was error for the district court to rely on the officers' remaining testimony. Ivery thus insists that the district court's finding that the officers actually feared for their safety lacked a proper factual predicate.

We have no such conviction here, and thus no reason to disturb the district court's factual findings. The fact that the district court disbelieved one part of the officers' testimony but credited other parts does not render suspect the district court's credibility finding. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the officers actually feared for their safety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Having concluded that <i>Lott</i>'s actual suspicion requirement is satisfied here, we decline the government's invitation to reconsider the continuing validity of that aspect of <i>Lott</i> in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Whren v.

At sentencing before the district court, Ivery stipulated to three prior convictions sufficient to require a minimum 15 year prison term under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ivery argues for the first time that the government's failure to prove the facts of his prior convictions to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated his Sixth Amendment rights. The question here is whether the district court erred in relying on Ivery's stipulations, rather than a jury finding, to establish the existence of the prior convictions for ACCA purposes. Ivery did not present his Sixth Amendment argument to the district court. Thus, we review the district court's sentencing determination for plain error. <i>United States v.
