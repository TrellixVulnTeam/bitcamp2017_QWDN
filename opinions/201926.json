This appeal involves a\n\nKurdish Syrian who came to the United States 17 years ago and has\n\nbeen living here illegally ever since.          Notwithstanding his long\n\nresidence in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security\n\nis endeavoring to remove him to Syria.          Finding no error by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals in rejecting his claim for relief from\n\nremoval, we deny his petition for review.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           The    IJ   who   heard   Adnan   Sulaiman's    case   found   his\n\ntestimony to be credible.      We therefore take his assertions before\n\nthe IJ as true in setting forth the facts of the case.\n\n           Sulaiman is a 57-year-old Syrian citizen of Kurdish\n\ndescent.   While he was growing up and throughout his adult life in\n\nSyria, he suffered discrimination at the hands of the ruling Ba'ath\n\nParty, which suppresses Kurdish nationalism among Syrian Kurds.\n\nThe Ba'athists denied Sulaiman the opportunity to get a public\n\neducation and, to some degree, frustrated his efforts to find\n\nemployment.      Sulaiman did obtain a privately financed education,\n\nand went on to find work for a Syrian company.            While at that job\n\nhe was harassed by government security forces who attempted to\n\ncoerce him into hiring Ba'ath party members to positions in the\n\ncompany, and who tried to extract benefits -- use of company cars,\n\nfree gasoline, and the like -- by threatening Sulaiman with harm if\n\nhe did not comply.       At some point in 1987, he was detained and\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fharassed for a full day by government security forces, which the IJ\n\nacknowledged must have been a \"fearful experience\" for him.             After\n\nhe was released from that detention he experienced increased\n\nharassment from security forces.            He received this treatment\n\nbecause of his Kurdish origin and his membership in the Kurdish\n\nDemocratic Party, a separatist organization disfavored by the\n\nSyrian government because it advocates independence for Syrian\n\nKurds.\n\n           As a result of the harassment, Sulaiman decided to leave\n\nSyria.   He obtained a tourist visa from the U.S. embassy in Syria\n\nand in June 1988 came to the United States.         His visa soon expired,\n\nbut Sulaiman stayed on.       Many years later, he was located by what\n\nwas then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) during a\n\nround-up of potentially removable aliens that the INS conducted in\n\nthe days following the attacks of September 11, 2001.          The INS, now\n\nthe   Department    of   Homeland    Security      (DHS),    began    removal\n\nproceedings.   Sulaiman requested withholding of removal and relief\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\n           The Immigration Judge (IJ) who heard his case noted that\n\nSulaiman   would   not   be   eligible    for   asylum   because,    with   few\n\nexceptions, an application for asylum is barred if not filed within\n\none year of a petitioner's arrival in the United States, and\n\nSulaiman did not allege that his case met any of the exceptions.\n\nThe IJ therefore concluded that the only issue facing it was\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwhether Sulaiman had demonstrated a \"clear probability\" that he\n\nwould suffer from either persecution (meriting withholding of\n\nremoval) or torture (meriting relief under the CAT) if he returned\n\nto Syria.    While expressing sympathy for the petitioner, given the\n\nlength of time he had resided in the United States, the IJ found\n\nthat the requirements for relief had not been met.    Sulaiman, the\n\nIJ noted, suffered no physical harm at the hands of government\n\nsecurity forces while in Syria, and his stories of harassment were\n\nnot sufficient to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that\n\nhe would suffer persecution or torture upon his return.        The IJ\n\ngranted voluntary departure.\n\n            Sulaiman timely appealed to the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals, which adopted the opinion of the IJ and affirmed her\n\ndecision.    Sulaiman now appeals the decision of the Board.\n\n                             II. Analysis\n\n            Sulaiman raises a number of issues in his petition.    He\n\ncontends that the IJ should have made a finding as to whether\n\nSulaiman experienced past persecution, should have admitted and\n\nconsidered certain evidence, should have applied a different legal\n\nstandard, and in any event reached the wrong conclusion on the\n\nfacts presented.    We review each claim in turn, finding no error.\n\nWe note at the outset that, while we normally review the decisions\n\nof the Board, not of the IJ, the Board here adopted the opinion of\n\nthe IJ.     We therefore review the opinion of the IJ as if it were\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat of Board.   Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\nA.        Sufficiency of the IJ's Opinion\n\n          Sulaiman faults the IJ for failing to make specific\n\nfindings as to whether or not he suffered from past persecution.\n\nHe also complains that the IJ did not thoroughly consider the State\n\nDepartment country report for Syria.        These claims go to the\n\nsufficiency of the IJ's opinion to support meaningful review,\n\nrather than to the procedures the IJ employed at the hearing or to\n\nthe merits of the decision.   On a challenge to the sufficiency of\n\nan opinion, the usual remedy is remand, which we will order \"if the\n\nBIA's opinion fails to state with sufficient particularity and\n\nclarity the reasons\" for denying relief.    Xu v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d\n\n45, 49 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Halo v. Gonzales, 419 F.3d 15, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n          Sulaiman cites El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 203\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), in support of his argument that the IJ should have\n\nmade a specific finding as to whether he suffered from past\n\npersecution.   El Moraghy indicates that a finding with respect to\n\npast persecution may be necessary under some circumstances. It did\n\nnot by any means create a per se rule requiring an explicit holding\n\nas to every factor that an IJ might find relevant in making a\n\ndetermination.   This is because, \"[w]hen considering whether the\n\nclarity of an administrative decision is sufficient to support our\n\n\n                                -5-\n\freview, . . . we are not . . . oblivious of the record on which it\n\nis based.\"    Xu, 424 F.3d at 49.              An IJ is obligated to offer more\n\nexplanation when the record suggests strong arguments for the\n\npetitioner that the IJ has not considered, see, e.g., Halo, 419\n\nF.3d 15; Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 1998), but that is\n\nnot the case here.\n\n            The     IJ,    it   is    true,    did     not   use    the    phrase     \"past\n\npersecution.\" It is nevertheless evident from her opinion that she\n\nfound no indication that Sulaiman's experiences in Syria amounted\n\nto persecution under the withholding of removal statute.                         The IJ's\n\nopinion indicates with clarity that she considered Sulaiman's\n\ntestimony as to his experiences in Syria and concluded that they\n\ndid not justify a finding that it was more likely than not that he\n\nwould be persecuted if he returned to Syria.                   We do not require an\n\nIJ   to    intone    any     magic     words        before   we     will    review     her\n\ndetermination.       See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n            Sulaiman also claims that the IJ did not sufficiently\n\nconsider the Department of State country report that Sulaiman\n\nsubmitted into evidence, but this claim also fails for similar\n\nreasons.    The IJ asserted, though in a bare fashion, that she had\n\nconsidered    the     country        report:       \"The   Court,\"    she    said,      \"has\n\nconsidered     the    Department        of     State      reports    put    in   by    the\n\nGovernment.\"      Although that is the only mention of the report in\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fthe opinion, it is enough to satisfy a reviewing court that the IJ\n\ndid in fact consider it.    Had the contents of the report rendered\n\nthe IJ's opinion sufficiently unclear by casting doubt on the\n\nreasoning of her decision, we would remand for clarification.   But\n\nnothing in the State Department report suggests that Sulaiman would\n\nbe more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured if he returned\n\nto Syria, and we therefore require no more detailed explanation\n\nfrom the IJ than she offered.\n\nB.        Exclusion of Evidence\n\n          Sulaiman offered certain documents into evidence one day\n\nlate, and the court chose not to admit the evidence.      We review\n\nprocedural decisions at the hearing level for abuse of discretion,\n\nGalicia v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 446, 447-48 (1st Cir. 2005), and we\n\nfind no such abuse here.1   The documents were untimely submitted.\n\nWhat is more, the IJ examined the proffered material, and noted\n\nthat none of it was probative of Sulaiman's claim.    That being the\n\ncase, she found there was no good reason to make an exception to\n\nthe filing deadline in Sulaiman's case.    Her considered procedural\n\ndecision was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The government contends that Sulaiman waived the argument\nthat the IJ abused her discretion with respect to the late evidence\nbecause he did not raise it before the Board. We see no need to\ndecide whether there was waiver, however, because the argument is\nclearly meritless.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fC.         Applicable Legal Standard\n\n           Sulaiman contends that the IJ applied the wrong standard\n\nin reviewing his claim under the CAT, because the IJ said that, in\n\norder to grant relief, she needed to find a \"clear probability\"\n\nthat he would be tortured if he returned to Syria.   This, however,\n\nis the correct standard. \"Clear probability\" simply means \"more\n\nlikely than not,\" which is the correct standard for the IJ to apply\n\nto the relevant claims.     See INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30\n\n(1984).   Sulaiman's contention is meritless.\n\nD.         The Merits\n\n           We review the determinations of the Board or an IJ under\n\na deferential standard, which permits us to reverse \"only if the\n\npetitioner's evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to\n\nconclude that relief was warranted.\"    Xu, 424 F.3d at 48 (quoting\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n           A petitioner's burden of proof for withholding of removal\n\nand relief under the CAT is high: the petitioner has to show that\n\nit is more likely than not that he will be persecuted or tortured\n\nin his country of origin.   Sulaiman's account of his life in Syria,\n\nwhich the IJ did deem credible, is an account of significant\n\nharassment, but the IJ could reasonably have concluded that the\n\nevents he recounted did not rise to the level of persecution\n\nrequired by the withholding of removal statute, and there is no\n\nindication of specific threats against him that would give rise to\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fan inference that he would probably suffer persecution or torture\n\nif he returned to Syria.   Because the IJ did not act unreasonably\n\nin finding that Sulaiman had not met his burden of proof, we affirm\n\nher decision.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny Sulaiman's petition\n\nfor review and affirm the decision of the Board.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Stevic,</i> 467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). Sulaiman's contention is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

Notwithstanding his long residence in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security is endeavoring to remove him to Syria. Finding no error by the Board of Immigration Appeals in rejecting his claim for relief from removal, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ who heard Adnan Sulaiman's case found his testimony to be credible. We therefore take his assertions before the IJ as true in setting forth the facts of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman is a 57-year-old Syrian citizen of Kurdish descent. While he was growing up and throughout his adult life in Syria, he suffered discrimination at the hands of the ruling Ba'ath Party, which suppresses Kurdish nationalism among Syrian Kurds. The Ba'athists denied Sulaiman the opportunity to get a public education and, to some degree, frustrated his efforts to find employment. Sulaiman did obtain a privately financed education, and went on to find work for a Syrian company. While at that job he was harassed by government security forces who attempted to coerce him into hiring Ba'ath party members to positions in the company, and who tried to extract benefits &#8212; use of company cars, free gasoline, and the like &#8212; by threatening Sulaiman with harm if he did not comply. At some point in 1987, he was detained and harassed for a full day by government security forces, which the IJ acknowledged must have been a \"fearful experience\" for him. After he was released from that detention he experienced increased harassment from security forces. He received this treatment because of his Kurdish origin and his membership in the Kurdish Democratic Party, a separatist organization disfavored by the Syrian government because it advocates independence for Syrian Kurds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the harassment, Sulaiman decided to leave Syria. He obtained a tourist visa from the U.S. embassy in Syria and in June 1988 came to the United States. His visa soon expired, but Sulaiman stayed on. Many years later, he was located by what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) during a round-up of potentially removable aliens that the INS conducted in the days following the attacks of September 11, 2001. The INS, now the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), began removal proceedings. Sulaiman requested withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (IJ) who heard his case noted that Sulaiman would not be eligible for asylum because, with few exceptions, an application for asylum is barred if not filed within one year of a petitioner's arrival in the United States, and Sulaiman did not allege that his case met any of the exceptions. The IJ therefore concluded that the only issue facing it was whether Sulaiman had demonstrated a \"clear probability\" that he would suffer from either persecution (meriting withholding of removal) or torture (meriting relief under the CAT) if he returned to Syria. While expressing sympathy for the petitioner, given the length of time he had resided in the United States, the IJ found that the requirements for relief had not been met. Sulaiman, the IJ noted, suffered no physical harm at the hands of government security forces while in Syria, and his stories of harassment were not sufficient to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would suffer persecution or torture upon his return. The IJ granted voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman timely appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which adopted the opinion of the IJ and affirmed her decision. Sulaiman now appeals the decision of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman raises a number of issues in his petition. He contends that the IJ should have made a finding as to whether Sulaiman experienced past persecution, should have admitted and considered certain evidence, should have applied a different legal standard, and in any event reached the wrong conclusion on the facts presented. We review each claim in turn, finding no error. We note at the outset that, while we normally review the decisions of the Board, not of the IJ, the Board here adopted the opinion of the IJ. We therefore review the opinion of the IJ as if it were that of Board. <i>Njenga v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201296\"><a href=\"/opinion/201296/njenga-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 338 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sufficiency of the IJ's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman faults the IJ for failing to make specific findings as to whether or not he suffered from past persecution. He also complains that the IJ did not thoroughly consider the State Department country report for Syria. These claims go to the sufficiency of the IJ's opinion to support meaningful review, rather than to the procedures the IJ employed at the hearing or to the merits of the decision. On a challenge to the sufficiency of an opinion, the usual remedy is remand, which we will order \"if the BIA's opinion fails to state with sufficient particularity and clarity the reasons\" for denying relief. <i>Xu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201828\"><a href=\"/opinion/201828/xu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Halo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201773\"><a href=\"/opinion/201773/halo-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2005)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman cites <i>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200506\"><a href=\"/opinion/200506/el-moraghy-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 203 (1st Cir.2003), in support of his argument that the IJ should have made a specific finding as to whether he suffered from past persecution. <i>El Moraghy</i> indicates that a finding with respect to past persecution may be necessary under some circumstances. It did not by any means create a <i>per se</i> rule requiring an explicit holding as to every factor that an IJ might find relevant in making a determination. This is because, \"[w]hen considering whether the clarity of an administrative decision is sufficient to support our review,... we are not ... oblivious of the record on which it is based.\" <i>Xu,</i> 424 F.3d at 49. An IJ is obligated to offer more explanation when the record suggests strong arguments for the petitioner that the IJ has not considered, <i>see, e.g., Halo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201773\"><a href=\"/opinion/201773/halo-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>; <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998), but that is not the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ, it is true, did not use the phrase \"past persecution.\" It is nevertheless evident from her opinion that she found no indication that Sulaiman's experiences in Syria amounted to persecution under the withholding of removal statute. The IJ's opinion indicates with clarity that she considered Sulaiman's testimony as to his experiences in Syria and concluded that they did not justify a finding that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted if he returned to Syria. We do not require an IJ to intone any magic words before we will review her determination. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman also claims that the IJ did not sufficiently consider the Department of State country report that Sulaiman submitted into evidence, but this claim also fails for similar reasons. The IJ asserted, though in a bare fashion, that she had considered the country report: \"The Court,\" she said, \"has considered the Department of State reports put in by the Government.\" Although that is the only mention of the report in the opinion, it is enough to satisfy a reviewing court that the IJ did in fact consider it. Had the contents of the report rendered the IJ's opinion sufficiently unclear by casting doubt on the reasoning of her decision, we would remand for clarification. But nothing in the State Department report suggests that Sulaiman would be more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured if he returned to Syria, and we therefore require no more detailed explanation from the IJ than she offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Exclusion of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman offered certain documents into evidence one day late, and the court chose not to admit the evidence. We review procedural decisions at the hearing level for abuse of discretion, <i>Galicia v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201419\"><a href=\"/opinion/201419/galicia-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 447-48 (1st Cir.2005), and we find no such abuse here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The documents were untimely submitted. What is more, the IJ examined the proffered material, and noted that none of it was probative of Sulaiman's claim. That being the case, she found there was no good reason to make an exception to the filing deadline in Sulaiman's case. Her considered procedural decision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Applicable Legal Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sulaiman contends that the IJ applied the wrong standard in reviewing his claim under the CAT, because the IJ said that, in order to grant relief, she needed to find a \"clear probability\" that he would be tortured if he returned to Syria. This, however, is the correct standard. \"Clear probability\" simply means \"more likely than not,\" which is the correct standard for the IJ to apply to the relevant claims. <i>See INS v.
