Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nU.S. Department of Justice, Michael P. Lindemann, Assistant\nDirector, Office of Immigration Litigation, and Ethan B. Kanter,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                             August 21, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam.    Petitioner Marcel Nehme Younes, a native of\n\nLebanon, came to the United States in May 1988 on a non-immigrant\n\nvisa    conditioned   on   his   attending   school.   That   limitation\n\nnotwithstanding, Younes never attended school, and in September\n\n1988 the Immigration and Naturalization Service began removal\n\nproceedings against Younes for failure to comply with the terms of\n\nhis student visa.     Younes conceded deportatability but applied for\n\npolitical asylum.     There was some preliminary activity on Younes's\n\nremoval case in the period from late 1989 to March 1991, during\n\nwhich time Younes requested and received a number of hearing\n\ncontinuances.    In March 1991, Lebanese aliens as a group became\n\neligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and proceedings on\n\nYounes's case were halted pending the expiration of the TPS decree,\n\nwhich did not occur until 1999.      The hearings resumed briefly that\n\nyear, only to be continued again for want of a translator.            A\n\nmerits hearing on Younes's asylum petition was not convened until\n\n2004.\n\n            At the 2004 asylum hearing, there was some initial\n\nconfusion about Younes's need for a translator.        Younes indicated\n\nthat he spoke English and at the start of the hearing alternated\n\nbetween English and Arabic, but at the urging of the Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) to select a language and stick with it ultimately\n\ndecided to speak in Arabic and avail himself of the benefit of the\n\nnow-present translator.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            At the hearing, Younes testified that in 1988 he was a\n\nmember of Lebanon's Christian Kataeb party and actively worked to\n\neject    Syria      from   Lebanon.         He    alleged   four   incidents    of\n\nmistreatment by members of the Syrian military which he said he was\n\nsubjected      to    on    account    of    his    political    affiliation     and\n\nactivities.         On each occasion, Younes said, he was detained by\n\nSyrian military personnel and beaten. He alleged that on the first\n\nthree occasions he was interrogated about his involvement with\n\nKataeb, while on the fourth, no mention was made of his political\n\nactivities but Younes attested that he believed the beating and\n\nharassment he suffered were directed against him by reason of those\n\nactivities. Younes concluded his testimony by asserting his belief\n\nthat he would be killed if he returned to Lebanon.\n\n            The IJ hearing the case found Younes not to be a credible\n\nwitness. He noted discrepancies between Younes's initial statement\n\nof his reasons for requesting asylum, completed at a time when\n\nYounes   had     recently     arrived      in    the   United   States,   and   the\n\ndescription given by him many years later at his asylum hearing of\n\nthe incidents of harassment and abuse that he claimed to have\n\nexperienced in Lebanon.          First, Younes had described only three\n\nincidents when he first sought asylum in the United States, but at\n\nthe hearing had testified about a fourth occasion, giving the IJ\n\nsome reason to suspect recent post hoc fabrication and casting\n\ndoubt on the veracity of Younes's other accounts.                  Second, Younes\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fhad changed his account of when an alleged third incident had\n\noccurred, initially dating the incident in April 1987 but later\n\nattesting   that   it     had   taken   place   in    October    of   that   year.\n\nFinally, and most significantly, Younes had originally written that\n\nduring the third incident he had been \"pulled . . . out into the\n\nstreet . . . during an exchange of gunfire,\" while in his testimony\n\nYounes indicated that the third incident had consisted in his being\n\ntaken into custody \"from his home and mistreated for six hours\n\nbefore being released.\"         The IJ thought these inconsistencies cast\n\ndoubt upon his story, and that Younes's explanation for them --\n\nthat he had been under stress or otherwise could not remember the\n\ndetails of his encounters with Syrian forces -- was unconvincing.\n\nThe IJ also counted against Younes's credibility as to his fear of\n\npersecution the fact that he had obtained a Lebanese passport\n\nthrough normal channels, had traveled to Syria to obtain a U.S.\n\nvisa from the U.S. embassy there, and had waited months after\n\nobtaining   the    visa    before     departing      for   the   United    States,\n\nsuggesting that his fear of remaining in the country was not as\n\npressing as he indicated.            For these and other reasons, the IJ\n\ndetermined that Younes had not presented a credible account of\n\npersecution.\n\n            Finally,      the   IJ   determined,     following     the    rendered\n\nopinion of the State Department, that even if Younes's account were\n\ntrue, his experiences were merely \"manifestations of the civil war\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fwhich has gripped Lebanon for over a decade rather than persecution\n\nwithin the meaning of the INA.\" This State Department opinion, the\n\nIJ concluded, was consistent with our decisions in Nelson v. INS,\n\n232 F.3d 258 (1st Cir. 2000), and Disu v. Ashcroft, 338 F.3d 13\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), under which, even were his account true, Younes\n\nwould not be entitled to asylum relief.\n\n          We need not reach any question presented regarding the\n\nproper interpretation of the INA, because the IJ's credibility\n\ndetermination settles the matter.             It is an alien's burden to\n\nestablish eligibility for asylum, and to do so the alien must\n\npresent credible evidence that he has suffered persecution in the\n\npast or otherwise fears persecution in the future.             Since Younes's\n\nasylum case rested on his testimony, the credibility of that\n\ntestimony was vital to the case.             Younes therefore can win this\n\nappeal   only   if    he   demonstrates       that    the   IJ's   credibility\n\ndetermination (which, where the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\nsummarily affirms, we review for all relevant purposes as the final\n\ndetermination of the agency, see Keo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 57, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2003)) is not supported by the record.\n\n          Under      the   INA,   we   uphold   the    agency's    credibility\n\ndetermination \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.\"          8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B); see also\n\nKhem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).            That is not the\n\ncase here, as the insufficiently explained inconsistencies in\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fYounes's story, the fact that his exit from Lebanon proceeded at a\n\nslow   pace    and   through   legitimate   channels   with    the   apparent\n\nacquiescence of the government, among and along with other reasons\n\ncited by the IJ, gave the IJ sufficient initial grounds to doubt\n\nYounes's story. Younes's failure to provide corroborating evidence\n\nor an explanation for that failure, despite the fact that he has\n\nbrothers living in the United States and in Canada who could\n\nreasonably have been expected to back up his story, further gave\n\nthe IJ pause, and reasonably so.       Moreover, the fact that Younes's\n\nmother, a third brother, and four sisters continue to live in\n\nLebanon tends to undermine (though does not conclusively discredit)\n\nhis testimony that he believed he would himself be killed upon his\n\nreturn.\n\n              More to the point, Younes has not explained how the\n\nevidence presented compels a contrary result, even if it might\n\nsuggest one.     Because the adverse credibility determination of the\n\nIJ must rest undisturbed unless a plaintiff can show that the IJ\n\nhad no reasonable choice but to conclude other than he did, and\n\nYounes has not attempted such a showing here, our inquiry begins\n\nand ends with the credibility question.\n\n              Younes also raises a secondary claim on due process\n\ngrounds, contending that his rights were violated when the IJ\n\nfailed to grant him a continuance in order to bring in an expert\n\nwitness, but there is nothing to this argument.               Where Younes's\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcounsel asked to present an expert witness and indicated that the\n\nexpert was not immediately available, the IJ asked counsel to\n\ndescribe the material that would be presented by the expert.\n\nCounsel indicated that the expert would testify that conditions in\n\nLebanon had not improved and may have worsened during Younes's time\n\nin the United States, without giving any indication that the expert\n\nknew anything about Younes in particular.\n\n           The IJ's final decision rested on Younes's credibility,\n\nmeaning that the IJ disposed of Younes's case without needing to\n\nreach the question of current conditions in Lebanon.     The expert\n\ntestimony was not relevant to these grounds for the decision, and\n\nany error therefore did not prejudice Younes and so did not render\n\nhis hearing fundamentally unfair.1     See Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358\n\nF.3d 118, 129 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.   The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Nor is there any reason to conclude, on the basis of Younes's\nsubmission, that there was any error at all on the IJ's part in his\nhandling of the proposed expert testimony. Younes suggests that\nrelevant objections were entered by counsel and that a request for\na continuance was made and improperly denied, but not only is all\nof this irrelevant, as discussed in the text, it is far from clear\nthat any of it is even so: Younes provides no convincing citation\nto the record in support of any of these propositions. So too with\nYounes's claims that his right to a competent translator was\ntrampled on.      By all appearances, notwithstanding Younes's\nunsupported protestations on this appeal, the translator provided\nwas thoroughly competent.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

Where Younes's\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcounsel asked to present an expert witness and indicated that the\n\nexpert was not immediately available, the IJ asked counsel to\n\ndescribe the material that would be presented by the expert.\n\nCounsel indicated that the expert would testify that conditions in\n\nLebanon had not improved and may have worsened during Younes's time\n\nin the United States, without giving any indication that the expert\n\nknew anything about Younes in particular.\n\n           The IJ's final decision rested on Younes's credibility,\n\nmeaning that the IJ disposed of Younes's case without needing to\n\nreach the question of current conditions in Lebanon.     The expert\n\ntestimony was not relevant to these grounds for the decision, and\n\nany error therefore did not prejudice Younes and so did not render\n\nhis hearing fundamentally unfair.1     See Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200854\"><a href=\"/opinion/200854/mekhoukh-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.   The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Nor is there any reason to conclude, on the basis of Younes's\nsubmission, that there was any error at all on the IJ's part in his\nhandling of the proposed expert testimony. Younes suggests that\nrelevant objections were entered by counsel and that a request for\na continuance was made and improperly denied, but not only is all\nof this irrelevant, as discussed in the text, it is far from clear\nthat any of it is even so: Younes provides no convincing citation\nto the record in support of any of these propositions. So too with\nYounes's claims that his right to a competent translator was\ntrampled on.      By all appearances, notwithstanding Younes's\nunsupported protestations on this appeal, the translator provided\nwas thoroughly competent.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
