R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 05-1011\n\n                        BARRIE LYNN RIBEIRO,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                  JO ANNE BARNHART, COMMISSIONER\n                 SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael J.

After carefully considering the briefs and\n\nrecord on appeal, we affirm the denial of disability benefits.\n\n            The central issue is whether the appellant showed that\n\nher    mental    impairment      satisfied      the    twelve-month       duration\n\nrequirement.      20 C.F.R. § 416.920(a)(4)(ii); Barnhart v. Walton,\n\n535 U.S. 212 (2002); Seavey v. Barnhart, 276 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nSubstantial evidence supported the ALJ’s conclusion that she did\n\nnot.    Among other considerations, the appellant worked for most of\n\nthe    period   of    alleged   disability     preceding     the     hearing,   and\n\nexamining and reviewing sources concluded that treatment would be,\n\nor had been, effective.\n\n            The appellant, who was represented by counsel at the\n\nhearing, argues that the ALJ breached his duty to develop the\n\nrecord    by    not    requesting     more    information     from    a   treating\n\nphysician.      The appellant had the burden of producing the evidence\n\nand proving impairment.         20 C.F.R. § 416.912.         The ALJ had a duty\n\nto “develop an adequate record from which a reasonable conclusion\n\ncan be drawn.”        Carrillo Marin v. Sec’y Health & Human Serv., 758\n\nF.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1985).             The appellant makes no showing,\n\nhowever, that the duration of her impairment defied reasoned\n\nevaluation on the record.        Currier v. Sec’y Health, Ed. & Welfare,\n\n612 F.2d 594 (1st Cir. 1980).           Although her treating physician’s\n\nreport   contained      gaps,   the   extent    of    her   impairment    was   not\n\nundeveloped in the record as a whole.           Moreover, in addition to the\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\faforementioned evidence, the ALJ could reasonably conclude that\n\nrequesting supplemental information would have provided little\n\ninsight.   The appellant stated that she saw the physician only\n\nintermittently, to update her medications, and the vocational\n\nexpert   testified   that   the   marked   limitations   posited   by   the\n\nphysician were inconsistent with the appellant’s job.        20 C.F.R. §\n\n416.927(d)(2).\n\n           Affirmed.   1st Cir.
