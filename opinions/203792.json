Cesar    Quiñones      (“Plaintiff”)\n\nappeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico (Pieras, J.) granting summary judgment\n\nin favor of Defendant, the United States of America.                     Plaintiff’s\n\nclaim, brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”), 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2671 et seq., is essentially that the doctors of the\n\nUnited     States        Veterans     Administration           (“VA”)    negligently\n\nmisdiagnosed his illness as schizophrenia, when in fact he was\n\nsuffering       from     post-traumatic      stress      disorder    (“PTSP”),     and\n\naccordingly failed to treat his illness correctly.                      The district\n\ncourt dismissed the claim because Plaintiff failed to present his\n\nadministrative claim to the VA within two years as required by the\n\nAct.   We affirm.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\n               Plaintiff served in the army from 1964 to 1967 and saw\n\ncombat in the Vietnam War as a medic.                 Since his return from the\n\nVietnam     War,        Plaintiff    has     suffered      difficulty       sleeping,\n\ndepression,        isolative         behavior,        nightmares,        flashbacks,\n\nhallucinations, homelessness, difficulty maintaining employment,\n\nmarital strife, and a suicide attempt.\n\n               Between 1968 and 1983, Plaintiff was diagnosed with\n\nschizophrenia and treated for it on several occasions at the San\n\nJuan Veterans’ Medical Center (“SJVMC”).                   He was hospitalized a\n\nnumber    of    times     during    this   period.       The    diagnosis    for   one\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fhospitalization was “schizophrenic reaction, catatonic type.”                       He\n\nwas treated during hospitalization with a number of medications and\n\npsychotherapy.\n\n            In October 1983, Plaintiff was diagnosed for the first\n\ntime at SJVMC with PTSD, in addition to schizophrenia.                             The\n\ndiagnosis at this time included both schizophrenia and PTSD.\n\nThereafter,    Plaintiff    sought   numerous      times      to    claim    service\n\nconnection for PTSD.      Service connection requires medical evidence\n\ndiagnosing the condition, a link between current symptoms and an\n\nin-service stressor, and credible supporting evidence that the\n\nclaimed in-service stressor occurred.           Plaintiff’s requests were\n\ndenied a number of times, including in June 1994, June 2002, and\n\nJuly 2006.\n\n            On January 20, 1994, Plaintiff received a Compensation\n\nand Pension Exam Report, pursuant to evaluation of his claim for\n\nservice-connected PTSD diagnosis.          In this exam, his diagnosis was\n\n“[s]chizophrenia   undifferentiated        type,    in   remission          of   acute\n\nsystems.”    The report stated, “It is the unanimous opinion of the\n\nBoard that there is no clinical evidence in history or in clinical\n\nevaluation for a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder diagnosis.”\n\n            He received another Compensation and Pension Exam Report\n\nin June 1999 in Florida.         This time, however, the report stated,\n\n“While   the   patient     has    been   diagnosed       as    undifferentiated\n\nschizophrenia,   the     patient’s   symptoms      now   and       description      of\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsymptoms since his time in Vietnam are more consistent with a\n\ndiagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.” The stated diagnosis\n\nwas   PTSD   and        history   of     undifferentiated       schizophrenia.       A\n\nCompensation and Pension Exam Report based on an examination in\n\nSeptember 2000, by a doctor at a VA facility in Florida, concurred\n\nwith the PTSD diagnosis.                The reporting doctor stated, “I agree\n\nwith [the June 1999] assessment that although the patient was\n\ndiagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia during his time in\n\nthe military service, his symptoms now and the description of his\n\nsymptoms since his time in Vietnam are more consistent with that of\n\na   diagnosis      of    posttraumatic         stress   disorder.”     This   report\n\nconcluded,        “Again,     I    do    not     feel   that    the   diagnosis     of\n\nschizophrenia is an accurate one.                I do feel that he suffers from\n\nposttraumatic        stress       disorder,      and    that    accounts    for    his\n\nhallucinations and delusions as well as the depressive component\n\nthat i[s] seen in this patient.”\n\n             In    his     deposition,      Plaintiff     was    asked,    “And   what\n\ndiagnosis did they g[i]ve you at VA in Orlando, VA Hospital.”                       He\n\nanswered, “They both said I had PTSD, not schizophrenia and I was\n\nevaluated twice in [Florida]; once by [Dr. O’Dell] and I don’t\n\nremember the name of the other doctor but they came to the same\n\ndetermination . . . .”\n\n             Plaintiff testified that after his time in Florida he\n\nwent to Panama in 2004, where a private psychiatrist said that he\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fwas being given the wrong medication because the schizophrenia\n\ndiagnosis was incorrect.    In October 2005 Plaintiff requested from\n\nthe VA a copy of his records.\n\n            Plaintiff filed an administrative claim with the VA in\n\nMay 2006.     He claimed medical malpractice for wrongful diagnosis\n\nand treatment and he claimed physical and emotional damages.         He\n\nstated that the VA wrongfully diagnosed him with and treated him\n\nfor schizophrenia.\n\n            After waiting the requisite six months without an agency\n\ndecision on his claim, Plaintiff filed the instant action in May\n\n2007.1    Defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that the\n\ndistrict court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff\n\nfailed to file a timely administrative claim with the VA.            The\n\ndistrict court agreed and entered judgment in favor of Defendant.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n            “Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers     to   interrogatories,    admissions   on   file,   and   any\n\naffidavits.”     Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st\n\nCir. 2008). This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary\n\n\n     1\n      Under the FTCA, a claimant must present his claim to the\nappropriate government agency and await either a final disposition\nof the claim or the passage of six months without such a\ndisposition before filing suit in district court.     28 U.S.C. §\n2675(a).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fjudgment de novo, construing the record evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party.        Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc.,\n\n549 F.3d 851, 855 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The FTCA’s statute of limitations provides, in relevant\n\npart, that “[a] tort claim against the United States shall be\n\nforever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate\n\nFederal agency within two years after such claim accrues.”           28\n\nU.S.C. § 2401(b).      Under the discovery rule, which applies to\n\nmedical malpractice claims, a claim accrues when the plaintiff\n\nknows both the existence and cause of his injury.           McIntyre v.\n\nUnited States, 367 F.3d 38, 51 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Plaintiff filed his administrative claim with the VA in\n\nMay 2006.     As a result, the FTCA statute of limitations bars his\n\nclaim unless his claim accrued within two years prior to such date.\n\nPlaintiff acknowledged in his deposition that in his consultation\n\nat the VA clinic in Orlando in 1999, he was given a diagnosis of\n\n“PTSD, not schizophrenia.”    He acknowledged further that when he\n\nwas evaluated again in Florida the doctors gave him the same\n\ndetermination. Upon his receipt of those pieces of advice that his\n\nearlier schizophrenia diagnosis was incorrect, his claim accrued.\n\nAt that point, he was obligated, in order to preserve his claim, to\n\npresent it in writing within two years to the appropriate Federal\n\nAgency.     28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).   He did not file an administrative\n\nclaim until 2006, which was not timely.        As a result, his claim is\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fbarred.   The district court properly granted summary judgment on\n\nthis ground.\n\n          We have reviewed Plaintiff’s other arguments and find\n\nthem to be without merit.   We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

As a result, the FTCA statute of limitations bars his\n\nclaim unless his claim accrued within two years prior to such date.\n\nPlaintiff acknowledged in his deposition that in his consultation\n\nat the VA clinic in Orlando in 1999, he was given a diagnosis of\n\n“PTSD, not schizophrenia.”    He acknowledged further that when he\n\nwas evaluated again in Florida the doctors gave him the same\n\ndetermination. Upon his receipt of those pieces of advice that his\n\nearlier schizophrenia diagnosis was incorrect, his claim accrued.\n\nAt that point, he was obligated, in order to preserve his claim, to\n\npresent it in writing within two years to the appropriate Federal\n\nAgency.     28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).   He did not file an administrative\n\nclaim until 2006, which was not timely.        As a result, his claim is\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fbarred.   The district court properly granted summary judgment on\n\nthis ground.\n\n          We have reviewed Plaintiff’s other arguments and find\n\nthem to be without merit.   We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f</pre>",
