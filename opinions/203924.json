William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Selya, and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Camille A. McKenna, with whom Mann and Mitchell was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Lee H.\nVilker, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 23, 2009\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. On October 15, 2004, after a four-\n\nday trial, a jury convicted appellant Timi Wallace of various\n\ncrimes related to the September 2000 armed robbery of a firearms\n\nstore in Providence, Rhode Island. He was sentenced to twenty-five\n\nyears in prison (300 months).            Wallace appealed, challenging both\n\nthe validity of his convictions and the sentence imposed by the\n\ntrial   court.     In   a   detailed      opinion,       we   affirmed      Wallace's\n\nconvictions, but held that several sentencing errors required a\n\nremand. See United States v. Wallace, 461 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nAt the resentencing hearing, the district court imposed a 294-month\n\nterm of imprisonment, six months less than its prior sentence.\n\nWallace    now   appeals    for   a    second    time,    raising     a   number   of\n\nchallenges to the sentence imposed by the district court on remand.\n\n            These objections fall into three categories.                      First,\n\nWallace raises for the first time two claims of error that,\n\nalthough they were available to him, he did not pursue in his first\n\nappeal. Second, he explicitly asks us to reconsider two objections\n\nthat we resolved against him in the first appeal.                    We find all of\n\nthe preceding claims barred by the law of the case doctrine.\n\nFinally, Wallace challenges the district court's decision to depart\n\nupwardly from the United States Sentencing Guidelines on the basis\n\nof   his   underrepresented           criminal   history       and    the    extreme\n\npsychological injuries suffered by the victims of the robbery, and\n\nasserts that his sentence, taken as a whole, was unreasonable.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAlthough these last claims are properly before us, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court in all respects.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           Because our opinion in the first appeal describes the\n\noffense,   the   trial,   and   the    first    sentencing      in    detail,      see\n\nWallace, 461 F.3d at 19-24, we limit ourselves to those facts which\n\nare most relevant to his claims of error in this appeal.\n\nA. The Offense\n\n           On September 25, 2000, appellant's brother, Nickoyan\n\nWallace (\"Nickoyan\"), entered a firearms dealership in Providence,\n\nRhode Island, and asked to see certain merchandise.                    The store's\n\nowner, Donn DiBiasio, and his assistant, Donna Gallinelli, were on\n\nduty.   As Gallinelli was retrieving the items that Nickoyan had\n\nrequested,   appellant    entered      the     store,   brandishing          a   semi-\n\nautomatic weapon known as a \"TEC-9.\"            He then ran up to DiBiasio,\n\npointed the gun at him, and yelled \"Don't move.\"                When Gallinelli\n\ntried to escape, Nickoyan drew a handgun which he pointed at her,\n\nordering her to stop.      Next, Nickoyan leapt over the counter and\n\nforced Gallinelli to open the display case, specifically demanding\n\nthat she retrieve certain high-caliber weapons.                 He stole six of\n\nthese high-caliber handguns and, heeding appellant's instruction to\n\nhurry up, fled the store with his brother.\n\n           Although    Nickoyan       was    arrested     and        tried       almost\n\nimmediately, appellant, using a variety of aliases and other\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdeceptive tactics, managed to evade arrest until July 2004.   After\n\na four-day jury trial, he was convicted of obtaining six firearms\n\nby robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count I of the\n\nindictment); conspiracy to obtain the firearms by armed robbery,\n\nalso in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count II); theft of firearms\n\nfrom a federally licensed firearms dealer, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(u) (Count III); and brandishing a firearm during and\n\nin relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count IV).\n\nB. The First Sentencing\n\n          Grouping Counts I and II, the 18 U.S.C. § 1951 charges,\n\nfor a base offense level of 20 under the Guidelines, the pre-\n\nsentence report (\"PSR\") recommended a two-level enhancement for\n\nphysical restraint of victims, a one-level enhancement for theft of\n\na firearm, and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice\n\nthrough perjury, yielding an adjusted offense level of 25.1       For\n\nCount III of the indictment, stealing a firearm from a federally\n\nlicensed dealer, the PSR started at a base offense level of 20.   To\n\nthis base offense level, the PSR added a three-level enhancement\n\nbecause the number of firearms unlawfully received or possessed\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The PSR,    as well as all subsequent court proceedings,\napplied the 1998   Guidelines Manual, and we therefore do the same.\nSee Wallace, 461   F.3d 22 n.3. Accordingly, all references to the\nGuidelines refer   to the 1998 Manual, unless otherwise noted.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fduring the offense was between eight and twelve;2 a two-level\n\nenhancement because the firearms were stolen; and the same two-\n\nlevel       enhancements   for    physical     restraint   of   victims     and\n\nobstruction of justice that were applied to the robbery counts.\n\nThe adjusted offense level for Count III was therefore 29. Because\n\nCounts I - III involved the same victims and conduct, the PSR\n\nadopted the higher of the two offense levels (29).              See Wallace,\n\n461 F.3d at 23 (citing U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b)).            Finally, Count IV of\n\nthe indictment, the brandishing count, carried a mandatory eighty-\n\nfour month (seven-year) consecutive term.\n\n              Since   Wallace    had   no   criminal   convictions,   the   PSR\n\nclassified him as criminal history category I. In combination with\n\nthe adjusted offense level of 29 for Counts I-III, this category\n\nyielded a sentencing range of 87-108 months, to run consecutively\n\nwith the 84 months required by the brandishing count.\n\n              At sentencing, the district court concluded that the\n\nguidelines range calculated by the PSR was inadequate, and decided\n\nto depart upwardly five levels to an offense level of 34.             It also\n\nassigned a criminal history category of III to account for his\n\ncommission of the crime while under indictment for another felony.3\n\n\n     2\n      Although Wallace was convicted of stealing six firearms from\nthe store, the multiple weapons enhancement included the two guns\nthat the defendant and his co-conspirator brandished during the\nrobbery. See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(C); Wallace, 461 F.3d at 35.\n        3\n       As we discuss infra, the district court's finding that\nWallace was under indictment for another felony was erroneous. As\n\n                                       -5-\n\fAll told, the court sentenced appellant to 216 months for Counts I\n\nand II, 120 months for Count III (to be served concurrently with\n\nthe term for Counts I and II), and 84 months for Count IV to be\n\nserved consecutively.   Thus, Wallace received a total sentence of\n\n300 months, or 25 years, in prison.\n\nC. The First Appeal\n\n           In his first appeal, Wallace challenged his convictions\n\nas well as the sentence, both of which he assailed on numerous\n\ngrounds.   Because our reasons for upholding the convictions are\n\nirrelevant to this appeal, we provide a brief summary of the\n\nsentencing portion of our decision only.\n\n           Wallace had argued \"that the sentence was based on error\n\n. . . both in terms of the court's calculation of the advisory\n\nguidelines range and its application of the guidelines provisions\n\nto depart upwardly from that range.\"    461 F.3d at 30.4   We first\n\naddressed Wallace's claims of error in the PSR's recommended\n\nadvisory guidelines range, holding that the district court properly\n\nimposed both the two-level enhancement for the physical restraint\n\nof a victim and the three-level enhancement for the number of\n\n\n\nthe PSR correctly noted, there had been a complaint lodged in\nMassachusetts state court accusing appellant of murdering his own\nbrother, Tasfa Wallace, but the case had not yet proceeded to an\nindictment.\n     4\n       Wallace also challenged the substantive reasonableness of\nhis sentence. Because of our other rulings, we did not need to\nreach this issue on his first appeal.\n\n                                -6-\n\ffirearms       involved    in    the   offense.       We    then    considered     the\n\nsentencing      court's    upward      departure     from    the   guidelines,     and\n\nconcluded that both appellant's use of a dangerous instrumentality\n\nin the commission of the offense and the disruption of government\n\nfunctions caused by appellant's four-year evasion of arrest were\n\nproper grounds for an upward departure.                    However, we also found\n\nthat the sentencing court had erred in upwardly departing on the\n\nbasis of (i) obstruction of justice; (ii) extreme psychological\n\ninjury    to    the   victims     of   the   offense;      (iii)    facilitation    of\n\ncriminal purpose; and (iv) defendant's criminal history category.\n\nWe found that the district court's decision to depart upwardly on\n\nthree of these grounds, without any factual basis in the record, in\n\ncombination with an insufficient explanation as to a fourth ground,\n\nconstituted plain error that had affected Wallace's substantial\n\nrights.        Id. at 44.        Accordingly, the case was \"remanded for\n\nresentencing.\"        Id. at 45.\n\nD. Resentencing\n\n               At resentencing, the district court first reviewed                  the\n\nPSR and reiterated its earlier findings that: the total offense\n\nlevel    for    Counts    I-III    was    29;     defendant's      criminal   history\n\ncategory was I; and the brandishing charge carried a mandatory 84-\n\nmonth sentence.         Defense counsel then \"reiterat[ed] all the prior\n\nobjections       that     were    filed      by   prior     counsel,\"    referring,\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fapparently, to the original objections to the PSR which had been\n\nfiled before the first sentencing.                 The court responded:\n\n           I don't think we need to have much discussion\n           about those issues, because, unless there's\n           something new, I think those were argued\n           before me previously. They were denied. The\n           Court of Appeals in its thorough opinion\n           reviewed the basis for those objections and\n           rejected them.\n                  So I would simply incorporate what is\n           said by the Court of Appeals with respect to\n           those objections, and to the extent they're\n           reiterated here, then they're denied.\n\nNext, Mr. DiBiasio, the owner of the gun store who was on duty at\n\nthe time of the robbery, testified in detail about the impact of\n\nthe crime on his life and mental health.\n\n           After this testimony and argument from counsel, and on\n\nthe government's motion, the court again decided to depart upwardly\n\nfrom the guidelines sentencing range.                 The departure was based on\n\nfour different grounds, two of which we had affirmed in the first\n\nappeal and two of which we had reversed.                 Specifically, the court\n\nreimposed a two-level increase for Wallace's use of dangerous\n\nweapons   during    the     offense   and      a    one-level   increase   for   his\n\ndisruption of government function, both of which we had previously\n\nfound to be appropriate grounds for an upward departure.                   However,\n\nin light of our holding that the upward departure for extreme\n\npsychological      injury     to   the   victim        had   been   insufficiently\n\njustified at the original sentencing, the court explained at length\n\non remand why a two-level departure was indeed warranted.                    Taken\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\ftogether, and starting from the base offense level of 29, these\n\ngrounds for departure yielded a total offense level of 34 (29 + 2\n\n+ 1 + 2).    Finally, the district court chose to impose on remand\n\nonly a one-level criminal history departure, placing appellant in\n\ncriminal history Category II.            We had previously reversed the\n\ndistrict court's original two-level criminal history departure.\n\n            The revised Guidelines analysis thus yielded a total\n\noffense level of 34, a criminal history category of II, and a\n\nguidelines sentencing range of 168-210 months on Counts I-III, plus\n\nthe mandatory 84-month term from the brandishing charge.               After\n\nweighing the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, the court\n\nchose a sentence at the top of the guidelines range and imposed a\n\nterm of imprisonment of 294 months, or 6 months fewer than its\n\nprior   sentence.      Finally,    the   court   explained   why    Wallace's\n\nsentence of 294 months imprisonment, as compared with Nickoyan's\n\n204-month    term,    did   not   create   an    inappropriate     sentencing\n\ndisparity.\n\nE. Wallace's Challenges to Resentencing\n\n            In the instant appeal, the government argues that several\n\nof Wallace's numerous challenges to the sentence imposed on remand\n\nare barred, in one way or another, by the law of the case doctrine.\n\nThese   potentially    precluded    claims   fall   into   two   categories.\n\nFirst, there are two grounds for departure - the dangerous weapons\n\nand disruption of government function grounds - that we upheld as\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fvalid in Wallace's first appeal, but that he now asks us to\n\n\"reconsider.\" Second, there are two enhancements - for obstruction\n\nof justice and for appellant's use of stolen weapons - that were\n\nfirst imposed at the initial sentencing and which, after Wallace\n\nfailed to challenge them in the first appeal, were reimposed on\n\nremand.   After setting forth the law of the case doctrine as it\n\napplies here, we address briefly each issue in both categories in\n\nturn, and then move to those objections that are properly before\n\nus.\n\n                                 II.\n\nA. Law of the Case Doctrine\n\n           Under the law of the case doctrine, \"'when a court\n\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern\n\nthe same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.'\"      Naser\n\nJewelers, Inc. v. City of Concord, 538 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983)).       We\n\nhave explained that this doctrine has two branches.       The first\n\nbranch - the so-called \"mandate rule\" - \"prevents relitigation in\n\nthe trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly\n\ndecided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.\" United\n\nStates v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).    The second branch\n\nbinds successor appellate panels in a second appeal in the same\n\ncase.   Id.   Both branches are implicated here.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f            1. The mandate rule\n\n            We explained the mandate rule in United States v. Bell,\n\n988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993):\n\n            The black letter rule . . . is that a legal\n            decision made at one stage of a civil or\n            criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent\n            appeal   despite   the   existence   of   ample\n            opportunity to do so, becomes the law of the\n            case for future stages of the same litigation,\n            and the aggrieved party is deemed to have\n            forfeited   any   right   to   challenge   that\n            particular decision at a subsequent date\n            . . . . Abandoning this prudential principle\n            would    threaten    the    important    policy\n            considerations underlying the law of the case\n            doctrine,    such   as   \"stability    in   the\n            decisionmaking process, predictability of\n            results, proper working relationships between\n            trial and appellate courts, and judicial\n            economy.\"\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n            In United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), the defendant had originally been sentenced as a manager or\n\nsupervisor of a conspiracy.       Id. at 28.     In his first appeal, he\n\nraised a number of issues, but did not challenge the district\n\ncourt's   determination   that    he   was   a   manager   for   sentencing\n\npurposes.   Id.   On remand, the district court denied his request to\n\nreopen this issue, invoking the law of the case doctrine.           Id.   On\n\nappeal, we considered \"whether the district court was correct in\n\nnot hearing the matter again,\" id., and found that it was:\n\n            The court was plainly correct [in refusing to\n            reopen the issue]. This is not a question of\n            what leeway there is to explore on remand an\n            issue directly related to the matter being\n\n                                   -11-\n\f               remanded.    This is rather a question of\n               whether a party, not having appealed from an\n               aspect of explicit findings and conclusions at\n               sentencing, is free on remand as to a\n               different unrelated issue to require the court\n               to hear that aspect again.\n\nId.   We rejected the argument that because we had not addressed the\n\nissue     in   the    first    appeal,    the    district      court    was   free   to\n\nreconsider the issue.           That argument missed \"the basic point\" of\n\nthe doctrine: that \"findings and conclusions that are not appealed\n\nand are not related to the issues on appeal are treated as\n\nsettled.\"       Id. at 29.5\n\n               However, we have also recognized that, \"even where . . .\n\nan appellate court's mandate does not contemplate resurrecting an\n\nissue on remand, the trial court may still possess some limited\n\ndiscretion to reopen the issue in very special situations.\"                     Bell,\n\n988 F.3d at 250-51.           The standard for reconsidering an issue under\n\nthe   mandate     rule   requires     a   showing    of     what   we   have   termed\n\n\"exceptional         circumstances\":      a     change    in    controlling     legal\n\nauthority, significant new evidence not earlier obtainable with due\n\n\n\n      5\n       We also reject Wallace's argument that the result of his\nprior appeal was a \"general remand\" that allowed the district court\nto review all sentencing matters de novo. \"Although some circuits\ndo generally allow de novo resentencing on remand, the First\nCircuit does not.\" United States v. Cruzado-Laureano, 527 F.3d\n231, 234 (1st Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). This is the thrust\nof our decision in Ticchiarelli - that upon a resentencing after a\nremand, the district court may only consider \"such new arguments or\nnew facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals'\ndecision - whether by the reasoning or by the result.\" Id. at 235\n(citing Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d at 32).\n\n                                          -12-\n\fdiligence, or the prospect of a serious injustice.             See Bell, 988\n\nF.3d at 251.\n\n            2. Subsequent Appellate Panel Rule\n\n            This branch of the law of the case doctrine \"contemplates\n\nthat a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil\n\nproceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the\n\nlitigation, unless and until the decision is modified or overruled\n\nby   a   higher   court.\"      Moran,   313   F.3d   at   7.      A   panel's\n\nreconsideration of a ruling made by a previous panel in the same\n\ncase may be proper \"if the initial ruling was made on an inadequate\n\nrecord or was designed to be preliminary or tentative,\" if there\n\nhas been \"a material change in the controlling law,\" if \"newly\n\ndiscovered evidence bears on the question,\" or if reconsideration\n\nwould \"avoid manifest injustice.\" Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d\n\n636, 647-48 (1st Cir. 2002).        \"A finding of manifest injustice\n\nrequires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a\n\nmaterial matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong,\" as well as a\n\nfinding of prejudice.       Id. at 648-49 & 648 n.5.\n\n            3. Wallace's Waiver Argument\n\n            Wallace argues that we should not apply the law of the\n\ncase doctrine to any of his claims because the government did not\n\nexplicitly raise the law of the case at resentencing before the\n\ndistrict court, and hence should be precluded from invoking it on\n\nappeal. In support of this argument, appellant cites United States\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fv. Lorenzo-Hernández, 279 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2002), where we\n\nrefused to punish the defendant for the district court's failure to\n\napply the mandate rule because \"the government did not present\" the\n\nargument   to   the    district   court.     We    stated   that   \"[i]f   the\n\ngovernment wishes to assert at resentencing before the district\n\ncourt after remand that certain issues resolved earlier should not\n\nbe revisited, it should say so then.\"             Id.   Thus, to the extent\n\nappellant may rely on this case, it is only for its implications\n\nabout the proper application of the mandate rule.                  Since oral\n\nargument in this case, we have again rejected the government's\n\nargument that the mandate rule should have barred an appellant's\n\nclaim after resentencing because the government had \"failed to make\n\nth[e] argument to the district court.\"            United States v. Olivero,\n\n552 F.3d 34, 41 n.4 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Both   of   these   cases   are   inapposite.      In   each,   the\n\ndistrict court at resentencing fully considered the defendant's\n\nsentencing challenge, with no substantive opposition from the\n\ngovernment, which then sought to invoke the mandate rule for the\n\nfirst time on appeal.      Thus, much of the efficiency gains provided\n\nby the doctrine were already lost.         Here, however, after Wallace's\n\ncursory statement that he \"reiterat[ed] all the prior objections\n\n[to the PSR] that were filed by prior counsel,\" the district court\n\nproperly replied that there was no need for discussion of those\n\nissues, \"unless there [was] something new,\" because those issues\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f\"were argued before [the court] previously.             They were denied.\"\n\nThe court also incorporated by reference anything we had said with\n\nrespect to those objections in Wallace's first appeal, and noted\n\nthat,       to   the   extent   those    objections   were   reiterated   at\n\nresentencing, they were denied.          Accordingly, without referring to\n\nthe law of the case doctrine explicitly, the court essentially\n\napplied the mandate rule to Wallace's arguments; the government\n\nnever had occasion to raise it.            Under these circumstances, with\n\nthe district court applying the law of the case doctrine itself,\n\nthere was no need for the government to invoke the doctrine below,\n\nand Lorenzo-Hernández and Olivero do not apply.6\n\n\n\n\n        6\n       Wallace also argues that the government's failure to raise\nthe law of the case below precludes us from applying the subsequent\nappellate panel rule to those issues that he explicitly asks us to\n\"reconsider.\" We fail to see how a doctrine directed at subsequent\nappellate panels can be waived by failure to raise it at the trial\nlevel.   We also note that the dicta in Lorenzo-Hernández and\nOlivero should not be understood to suggest that the government\nwaives all law of the case arguments by failing to raise them in\nthe district court. Frankly, we are uneasy with this dicta, which\nwould impose a burden on us to reconsider issues already decided.\nThe prudential law of the case doctrine is ultimately directed at\nconserving judicial resources and preserving the integrity of our\nown processes. See, e.g., Ellis, 313 F.3d at 647; United States v.\nRivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 149 (1st Cir. 1991). We therefore\nreject any intimation in our cases that we cannot raise the law of\nthe case issue sua sponte if we deem it appropriate. See, e.g.,\nMaxfield v. Cintas Corp. No. 2, 487 F.3d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir.\n2007); Bollinger v. Or., 172 F. App'x 770, 771 (9th Cir. 2006);\nDiLaura v. Power Auth. of State of N.Y., 982 F.2d 73, 76 (2d Cir.\n1992).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fB. Objections Not Raised in the First Appeal\n\n           1. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement\n\n           The    original      PSR    recommended     a    two-level     sentencing\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C.1.1 for obstruction of justice\n\nbased on Wallace's perjury.            He timely objected.         At the initial\n\nsentencing, the court stated that an upward departure beyond the\n\ntwo-level enhancement was appropriate.                     In his first appeal,\n\nWallace   did    not     challenge      the   application     of    the      two-level\n\nenhancement for obstruction of justice as recommended by the PSR;\n\ninstead, he appealed only the court's subsequent upward departure\n\nfrom that two-level enhancement. See Wallace, 461 F.3d at 38 n.12.\n\n           In this appeal, Wallace attempts to use the court's\n\nresponse to his reiteration of all original objections to the PSR\n\n(stating that his objections had been reviewed and rejected on\n\nappeal) to argue that the district court erroneously concluded that\n\nwe had affirmed the obstruction of justice enhancement. As Wallace\n\ncorrectly points out, because he elected not to challenge the\n\ndistrict court's application of the two-level enhancement in his\n\nfirst appeal, we did not consider it.             Wallace misguidedly insists\n\nthat this fact actually helps his position, claiming that when he\n\nreincorporated     all     of   his    original   objections       to   the    PSR   at\n\nresentencing,      the    objection      to     the   obstruction       of     justice\n\nenhancement      was     somehow      resurrected     and,    therefore,       it    is\n\nappropriate for us to consider it in this second appeal.\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f          We   will   not   reach     appellant's   argument   that   the\n\nenhancement was erroneously applied.          When Wallace failed to\n\nchallenge the obstruction of justice enhancement the first time\n\naround, it became the law of the case.      See Bell, 988 F.2d at 250.\n\nThe district court appropriately noted that, unless there was\n\nsomething new, appellant's original objections to the PSR did not\n\nmerit discussion and, \"to the extent they [were reiterated at\n\nresentencing],\" were once again denied.       Thus, the district court\n\nproperly applied the mandate rule and refused to consider Wallace's\n\ncursory objection to this enhancement.\n\n          Nor does this claim fit within any of the recognized\n\nexceptions to the mandate rule.      We explicitly reject the argument\n\n(found only in Wallace's reply brief) that failure to reexamine the\n\nissue would result in a serious injustice.          He argues that the\n\nenhancement was unwarranted because the district court made no\n\nfindings regarding his perjury at either sentencing, citing United\n\nStates v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87 (1993), for the proposition that\n\nsuch findings were required.    However, the jury had already found\n\nthat Wallace committed perjury, see Wallace, 461 F.3d at 22, and,\n\nin fact, the court endorsed this finding at the first sentencing.\n\nBecause we are not compelled to conclude that the ruling was\n\n\"unreasonable or obviously wrong\" or that Wallace was prejudiced by\n\nthe   district court's failure to make more specific findings (if\n\nany were required), his attempt to show any injustice fails.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f               2. Stolen Weapons Enhancement\n\n               In the initial PSR, the Probation Office proposed a two-\n\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(4), which instructs the\n\ncourt:    \"[i]f          any    firearm      was   stolen,   or    had     an    altered      or\n\nobliterated         serial       number,      increase     by     two    levels.\"           Over\n\ndefendant's objection, the district court applied this enhancement.\n\nHowever, Wallace did not challenge the enhancement on appeal, and\n\nit was reimposed at resentencing, subject only to the same summary\n\n\"objection\" as all of Wallace's initial objections to the PSR.                                At\n\nthis stage in the litigation, Wallace's claim that the district\n\ncourt's    imposition             of    the     stolen    weapons        enhancement         was\n\ninappropriate because \"it should not apply in cases where the\n\nfirearm was stolen during the course of the instant offense\" is\n\nbarred    by       the    law    of    the    case    doctrine.         Just    as   with    the\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement, the district court's implicit\n\ninvocation of the mandate rule was proper.\n\n               Furthermore, his attempt to invoke an exception to the\n\ndoctrine fails in light of United States v. Brown, 169 F.3d 89, 93\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).                There, relying upon application note 12 to\n\nU.S.S.G.       §    2K2.1,      we     rejected      appellant's    argument         that    the\n\ndistrict court \"double counted\" the stolen nature of the firearm.\n\nId.   Here, as in Brown, Wallace's offense level was not determined\n\nunder    U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(7) (the catch-all provision for crimes\n\ninvolving the unlawful receipt or possession of firearms), which\n\n\n                                               -18-\n\falready \"takes into account that the firearm . . . was stolen.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. 2K2.1 cmt. n. 12.7       Thus, there was no double counting,\n\nand the stolen weapons enhancement was properly applied in view of\n\napplication note 12, Brown, and the case law from other circuits.8\n\nAccordingly,   there   is   no   error,   let   alone   injustice,   in   the\n\nimposition of this enhancement that would preclude application of\n\nthe law of the case doctrine.\n\nC. \"Reconsidering\" Issues Decided in the First Appeal\n\n          Wallace also explicitly asks us to \"reconsider\" our prior\n\ndecision on the dangerous weapons and the disruption of government\n\nfunction grounds for departure.       We decline to do so.\n\n          1. Dangerous Weapons Departure\n\n          Wallace argues that his use of a dangerous weapon during\n\nthe robbery was an improper basis for an upward departure because\n\nhis use of that weapon, the TEC-9, was already accounted for by\n\n\n\n     7\n       Instead, it was determined under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(B),\nwhich prescribes a base offense level of 20 if \"the offense\ninvolved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. §\n921(a)(30); and the defendant (i) is a prohibited person; or (ii)\nis convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d).\"     According to the PSR,\nWallace was a \"prohibited person\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g) because he was a fugitive from justice at the time of the\noffense (since he was a suspect in connection with the murder of\nhis brother) and also because he admitted being an unlawful,\naddicted user of marijuana at the time of the offense.         See\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, cmt. n. 6.\n     8\n       See, e.g., United States v. Goff, 314 F.3d 1248, 1249-50\n(10th Cir. 2003); United States v. Hurst, 228 F.3d 751, 764 (6th\nCir. 2000); United States v. Shepardson, 196 F.3d 306, 311-14 (2d\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                   -19-\n\fvarious other Guidelines provisions.                    The application of the\n\nsubsequent appellate panel branch of the law of the case doctrine\n\nto this claim is straightforward.                    We have already held that\n\nappellant's use of a dangerous weapon was a valid basis for the\n\nupward departure, 461 F.3d at 36, and Wallace cannot meet the heavy\n\nburden required to invoke an exception under the law of the case\n\ndoctrine.    He cites no newly discovered evidence or intervening\n\nlegal authority that requires us to reconsider, and there can be no\n\ncredible claim that our failure to do so would work a \"manifest\n\ninjustice\" in this case.            As a general matter, we have long held\n\nthat double-counting is \"less sinister than the name implies.”\n\nUnited    States   v.      McCarty,    475    F.3d    39,     46    (1st   Cir.    2007)\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted).                 \"This is because two (or\n\nmore) guidelines will often rely on the same underlying facts,\n\nalthough    accounting        for   different       sentencing      concerns.\"         Id.\n\n(citing    Wallace,     461    F.3d   at     36).      Wallace      cannot      cite   any\n\nGuidelines    that      explicitly     prohibit       the     \"double-counting\"        he\n\nalleges    here,     and    the     other    enhancements          he   cites    clearly\n\n\"account[] for different sentencing concerns.\"                     McCarty, 475 F.3d\n\nat 46.     Therefore, this claim is barred by the law of the case\n\ndoctrine.\n\n            2. Disruption of Government Function\n\n            We similarly refuse to revisit our prior affirmance of\n\nthe   district     court's      decision      to     depart    upwardly      based     on\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fappellant's disruption of government functions.                   See Wallace, 461\n\nF.3d at 36-37.        We held that the departure was justified by\n\nWallace's     deliberate       evasion    of     arrest,    which       required     the\n\ngovernment     to   expend       significant       resources       in    trying      him\n\nseparately,    four   years      after     the    initial       trial    of    his   co-\n\nconspirator.        Id.   at    37.       He    now    argues    that     there      were\n\ninsufficient    factual        findings    in    the    record    to     support     the\n\ndeparture because the government cannot prove that its ability to\n\nprosecute the underlying crime was \"materially prejudiced\" by\n\nWallace's evasion of arrest.\n\n            Here, too, his arguments are unavailing.                          Our prior\n\nopinion provided a full explanation as to why the departure was\n\njustified even on the record as it stood after the first sentencing.\n\nId. at 36-37. On remand, the district court, in addition to citing\n\nour decision that the departure was appropriate, reiterated its own\n\nreasons for imposing the departure.                The reasonableness of this\n\nexplanation precludes any argument that the application of this\n\ndeparture works a manifest injustice in Wallace's case.                    Therefore,\n\nthis claim is also barred by the law of the case doctrine.\n\n                                         III.\n\n            Appellant raises two specific challenges to the sentence\n\nimposed on remand that, unlike the claims barred by the law of the\n\ncase doctrine, are appropriate for our consideration.                     \"We review\n\nclaims of legal errors in sentencing . . . de novo,\" and, where a\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fdefendant has properly preserved his objection, we review the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings for clear error.          Wallace, 461\n\nF.3d at 33.\n\nA.   Extreme Psychological Injury\n\n           Appellant   argues   that   the   district   court   improperly\n\nimposed a two-level increase for extreme psychological injury under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.3, which then provided:\n\n           If a victim or victims suffered psychological\n           injury much more serious than that normally\n           resulting from commission of the offense, the\n           court may increase the sentence above the\n           authorized guideline range. The extent of the\n           increase ordinarily should depend on the\n           severity of the psychological injury and the\n           extent to which the injury was intended or\n           knowingly risked.\n\n           Normally, psychological injury would be\n           sufficiently severe to warrant application of\n           this adjustment only when there is a\n           substantial impairment of the intellectual,\n           psychological,    emotional,   or   behavioral\n           functioning of a victim, when the impairment\n           is likely to be of an extended or continuous\n           duration, and when the impairment manifests\n           itself by physical or psychological symptoms\n           or by changes in behavior patterns. The court\n           should consider the extent to which such harm\n           was   likely,   given   the  nature   of   the\n           defendant's conduct.\n\n           When this case was first before us, we held that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence in the record to warrant an upward\n\ndeparture for extreme psychological injury.        Id. at 39.    We noted\n\nthat the district court, in explaining the departure, had merely\n\nrepeated portions of the trial testimony establishing that the\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fvictims were \"terrorized\" during the time of the robbery, but had\n\nnot   pointed   to    any    evidence     of   the   victims's   \"physical   or\n\npsychological symptoms or [] changes in behavior patterns,\" or the\n\n\"extended and continuous duration\" of any such injuries, as required\n\nby § 5K2.3.     Id.    At that time, the only evidence in the record\n\nregarding the \"long-term after-effects\" of the robbery was Mr.\n\nDiBiasio's trial testimony that he still \"dream[s] about [the\n\ndefendant's] face.\"         We specifically noted that the \"witnesses did\n\nnot testify about their sustained psychological injury at trial.\n\nNo medical or psychiatric records were presented.            According to the\n\nPSR, no victim impact statement appears to have been submitted by\n\nany of the victims.\"         Id. at 40.\n\n           The government addressed the deficiencies in the record\n\non extreme psychological injury by having Mr. DiBiasio testify in\n\nsome detail at the resentencing hearing. Mr. DiBiasio described the\n\n\"terrifying experience\" of having a heavy semi-automatic weapon with\n\n\"a large capacity magazine\" pointed \"about five to six inches from\n\n[his] face\" during the robbery for what \"seemed like an eternity\"\n\nwhile appellant shouted \"[d]on't move, don't move, don't move.\"\n\nImmediately after the robbery, Mr. DiBiasio experienced a number of\n\nphysical symptoms, such as light-headedness, dizziness, and chest-\n\npains, and was initially unable to answer the questions posed to him\n\nby an officer on the scene.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f             Later, Mr. DiBiasio learned that appellant was wanted for\n\nthe murder of his brother, and that he and Nickoyan were still at\n\nlarge.     Understandably, this affected Mr. DiBiasio a great deal:\n\n\"These two men, dangerous when armed, capable of murdering their own\n\nbrother were on the loose.     There were only two people who could\n\nidentify them.     I was one of them, and Donna was the other one.\"\n\nHe was \"positive\" that Wallace knew that DiBiasio could identify\n\nhim, because \"he stared at me long enough, and I stared at him long\n\nenough.\"     This caused him to fear for his life, as well as for the\n\nlives of his family and his employees.     \"Timi Wallace remained on\n\nthe loose for nearly four years, four years of constant terror,\" he\n\nexplained.    \"Was he behind corners?   Was he hiding? Was he waiting\n\nfor me?\"    Mr. DiBiasio stated that, as a result of the robbery, Ms.\n\nGallinelli quit her job at the store, and he was unable to find a\n\nreplacement because potential employees - as well as potential\n\ncustomers - were too afraid to come into the store after the\n\nrobbery.     As a result, business was poor and eventually the store\n\nclosed.    Mr. DiBiasio testified that \"It affected me emotionally.\n\nI had a tough time sleeping at night.      I had nightmares reliving\n\nthis whole situation . . . Life at home became terrible, as was my\n\ntemper.      So much so that my wife and I were having constant\n\narguments.\"    He said that the continuing stress caused estrangement\n\nfrom his wife, which eventually led to divorce and also strained his\n\nrelationship with his children.     Mr. DiBiasio also stated that he\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fhad a heart attack in September 2001, while appellant was still at\n\nlarge, and that he attributed this to the stress of the robbery's\n\naftermath.    He told the court that \"As I lay in that hospital, I\n\nwish that I had died.\"\n\n             Mr. DiBiasio also reported that the robbery also had\n\nlasting effects on Gallinelli, who was in a \"terrible condition\"\n\nfollowing the robbery.         He stated that because of the constant\n\nterror caused by appellant's fugitive status, she moved out of her\n\nhouse because \"her address or approximate location had been in the\n\npaper.\"    She also quit her job at Mr. DiBiasio's store.\n\n             Wallace, who timely objected to the imposition of this\n\ndeparture below, now contends that the additional evidence provided\n\nat the second sentencing through the testimony of Mr. DiBiasio was\n\nan insufficient basis for the departure.                He argues that Mr.\n\nDiBiasio   did    not   produce   evidence    -   for   example,    medical   or\n\npsychiatric      records   -   that   would   establish   that     he   suffered\n\npsychological injuries more serious than those that would normally\n\nfollow the commission of an armed robbery, that he changed his\n\nbehavior in any significant way, or that his functioning was\n\nsubstantially impaired.        He also asserts, citing authorities from\n\nother circuits, that Mr. DiBiasio's testimony regarding the effect\n\nof the robbery on his family members is irrelevant because they were\n\nnot present during the robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\f             Appellant correctly points out that we have, in the past,\n\nremarked on the absence of sufficient evidence in the record -\n\nincluding the absence of medical records - to support the departure.\n\nSee, e.g., Wallace, 461 F.3d at 40; United States v. Pelkey, 29 F.3d\n\n11, 16 (1st Cir. 1994).          However, our discussion in those earlier\n\ncases focused on the absence of evidence of any kind that would\n\nsupport the imposition of the departure; we have never stated that,\n\nin the face of other credible evidence, the absence of medical\n\ndocumentation is dispositive and precludes the departure.                Other\n\ncircuits have similarly rejected any such requirement.             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Morrison, 153 F.3d 34, 54-55 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"A\n\nsentencing    court    does      not   need   to   hear   the   testimony   of\n\npsychologists or psychiatrists to impose an upward departure based\n\non psychological injury.\"); United States v. Anderson, 5 F.3d 795,\n\n805 (5th Cir. 1993) (imposing departure on the basis of a victim\n\nimpact statement alone and distinguishing cases refusing to impose\n\nthe departure based on lack of medical records by noting the absence\n\nin   those   cases    of   any    other   credible    evidence    of   extreme\n\npsychological injury); see also United States v. Bowker, 372 F.3d\n\n365, 390-92 (6th Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. 1182\n\n(2005); United States v. Sawyer, 180 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Miller, 993 F.2d 16, 21 (2d Cir. 1993).\n\n             In this case, there was ample evidence to support the\n\ndeparture without medical records.            After hearing Mr. DiBiasio's\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\ftestimony at resentencing, the district court noted: \"This is an\n\nexample of how a violent crime can have an effect that rolls like\n\nthe ripples of a rock hitting a pond out from the center and touches\n\nso   many   different   people    beyond   the    people    who    are   directly\n\ninvolved.\" The court noted that, aside from the \"terrorizing nature\n\nof the crime,\" the fact that Mr. DiBiasio (and Ms. Gallinelli) could\n\nidentify the defendant, who they later learned had been accused of\n\nmurdering his own brother, led to \"four years of non-stop worry and\n\nfear\" while Wallace was on the run.           This was sufficient to show\n\nthat the effects had been \"of an extended or continuous duration.\"\n\nThe court cited the evidence that Mr. DiBiasio's functioning had\n\nbeen   impaired:   \"his   whole    attitude      changed.     He    became   more\n\nirritable.     He became argumentative and that, in turn, led to,\n\nessentially, separation from his wife and estrangement from his\n\nchildren.\"    Finally, the court pointed to changes in the victims'\n\nbehavior - noting that even beyond Mr. DiBiasio's powerful testimony\n\nas to his own condition, he had recounted that Ms. Gallinelli was\n\n\"a basket case\" who quit her job and had to move for fear that she\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fwould be found by the appellant.9   There was no error in the court's\n\ndecision to impose the departure for extreme psychological injuries.\n\nB.   Criminal History Category\n\n           Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(1) (2005)10, \"[i]f reliable\n\ninformation indicates that the defendant's criminal history category\n\nsubstantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's\n\ncriminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\n\nother crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\" The Guidelines\n\nspecifically note several types of information that may support this\n\ndeparture, including \"[w]hether the defendant was pending trial or\n\nsentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(2)(D).   If the sentencing court determines that\n\nthe departure is appropriate, the court \"shall determine the extent\n\nof [the] departure . . . by using, as a reference, the criminal\n\n\n\n      9\n       At oral argument, appellant's counsel insisted that the\ndistrict court inappropriately considered the destruction of Mr.\nDiBiasio's business itself as part of the psychological injury\nresulting from the crime. This claim is inaccurate. Indeed, the\ncourt explicitly noted that \"I don't think I can consider the\ndestruction of the business, although I do think I can consider the\nimpact that that has on one's psyche. You build a business over a\nlifetime and it's the culmination of your life's work, and to see\nthat destroyed cannot help but have an impact on the victim.\"\n      10\n        With respect to this departure only, the government cites\nthe 2005 edition of the Guidelines because (1) this court seems to\nhave used this edition in the prior appeal, see 461 F.3d at 41-42;\n(2) the government relied on this edition at the resentencing,\nwithout objection, and (3) none of the post-1998 changes in\nlanguage or numbering would affect the outcome. We agree and, for\nthe purposes of this departure only, will also refer to the 2005\nManual.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fhistory category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or\n\nlikelihood       to   recidivate   most   closely   resembles    that   of   the\n\ndefendant's.\"         U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(4)(A).\n\n             In the first appeal, we held that the district court's\n\nadoption of a two-level horizontal departure without an adequate\n\njustification for the substantial increase was clear error.                   We\n\nnoted first that the commission of the robbery at a time when - as\n\nwe assumed - Wallace knew that he was under indictment for another\n\nserious crime may \"arguably [be] indicative of his likelihood to\n\ncommit other crimes.\"        Wallace, 461 F.3d at 41 (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).          We compared this situation to \"the example\n\nlisted in the guidelines of committing an 'offense while on bail or\n\npretrial release for another serious offense,'\" id. at 42 (quoting\n\nU.S.S.G.     §    4A1.3(2)(D)),     because   \"[i]n    both     scenarios,    no\n\nadjudication of guilt has occurred, but the defendant's commission\n\nof a crime during a period in which one would expect a careful\n\nabidance to the law arguably demonstrates his or her propensity for\n\ncriminal behavior, at least for the purposes of sentencing.\"                 Id.\n\nHowever, we also acknowledged that the imposition of a two-level\n\ndeparture \"essentially added 4-6 points to Wallace's criminal\n\nhistory points.\"         If he had committed the robbery while under any\n\ncriminal justice sentence,11 only two points would have been added\n\n\n     11\n       Defined by the Guidelines as \"probation, parole, supervised\nrelease, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\" U.S.S.G.\n§ 4A.1.1(d).\n\n                                      -29-\n\fto his criminal history classification under U.S.S.G. § 4A.1.1(d).\n\nId.    \"Without any explanation of why the court chose a departure of\n\nthis extent,\" we could not conclude that it was justified.                     Id. at\n\n42.    We also commented that, on remand, the required explanation\n\nmight include \"at least an indication of why a one category increase\n\nis inadequate in this case.\"          Id. at 43 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n            At resentencing, the district court determined that,\n\nwhile an upward departure on the basis of underrepresented criminal\n\nhistory was warranted, a one-level increase would suffice.                    Wallace\n\nnow argues that this increase was an error because at the time he\n\ncommitted the robbery, the Massachusetts criminal proceeding was at\n\nthe complaint stage and had not yet resulted in an indictment.                     He\n\nclaims that this fact renders the charges insufficient to warrant\n\nan upward departure.\n\n            Wallace       is    correct    that,   in    all   of    the     previous\n\nproceedings, including his first appeal and the resentencing, the\n\nMassachusetts criminal complaint was mistakenly referred to as an\n\n\"indictment.\"        In    reality,   although     appellant        was    ultimately\n\nindicted for murder by a Suffolk County Superior Court Grand Jury,\n\nthis    indictment        did   not   occur      until    after      the     robbery.\n\nNevertheless, the logic set forth in our first decision, endorsed\n\nby the district court, still applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\f             At resentencing, the district court found that certain\n\nevidence introduced at trial, including evidence of appellant's\n\nflight and use of aliases, indicated that he was well aware of the\n\nstate criminal proceedings at the time of the robbery.                 That was\n\ntrue regardless of whether those proceedings were at the complaint\n\nor the indictment stage.       The court specifically noted our earlier\n\nconclusion    that   Wallace   would    be    \"hard-pressed\"      to   deny   the\n\nconnection between the murder charge and his evasive activities, see\n\nid. at 42, after he himself proposed such a link in the course of\n\nmaking other arguments in his first appeal.12            The sentencing court\n\nendorsed our prior logic that the timing of the commission of the\n\nrobbery at a time when \"one would expect a careful abidance to the\n\nlaw . . . demonstrated his propensity for criminal behavior.\"\n\nFinally,   the   court   explained     that   it   had   chosen   a    one-level\n\ndeparture based on our analogy to U.S.S.G. § 4.A1.1(d) concerning\n\nthe commission of a robbery while on supervised release.               There was\n\nno abuse of discretion in this choice.13\n\n\n     12\n       In the first appeal, in a challenge to certain remarks made\nby the prosecution in closing, Wallace argued that his flight and\nthe use of aliases might have reflected his attempt to evade the\nmurder charge, rather than flight based on the robbery charges.\nSee Wallace, 461 F.3d at 42.\n     13\n         Appellant also advances an additional argument, for the\nfirst time on appeal, that the criminal history departure\nrepresented impermissible double-counting because the multiple\nweapons enhancement he received for Count III was premised in part\non the fact that he possessed the firearms as a \"prohibited person\"\n- a designation that was based on findings that he was \"a fugitive\nfrom justice\" and \"an unlawful user of or addicted to any\n\n                                     -31-\n\f                                    IV.\n\n              Finally,      appellant     challenges    the   substantive\n\nreasonableness of his sentence on two grounds.           First, he argues\n\nthat there was a significant disparity between his sentence and his\n\nco-conspirator's sentence and, therefore, the sentencing court did\n\nnot properly heed 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)'s instruction that it consider\n\n\"the   need    to   avoid   unwarranted    sentencing   disparities   among\n\ndefendants with similar records who have been convicted of similar\n\nconduct.\"     He notes that Nickoyan Wallace was sentenced to a term\n\nof imprisonment 90 months shorter than appellant's, despite having\n\nbeen convicted of the same crimes.           Appellant also attacks his\n\nsentence on the ground that the government \"drastically changed its\n\nposition\" between the first sentencing (at which it recommended a\n\nsentence of 184 months, which was within the advisory Guidelines\n\nrange) and resentencing (where it moved for upward departures and\n\nrecommended a term of 294 months).\n\n              We review a defendant's challenge to the substantive\n\nreasonableness of his sentence for abuse of discretion.               United\n\nStates v. Cruz-Rodríguez, 541 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir. 2008).               We\n\nafford the district court \"wide discretion\" in sentencing decisions.\n\n\n\ncontrolled substance.\" He now contends that his designation as a\n\"fugitive from justice\" makes the imposition of the criminal\nhistory departure redundant. Arguments raised for the first time\non appeal are considered waived. See United States v. Hernández-\nRodríguez, 443 F.3d 138, 143 n.5 (1st Cir. 2006). We therefore\nrefuse to consider them.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fUnited    States    v.   Marceau,   554   F.3d   24,    33   (1st   Cir.   2009).\n\nUltimately, \"the linchpin of a reasonable sentence is a plausible\n\nsentencing rationale and a defensible result.\"                United States v.\n\nMartin, 520 F.3d 87, 96 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            18       U.S.C.    §    3553(a)(6)         requires     judges     to\n\n\"consider . . . the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\n\namong defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n\nsimilar conduct.\"        Although this section is \"primarily aimed at\n\nnational disparities, rather than those between co-defendants . .\n\n. , a district court may consider differences and similarities\n\nbetween co-defendants at sentencing.\"             Marceau, 554 F.3d at 33.\n\nHowever, a \"defendant is not entitled to a lighter sentence merely\n\nbecause    his     co-defendants    received     lighter     sentences.\"      Id.\n\n(quotation marks omitted).          Still, \"concerns could arise if two\n\nidentically situated defendants received different sentences from\n\nthe same judge.\"         Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n            Here, it was not the same judge who sentenced Timi and\n\nNickoyan Wallace in this case, a fact that makes Nickoyan's sentence\n\neven less relevant to the reasonableness analysis.                   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Saez, 444 F.3d              15, 19 (1st Cir. 2006).         More\n\nimportantly, \"the district court confronted the disparity head-on,\"\n\nMarceau, 554 F.3d at 34, and explicitly described the reasons that\n\nappellant and Nickoyan Wallace were not \"identically situated.\"                It\n\nfocused on a number of aggravating factors that were present only\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fin appellant's case.        Specifically, the court pointed to the\n\ndepartures for the use of a dangerous weapon, obstruction of\n\ngovernment function, and extreme psychological injury, none of which\n\nwere   applied   to   Nickoyan.14   Appellant's   extended   flight   from\n\nauthorities differentiated his case from Nickoyan's. The government\n\nhad to expend additional resources by holding two separate trials\n\nfour years apart. Also, Mr. DiBiasio and Ms. Gallinelli had to live\n\nin constant fear while appellant was at large. The district court's\n\ndetailed justification for the disparity in sentencing complies\n\neasily with the reasonableness standard.\n\n            Appellant's attempt to use the government's change of\n\nstrategy at resentencing to assail his sentence must also fail.         He\n\ncites no authority for the proposition that the government's changed\n\napproach to a sentencing proceeding on remand should affect the\n\nreasonableness analysis in any way. We reject the relevance of that\n\nchange to the reasonableness analysis.15\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n       14\n       The court also noted that the criminal history departure\nraised appellant's criminal history category to the same as his\nbrother's, and, while Nickoyan's might have been raised even\nfurther, that motion had not been made in his case.\n       15\n        Appellant also makes several perfunctory constitutional\nclaims. He argues 1) that the sentencing disparity violates the\nConstitution and 2) that the change in the government's\nrecommendation between the first and second sentencing proceedings\nrepresents a violation of his rights on the basis of prosecutorial\nvindictiveness.   These perfunctory arguments are both waived,\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), and\nmeritless.\n\n                                    -34-\n\f",

McKenna, with whom Mann and Mitchell was on brief, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Lee H. Vilker, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, SELYA, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>On October 15, 2004, after a four-day trial, a jury convicted appellant Timi Wallace of various crimes related to the September 2000 armed robbery of a firearms store in Providence, Rhode Island. He was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison (300 months). Wallace appealed, challenging both the validity of his convictions and the sentence imposed by the trial court. In a detailed opinion, we affirmed Wallace's convictions, but held that several sentencing errors required a remand. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.2006). At the resentencing hearing, the district court imposed a 294-month term of imprisonment, six months less than its prior sentence. Wallace now appeals for a second time, raising a number of challenges to the sentence imposed by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p>These objections fall into three categories. First, Wallace raises for the first time two claims of error that, although they were available to him, he did not pursue in his first appeal. Second, he explicitly asks us to reconsider two objections that we resolved against him in the first appeal. We find all of the preceding claims barred by the law of the case doctrine. Finally, Wallace challenges the district court's decision to depart upwardly from the United States Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of his underrepresented criminal history and the extreme psychological injuries suffered by the victims of the robbery, and asserts that his sentence, taken as a whole, was unreasonable. Although these last claims are properly before us, we affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because our opinion in the first appeal describes the offense, the trial, and the first sentencing in detail, <i>see </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 19-24, we limit ourselves to those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> facts which are most relevant to his claims of error in this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Offense</h2>\n<p>On September 25, 2000, appellant's brother, Nickoyan Wallace (\"Nickoyan\"), entered a firearms dealership in Providence, Rhode Island, and asked to see certain merchandise. The store's owner, Donn DiBiasio, and his assistant, Donna Gallinelli, were on duty. As Gallinelli was retrieving the items that Nickoyan had requested, appellant entered the store, brandishing a semi-automatic weapon known as a \"TEC-9.\" He then ran up to DiBiasio, pointed the gun at him, and yelled \"Don't move.\" When Gallinelli tried to escape, Nickoyan drew a handgun which he pointed at her, ordering her to stop. Next, Nickoyan leapt over the counter and forced Gallinelli to open the display case, specifically demanding that she retrieve certain high-caliber weapons. He stole six of these high-caliber handguns and, heeding appellant's instruction to hurry up, fled the store with his brother.</p>\n<p>Although Nickoyan was arrested and tried almost immediately, appellant, using a variety of aliases and other deceptive tactics, managed to evade arrest until July 2004. After a four-day jury trial, he was convicted of obtaining six firearms by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count I of the indictment); conspiracy to obtain the firearms by armed robbery, also in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count II); theft of firearms from a federally licensed firearms dealer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(u) (Count III); and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count IV).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The First Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Grouping Counts I and II, the 18 U.S.C. § 1951 charges, for a base offense level of 20 under the Guidelines, the pre-sentence report (\"PSR\") recommended a two-level enhancement for physical restraint of victims, a one-level enhancement for theft of a firearm, and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice through perjury, yielding an adjusted offense level of 25.<sup>[1]</sup> For Count III of the indictment, stealing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, the PSR started at a base offense level of 20. To this base offense level, the PSR added a three-level enhancement because the number of firearms unlawfully received or possessed during the offense was between eight and twelve;<sup>[2]</sup> a two-level enhancement because the firearms were stolen; and the same two-level enhancements for physical restraint of victims and obstruction of justice that were applied to the robbery counts. The adjusted offense level for Count III was therefore 29. Because Counts I  III involved the same victims and conduct, the PSR adopted the higher of the two offense levels (29). <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 23 (citing U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b)). Finally, Count IV of the indictment, the brandishing count, carried a mandatory eighty-four month (seven-year) consecutive term.</p>\n<p>Since Wallace had no criminal convictions, the PSR classified him as criminal history category I. In combination with the adjusted offense level of 29 for Counts I-III, this category yielded a sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> range of 87-108 months, to run consecutively with the 84 months required by the brandishing count.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court concluded that the guidelines range calculated by the PSR was inadequate, and decided to depart upwardly five levels to an offense level of 34. It also assigned a criminal history category of III to account for his commission of the crime while under indictment for another felony.<sup>[3]</sup> All told, the court sentenced appellant to 216 months for Counts I and II, 120 months for Count III (to be served concurrently with the term for Counts I and II), and 84 months for Count IV to be served consecutively. Thus, Wallace received a total sentence of 300 months, or 25 years, in prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The First Appeal</h2>\n<p>In his first appeal, Wallace challenged his convictions as well as the sentence, both of which he assailed on numerous grounds. Because our reasons for upholding the convictions are irrelevant to this appeal, we provide a brief summary of the sentencing portion of our decision only.</p>\n<p>Wallace had argued \"that the sentence was based on error ... both in terms of the court's calculation of the advisory guidelines range and its application of the guidelines provisions to depart upwardly from that range.\" 461 F.3d at 30.<sup>[4]</sup> We first addressed Wallace's claims of error in the PSR's recommended advisory guidelines range, holding that the district court properly imposed both the two-level enhancement for the physical restraint of a victim and the three-level enhancement for the number of firearms involved in the offense. We then considered the sentencing court's upward departure from the guidelines, and concluded that both appellant's use of a dangerous instrumentality in the commission of the offense and the disruption of government functions caused by appellant's four-year evasion of arrest were proper grounds for an upward departure. However, we also found that the sentencing court had erred in upwardly departing on the basis of (i) obstruction of justice; (ii) extreme psychological injury to the victims of the offense; (iii) facilitation of criminal purpose; and (iv) defendant's criminal history category. We found that the district court's decision to depart upwardly on three of these grounds, without any factual basis in the record, in combination with an insufficient explanation as to a fourth ground, constituted plain error that had affected Wallace's substantial rights. <i>Id.</i> at 44. Accordingly, the case was \"remanded for resentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 45.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Resentencing</h2>\n<p>At resentencing, the district court first reviewed the PSR and reiterated its earlier findings that: the total offense level for Counts I-III was 29; defendant's criminal history category was I; and the brandishing charge carried a mandatory 84-month sentence. Defense counsel then \"reiterat[ed] all the prior objections that were filed by prior counsel,\" referring, apparently, to the original objections to the PSR which had been filed before the first sentencing. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote>I don't think we need to have much discussion about those issues, because, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> unless there's something new, I think those were argued before me previously. They were denied. The Court of Appeals in its thorough opinion reviewed the basis for those objections and rejected them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So I would simply incorporate what is said by the Court of Appeals with respect to those objections, and to the extent they're reiterated here, then they're denied.</blockquote>\n<p>Next, Mr. DiBiasio, the owner of the gun store who was on duty at the time of the robbery, testified in detail about the impact of the crime on his life and mental health.</p>\n<p>After this testimony and argument from counsel, and on the government's motion, the court again decided to depart upwardly from the guidelines sentencing range. The departure was based on four different grounds, two of which we had affirmed in the first appeal and two of which we had reversed. Specifically, the court reimposed a two-level increase for Wallace's use of dangerous weapons during the offense and a one-level increase for his disruption of government function, both of which we had previously found to be appropriate grounds for an upward departure. However, in light of our holding that the upward departure for extreme psychological injury to the victim had been insufficiently justified at the original sentencing, the court explained at length on remand why a two-level departure was indeed warranted. Taken together, and starting from the base offense level of 29, these grounds for departure yielded a total offense level of 34 (29 + 2 + 1 + 2). Finally, the district court chose to impose on remand only a one-level criminal history departure, placing appellant in criminal history Category II. We had previously reversed the district court's original two-level criminal history departure.</p>\n<p>The revised Guidelines analysis thus yielded a total offense level of 34, a criminal history category of II, and a guidelines sentencing range of 168-210 months on Counts I-III, plus the mandatory 84-month term from the brandishing charge. After weighing the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, the court chose a sentence at the top of the guidelines range and imposed a term of imprisonment of 294 months, or 6 months fewer than its prior sentence. Finally, the court explained why Wallace's sentence of 294 months imprisonment, as compared with Nickoyan's 204-month term, did not create an inappropriate sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Wallace's Challenges to Resentencing</h2>\n<p>In the instant appeal, the government argues that several of Wallace's numerous challenges to the sentence imposed on remand are barred, in one way or another, by the law of the case doctrine. These potentially precluded claims fall into two categories. First, there are two grounds for departure  the dangerous weapons and disruption of government function grounds  that we upheld as valid in Wallace's first appeal, but that he now asks us to \"reconsider.\" Second, there are two enhancements  for obstruction of justice and for appellant's use of stolen weapons  that were first imposed at the initial sentencing and which, after Wallace failed to challenge them in the first appeal, were reimposed on remand. After setting forth the law of the case doctrine as it applies here, we address briefly each issue in both categories in turn, and then move to those objections that are properly before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Law of the Case Doctrine</h2>\n<p>Under the law of the case doctrine, \"`when a court decides upon a rule of law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*88</span> that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.'\" <i>Naser Jewelers, Inc. v. City of Concord,</i> 538 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Arizona v. California,</i> 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983)). We have explained that this doctrine has two branches. The first branch  the so-called \"mandate rule\"  \"prevents relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.\" <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004). The second branch binds successor appellate panels in a second appeal in the same case. <i>Id.</i> Both branches are implicated here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The mandate rule</h2>\n<p>We explained the mandate rule in <i>United States v. Bell,</i> 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir.1993):</p>\n<blockquote>The black letter rule ... is that a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal despite the existence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the aggrieved party is deemed to have forfeited any right to challenge that particular decision at a subsequent date.... Abandoning this prudential principle would threaten the important policy considerations underlying the law of the case doctrine, such as \"stability in the decisionmaking process, predictability of results, proper working relationships between trial and appellate courts, and judicial economy.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>United States v. Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.1999), the defendant had originally been sentenced as a manager or supervisor of a conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 28. In his first appeal, he raised a number of issues, but did not challenge the district court's determination that he was a manager for sentencing purposes. <i>Id.</i> On remand, the district court denied his request to reopen this issue, invoking the law of the case doctrine. <i>Id.</i> On appeal, we considered \"whether the district court was correct in not hearing the matter again,\" <i>id.,</i> and found that it was:</p>\n<blockquote>The court was plainly correct [in refusing to reopen the issue]. This is not a question of what leeway there is to explore on remand an issue directly related to the matter being remanded. This is rather a question of whether a party, not having appealed from an aspect of explicit findings and conclusions at sentencing, is free on remand as to a different unrelated issue to require the court to hear that aspect again.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> We rejected the argument that because we had not addressed the issue in the first appeal, the district court was free to reconsider the issue. That argument missed \"the basic point\" of the doctrine: that \"findings and conclusions that are not appealed and are not related to the issues on appeal are treated as settled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 29.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>However, we have also recognized that, \"even where ... an appellate court's mandate does not contemplate resurrecting an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> issue on remand, the trial court may still possess some limited discretion to reopen the issue in very special situations.\" <i>Bell,</i> 988 F.2d at 250-51. The standard for reconsidering an issue under the mandate rule requires a showing of what we have termed \"exceptional circumstances\": a change in controlling legal authority, significant new evidence not earlier obtainable with due diligence, or the prospect of a serious injustice. <i>See </i><i>Bell,</i> 988 F.2d at 251.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Subsequent Appellate Panel Rule</h2>\n<p>This branch of the law of the case doctrine \"contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\" <i>Moran,</i> 393 F.3d at 7. A panel's reconsideration of a ruling made by a previous panel in the same case may be proper \"if the initial ruling was made on an inadequate record or was designed to be preliminary or tentative,\" if there has been \"a material change in the controlling law,\" if \"newly discovered evidence bears on the question,\" or if reconsideration would \"avoid manifest injustice.\" <i>Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 647-48 (1st Cir.2002). \"A finding of manifest injustice requires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong,\" as well as a finding of prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 648-49 &amp; 648 n. 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Wallace's Waiver Argument</h2>\n<p>Wallace argues that we should not apply the law of the case doctrine to <i>any</i> of his claims because the government did not explicitly raise the law of the case at resentencing before the district court, and hence should be precluded from invoking it on appeal. In support of this argument, appellant cites <i>United States v. Lorenzo-Hernández,</i> 279 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2002), where we refused to punish the defendant for the district court's failure to apply the mandate rule because \"the government did not present\" the argument to the district court. We stated that \"[i]f the government wishes to assert at resentencing before the district court after remand that certain issues resolved earlier should not be revisited, it should say so then.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, to the extent appellant may rely on this case, it is only for its implications about the proper application of the mandate rule. Since oral argument in this case, we have again rejected the government's argument that the mandate rule should have barred an appellant's claim after resentencing because the government had \"failed to make th[e] argument to the district court.\" <i>United States v. Olivero,</i> 552 F.3d 34, 41 n. 4 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Both of these cases are inapposite. In each, the district court at resentencing <i>fully considered</i> the defendant's sentencing challenge, with no substantive opposition from the government, which then sought to invoke the mandate rule for the first time on appeal. Thus, much of the efficiency gains provided by the doctrine were already lost. Here, however, after Wallace's cursory statement that he \"reiterat[ed] all the prior objections [to the PSR] that were filed by prior counsel,\" the district court properly replied that there was no need for discussion of those issues, \"unless there [was] something new,\" because those issues \"were argued before [the court] previously. They were denied.\" The court also incorporated by reference anything we had said with respect to those objections in Wallace's first appeal, and noted that, to the extent those objections were reiterated at resentencing, they were denied. Accordingly, without referring to the law of the case doctrine explicitly, the court essentially applied the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> mandate rule to Wallace's arguments; the government never had occasion to raise it. Under these circumstances, with the district court applying the law of the case doctrine itself, there was no need for the government to invoke the doctrine below, and <i>Lorenzo-Hernández</i> and <i>Olivero</i> do not apply.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Objections Not Raised in the First Appeal</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</h2>\n<p>The original PSR recommended a two-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C.1.1 for obstruction of justice based on Wallace's perjury. He timely objected. At the initial sentencing, the court stated that an upward departure beyond the two-level enhancement was appropriate. In his first appeal, Wallace did not challenge the application of the two-level <i>enhancement</i> for obstruction of justice as recommended by the PSR; instead, he appealed only the court's subsequent <i>upward departure</i> from that two-level enhancement. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 38 n. 12.</p>\n<p>In this appeal, Wallace attempts to use the court's response to his reiteration of all original objections to the PSR (stating that his objections had been reviewed and rejected on appeal) to argue that the district court erroneously concluded that we had affirmed the obstruction of justice <i>enhancement.</i> As Wallace correctly points out, because he elected not to challenge the district court's application of the two-level enhancement in his first appeal, we did not consider it. Wallace misguidedly insists that this fact actually helps his position, claiming that when he reincorporated all of his original objections to the PSR at resentencing, the objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement was somehow resurrected and, therefore, it is appropriate for us to consider it in this second appeal.</p>\n<p>We will not reach appellant's argument that the enhancement was erroneously applied. When Wallace failed to challenge the obstruction of justice enhancement the first time around, it became the law of the case. <i>See </i><i>Bell,</i> 988 F.2d at 250. The district court appropriately noted that, unless there was something new, appellant's original objections to the PSR did not merit discussion and, \"to the extent they [were reiterated at resentencing],\" were once again denied. Thus, the district court properly applied the mandate rule and refused to consider Wallace's cursory objection to this enhancement.</p>\n<p>Nor does this claim fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the mandate rule. We explicitly reject the argument (found only in Wallace's reply brief) that failure to reexamine the issue would result in a serious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> injustice. He argues that the enhancement was unwarranted because the district court made no findings regarding his perjury at either sentencing, citing <i>United States v. Dunnigan,</i> 507 U.S. 87, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), for the proposition that such findings were required. However, the jury had already found that Wallace committed perjury, <i>see </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 22, and, in fact, the court endorsed this finding at the first sentencing. Because we are not compelled to conclude that the ruling was \"unreasonable or obviously wrong\" or that Wallace was prejudiced by the district court's failure to make more specific findings (if any were required), his attempt to show any injustice fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Stolen Weapons Enhancement</h2>\n<p>In the initial PSR, the Probation Office proposed a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(4), which instructs the court: \"[i]f any firearm was stolen, or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by two levels.\" Over defendant's objection, the district court applied this enhancement. However, Wallace did not challenge the enhancement on appeal, and it was reimposed at resentencing, subject only to the same summary \"objection\" as all of Wallace's initial objections to the PSR. At this stage in the litigation, Wallace's claim that the district court's imposition of the stolen weapons enhancement was inappropriate because \"it should not apply in cases where the firearm was stolen during the course of the instant offense\" is barred by the law of the case doctrine. Just as with the obstruction of justice enhancement, the district court's implicit invocation of the mandate rule was proper.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, his attempt to invoke an exception to the doctrine fails in light of <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 169 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.1999). There, relying upon application note 12 to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, we rejected appellant's argument that the district court \"double counted\" the stolen nature of the firearm. <i>Id.</i> Here, as in <i>Brown,</i> Wallace's offense level was not determined under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(7) (the catch-all provision for crimes involving the unlawful receipt or possession of firearms), which already \"takes into account that the firearm ... was stolen.\" U.S.S.G. 2K2.1 cmt. n. 12.<sup>[7]</sup> Thus, there was no double counting, and the stolen weapons enhancement was properly applied in view of application note 12, <i>Brown,</i> and the case law from other circuits.<sup>[8]</sup> Accordingly, there is no error, let alone injustice, in the imposition of this enhancement that would preclude application of the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. \"Reconsidering\" Issues Decided in the First Appeal</h2>\n<p>Wallace also explicitly asks us to \"reconsider\" our prior decision on the dangerous weapons and the disruption of government <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> function grounds for departure. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Dangerous Weapons Departure</h2>\n<p>Wallace argues that his use of a dangerous weapon during the robbery was an improper basis for an upward departure because his use of that weapon, the TEC-9, was already accounted for by various other Guidelines provisions. The application of the subsequent appellate panel branch of the law of the case doctrine to this claim is straightforward. We have already held that appellant's use of a dangerous weapon was a valid basis for the upward departure, 461 F.3d at 36, and Wallace cannot meet the heavy burden required to invoke an exception under the law of the case doctrine. He cites no newly discovered evidence or intervening legal authority that requires us to reconsider, and there can be no credible claim that our failure to do so would work a \"manifest injustice\" in this case. As a general matter, we have long held that double-counting is \"less sinister than the name implies.\" <i>United States v. McCarty,</i> 475 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir.2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \"This is because two (or more) guidelines will often rely on the same underlying facts, although accounting for different sentencing concerns.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 36). Wallace cannot cite any Guidelines that explicitly prohibit the \"double-counting\" he alleges here, and the other enhancements he cites clearly \"account[] for different sentencing concerns.\" <i>McCarty,</i> 475 F.3d at 46. Therefore, this claim is barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Disruption of Government Function</h2>\n<p>We similarly refuse to revisit our prior affirmance of the district court's decision to depart upwardly based on appellant's disruption of government functions. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 36-37. We held that the departure was justified by Wallace's deliberate evasion of arrest, which required the government to expend significant resources in trying him separately, four years after the initial trial of his co-conspirator. <i>Id.</i> at 37. He now argues that there were insufficient factual findings in the record to support the departure because the government cannot prove that its ability to prosecute the underlying crime was \"materially prejudiced\" by Wallace's evasion of arrest.</p>\n<p>Here, too, his arguments are unavailing. Our prior opinion provided a full explanation as to why the departure was justified even on the record as it stood after the first sentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 36-37. On remand, the district court, in addition to citing our decision that the departure was appropriate, reiterated its own reasons for imposing the departure. The reasonableness of this explanation precludes any argument that the application of this departure works a manifest injustice in Wallace's case. Therefore, this claim is also barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant raises two specific challenges to the sentence imposed on remand that, unlike the claims barred by the law of the case doctrine, are appropriate for our consideration. \"We review claims of legal errors in sentencing ... de novo,\" and, where a defendant has properly preserved his objection, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error. <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Extreme Psychological Injury</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court improperly imposed a two-level increase for extreme psychological injury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.3, which then provided:</p>\n<blockquote>If a victim or victims suffered psychological injury much more serious than that normally resulting from commission of the offense, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the severity of the psychological injury and the extent to which the injury was intended or knowingly risked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Normally, psychological injury would be sufficiently severe to warrant application of this adjustment only when there is a substantial impairment of the intellectual, psychological, emotional, or behavioral functioning of a victim, when the impairment is likely to be of an extended or continuous duration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or psychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns. The court should consider the extent to which such harm was likely, given the nature of the defendant's conduct.</blockquote>\n<p>When this case was first before us, we held that there was insufficient evidence in the record to warrant an upward departure for extreme psychological injury. <i>Id.</i> at 39. We noted that the district court, in explaining the departure, had merely repeated portions of the trial testimony establishing that the victims were \"terrorized\" during the time of the robbery, but had not pointed to any evidence of the victims's \"physical or psychological symptoms or [] changes in behavior patterns,\" or the \"extended and continuous duration\" of any such injuries, as required by § 5K2.3. <i>Id.</i> At that time, the only evidence in the record regarding the \"longterm after-effects\" of the robbery was Mr. DiBiasio's trial testimony that he still \"dream[s] about [the defendant's] face.\" We specifically noted that the \"witnesses did not testify about their sustained psychological injury at trial. No medical or psychiatric records were presented. According to the PSR, no victim impact statement appears to have been submitted by any of the victims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>The government addressed the deficiencies in the record on extreme psychological injury by having Mr. DiBiasio testify in some detail at the resentencing hearing. Mr. DiBiasio described the \"terrifying experience\" of having a heavy semi-automatic weapon with \"a large capacity magazine\" pointed \"about five to six inches from [his] face\" during the robbery for what \"seemed like an eternity\" while appellant shouted \"[d]on't move, don't move, don't move.\" Immediately after the robbery, Mr. DiBiasio experienced a number of physical symptoms, such as light-headedness, dizziness, and chest-pains, and was initially unable to answer the questions posed to him by an officer on the scene.</p>\n<p>Later, Mr. DiBiasio learned that appellant was wanted for the murder of his brother, and that he and Nickoyan were still at large. Understandably, this affected Mr. DiBiasio a great deal: \"These two men, dangerous when armed, capable of murdering their own brother were on the loose. There were only two people who could identify them. I was one of them, and Donna was the other one.\" He was \"positive\" that Wallace knew that DiBiasio could identify him, because \"he stared at me long enough, and I stared at him long enough.\" This caused him to fear for his life, as well as for the lives of his family and his employees. \"Timi Wallace remained on the loose for nearly four years, four years of constant terror,\" he explained. \"Was he behind corners? Was he hiding? Was he waiting for me?\" Mr. DiBiasio stated that, as a result of the robbery, Ms. Gallinelli quit her job at the store, and he was unable to find a replacement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> because potential employees  as well as potential customers  were too afraid to come into the store after the robbery. As a result, business was poor and eventually the store closed. Mr. DiBiasio testified that \"It affected me emotionally. I had a tough time sleeping at night. I had nightmares reliving this whole situation ... Life at home became terrible, as was my temper. So much so that my wife and I were having constant arguments.\" He said that the continuing stress caused estrangement from his wife, which eventually led to divorce and also strained his relationship with his children. Mr. DiBiasio also stated that he had a heart attack in September 2001, while appellant was still at large, and that he attributed this to the stress of the robbery's aftermath. He told the court that \"As I lay in that hospital, I wish that I had died.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. DiBiasio also reported that the robbery also had lasting effects on Gallinelli, who was in a \"terrible condition\" following the robbery. He stated that because of the constant terror caused by appellant's fugitive status, she moved out of her house because \"her address or approximate location had been in the paper.\" She also quit her job at Mr. DiBiasio's store.</p>\n<p>Wallace, who timely objected to the imposition of this departure below, now contends that the additional evidence provided at the second sentencing through the testimony of Mr. DiBiasio was an insufficient basis for the departure. He argues that Mr. DiBiasio did not produce evidence  for example, medical or psychiatric records  that would establish that he suffered psychological injuries more serious than those that would normally follow the commission of an armed robbery, that he changed his behavior in any significant way, or that his functioning was substantially impaired. He also asserts, citing authorities from other circuits, that Mr. DiBiasio's testimony regarding the effect of the robbery on his family members is irrelevant because they were not present during the robbery.</p>\n<p>Appellant correctly points out that we have, in the past, remarked on the <i>absence</i> of sufficient evidence in the record  including the absence of medical records  to support the departure. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 40; <i>United States v. Pelkey,</i> 29 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1994). However, our discussion in those earlier cases focused on the absence of evidence of <i>any kind</i> that would support the imposition of the departure; we have never stated that, in the face of other credible evidence, the absence of medical documentation is dispositive and precludes the departure. Other circuits have similarly rejected any such requirement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 153 F.3d 34, 54-55 (2d Cir.1998) (\"A sentencing court does not need to hear the testimony of psychologists or psychiatrists to impose an upward departure based on psychological injury.\"); <i>United States v. Anderson,</i> 5 F.3d 795, 805 (5th Cir.1993) (imposing departure on the basis of a victim impact statement alone and distinguishing cases refusing to impose the departure based on lack of medical records by noting the absence in those cases of any other credible evidence of extreme psychological injury); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Bowker,</i> 372 F.3d 365, 390-92 (6th Cir. 2004), <i>vacated </i><i>on other grounds,</i> 543 U.S. 1182, 125 S.Ct. 1420, 161 L.Ed.2d 181 (2005); <i>United States v. Sawyer,</i> 180 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 993 F.2d 16, 21 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>In this case, there was ample evidence to support the departure without medical records. After hearing Mr. DiBiasio's testimony at resentencing, the district court noted: \"This is an example of how a violent crime can have an effect that rolls like the ripples of a rock hitting a pond out <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> from the center and touches so many different people beyond the people who are directly involved.\" The court noted that, aside from the \"terrorizing nature of the crime,\" the fact that Mr. DiBiasio (and Ms. Gallinelli) could identify the defendant, who they later learned had been accused of murdering his own brother, led to \"four years of non-stop worry and fear\" while Wallace was on the run. This was sufficient to show that the effects had been \"of an extended or continuous duration.\" The court cited the evidence that Mr. DiBiasio's functioning had been impaired: \"his whole attitude changed. He became more irritable. He became argumentative and that, in turn, led to, essentially, separation from his wife and estrangement from his children.\" Finally, the court pointed to changes in the victims' behavior  noting that even beyond Mr. DiBiasio's powerful testimony as to his own condition, he had recounted that Ms. Gallinelli was \"a basket case\" who quit her job and had to move for fear that she would be found by the appellant.<sup>[9]</sup> There was no error in the court's decision to impose the departure for extreme psychological injuries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Criminal History Category</h2>\n<p>Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(1) (2005)<sup>[10]</sup>, \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\" The Guidelines specifically note several types of information that may support this departure, including \"[w]hether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(2)(D). If the sentencing court determines that the departure is appropriate, the court \"shall determine the extent of [the] departure ... by using, as a reference, the criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of the defendant's.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p>In the first appeal, we held that the district court's adoption of a two-level horizontal departure without an adequate justification for the substantial increase was clear error. We noted first that the commission of the robbery at a time when  as we assumed  Wallace knew that he was under indictment for another serious crime may \"arguably [be] indicative of his likelihood to commit other crimes.\" <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 41 (quotation marks and citation omitted). We compared this situation to \"the example listed in the guidelines of committing an `offense while on bail or pretrial release for another serious offense,'\" <i>id.</i> at 42 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(2)(D)), because \"[i]n both scenarios, no adjudication of guilt has occurred, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> but the defendant's commission of a crime during a period in which one would expect a careful abidance to the law arguably demonstrates his or her propensity for criminal behavior, at least for the purposes of sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> However, we also acknowledged that the imposition of a two-level departure \"essentially added 4-6 points to Wallace's criminal history points.\" If he had committed the robbery while under any criminal justice sentence,<sup>[11]</sup> only two points would have been added to his criminal history classification under U.S.S.G. § 4A.1.1(d). <i>Id.</i> \"Without any explanation of why the court chose a departure of this extent,\" we could not conclude that it was justified. <i>Id.</i> at 42. We also commented that, on remand, the required explanation might include \"at least an indication of why a one category increase is inadequate in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>At resentencing, the district court determined that, while an upward departure on the basis of underrepresented criminal history was warranted, a one-level increase would suffice. Wallace now argues that this increase was an error because at the time he committed the robbery, the Massachusetts criminal proceeding was at the complaint stage and had not yet resulted in an indictment. He claims that this fact renders the charges insufficient to warrant an upward departure.</p>\n<p>Wallace is correct that, in all of the previous proceedings, including his first appeal and the resentencing, the Massachusetts criminal complaint was mistakenly referred to as an \"indictment.\" In reality, although appellant was ultimately indicted for murder by a Suffolk County Superior Court Grand Jury, this indictment did not occur until after the robbery. Nevertheless, the logic set forth in our first decision, endorsed by the district court, still applies.</p>\n<p>At resentencing, the district court found that certain evidence introduced at trial, including evidence of appellant's flight and use of aliases, indicated that he was well aware of the state criminal proceedings at the time of the robbery. That was true regardless of whether those proceedings were at the complaint or the indictment stage. The court specifically noted our earlier conclusion that Wallace would be \"hard-pressed\" to deny the connection between the murder charge and his evasive activities, <i>see id.</i> at 42, after he himself proposed such a link in the course of making other arguments in his first appeal.<sup>[12]</sup> The sentencing court endorsed our prior logic that the timing of the commission of the robbery at a time when \"one would expect a careful abidance to the law ... demonstrated his propensity for criminal behavior.\" Finally, the court explained that it had chosen a one-level departure based on our analogy to U.S.S.G. § 4.A1.1(d) concerning the commission of a robbery while on supervised release. There was no abuse of discretion in this choice.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> IV.</h2>\n<p>Finally, appellant challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that there was a significant disparity between his sentence and his co-conspirator's sentence and, therefore, the sentencing court did not properly heed 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)'s instruction that it consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been convicted of similar conduct.\" He notes that Nickoyan Wallace was sentenced to a term of imprisonment 90 months shorter than appellant's, despite having been convicted of the same crimes. Appellant also attacks his sentence on the ground that the government \"drastically changed its position\" between the first sentencing (at which it recommended a sentence of 184 months, which was within the advisory Guidelines range) and resentencing (where it moved for upward departures and recommended a term of 294 months).</p>\n<p>We review a defendant's challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodríguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 32 (1st Cir.2008). We afford the district court \"wide discretion\" in sentencing decisions. <i>United States v. Marceau,</i> 554 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir.2009). Ultimately, \"the linchpin of a reasonable sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 96 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) requires judges to \"consider ... the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" Although this section is \"primarily aimed at national disparities, rather than those between co-defendants ..., a district court may consider differences and similarities between co-defendants at sentencing.\" <i>Marceau,</i> 554 F.3d at 33. However, a \"defendant is not entitled to a lighter sentence merely because his co-defendants received lighter sentences.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks omitted). Still, \"concerns could arise if two identically situated defendants received different sentences from the same judge.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, it was <i>not</i> the same judge who sentenced Timi and Nickoyan Wallace in this case, a fact that makes Nickoyan's sentence even less relevant to the reasonableness analysis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Saez,</i> 444 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.2006). More importantly, \"the district court confronted the disparity head-on,\" <i>Marceau,</i> 554 F.3d at 34, and explicitly described the reasons that appellant and Nickoyan Wallace were not \"identically situated.\" It focused on a number of aggravating factors that were present only in appellant's case. Specifically, the court pointed to the departures for the use of a dangerous weapon, obstruction of government function, and extreme psychological injury, none of which were applied to Nickoyan.<sup>[14]</sup> Appellant's extended flight from authorities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> differentiated his case from Nickoyan's. The government had to expend additional resources by holding two separate trials four years apart. Also, Mr. DiBiasio and Ms. Gallinelli had to live in constant fear while appellant was at large. The district court's detailed justification for the disparity in sentencing complies easily with the reasonableness standard.</p>\n<p>Appellant's attempt to use the government's change of strategy at resentencing to assail his sentence must also fail. He cites no authority for the proposition that the government's changed approach to a sentencing proceeding on remand should affect the reasonableness analysis in any way. We reject the relevance of that change to the reasonableness analysis.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The PSR, as well as all subsequent court proceedings, applied the 1998 Guidelines Manual, and we therefore do the same. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 22 n. 3. Accordingly, all references to the Guidelines refer to the 1998 Manual, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although Wallace was convicted of stealing six firearms from the store, the multiple weapons enhancement included the two guns that the defendant and his co-conspirator brandished during the robbery. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(C); <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 35.</p>\n<p>[3]  As we discuss <i>infra,</i> the district court's finding that Wallace was under indictment for another felony was erroneous. As the PSR correctly noted, there had been a complaint lodged in Massachusetts state court accusing appellant of murdering his own brother, Tasfa Wallace, but the case had not yet proceeded to an indictment.</p>\n<p>[4]  Wallace also challenged the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Because of our other rulings, we did not need to reach this issue on his first appeal.</p>\n<p>[5]  We also reject Wallace's argument that the result of his prior appeal was a \"general remand\" that allowed the district court to review all sentencing matters de novo. \"Although some circuits do generally allow de novo resentencing on remand, the First Circuit does not.\" <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 527 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir.2008) (citations omitted). This is the thrust of our decision in <i>Ticchiarelli</i>-that upon a resentencing after a remand, the district court <i>may only consider</i> \"such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision  whether by the reasoning or by the result.\" <i>Id.</i> at 235 (citing <i>Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d at 32).</p>\n<p>[6]  Wallace also argues that the government's failure to raise the law of the case below precludes us from applying the subsequent appellate panel rule to those issues that he explicitly asks us to \"reconsider.\" We fail to see how a doctrine directed at subsequent appellate panels can be waived by failure to raise it at the trial level. We also note that the dicta in <i>Lorenzo-Hernández</i> and <i>Olivero</i> should not be understood to suggest that the government waives all law of the case arguments by failing to raise them in the district court. Frankly, we are uneasy with this dicta, which would impose a burden on us to reconsider issues already decided. The prudential law of the case doctrine is ultimately directed at conserving judicial resources and preserving the integrity of our own processes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 647; <i>United States v. Rivera-Martinez,</i> 931 F.2d 148, 149 (1st Cir.1991). We therefore reject any intimation in our cases that we cannot raise the law of the case issue sua sponte if we deem it appropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maxfield v. Cintas Corp. No. 2,</i> 487 F.3d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir.2007); <i>Bollinger v. Or.,</i> 172 Fed.Appx. 770, 771 (9th Cir.2006); <i>DiLaura v. Power Auth. of State of N.Y.,</i> 982 F.2d 73, 76 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>[7]  Instead, it was determined under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(B), which prescribes a base offense level of 20 if \"the offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30); and the defendant (i) is a prohibited person; or (ii) is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d).\" According to the PSR, Wallace was a \"prohibited person\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) because he was a fugitive from justice at the time of the offense (since he was a suspect in connection with the murder of his brother) and also because he admitted being an unlawful, addicted user of marijuana at the time of the offense. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, cmt. n. 6.</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Goff,</i> 314 F.3d 1248, 1249-50 (10th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Hurst,</i> 228 F.3d 751, 764 (6th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Shepardson,</i> 196 F.3d 306, 311-14 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>[9]  At oral argument, appellant's counsel insisted that the district court inappropriately considered the destruction of Mr. DiBiasio's business itself as part of the psychological injury resulting from the crime. This claim is inaccurate. Indeed, the court explicitly noted that \"I don't think I can consider the destruction of the business, although I do think I can consider the impact that that has on one's psyche. You build a business over a lifetime and it's the culmination of your life's work, and to see that destroyed cannot help but have an impact on the victim.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  With respect to this departure only, the government cites the 2005 edition of the Guidelines because (1) this court seems to have used this edition in the prior appeal, <i>see</i> 461 F.3d at 41-42; (2) the government relied on this edition at the resentencing, without objection, and (3) none of the post-1998 changes in language or numbering would affect the outcome. We agree and, for the purposes of this departure only, will also refer to the 2005 Manual.</p>\n<p>[11]  Defined by the Guidelines as \"probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A.1.1(d).</p>\n<p>[12]  In the first appeal, in a challenge to certain remarks made by the prosecution in closing, Wallace argued that his flight and the use of aliases might have reflected his attempt to evade the murder charge, rather than flight based on the robbery charges. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 42.</p>\n<p>[13]  Appellant also advances an additional argument, for the first time on appeal, that the criminal history departure represented impermissible double-counting because the multiple weapons enhancement he received for Count III was premised in part on the fact that he possessed the firearms as a \"prohibited person\"  a designation that was based on findings that he was \"a fugitive from justice\" and \"an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\" He now contends that his designation as a \"fugitive from justice\" makes the imposition of the criminal history departure redundant. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are considered waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hernández-Rodríguez,</i> 443 F.3d 138, 143 n. 5 (1st Cir.2006). We therefore refuse to consider them.</p>\n<p>[14]  The court also noted that the criminal history departure raised appellant's criminal history category to the same as his brother's, and, while Nickoyan's might have been raised even further, that motion had not been made in his case.</p>\n<p>[15]  Appellant also makes several perfunctory constitutional claims. He argues 1) that the sentencing disparity violates the Constitution and 2) that the change in the government's recommendation between the first and second sentencing proceedings represents a violation of his rights on the basis of prosecutorial vindictiveness. These perfunctory arguments are both waived, <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990), and meritless.</p>\n\n</div>",

He was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison (300 months). Wallace appealed, challenging both the validity of his convictions and the sentence imposed by the trial court. In a detailed opinion, we affirmed Wallace's convictions, but held that several sentencing errors required a remand. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wallace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202348\"><a href=\"/opinion/202348/united-states-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006). At the resentencing hearing, the district court imposed a 294-month term of imprisonment, six months less than its prior sentence. Wallace now appeals for a second time, raising a number of challenges to the sentence imposed by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p>These objections fall into three categories. First, Wallace raises for the first time two claims of error that, although they were available to him, he did not pursue in his first appeal. Second, he explicitly asks us to reconsider two objections that we resolved against him in the first appeal. We find all of the preceding claims barred by the law of the case doctrine. Finally, Wallace challenges the district court's decision to depart upwardly from the United States Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of his underrepresented criminal history and the extreme psychological injuries suffered by the victims of the robbery, and asserts that his sentence, taken as a whole, was unreasonable. Although these last claims are properly before us, we affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because our opinion in the first appeal describes the offense, the trial, and the first sentencing in detail, <i>see </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 19-24, we limit ourselves to those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> facts which are most relevant to his claims of error in this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Offense</h2>\n<p>On September 25, 2000, appellant's brother, Nickoyan Wallace (\"Nickoyan\"), entered a firearms dealership in Providence, Rhode Island, and asked to see certain merchandise. The store's owner, Donn DiBiasio, and his assistant, Donna Gallinelli, were on duty. As Gallinelli was retrieving the items that Nickoyan had requested, appellant entered the store, brandishing a semi-automatic weapon known as a \"TEC-9.\" He then ran up to DiBiasio, pointed the gun at him, and yelled \"Don't move.\" When Gallinelli tried to escape, Nickoyan drew a handgun which he pointed at her, ordering her to stop. Next, Nickoyan leapt over the counter and forced Gallinelli to open the display case, specifically demanding that she retrieve certain high-caliber weapons. He stole six of these high-caliber handguns and, heeding appellant's instruction to hurry up, fled the store with his brother.</p>\n<p>Although Nickoyan was arrested and tried almost immediately, appellant, using a variety of aliases and other deceptive tactics, managed to evade arrest until July 2004. After a four-day jury trial, he was convicted of obtaining six firearms by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count I of the indictment); conspiracy to obtain the firearms by armed robbery, also in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count II); theft of firearms from a federally licensed firearms dealer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(u) (Count III); and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count IV).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The First Sentencing</h2>\n<p>Grouping Counts I and II, the 18 U.S.C. § 1951 charges, for a base offense level of 20 under the Guidelines, the pre-sentence report (\"PSR\") recommended a two-level enhancement for physical restraint of victims, a one-level enhancement for theft of a firearm, and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice through perjury, yielding an adjusted offense level of 25.<sup>[1]</sup> For Count III of the indictment, stealing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, the PSR started at a base offense level of 20. To this base offense level, the PSR added a three-level enhancement because the number of firearms unlawfully received or possessed during the offense was between eight and twelve;<sup>[2]</sup> a two-level enhancement because the firearms were stolen; and the same two-level enhancements for physical restraint of victims and obstruction of justice that were applied to the robbery counts. The adjusted offense level for Count III was therefore 29. Because Counts I  III involved the same victims and conduct, the PSR adopted the higher of the two offense levels (29). <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 23 (citing U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b)). Finally, Count IV of the indictment, the brandishing count, carried a mandatory eighty-four month (seven-year) consecutive term.</p>\n<p>Since Wallace had no criminal convictions, the PSR classified him as criminal history category I. In combination with the adjusted offense level of 29 for Counts I-III, this category yielded a sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> range of 87-108 months, to run consecutively with the 84 months required by the brandishing count.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court concluded that the guidelines range calculated by the PSR was inadequate, and decided to depart upwardly five levels to an offense level of 34. It also assigned a criminal history category of III to account for his commission of the crime while under indictment for another felony.<sup>[3]</sup> All told, the court sentenced appellant to 216 months for Counts I and II, 120 months for Count III (to be served concurrently with the term for Counts I and II), and 84 months for Count IV to be served consecutively. Thus, Wallace received a total sentence of 300 months, or 25 years, in prison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The First Appeal</h2>\n<p>In his first appeal, Wallace challenged his convictions as well as the sentence, both of which he assailed on numerous grounds. Because our reasons for upholding the convictions are irrelevant to this appeal, we provide a brief summary of the sentencing portion of our decision only.</p>\n<p>Wallace had argued \"that the sentence was based on error ... both in terms of the court's calculation of the advisory guidelines range and its application of the guidelines provisions to depart upwardly from that range.\" 461 F.3d at 30.<sup>[4]</sup> We first addressed Wallace's claims of error in the PSR's recommended advisory guidelines range, holding that the district court properly imposed both the two-level enhancement for the physical restraint of a victim and the three-level enhancement for the number of firearms involved in the offense. We then considered the sentencing court's upward departure from the guidelines, and concluded that both appellant's use of a dangerous instrumentality in the commission of the offense and the disruption of government functions caused by appellant's four-year evasion of arrest were proper grounds for an upward departure. However, we also found that the sentencing court had erred in upwardly departing on the basis of (i) obstruction of justice; (ii) extreme psychological injury to the victims of the offense; (iii) facilitation of criminal purpose; and (iv) defendant's criminal history category. We found that the district court's decision to depart upwardly on three of these grounds, without any factual basis in the record, in combination with an insufficient explanation as to a fourth ground, constituted plain error that had affected Wallace's substantial rights. <i>Id.</i> at 44. Accordingly, the case was \"remanded for resentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 45.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Resentencing</h2>\n<p>At resentencing, the district court first reviewed the PSR and reiterated its earlier findings that: the total offense level for Counts I-III was 29; defendant's criminal history category was I; and the brandishing charge carried a mandatory 84-month sentence. Defense counsel then \"reiterat[ed] all the prior objections that were filed by prior counsel,\" referring, apparently, to the original objections to the PSR which had been filed before the first sentencing. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote>I don't think we need to have much discussion about those issues, because, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*87</span> unless there's something new, I think those were argued before me previously. They were denied. The Court of Appeals in its thorough opinion reviewed the basis for those objections and rejected them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So I would simply incorporate what is said by the Court of Appeals with respect to those objections, and to the extent they're reiterated here, then they're denied.</blockquote>\n<p>Next, Mr. DiBiasio, the owner of the gun store who was on duty at the time of the robbery, testified in detail about the impact of the crime on his life and mental health.</p>\n<p>After this testimony and argument from counsel, and on the government's motion, the court again decided to depart upwardly from the guidelines sentencing range. The departure was based on four different grounds, two of which we had affirmed in the first appeal and two of which we had reversed. Specifically, the court reimposed a two-level increase for Wallace's use of dangerous weapons during the offense and a one-level increase for his disruption of government function, both of which we had previously found to be appropriate grounds for an upward departure. However, in light of our holding that the upward departure for extreme psychological injury to the victim had been insufficiently justified at the original sentencing, the court explained at length on remand why a two-level departure was indeed warranted. Taken together, and starting from the base offense level of 29, these grounds for departure yielded a total offense level of 34 (29 + 2 + 1 + 2). Finally, the district court chose to impose on remand only a one-level criminal history departure, placing appellant in criminal history Category II. We had previously reversed the district court's original two-level criminal history departure.</p>\n<p>The revised Guidelines analysis thus yielded a total offense level of 34, a criminal history category of II, and a guidelines sentencing range of 168-210 months on Counts I-III, plus the mandatory 84-month term from the brandishing charge. After weighing the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, the court chose a sentence at the top of the guidelines range and imposed a term of imprisonment of 294 months, or 6 months fewer than its prior sentence. Finally, the court explained why Wallace's sentence of 294 months imprisonment, as compared with Nickoyan's 204-month term, did not create an inappropriate sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Wallace's Challenges to Resentencing</h2>\n<p>In the instant appeal, the government argues that several of Wallace's numerous challenges to the sentence imposed on remand are barred, in one way or another, by the law of the case doctrine. These potentially precluded claims fall into two categories. First, there are two grounds for departure  the dangerous weapons and disruption of government function grounds  that we upheld as valid in Wallace's first appeal, but that he now asks us to \"reconsider.\" Second, there are two enhancements  for obstruction of justice and for appellant's use of stolen weapons  that were first imposed at the initial sentencing and which, after Wallace failed to challenge them in the first appeal, were reimposed on remand. After setting forth the law of the case doctrine as it applies here, we address briefly each issue in both categories in turn, and then move to those objections that are properly before us.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

In his first appeal, he raised a number of issues, but did not challenge the district court's determination that he was a manager for sentencing purposes. <i>Id.</i> On remand, the district court denied his request to reopen this issue, invoking the law of the case doctrine. <i>Id.</i> On appeal, we considered \"whether the district court was correct in not hearing the matter again,\" <i>id.,</i> and found that it was:</p>\n<blockquote>The court was plainly correct [in refusing to reopen the issue]. This is not a question of what leeway there is to explore on remand an issue directly related to the matter being remanded. This is rather a question of whether a party, not having appealed from an aspect of explicit findings and conclusions at sentencing, is free on remand as to a different unrelated issue to require the court to hear that aspect again.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> We rejected the argument that because we had not addressed the issue in the first appeal, the district court was free to reconsider the issue. That argument missed \"the basic point\" of the doctrine: that \"findings and conclusions that are not appealed and are not related to the issues on appeal are treated as settled.\" <i>Id.</i> at 29.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>However, we have also recognized that, \"even where ... an appellate court's mandate does not contemplate resurrecting an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*89</span> issue on remand, the trial court may still possess some limited discretion to reopen the issue in very special situations.\" <i>Bell,</i> 988 F.2d at 250-51. The standard for reconsidering an issue under the mandate rule requires a showing of what we have termed \"exceptional circumstances\": a change in controlling legal authority, significant new evidence not earlier obtainable with due diligence, or the prospect of a serious injustice. <i>See </i><i>Bell,</i> 988 F.2d at 251.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Subsequent Appellate Panel Rule</h2>\n<p>This branch of the law of the case doctrine \"contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\" <i>Moran,</i> 393 F.3d at 7. A panel's reconsideration of a ruling made by a previous panel in the same case may be proper \"if the initial ruling was made on an inadequate record or was designed to be preliminary or tentative,\" if there has been \"a material change in the controlling law,\" if \"newly discovered evidence bears on the question,\" or if reconsideration would \"avoid manifest injustice.\" <i>Ellis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 647-48 (1st Cir.2002). \"A finding of manifest injustice requires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong,\" as well as a finding of prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 648-49 &amp; 648 n. 5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Wallace's Waiver Argument</h2>\n<p>Wallace argues that we should not apply the law of the case doctrine to <i>any</i> of his claims because the government did not explicitly raise the law of the case at resentencing before the district court, and hence should be precluded from invoking it on appeal. In support of this argument, appellant cites <i>United States v. Lorenzo-Hernández,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199805\"><a href=\"/opinion/199805/united-states-v-lorenzo-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2002), where we refused to punish the defendant for the district court's failure to apply the mandate rule because \"the government did not present\" the argument to the district court. We stated that \"[i]f the government wishes to assert at resentencing before the district court after remand that certain issues resolved earlier should not be revisited, it should say so then.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, to the extent appellant may rely on this case, it is only for its implications about the proper application of the mandate rule. Since oral argument in this case, we have again rejected the government's argument that the mandate rule should have barred an appellant's claim after resentencing because the government had \"failed to make th[e] argument to the district court.\" <i>United States v. Olivero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203616\"><a href=\"/opinion/203616/united-states-v-olivero/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 41 n. 4 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Both of these cases are inapposite. In each, the district court at resentencing <i>fully considered</i> the defendant's sentencing challenge, with no substantive opposition from the government, which then sought to invoke the mandate rule for the first time on appeal. Thus, much of the efficiency gains provided by the doctrine were already lost. Here, however, after Wallace's cursory statement that he \"reiterat[ed] all the prior objections [to the PSR] that were filed by prior counsel,\" the district court properly replied that there was no need for discussion of those issues, \"unless there [was] something new,\" because those issues \"were argued before [the court] previously. They were denied.\" The court also incorporated by reference anything we had said with respect to those objections in Wallace's first appeal, and noted that, to the extent those objections were reiterated at resentencing, they were denied. Accordingly, without referring to the law of the case doctrine explicitly, the court essentially applied the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*90</span> mandate rule to Wallace's arguments; the government never had occasion to raise it. Under these circumstances, with the district court applying the law of the case doctrine itself, there was no need for the government to invoke the doctrine below, and <i>Lorenzo-Hernández</i> and <i>Olivero</i> do not apply.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Objections Not Raised in the First Appeal</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</h2>\n<p>The original PSR recommended a two-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3C.1.1 for obstruction of justice based on Wallace's perjury. He timely objected. At the initial sentencing, the court stated that an upward departure beyond the two-level enhancement was appropriate. In his first appeal, Wallace did not challenge the application of the two-level <i>enhancement</i> for obstruction of justice as recommended by the PSR; instead, he appealed only the court's subsequent <i>upward departure</i> from that two-level enhancement. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 38 n. 12.</p>\n<p>In this appeal, Wallace attempts to use the court's response to his reiteration of all original objections to the PSR (stating that his objections had been reviewed and rejected on appeal) to argue that the district court erroneously concluded that we had affirmed the obstruction of justice <i>enhancement.</i> As Wallace correctly points out, because he elected not to challenge the district court's application of the two-level enhancement in his first appeal, we did not consider it. Wallace misguidedly insists that this fact actually helps his position, claiming that when he reincorporated all of his original objections to the PSR at resentencing, the objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement was somehow resurrected and, therefore, it is appropriate for us to consider it in this second appeal.</p>\n<p>We will not reach appellant's argument that the enhancement was erroneously applied. When Wallace failed to challenge the obstruction of justice enhancement the first time around, it became the law of the case. <i>See </i><i>Bell,</i> 988 F.2d at 250. The district court appropriately noted that, unless there was something new, appellant's original objections to the PSR did not merit discussion and, \"to the extent they [were reiterated at resentencing],\" were once again denied. Thus, the district court properly applied the mandate rule and refused to consider Wallace's cursory objection to this enhancement.</p>\n<p>Nor does this claim fit within any of the recognized exceptions to the mandate rule. We explicitly reject the argument (found only in Wallace's reply brief) that failure to reexamine the issue would result in a serious <span class=\"star-pagination\">*91</span> injustice. He argues that the enhancement was unwarranted because the district court made no findings regarding his perjury at either sentencing, citing <i>United States v. Dunnigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (1993), for the proposition that such findings were required. However, the jury had already found that Wallace committed perjury, <i>see </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 22, and, in fact, the court endorsed this finding at the first sentencing. Because we are not compelled to conclude that the ruling was \"unreasonable or obviously wrong\" or that Wallace was prejudiced by the district court's failure to make more specific findings (if any were required), his attempt to show any injustice fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Stolen Weapons Enhancement</h2>\n<p>In the initial PSR, the Probation Office proposed a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(4), which instructs the court: \"[i]f any firearm was stolen, or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by two levels.\" Over defendant's objection, the district court applied this enhancement. However, Wallace did not challenge the enhancement on appeal, and it was reimposed at resentencing, subject only to the same summary \"objection\" as all of Wallace's initial objections to the PSR. At this stage in the litigation, Wallace's claim that the district court's imposition of the stolen weapons enhancement was inappropriate because \"it should not apply in cases where the firearm was stolen during the course of the instant offense\" is barred by the law of the case doctrine. Just as with the obstruction of justice enhancement, the district court's implicit invocation of the mandate rule was proper.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, his attempt to invoke an exception to the doctrine fails in light of <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198351\"><a href=\"/opinion/198351/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.1999). There, relying upon application note 12 to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, we rejected appellant's argument that the district court \"double counted\" the stolen nature of the firearm. <i>Id.</i> Here, as in <i>Brown,</i> Wallace's offense level was not determined under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(7) (the catch-all provision for crimes involving the unlawful receipt or possession of firearms), which already \"takes into account that the firearm ... was stolen.\" U.S.S.G. 2K2.1 cmt. n. 12.<sup>[7]</sup> Thus, there was no double counting, and the stolen weapons enhancement was properly applied in view of application note 12, <i>Brown,</i> and the case law from other circuits.<sup>[8]</sup> Accordingly, there is no error, let alone injustice, in the imposition of this enhancement that would preclude application of the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. \"Reconsidering\" Issues Decided in the First Appeal</h2>\n<p>Wallace also explicitly asks us to \"reconsider\" our prior decision on the dangerous weapons and the disruption of government <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> function grounds for departure. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Dangerous Weapons Departure</h2>\n<p>Wallace argues that his use of a dangerous weapon during the robbery was an improper basis for an upward departure because his use of that weapon, the TEC-9, was already accounted for by various other Guidelines provisions. The application of the subsequent appellate panel branch of the law of the case doctrine to this claim is straightforward. We have already held that appellant's use of a dangerous weapon was a valid basis for the upward departure, 461 F.3d at 36, and Wallace cannot meet the heavy burden required to invoke an exception under the law of the case doctrine. He cites no newly discovered evidence or intervening legal authority that requires us to reconsider, and there can be no credible claim that our failure to do so would work a \"manifest injustice\" in this case. As a general matter, we have long held that double-counting is \"less sinister than the name implies.\" <i>United States v. McCarty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202621\"><a href=\"/opinion/202621/united-states-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \"This is because two (or more) guidelines will often rely on the same underlying facts, although accounting for different sentencing concerns.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 36). Wallace cannot cite any Guidelines that explicitly prohibit the \"double-counting\" he alleges here, and the other enhancements he cites clearly \"account[] for different sentencing concerns.\" <i>McCarty,</i> 475 F.3d at 46. Therefore, this claim is barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Disruption of Government Function</h2>\n<p>We similarly refuse to revisit our prior affirmance of the district court's decision to depart upwardly based on appellant's disruption of government functions. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 36-37. We held that the departure was justified by Wallace's deliberate evasion of arrest, which required the government to expend significant resources in trying him separately, four years after the initial trial of his co-conspirator. <i>Id.</i> at 37. He now argues that there were insufficient factual findings in the record to support the departure because the government cannot prove that its ability to prosecute the underlying crime was \"materially prejudiced\" by Wallace's evasion of arrest.</p>\n<p>Here, too, his arguments are unavailing. Our prior opinion provided a full explanation as to why the departure was justified even on the record as it stood after the first sentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 36-37. On remand, the district court, in addition to citing our decision that the departure was appropriate, reiterated its own reasons for imposing the departure. The reasonableness of this explanation precludes any argument that the application of this departure works a manifest injustice in Wallace's case. Therefore, this claim is also barred by the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant raises two specific challenges to the sentence imposed on remand that, unlike the claims barred by the law of the case doctrine, are appropriate for our consideration. \"We review claims of legal errors in sentencing ... de novo,\" and, where a defendant has properly preserved his objection, we review the district court's factual findings for clear error. <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Extreme Psychological Injury</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that the district court improperly imposed a two-level increase for extreme psychological injury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.3, which then provided:</p>\n<blockquote>If a victim or victims suffered psychological injury much more serious than that normally resulting from commission of the offense, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the severity of the psychological injury and the extent to which the injury was intended or knowingly risked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Normally, psychological injury would be sufficiently severe to warrant application of this adjustment only when there is a substantial impairment of the intellectual, psychological, emotional, or behavioral functioning of a victim, when the impairment is likely to be of an extended or continuous duration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or psychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns. The court should consider the extent to which such harm was likely, given the nature of the defendant's conduct.</blockquote>\n<p>When this case was first before us, we held that there was insufficient evidence in the record to warrant an upward departure for extreme psychological injury. <i>Id.</i> at 39. We noted that the district court, in explaining the departure, had merely repeated portions of the trial testimony establishing that the victims were \"terrorized\" during the time of the robbery, but had not pointed to any evidence of the victims's \"physical or psychological symptoms or [] changes in behavior patterns,\" or the \"extended and continuous duration\" of any such injuries, as required by § 5K2.3. <i>Id.</i> At that time, the only evidence in the record regarding the \"longterm after-effects\" of the robbery was Mr. DiBiasio's trial testimony that he still \"dream[s] about [the defendant's] face.\" We specifically noted that the \"witnesses did not testify about their sustained psychological injury at trial. No medical or psychiatric records were presented. According to the PSR, no victim impact statement appears to have been submitted by any of the victims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 40.</p>\n<p>The government addressed the deficiencies in the record on extreme psychological injury by having Mr. DiBiasio testify in some detail at the resentencing hearing. Mr. DiBiasio described the \"terrifying experience\" of having a heavy semi-automatic weapon with \"a large capacity magazine\" pointed \"about five to six inches from [his] face\" during the robbery for what \"seemed like an eternity\" while appellant shouted \"[d]on't move, don't move, don't move.\" Immediately after the robbery, Mr. DiBiasio experienced a number of physical symptoms, such as light-headedness, dizziness, and chest-pains, and was initially unable to answer the questions posed to him by an officer on the scene.</p>\n<p>Later, Mr. DiBiasio learned that appellant was wanted for the murder of his brother, and that he and Nickoyan were still at large. Understandably, this affected Mr. DiBiasio a great deal: \"These two men, dangerous when armed, capable of murdering their own brother were on the loose. There were only two people who could identify them. I was one of them, and Donna was the other one.\" He was \"positive\" that Wallace knew that DiBiasio could identify him, because \"he stared at me long enough, and I stared at him long enough.\" This caused him to fear for his life, as well as for the lives of his family and his employees. \"Timi Wallace remained on the loose for nearly four years, four years of constant terror,\" he explained. \"Was he behind corners? Was he hiding? Was he waiting for me?\" Mr. DiBiasio stated that, as a result of the robbery, Ms. Gallinelli quit her job at the store, and he was unable to find a replacement <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> because potential employees  as well as potential customers  were too afraid to come into the store after the robbery. As a result, business was poor and eventually the store closed. Mr. DiBiasio testified that \"It affected me emotionally. I had a tough time sleeping at night. I had nightmares reliving this whole situation ... Life at home became terrible, as was my temper. So much so that my wife and I were having constant arguments.\" He said that the continuing stress caused estrangement from his wife, which eventually led to divorce and also strained his relationship with his children. Mr. DiBiasio also stated that he had a heart attack in September 2001, while appellant was still at large, and that he attributed this to the stress of the robbery's aftermath. He told the court that \"As I lay in that hospital, I wish that I had died.\"</p>\n<p>Mr. DiBiasio also reported that the robbery also had lasting effects on Gallinelli, who was in a \"terrible condition\" following the robbery. He stated that because of the constant terror caused by appellant's fugitive status, she moved out of her house because \"her address or approximate location had been in the paper.\" She also quit her job at Mr. DiBiasio's store.</p>\n<p>Wallace, who timely objected to the imposition of this departure below, now contends that the additional evidence provided at the second sentencing through the testimony of Mr. DiBiasio was an insufficient basis for the departure. He argues that Mr. DiBiasio did not produce evidence  for example, medical or psychiatric records  that would establish that he suffered psychological injuries more serious than those that would normally follow the commission of an armed robbery, that he changed his behavior in any significant way, or that his functioning was substantially impaired. He also asserts, citing authorities from other circuits, that Mr. DiBiasio's testimony regarding the effect of the robbery on his family members is irrelevant because they were not present during the robbery.</p>\n<p>Appellant correctly points out that we have, in the past, remarked on the <i>absence</i> of sufficient evidence in the record  including the absence of medical records  to support the departure. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 40; <i>United States v. Pelkey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195491\"><a href=\"/opinion/195491/united-states-v-pelkey/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994). However, our discussion in those earlier cases focused on the absence of evidence of <i>any kind</i> that would support the imposition of the departure; we have never stated that, in the face of other credible evidence, the absence of medical documentation is dispositive and precludes the departure. Other circuits have similarly rejected any such requirement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757295\"><a href=\"/opinion/757295/united-states-v-arthur-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 54-55 (2d Cir.1998) (\"A sentencing court does not need to hear the testimony of psychologists or psychiatrists to impose an upward departure based on psychological injury.\"); <i>United States v.

After hearing Mr. DiBiasio's testimony at resentencing, the district court noted: \"This is an example of how a violent crime can have an effect that rolls like the ripples of a rock hitting a pond out <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> from the center and touches so many different people beyond the people who are directly involved.\" The court noted that, aside from the \"terrorizing nature of the crime,\" the fact that Mr. DiBiasio (and Ms. Gallinelli) could identify the defendant, who they later learned had been accused of murdering his own brother, led to \"four years of non-stop worry and fear\" while Wallace was on the run. This was sufficient to show that the effects had been \"of an extended or continuous duration.\" The court cited the evidence that Mr. DiBiasio's functioning had been impaired: \"his whole attitude changed. He became more irritable. He became argumentative and that, in turn, led to, essentially, separation from his wife and estrangement from his children.\" Finally, the court pointed to changes in the victims' behavior  noting that even beyond Mr. DiBiasio's powerful testimony as to his own condition, he had recounted that Ms. Gallinelli was \"a basket case\" who quit her job and had to move for fear that she would be found by the appellant.<sup>[9]</sup> There was no error in the court's decision to impose the departure for extreme psychological injuries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Criminal History Category</h2>\n<p>Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(1) (2005)<sup>[10]</sup>, \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\" The Guidelines specifically note several types of information that may support this departure, including \"[w]hether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(2)(D). If the sentencing court determines that the departure is appropriate, the court \"shall determine the extent of [the] departure ... by using, as a reference, the criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of the defendant's.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p>In the first appeal, we held that the district court's adoption of a two-level horizontal departure without an adequate justification for the substantial increase was clear error. We noted first that the commission of the robbery at a time when  as we assumed  Wallace knew that he was under indictment for another serious crime may \"arguably [be] indicative of his likelihood to commit other crimes.\" <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 41 (quotation marks and citation omitted). We compared this situation to \"the example listed in the guidelines of committing an `offense while on bail or pretrial release for another serious offense,'\" <i>id.</i> at 42 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(2)(D)), because \"[i]n both scenarios, no adjudication of guilt has occurred, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> but the defendant's commission of a crime during a period in which one would expect a careful abidance to the law arguably demonstrates his or her propensity for criminal behavior, at least for the purposes of sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> However, we also acknowledged that the imposition of a two-level departure \"essentially added 4-6 points to Wallace's criminal history points.\" If he had committed the robbery while under any criminal justice sentence,<sup>[11]</sup> only two points would have been added to his criminal history classification under U.S.S.G. § 4A.1.1(d). <i>Id.</i> \"Without any explanation of why the court chose a departure of this extent,\" we could not conclude that it was justified. <i>Id.</i> at 42. We also commented that, on remand, the required explanation might include \"at least an indication of why a one category increase is inadequate in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>At resentencing, the district court determined that, while an upward departure on the basis of underrepresented criminal history was warranted, a one-level increase would suffice. Wallace now argues that this increase was an error because at the time he committed the robbery, the Massachusetts criminal proceeding was at the complaint stage and had not yet resulted in an indictment. He claims that this fact renders the charges insufficient to warrant an upward departure.</p>\n<p>Wallace is correct that, in all of the previous proceedings, including his first appeal and the resentencing, the Massachusetts criminal complaint was mistakenly referred to as an \"indictment.\" In reality, although appellant was ultimately indicted for murder by a Suffolk County Superior Court Grand Jury, this indictment did not occur until after the robbery. Nevertheless, the logic set forth in our first decision, endorsed by the district court, still applies.</p>\n<p>At resentencing, the district court found that certain evidence introduced at trial, including evidence of appellant's flight and use of aliases, indicated that he was well aware of the state criminal proceedings at the time of the robbery. That was true regardless of whether those proceedings were at the complaint or the indictment stage. The court specifically noted our earlier conclusion that Wallace would be \"hard-pressed\" to deny the connection between the murder charge and his evasive activities, <i>see id.</i> at 42, after he himself proposed such a link in the course of making other arguments in his first appeal.<sup>[12]</sup> The sentencing court endorsed our prior logic that the timing of the commission of the robbery at a time when \"one would expect a careful abidance to the law ... demonstrated his propensity for criminal behavior.\" Finally, the court explained that it had chosen a one-level departure based on our analogy to U.S.S.G. § 4.A1.1(d) concerning the commission of a robbery while on supervised release. There was no abuse of discretion in this choice.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> IV.</h2>\n<p>Finally, appellant challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that there was a significant disparity between his sentence and his co-conspirator's sentence and, therefore, the sentencing court did not properly heed 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)'s instruction that it consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been convicted of similar conduct.\" He notes that Nickoyan Wallace was sentenced to a term of imprisonment 90 months shorter than appellant's, despite having been convicted of the same crimes. Appellant also attacks his sentence on the ground that the government \"drastically changed its position\" between the first sentencing (at which it recommended a sentence of 184 months, which was within the advisory Guidelines range) and resentencing (where it moved for upward departures and recommended a term of 294 months).</p>\n<p>We review a defendant's challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203469\"><a href=\"/opinion/203469/united-states-v-cruz-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2008). We afford the district court \"wide discretion\" in sentencing decisions. <i>United States v. Marceau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203644\"><a href=\"/opinion/203644/united-states-v-marceau/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2009). Ultimately, \"the linchpin of a reasonable sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) requires judges to \"consider ... the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" Although this section is \"primarily aimed at national disparities, rather than those between co-defendants ..., a district court may consider differences and similarities between co-defendants at sentencing.\" <i>Marceau,</i> 554 F.3d at 33. However, a \"defendant is not entitled to a lighter sentence merely because his co-defendants received lighter sentences.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks omitted). Still, \"concerns could arise if two identically situated defendants received different sentences from the same judge.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, it was <i>not</i> the same judge who sentenced Timi and Nickoyan Wallace in this case, a fact that makes Nickoyan's sentence even less relevant to the reasonableness analysis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Saez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202135\"><a href=\"/opinion/202135/united-states-v-saez/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2006). More importantly, \"the district court confronted the disparity head-on,\" <i>Marceau,</i> 554 F.3d at 34, and explicitly described the reasons that appellant and Nickoyan Wallace were not \"identically situated.\" It focused on a number of aggravating factors that were present only in appellant's case. Specifically, the court pointed to the departures for the use of a dangerous weapon, obstruction of government function, and extreme psychological injury, none of which were applied to Nickoyan.<sup>[14]</sup> Appellant's extended flight from authorities <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> differentiated his case from Nickoyan's. The government had to expend additional resources by holding two separate trials four years apart. Also, Mr. DiBiasio and Ms. Gallinelli had to live in constant fear while appellant was at large. The district court's detailed justification for the disparity in sentencing complies easily with the reasonableness standard.</p>\n<p>Appellant's attempt to use the government's change of strategy at resentencing to assail his sentence must also fail. He cites no authority for the proposition that the government's changed approach to a sentencing proceeding on remand should affect the reasonableness analysis in any way. We reject the relevance of that change to the reasonableness analysis.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The PSR, as well as all subsequent court proceedings, applied the 1998 Guidelines Manual, and we therefore do the same. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 22 n. 3. Accordingly, all references to the Guidelines refer to the 1998 Manual, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>[2]  Although Wallace was convicted of stealing six firearms from the store, the multiple weapons enhancement included the two guns that the defendant and his co-conspirator brandished during the robbery. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(C); <i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 35.</p>\n<p>[3]  As we discuss <i>infra,</i> the district court's finding that Wallace was under indictment for another felony was erroneous. As the PSR correctly noted, there had been a complaint lodged in Massachusetts state court accusing appellant of murdering his own brother, Tasfa Wallace, but the case had not yet proceeded to an indictment.</p>\n<p>[4]  Wallace also challenged the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Because of our other rulings, we did not need to reach this issue on his first appeal.</p>\n<p>[5]  We also reject Wallace's argument that the result of his prior appeal was a \"general remand\" that allowed the district court to review all sentencing matters de novo. \"Although some circuits do generally allow de novo resentencing on remand, the First Circuit does not.\" <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203369\"><a href=\"/opinion/203369/united-states-v-cruzado-laureano/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 234 (1st Cir.2008) (citations omitted). This is the thrust of our decision in <i>Ticchiarelli</i>-that upon a resentencing after a remand, the district court <i>may only consider</i> \"such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals' decision  whether by the reasoning or by the result.\" <i>Id.</i> at 235 (citing <i>Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d at 32).</p>\n<p>[6]  Wallace also argues that the government's failure to raise the law of the case below precludes us from applying the subsequent appellate panel rule to those issues that he explicitly asks us to \"reconsider.\" We fail to see how a doctrine directed at subsequent appellate panels can be waived by failure to raise it at the trial level. We also note that the dicta in <i>Lorenzo-Hernández</i> and <i>Olivero</i> should not be understood to suggest that the government waives all law of the case arguments by failing to raise them in the district court. Frankly, we are uneasy with this dicta, which would impose a burden on us to reconsider issues already decided. The prudential law of the case doctrine is ultimately directed at conserving judicial resources and preserving the integrity of our own processes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 647; <i>United States v. Rivera-Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559873\"><a href=\"/opinion/559873/united-states-v-hector-rivera-martinez-aka-el-men/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 149 (1st Cir.1991). We therefore reject any intimation in our cases that we cannot raise the law of the case issue sua sponte if we deem it appropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maxfield v. Cintas Corp. No. 2,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797900\"><a href=\"/opinion/797900/darold-maxfield-v-cintas-corporation-no-2/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>, 1135 (8th Cir.2007); <i>Bollinger v. Or.,</i> 172 Fed.Appx. 770, 771 (9th Cir.2006); <i>DiLaura v. Power Auth. of State of N.Y.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597144\"><a href=\"/opinion/597144/j-gary-dilaura-individually-and-as-president-of-waterfront-homeowners/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 76 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>[7]  Instead, it was determined under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(B), which prescribes a base offense level of 20 if \"the offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30); and the defendant (i) is a prohibited person; or (ii) is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d).\" According to the PSR, Wallace was a \"prohibited person\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) because he was a fugitive from justice at the time of the offense (since he was a suspect in connection with the murder of his brother) and also because he admitted being an unlawful, addicted user of marijuana at the time of the offense. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, cmt. n. 6.</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Goff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"162943\"><a href=\"/opinion/162943/united-states-v-goff/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span>, 1249-50 (10th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Hurst,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770650\"><a href=\"/opinion/770650/united-states-v-scottie-ray-hurst/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 764 (6th Cir.2000); <i>United States v.

This claim is inaccurate. Indeed, the court explicitly noted that \"I don't think I can consider the destruction of the business, although I do think I can consider the impact that that has on one's psyche. You build a business over a lifetime and it's the culmination of your life's work, and to see that destroyed cannot help but have an impact on the victim.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  With respect to this departure only, the government cites the 2005 edition of the Guidelines because (1) this court seems to have used this edition in the prior appeal, <i>see</i> 461 F.3d at 41-42; (2) the government relied on this edition at the resentencing, without objection, and (3) none of the post-1998 changes in language or numbering would affect the outcome. We agree and, for the purposes of this departure only, will also refer to the 2005 Manual.</p>\n<p>[11]  Defined by the Guidelines as \"probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A.1.1(d).</p>\n<p>[12]  In the first appeal, in a challenge to certain remarks made by the prosecution in closing, Wallace argued that his flight and the use of aliases might have reflected his attempt to evade the murder charge, rather than flight based on the robbery charges. <i>See </i><i>Wallace,</i> 461 F.3d at 42.</p>\n<p>[13]  Appellant also advances an additional argument, for the first time on appeal, that the criminal history departure represented impermissible double-counting because the multiple weapons enhancement he received for Count III was premised in part on the fact that he possessed the firearms as a \"prohibited person\"  a designation that was based on findings that he was \"a fugitive from justice\" and \"an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\" He now contends that his designation as a \"fugitive from justice\" makes the imposition of the criminal history departure redundant. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are considered waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hernández-Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span>, 143 n. 5 (1st Cir.2006). We therefore refuse to consider them.</p>\n<p>[14]  The court also noted that the criminal history departure raised appellant's criminal history category to the same as his brother's, and, while Nickoyan's might have been raised even further, that motion had not been made in his case.</p>\n<p>[15]  Appellant also makes several perfunctory constitutional claims. He argues 1) that the sentencing disparity violates the Constitution and 2) that the change in the government's recommendation between the first and second sentencing proceedings represents a violation of his rights on the basis of prosecutorial vindictiveness. These perfunctory arguments are both waived, <i>United States v.
