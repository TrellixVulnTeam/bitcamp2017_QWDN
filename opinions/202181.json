George A.

Loeb, Attorneys, Appellate Staff, and\nPeter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, were on brief for\nU.S. Department of Education.\n     Mark F. Weaver with whom Ford, Weaver & McDonald, PA, was on\nbrief for New Hampshire Higher Education Assistance Foundation.\n     R. Richard Croce for Connecticut Student Loan Foundation.\n\n\n                          April 26, 2006\n\f      COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.         Appellant is the debtor in a\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding.       The total indebtedness revealed\n\nby her bankruptcy schedules was approximately $285,000; of this\n\namount,    some   $140,000   consisted      of   student    loans,      made   or\n\nguaranteed by state student loan foundations, universities, and the\n\nUnited States Department of Education.           This appeal stems from an\n\nadversary proceeding brought by appellant against these entities in\n\nthe bankruptcy court of the District of Massachusetts, seeking\n\ndischarge of her education loans, under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8), on\n\nthe ground that repaying the debts would impose an \"undue hardship\"\n\non her.1\n\n      The bankruptcy judge ruled that appellant had not carried her\n\nburden of showing \"undue hardship.\" The judge based her conclusion\n\non   the   absence   or   inadequacy   of    evidence      on   three    points:\n\nappellant’s long-term prognosis, the effects over time of therapy\n\nand medication, and the effects of her mental condition on her\n\nemployment prospects. The judge added a finding that appellant had\n\nnot made a good faith attempt to repay her loans.               In affirming,\n\nthe district judge endorsed both the good faith finding and the\n\nconclusion \"that Nash had not shown that her disability was likely\n\nto continue for such a period of time that she could not reasonably\n\n\n      1\n       In relevant part, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8) provides that a\ndischarge in bankruptcy does not discharge a debtor from a\nspecified class of student loan debt \"unless excepting such debt\nfrom discharge . . . will impose an undue hardship on the debtor .\n. . .\"\n\n                                   -2-\n\fbe expected to repay the education loans in the future.\"   See Nash\n\nv. Conn. Student Loan Found., 330 B.R. 323, 327 (D. Mass. 2005).\n\nFor reasons we shall explain, we affirm without reaching the issue\n\nof good faith.\n\n                       I. The Legal Setting\n\n     In the course of the proceedings to this point, there has been\n\nmuch attention given to the particular test which should be applied\n\nto determine \"undue hardship.\"    Congress did not attempt to give\n\nspecific guidance.    We as a circuit have not had occasion to\n\ndeclare our views.\n\n     Appellees would have us join the nine circuit courts of appeal\n\nthat have followed the Second Circuit's test set forth in Brunner\n\nv. New York State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., 831 F.2d 395 (2d Cir.\n\n1987) (per curiam).   This is a tripartite test, requiring that the\n\ndebtor show inability, at her current level of income and expenses,\n\nto maintain a \"minimal\" standard of living; the likelihood that\n\nthis inability will persist for a significant portion of the\n\nrepayment period; and the existence of good faith efforts to repay\n\nthe loans.   Id. at 396.\n\n     A facially different test is the Eighth Circuit's totality-of-\n\ncircumstances test, which would have courts consider the debtor's\n\nreasonably reliable future financial resources, his reasonably\n\nnecessary living expenses, and \"any other relevant facts.”     See\n\nLong v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. (In re Long), 322 F.3d 549, 554\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f(8th Cir. 2003).       Appellant contends that this test does not\n\ninclude \"good faith effort\" under the \"other relevant facts\"\n\nrubric, although bankruptcy courts within the Eighth Circuit are\n\nnot unanimous on this issue.         She urges a “true totality of the\n\ncircumstances test,” focusing solely on the ability of the debtor\n\nto   maintain   a   minimal   standard      of   living    now   and    in   \"the\n\nforeseeable future\" and still afford to make loan repayments.\n\n      The bankruptcy judge, citing her opinion in Burkhead v. United\n\nStates (In re Burkhead), 304 B.R. 560, 565 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2004),\n\napplied the totality approach but was of the view that courts\n\nessentially looked at the same factors under either test.                    She\n\nlisted four relevant factors, including good faith efforts.                   The\n\ndistrict   judge    noted   the    unadorned     breadth   of    the   statutory\n\nlanguage, which he felt pointed to the totality test as \"the\n\ndefault standard for all judging,\" and found that the care and\n\nmethodical approach of the bankruptcy judge was \"proper employment\n\nof a 'totality-of-the-circumstances' test, which is another way of\n\nsaying it was proper judging.\"        See 330 B.R. at 326-27.\n\n      We see no need in this case to pronounce our views of a\n\npreferred method of identifying a case of \"undue hardship.\"                  The\n\nstandards urged on us by the parties both require the debtor to\n\ndemonstrate that her disability will prevent her from working for\n\nthe foreseeable future.           Appellant has a formidable task, for\n\nCongress has made the judgment that the general purpose of the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fBankruptcy Code to give honest debtors a fresh start does not\n\nautomatically apply to student loan debtors.    Rather, the interest\n\nin ensuring the continued viability of the student loan program\n\ntakes precedence.   TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921,\n\n937 (1st Cir. 1995).    Moreover, the judgment of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt, which is the focus of our review, see Groman v. Watman (In\n\nre Watman), 301 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2002), was not a summary\n\njudgment adverse to appellant; it was a decision reached after\n\ntrial and, as the district judge properly noted, that court's\n\nfindings of fact must stand if reasonably supported.    See McMullen\n\nv. Sevigny (In re McMullen), 386 F.3d 320, 329 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe ultimate question of law – whether appellant proved “undue\n\nhardship” – is subject to de novo review.      Tirch v. Penn. Higher\n\nEduc. Assistance Agency (In re Tirch), 409 F.3d 677, 680 (6th Cir.\n\n2005); Martin v. Bajgar (In re Bajgar), 104 F.3d 495, 497 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n     Taking this view of the case, we need not consider the issue\n\nof good faith effort to repay; nor need we review the evidence\n\nconcerning appellant’s use and retention of her income and assets,\n\nor her failure to utilize available avenues of assistance to\n\nminimize the impact of repayment.     We also emphasize that our\n\nconclusion that this record is insufficient to carry the day does\n\nnot foreclose appellant from a future effort, buttressed with more\n\npersuasive support.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f                       II. Factual Background\n\n     Appellant's higher education and employment history, from her\n\ngraduation with honors from Dartmouth in 1984 to her attendance at\n\nthe University of Michigan Law School a decade later, was one of\n\nhigh achievement.     From 1984 to 1990, she worked for a leading\n\npublishing   house,    an   international   non-profit   educational\n\norganization, and the United Hospital Fund of New York, moving\n\nupward steadily from editorial assistant to assistant and then to\n\nassociate editor, and finally to the position of public information\n\nofficer of the Hospital Fund.      During this period she remained\n\ncurrent in her student loan repayments.\n\n     In 1990 she entered Yale Management School, receiving in 1992\n\nwhat is now considered an MBA degree.       On graduating, she was\n\nemployed by Prudential Securities as an investment banker in\n\nhealthcare and higher education finance, eventually being promoted\n\nto a position as vice president in the municipal bond department,\n\nwith a salary of $120,000.\n\n     Appellant then carried out a decision reached two years\n\nearlier and entered the University of Michigan Law School in 1994,\n\nwhere she took a full course load and also worked as a research\n\nassistant for four professors.    During her first year, she found\n\nshe was having difficulty focusing.     A psychiatrist treated her\n\nwith medication for manic/depressive symptoms.    During the summer\n\nof 1996, after her second year, she worked for a large law firm in\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fWashington, D.C., but was unable to concentrate and to finish\n\nassignments.   During her third year, she felt obliged to withdraw\n\nfrom law school and did some work as a telemarketer.    She ceased\n\nthis work in December 1997.      Subsequently, the Social Security\n\nAdministration determined that she had been disabled since December\n\n1, 1997.   She has not worked regularly since then, and has been\n\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder.   She is under the care of a pair\n\nof doctors, Dr. Ronningstam and Dr. Mallya.\n\n     Appellant filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the\n\nBankruptcy Code in September 2002.      All debts other than her\n\nstudent loans were automatically discharged, and she then filed the\n\ncomplaint underlying this appeal seeking discharge of the student\n\nloans on the ground of undue hardship, under section 523(a)(8) of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code.\n\n                          III. Discussion\n\n     Under any test assessing eligibility for discharge of student\n\nloan debt, appellant must show that her current inability to\n\nmaintain a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the debt\n\nwill continue into the future.   We thus come to the issue we have\n\nisolated as the key to decision in this appeal: does the record\n\nsupport the bankruptcy judge's holding that appellant did not\n\nestablish that her disability would continue to prevent her from\n\nremunerative work?\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f      The judge used various phrases to characterize the duration of\n\nthe incapacity that appellant needed to demonstrate.             Nash seizes\n\non the judge's choice of language such as this passage reveals:\n\n\"The Debtor did not establish that it [is] more likely than not\n\nthat her mental condition will disable her indefinitely. There was\n\nno   admissible   evidence   to   support   a   finding   that   Ms.   Nash's\n\ndisorder permanently disables her from employment.\" (Emphasis in\n\noriginal.)     Appellant argues that this statement sets the bar\n\nhigher than is required even by Brunner, which requires only that\n\nthe evidence of disability endure for a significant portion of the\n\nrepayment period or for the reasonably foreseeable future. See 831\n\nF.2d at 396.\n\n      What is revealed by the context of the judge's remarks,\n\nhowever, is that her decision did not turn on the projected length\n\nof appellant’s disability, but on the total absence of any reliable\n\nevidence of future inability to work. The sentences we have quoted\n\nwere immediately preceded by the following:\n\n      There was a dearth of evidence on the Debtor's prognosis,\n      the effect of medication on her condition, and her\n      employment prospects. Ms. Nash submitted no evidence of\n      her long-term prognosis. It is unclear whether therapy\n      and medication will improve Ms. Nash's mental condition\n      over time.\n\n      Moreover, prior to the passage quoted, the judge had referred\n\nin her opinion to another case involving bipolar disorder, where\n\nexpert testimony concluded with the prognosis that \"it is more\n\nlikely than not that the debtor's debilitating condition will\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpersist for a significant portion of the repayment period.\"           See\n\nKelsey v. Great Lakes Higher Educ. Corp. (In re Kelsey), 287 B.R.\n\n132, 144 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2001).        This analysis, of course, is the\n\nsame formula endorsed by appellant.        We think that the district\n\njudge was justified in characterizing the bankruptcy court decision\n\nas consistent with this formulation.       In any event, we analyze the\n\nrecord, applying the lowest threshold and searching it for any\n\ncompelling evidence of the disabling condition persisting for the\n\nforeseeable future.\n\n     A major weakness in appellant's case, in contrast to Kelsey,\n\nwas her failure to call any of her doctors to testify.        Nor did she\n\nappeal the court’s exclusion of the expert prognosis in her medical\n\nrecords, an action apparently taken for procedural reasons.           The\n\nstate of the evidence at the conclusion of trial on January 23,\n\n2004 was as follows.\n\n     Dr. Ronningstam's last report, dated April 17, 2003, states\n\nthat appellant suffers from bipolar II disorder, which includes\n\n\"episodes of major depression and episodes of elevated mood and\n\nenergy, but without mania.\"     The condition disables her cognitive\n\nfunctioning, endurance, and ability to concentrate.            Tasks may\n\nleave   her   feeling   exhausted,    lacking   energy,   having   trouble\n\nsleeping. Sometimes her thought processes go too fast, leaving her\n\nhead \"spinning.\"    She is sensitive to stress and easily tearful.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f       Appellant added her agreement to these findings, adding that\n\nthere are days when she cannot get out of bed.         She also referred\n\nto two Temporary Total Disability Deferment Request forms, signed\n\nby Dr. Mallya and stating that she is disabled with bipolar\n\ndisorder.    These, however, do not indicate extensive duration of\n\ntotal disability.    The forms specifically carry the notation that\n\n\"[t]his disability is temporary\" and that the debtor understands\n\nthat   limitation.    On   the   request    dated   July   23,   2002,   the\n\ncertificate of the signing doctor stated that the length of the\n\ndisabling condition was \"undetermined\"; on the other, dated June 6,\n\n2002, the entry as to duration is “unknown.”         Appellant felt that\n\nshe could not apply for an administrative discharge of her loans\n\nbased on a permanent total disability because she retained the\n\ncapacity, at least sporadically, to earn small amounts of income.\n\n       Appellant's testimony, beyond affirming her doctors' report,\n\nvaried.    She stated that she felt fine on some days, but that she\n\n\"fluctuate[d] hugely,\" that she had become in the past couple of\n\nyears \"more stable,\" that \"my life is much better now.\"          She stated\n\nthat she could not commit to working five days a week but would\n\nlike to \"make money when I can.\"         Asked about her prognosis, she\n\nreplied that, at age 41, her chances of \"stabilizing continuously\n\nare not very good,\" but acknowledged that her medications helped\n\nkeep her from feeling \"completely out of control.\"                 She was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\ffollowing a regimen of seeing Dr. Ronningstam three times a week\n\nand Dr. Mallya once a week.\n\n       The specific question we face is whether, on this record,\n\nwhere the illness is bipolar disorder, where we have no prognosis\n\nfrom treating physicians or other experts, where the testimony of\n\nappellant herself as to the future is necessarily speculative, the\n\nbankruptcy court supportably found that appellant had not carried\n\nher   burden    of   proving   a   sufficient    likely   future    period   of\n\nunemployability.\n\n       Appellant's perception of her case, as reflected by counsel in\n\noral argument, is essentially that one would not insist on expert\n\ntestimony if the debtor appeared in court in a wheelchair. Putting\n\nto one side the observation that such a physical disability does\n\nnot in any way correlate to the ability to maintain demanding and\n\nresponsible employment, bipolar disorder is a rubric covering many\n\nconditions, many kinds of treatment, and many levels and durations\n\nof    disablement.      Appellant's    last     diagnosis   was    bipolar   II\n\ndisorder.      A booklet issued by the National Institute of Mental\n\nHealth, cited by the government, describes the levels of the\n\ndisorder as follows:\n\n       The classic form of the illness, which involves recurrent\n       episodes of mania and depression, is called bipolar I\n       disorder.   Some people, however, never develop severe\n       mania but instead experience milder episodes of hypomania\n       that alternate with depression; this form of the illness\n       is called bipolar II disorder.\n\n(Bold in original.)\n\n                                     -11-\n\f     The booklet holds out the likelihood that people with bipolar\n\ndisorder may lead productive lives with proper treatment.          The\n\nrecords indicate that the illness afflicting appellant is not its\n\nmost severe form.   In addition, we note that on January 27, 2003,\n\nonly seven weeks before the most recent evaluation on record, Dr.\n\nRunningstam recorded a diagnosis of “Bipolar Disorder II/III.”\n\nWhether this means that appellant's condition bordered on an even\n\nless disabling form of the illness we do not know.       But we are\n\nconfident that the bankruptcy judge did not commit any error of law\n\nor clear error of fact in finding a lack of sufficient evidence of\n\nthe likely duration of appellant's inability to work.\n\n     A case remarkably similar on its facts to this one is Shilling\n\nv. Sallie Mae Servicing Corp. (In re Shilling), 333 B.R. 716\n\n(Bankr. W.D. Pa. 2005).      The debtor had obtained a bachelor’s\n\ndegree in psychology before being adjudged disabled with a \"severe\n\nbipolar disorder\" by a Social Security administrative law judge.\n\nId. at 720.   As in the instant case, the debtor submitted no expert\n\nevidence to supplement her own prognosis.    The   court stated:\n\n          While we might give considerable weight to the\n     opinion of a qualified expert concerning the expected\n     duration of debtor's psychological disorders, debtor\n     herself does not qualify as an expert in such matters.\n     Moreover, because she is caught in the maelstrom of her\n     psychological problems, debtor is not in a position to\n     offer an objective and informed opinion concerning her\n     future psychological condition, one that would withstand\n     scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fId. at 722.    We cannot fault the bankruptcy judge in this case for\n\ntaking a similar position.          See generally Burton v. Educ. Credit\n\nMgmt. Corp. (In re Burton), Nos. 04-53297-SCS, 05-5016-SCS, 2006 WL\n\n802885 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Jan. 11, 2006) (discussing cases addressing\n\nthe   need   for   corroborating        medical    evidence   on   prognosis        of\n\ndisabling condition).\n\n      This does not mean the end of the road for appellant.                  If her\n\ncondition justifies it, she may be successful in securing an\n\nadministrative discharge on the basis of total and permanent\n\ndisability.        See    34    C.F.R.    §     682.402(c)(15);    34     C.F.R.    §\n\n685.213(a).        In    any   event,    our    decision   today   does    not     bar\n\nappellant from making another, more adequately supported request\n\nfor discharge.      See 11 U.S.C. § 523(b); see also Storey v. Nat’l\n\nEnter. Sys. (In re Storey), 312 B.R. 867, 875 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio\n\n2004).2\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Section 523(b) states, in relevant part: “. . . [A] debt\nthat was excepted from discharge under subsection . . .

The total indebtedness revealed by her bankruptcy schedules was approximately $285,000; of this amount, some $140,000 consisted of student loans, made or guaranteed by state student loan foundations, universities, and the United States Department of Education. This appeal stems from an adversary proceeding brought by appellant against these entities in the bankruptcy court of the District of Massachusetts, seeking discharge of her education loans, under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(8), on the ground that repaying the debts would impose an \"undue hardship\" on her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy judge ruled that appellant had not carried her burden of showing \"undue hardship.\" The judge based her conclusion on the absence or inadequacy of evidence on three points: appellant's long-term prognosis, the effects over time of therapy and medication, and the effects of her mental condition on her employment prospects. The judge added a finding that appellant had not made a good faith attempt to repay her loans. In affirming, the district judge endorsed both the good faith finding and the conclusion \"that Nash had not shown that her disability was likely to continue for such a period of time that she could not reasonably be expected to repay the education loans in the future.\" <i>See Nash v. Conn. Student Loan Found.,</i> 330 B.R. 323, 327 (D.Mass.2005). For reasons we shall explain, we affirm without reaching the issue of good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>The Legal Setting</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the proceedings to this point, there has been much attention given to the particular test which should be applied to determine \"undue hardship.\" Congress did not attempt to give specific guidance. We as a circuit have not had occasion to declare our views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees would have us join the nine circuit courts of appeal that have followed the Second Circuit's test set forth in <i>Brunner v. New York State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp.,</i> 831 F.2d 395 (2d Cir.1987) (per curiam). This is a tripartite test, requiring that the debtor show inability, at her current level of income and expenses, to maintain a \"minimal\" standard of living; the likelihood that this inability will persist for a significant portion of the repayment period; and the existence of good faith efforts to repay the loans. <i>Id.</i> at 396.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A facially different test is the Eighth Circuit's totality-of-circumstances test, which would have courts consider the debtor's reasonably reliable future financial resources, his reasonably necessary living expenses, and \"any other relevant facts.\" <i>See Long v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. (In re Long),</i> 322 F.3d 549, 554 (8th Cir.2003). Appellant contends that this test does not include \"good faith effort\" under the \"other relevant facts\" rubric, although bankruptcy courts within the Eighth Circuit are not unanimous on this issue. She urges a \"true totality of the circumstances test,\" focusing solely on the ability of the debtor to maintain a minimal standard of living now and in \"the foreseeable future\" and still afford to make loan repayments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy judge, citing her opinion in <i>Burkhead v. United States (In re Burkhead),</i> 304 B.R. 560, 565 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2004), applied the totality approach but was of the view that courts essentially looked at the same factors under either test. She listed four relevant factors, including good faith efforts. The district judge noted the unadorned breadth of the statutory language, which he felt pointed to the totality test as \"the default standard for all judging,\" and found that the care and methodical approach of the bankruptcy judge was \"proper employment of a `totality-of-the-circumstances' test, which is another way of saying it was proper judging.\" <i>See</i> 330 B.R. at 326-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need in this case to pronounce our views of a preferred method of identifying a case of \"undue hardship.\" The standards urged on us by the parties both require the debtor to demonstrate that her disability will prevent her from working for the foreseeable future. Appellant has a formidable task, for Congress has made the judgment that the general purpose of the Bankruptcy Code to give honest debtors a fresh start does not automatically apply to student loan debtors. Rather, the interest in ensuring the continued viability of the student loan program takes precedence. <i>TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis,</i> 72 F.3d 921, 937 (1st Cir.1995). Moreover, the judgment of the bankruptcy court, which is the focus of our review, <i>see Groman v. Watman (In re Watman),</i> 301 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.2002), was not a summary judgment adverse to appellant; it was a decision reached after trial and, as the district judge properly noted, that court's findings of fact must stand if reasonably supported. <i>See McMullen v. Sevigny (In re McMullen),</i> 386 F.3d 320, 329 (1st Cir.2004). The ultimate question of law &#8212; whether appellant proved \"undue hardship\" &#8212; is subject to de novo review. <i>Tirch v. Penn. Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Tirch),</i> 409 F.3d 677, 680 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Martin v. Bajgar (In re Bajgar),</i> 104 F.3d 495, 497 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking this view of the case, we need not consider the issue of good faith effort to repay; nor need we review the evidence concerning appellant's use and retention of her income and assets, or her failure to utilize available avenues of assistance to minimize the impact of repayment. We also emphasize that our conclusion that this record is insufficient to carry the day does not foreclose appellant from a future effort, buttressed with more persuasive support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's higher education and employment history, from her graduation with honors from Dartmouth in 1984 to her attendance at the University of Michigan Law School a decade later, was one of high achievement. From 1984 to 1990, she worked for a leading publishing house, an international non-profit educational organization, and the United Hospital Fund of New York, moving upward steadily from editorial assistant to assistant and then to associate editor, and finally to the position of public information officer of the Hospital Fund. During this period she remained current in her student loan repayments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990 she entered Yale Management School, receiving in 1992 what is now considered an MBA degree. On graduating, she was employed by Prudential Securities as an investment banker in healthcare and higher education finance, eventually being promoted to a position as vice president in the municipal bond department, with a salary of $120,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then carried out a decision reached two years earlier and entered the University of Michigan Law School in 1994, where she took a full course load and also worked as a research assistant for four professors. During her first year, she found she was having difficulty focusing. A psychiatrist treated her with medication for manic/depressive symptoms. During the summer of 1996, after her second year, she worked for a large law firm in Washington, D.C., but was unable to concentrate and to finish assignments. During her third year, she felt obliged to withdraw from law school and did some work as a telemarketer. She ceased this work in December 1997. Subsequently, the Social Security Administration determined that she had been disabled since December 1, 1997. She has not worked regularly since then, and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She is under the care of a pair of doctors, Dr. Ronningstam and Dr. Mallya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2002. All debts other than her student loans were automatically discharged, and she then filed the complaint underlying this appeal seeking discharge of the student loans on the ground of undue hardship, under section 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under any test assessing eligibility for discharge of student loan debt, appellant must show that her current inability to maintain a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the debt will continue into the future. We thus come to the issue we have isolated as the key to decision in this appeal: does the record support the bankruptcy judge's holding that appellant did not establish that her disability would continue to prevent her from remunerative work?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge used various phrases to characterize the duration of the incapacity that appellant needed to demonstrate. Nash seizes on the judge's choice of language such as this passage reveals: \"The Debtor did not establish that it [is] more likely than not that her mental condition will disable her indefinitely. There was no admissible evidence to support a finding that Ms. Nash's disorder <i>permanently</i> disables her from employment.\" (Emphasis in original.) Appellant argues that this statement sets the bar higher than is required even by <i>Brunner,</i> which requires only that the evidence of disability endure for a significant portion of the repayment period or for the reasonably foreseeable future. <i>See</i> 831 F.2d at 396.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is revealed by the context of the judge's remarks, however, is that her decision did not turn on the projected length of appellant's disability, but on the total absence of any reliable evidence of future inability to work. The sentences we have quoted were immediately preceded by the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a dearth of evidence on the Debtor's prognosis, the effect of medication on her condition, and her employment prospects. Ms. Nash submitted no evidence of her long-term prognosis. It is unclear whether therapy and medication will improve Ms. Nash's mental condition over time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, prior to the passage quoted, the judge had referred in her opinion to another case involving bipolar disorder, where expert testimony concluded with the prognosis that \"it is more likely than not that the debtor's debilitating condition will persist for a significant portion of the repayment period.\" <i>See Kelsey v. Great Lakes Higher Educ. Corp. (In re Kelsey),</i> 287 B.R. 132, 144 (Bankr.D.Vt.2001). This analysis, of course, is the same formula endorsed by appellant. We think that the district judge was justified in characterizing the bankruptcy court decision as consistent with this formulation. In any event, we analyze the record, applying the lowest threshold and searching it for any compelling evidence of the disabling condition persisting for the foreseeable future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A major weakness in appellant's case, in contrast to <i>Kelsey,</i> was her failure to call any of her doctors to testify. Nor did she appeal the court's exclusion of the expert prognosis in her medical records, an action apparently taken for procedural reasons. The state of the evidence at the conclusion of trial on January 23, 2004 was as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Ronningstam's last report, dated April 17, 2003, states that appellant suffers from bipolar II disorder, which includes \"episodes of major depression and episodes of elevated mood and energy, but without mania.\" The condition disables her cognitive functioning, endurance, and ability to concentrate. Tasks may leave her feeling exhausted, lacking energy, having trouble sleeping. Sometimes her thought processes go too fast, leaving her head \"spinning.\" She is sensitive to stress and easily tearful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant added her agreement to these findings, adding that there are days when she cannot get out of bed. She also referred to two Temporary Total Disability Deferment Request forms, signed by Dr. Mallya and stating that she is disabled with bipolar disorder. These, however, do not indicate extensive duration of total disability. The forms specifically carry the notation that \"[t]his disability is temporary\" and that the debtor understands that limitation. On the request dated July 23, 2002, the certificate of the signing doctor stated that the length of the disabling condition was \"undetermined\"; on the other, dated June 6, 2002, the entry as to duration is \"unknown.\" Appellant felt that she could not apply for an administrative discharge of her loans based on a permanent total disability because she retained the capacity, at least sporadically, to earn small amounts of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's testimony, beyond affirming her doctors' report, varied. She stated that she felt fine on some days, but that she \"fluctuate[d] hugely,\" that she had become in the past couple of years \"more stable,\" that \"my life is much better now.\" She stated that she could not commit to working five days a week but would like to \"make money when I can.\" Asked about her prognosis, she replied that, at age 41, her chances of \"stabilizing continuously are not very good,\" but acknowledged that her medications helped keep her from feeling \"completely out of control.\" She was following a regimen of seeing Dr. Ronningstam three times a week and Dr. Mallya once a week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific question we face is whether, on this record, where the illness is bipolar disorder, where we have no prognosis from treating physicians or other experts, where the testimony of appellant herself as to the future is necessarily speculative, the bankruptcy court supportably found that appellant had not carried her burden of proving a sufficient likely future period of unemployability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's perception of her case, as reflected by counsel in oral argument, is essentially that one would not insist on expert testimony if the debtor appeared in court in a wheelchair. Putting to one side the observation that such a physical disability does not in any way correlate to the ability to maintain demanding and responsible employment, bipolar disorder is a rubric covering many conditions, many kinds of treatment, and many levels and durations of disablement. Appellant's last diagnosis was bipolar II disorder. A booklet issued by the National Institute of Mental Health, cited by the government, describes the levels of the disorder as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The classic form of the illness, which involves recurrent episodes of mania and depression, is called bipolar I disorder. Some people, however, never develop severe mania but instead experience milder episodes of hypomania that alternate with depression; this form of the illness is called bipolar II disorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Bold in original.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The booklet holds out the likelihood that people with bipolar disorder may lead productive lives with proper treatment. The records indicate that the illness afflicting appellant is not its most severe form. In addition, we note that on January 27, 2003, only seven weeks before the most recent evaluation on record, Dr. Runningstam recorded a diagnosis of \"Bipolar Disorder II/III.\" Whether this means that appellant's condition bordered on an even less disabling form of the illness we do not know. But we are confident that the bankruptcy judge did not commit any error of law or clear error of fact in finding a lack of sufficient evidence of the likely duration of appellant's inability to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A case remarkably similar on its facts to this one is <i>Shilling v. Sallie Mae Servicing Corp. (In re Shilling),</i> 333 B.R. 716 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.2005). The debtor had obtained a bachelor's degree in psychology before being adjudged disabled with a \"severe bipolar disorder\" by a Social Security administrative law judge. <i>Id.</i> at 720. As in the instant case, the debtor submitted no expert evidence to supplement her own prognosis. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we might give considerable weight to the opinion of a qualified expert concerning the expected duration of debtor's psychological disorders, debtor herself does not qualify as an expert in such matters. Moreover, because she is caught in the maelstrom of her psychological problems, debtor is not in a position to offer an objective and informed opinion concerning her future psychological condition, one that would withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 722. We cannot fault the bankruptcy judge in this case for taking a similar position. <i>See generally Burton v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. (In re Burton),</i> 339 B.R. 856 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Va.2006) (discussing cases addressing the need for corroborating medical evidence on prognosis of disabling condition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean the end of the road for appellant. If her condition justifies it, she may be successful in securing an administrative discharge on the basis of total and permanent disability. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 682.402(c)(15); 34 C.F.R. &#167; 685.213(a). In any event, our decision today does not bar appellant from making another, more adequately supported request for discharge. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(b); <i>see also Storey v. Nat'l Enter. Sys.

The district judge noted the unadorned breadth of the statutory language, which he felt pointed to the totality test as \"the default standard for all judging,\" and found that the care and methodical approach of the bankruptcy judge was \"proper employment of a `totality-of-the-circumstances' test, which is another way of saying it was proper judging.\" <i>See</i> 330 B.R. at 326-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need in this case to pronounce our views of a preferred method of identifying a case of \"undue hardship.\" The standards urged on us by the parties both require the debtor to demonstrate that her disability will prevent her from working for the foreseeable future. Appellant has a formidable task, for Congress has made the judgment that the general purpose of the Bankruptcy Code to give honest debtors a fresh start does not automatically apply to student loan debtors. Rather, the interest in ensuring the continued viability of the student loan program takes precedence. <i>TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196479\"><a href=\"/opinion/196479/t-i-v-delbonis/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span>, 937 (1st Cir.1995). Moreover, the judgment of the bankruptcy court, which is the focus of our review, <i>see Groman v. Watman (In re Watman),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200092\"><a href=\"/opinion/200092/groman-v-watman/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2002), was not a summary judgment adverse to appellant; it was a decision reached after trial and, as the district judge properly noted, that court's findings of fact must stand if reasonably supported. <i>See McMullen v. Sevigny (In re McMullen),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201293\"><a href=\"/opinion/201293/mcmullen-v-sevigny/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, 329 (1st Cir.2004). The ultimate question of law &#8212; whether appellant proved \"undue hardship\" &#8212; is subject to de novo review. <i>Tirch v. Penn. Higher Educ.

We also emphasize that our conclusion that this record is insufficient to carry the day does not foreclose appellant from a future effort, buttressed with more persuasive support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's higher education and employment history, from her graduation with honors from Dartmouth in 1984 to her attendance at the University of Michigan Law School a decade later, was one of high achievement. From 1984 to 1990, she worked for a leading publishing house, an international non-profit educational organization, and the United Hospital Fund of New York, moving upward steadily from editorial assistant to assistant and then to associate editor, and finally to the position of public information officer of the Hospital Fund. During this period she remained current in her student loan repayments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990 she entered Yale Management School, receiving in 1992 what is now considered an MBA degree. On graduating, she was employed by Prudential Securities as an investment banker in healthcare and higher education finance, eventually being promoted to a position as vice president in the municipal bond department, with a salary of $120,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then carried out a decision reached two years earlier and entered the University of Michigan Law School in 1994, where she took a full course load and also worked as a research assistant for four professors. During her first year, she found she was having difficulty focusing. A psychiatrist treated her with medication for manic/depressive symptoms. During the summer of 1996, after her second year, she worked for a large law firm in Washington, D.C., but was unable to concentrate and to finish assignments. During her third year, she felt obliged to withdraw from law school and did some work as a telemarketer. She ceased this work in December 1997. Subsequently, the Social Security Administration determined that she had been disabled since December 1, 1997. She has not worked regularly since then, and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She is under the care of a pair of doctors, Dr. Ronningstam and Dr. Mallya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2002. All debts other than her student loans were automatically discharged, and she then filed the complaint underlying this appeal seeking discharge of the student loans on the ground of undue hardship, under section 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under any test assessing eligibility for discharge of student loan debt, appellant must show that her current inability to maintain a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the debt will continue into the future. We thus come to the issue we have isolated as the key to decision in this appeal: does the record support the bankruptcy judge's holding that appellant did not establish that her disability would continue to prevent her from remunerative work?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge used various phrases to characterize the duration of the incapacity that appellant needed to demonstrate. Nash seizes on the judge's choice of language such as this passage reveals: \"The Debtor did not establish that it [is] more likely than not that her mental condition will disable her indefinitely. There was no admissible evidence to support a finding that Ms. Nash's disorder <i>permanently</i> disables her from employment.\" (Emphasis in original.) Appellant argues that this statement sets the bar higher than is required even by <i>Brunner,</i> which requires only that the evidence of disability endure for a significant portion of the repayment period or for the reasonably foreseeable future. <i>See</i> 831 F.2d at 396.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is revealed by the context of the judge's remarks, however, is that her decision did not turn on the projected length of appellant's disability, but on the total absence of any reliable evidence of future inability to work. The sentences we have quoted were immediately preceded by the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a dearth of evidence on the Debtor's prognosis, the effect of medication on her condition, and her employment prospects. Ms. Nash submitted no evidence of her long-term prognosis. It is unclear whether therapy and medication will improve Ms. Nash's mental condition over time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, prior to the passage quoted, the judge had referred in her opinion to another case involving bipolar disorder, where expert testimony concluded with the prognosis that \"it is more likely than not that the debtor's debilitating condition will persist for a significant portion of the repayment period.\" <i>See Kelsey v. Great Lakes Higher Educ. Corp. (In re Kelsey),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877573\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877573/in-re-kelsey/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span>, 144 (Bankr.D.Vt.2001). This analysis, of course, is the same formula endorsed by appellant. We think that the district judge was justified in characterizing the bankruptcy court decision as consistent with this formulation. In any event, we analyze the record, applying the lowest threshold and searching it for any compelling evidence of the disabling condition persisting for the foreseeable future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A major weakness in appellant's case, in contrast to <i>Kelsey,</i> was her failure to call any of her doctors to testify. Nor did she appeal the court's exclusion of the expert prognosis in her medical records, an action apparently taken for procedural reasons. The state of the evidence at the conclusion of trial on January 23, 2004 was as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Ronningstam's last report, dated April 17, 2003, states that appellant suffers from bipolar II disorder, which includes \"episodes of major depression and episodes of elevated mood and energy, but without mania.\" The condition disables her cognitive functioning, endurance, and ability to concentrate. Tasks may leave her feeling exhausted, lacking energy, having trouble sleeping. Sometimes her thought processes go too fast, leaving her head \"spinning.\" She is sensitive to stress and easily tearful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant added her agreement to these findings, adding that there are days when she cannot get out of bed. She also referred to two Temporary Total Disability Deferment Request forms, signed by Dr. Mallya and stating that she is disabled with bipolar disorder. These, however, do not indicate extensive duration of total disability. The forms specifically carry the notation that \"[t]his disability is temporary\" and that the debtor understands that limitation. On the request dated July 23, 2002, the certificate of the signing doctor stated that the length of the disabling condition was \"undetermined\"; on the other, dated June 6, 2002, the entry as to duration is \"unknown.\" Appellant felt that she could not apply for an administrative discharge of her loans based on a permanent total disability because she retained the capacity, at least sporadically, to earn small amounts of income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's testimony, beyond affirming her doctors' report, varied. She stated that she felt fine on some days, but that she \"fluctuate[d] hugely,\" that she had become in the past couple of years \"more stable,\" that \"my life is much better now.\" She stated that she could not commit to working five days a week but would like to \"make money when I can.\" Asked about her prognosis, she replied that, at age 41, her chances of \"stabilizing continuously are not very good,\" but acknowledged that her medications helped keep her from feeling \"completely out of control.\" She was following a regimen of seeing Dr. Ronningstam three times a week and Dr. Mallya once a week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific question we face is whether, on this record, where the illness is bipolar disorder, where we have no prognosis from treating physicians or other experts, where the testimony of appellant herself as to the future is necessarily speculative, the bankruptcy court supportably found that appellant had not carried her burden of proving a sufficient likely future period of unemployability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's perception of her case, as reflected by counsel in oral argument, is essentially that one would not insist on expert testimony if the debtor appeared in court in a wheelchair. Putting to one side the observation that such a physical disability does not in any way correlate to the ability to maintain demanding and responsible employment, bipolar disorder is a rubric covering many conditions, many kinds of treatment, and many levels and durations of disablement. Appellant's last diagnosis was bipolar II disorder. A booklet issued by the National Institute of Mental Health, cited by the government, describes the levels of the disorder as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The classic form of the illness, which involves recurrent episodes of mania and depression, is called bipolar I disorder. Some people, however, never develop severe mania but instead experience milder episodes of hypomania that alternate with depression; this form of the illness is called bipolar II disorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Bold in original.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The booklet holds out the likelihood that people with bipolar disorder may lead productive lives with proper treatment. The records indicate that the illness afflicting appellant is not its most severe form. In addition, we note that on January 27, 2003, only seven weeks before the most recent evaluation on record, Dr. Runningstam recorded a diagnosis of \"Bipolar Disorder II/III.\" Whether this means that appellant's condition bordered on an even less disabling form of the illness we do not know. But we are confident that the bankruptcy judge did not commit any error of law or clear error of fact in finding a lack of sufficient evidence of the likely duration of appellant's inability to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A case remarkably similar on its facts to this one is <i>Shilling v. Sallie Mae Servicing Corp. (In re Shilling),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1905858\"><a href=\"/opinion/1905858/in-re-shilling/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span> (Bankr.W.D.Pa.2005). The debtor had obtained a bachelor's degree in psychology before being adjudged disabled with a \"severe bipolar disorder\" by a Social Security administrative law judge. <i>Id.</i> at 720. As in the instant case, the debtor submitted no expert evidence to supplement her own prognosis. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we might give considerable weight to the opinion of a qualified expert concerning the expected duration of debtor's psychological disorders, debtor herself does not qualify as an expert in such matters. Moreover, because she is caught in the maelstrom of her psychological problems, debtor is not in a position to offer an objective and informed opinion concerning her future psychological condition, one that would withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 722. We cannot fault the bankruptcy judge in this case for taking a similar position. <i>See generally Burton v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. (In re Burton),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1863462\"><a href=\"/opinion/1863462/in-re-burton/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span> (Bkrtcy.E.D.Va.2006) (discussing cases addressing the need for corroborating medical evidence on prognosis of disabling condition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean the end of the road for appellant. If her condition justifies it, she may be successful in securing an administrative discharge on the basis of total and permanent disability. <i>See</i> 34 C.F.R. &#167; 682.402(c)(15); 34 C.F.R. &#167; 685.213(a). In any event, our decision today does not bar appellant from making another, more adequately supported request for discharge. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(b); <i>see also Storey v. Nat'l Enter.
