Farrell, Attorney, Department of Justice, Civil\nDivision, Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, and Jeffrey S.\nBucholtz, Acting Attorney General, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                            March 13, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.    Petitioner Musa Karim petitions for review\n\nof   the   decision   by   the   Board    of   Immigration   Appeals   (BIA)\n\ndismissing his appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge\n\n(IJ) ordering him removed to Kenya for being an alien in violation\n\nof his immigration status, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. ยง 1227(a)(1)(C)(i).\n\nKarim contends that the BIA erred in rejecting his claim of U.S.\n\ncitizenship and his claims of violations of procedural due process\n\nin his immigration proceedings.          We deny the petition for review.\n\n            \"We review the BIA's decisions under the 'substantial\n\nevidence' standard, which means we will uphold the decision if it\n\nis 'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.' This is a deferential standard,\n\nand we will reverse the BIA only if the evidence compels that\n\nresult.\" Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Karim's central claim is that the IJ and BIA improperly\n\nshifted the burden of proving alienage to him and relied upon\n\nevidence that was obtained as a result of the government's alleged\n\n\"egregious\" and unconstitutional conduct in searching his home.\n\nThe record reveals, however, that the IJ properly relied upon\n\nKarim's pleading, submitted in September 2005, in which he (through\n\ncounsel) admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear\n\n(NTA), including the allegation that he was not a United States\n\ncitizen.    The pleading satisfied the government's burden. \"[T]he\n\ngovernment need only establish the [individual's] identity and\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\falienage to meet its burden on deportation. The burden then shifts\n\nto the [individual] to show the time, place, and manner of entry in\n\norder to defeat deportation.\" Navarro-Chalan v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d\n\n19, 22 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             Karmir argues that he should be permitted to withdraw\n\nthe concession in his pleading because he never specifically\n\nauthorized his attorney to concede the facts alleged in the NTA.\n\nHowever, Kamir has not alleged that he did not authorize Attorney\n\nMacarius to represent him at the September 29, 2005 hearing, in\n\nwhich Kamir participated via televideo conferencing and at which\n\ntime the pleading was submitted without objection.          \"[A]ll that\n\nis required for an attorney's concession to be binding on an\n\nalien   is   the   authorization   of    representation.\"   Pietrzak   v.\n\nMukasey, ___F.3d ___, (2d Cir. 2008) [2008 WL 142796, at *2].\n\nNor has Karim shown that his attorney engaged in the kind of\n\n\"egregious\" conduct that might warrant releasing Karim from his\n\nattorney's concessions. See id.          Karim himself contends that he\n\nonly became aware that he was a United States citizen two months\n\nbefore his February 8, 2007 hearing, long after the pleading was\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fsubmitted.1       He has otherwise failed to allege that the pleading\n\ncontained false information.\n\n              In all events, the record supports the BIA's finding\n\nthat Karim, after claiming U.S. citizenship for the first time in\n\nJanuary 2007, provided \"no evidence that he was born in the\n\nUnited States.\"       The additional evidence submitted to the BIA on\n\nappeal, consisted only of the passport and death certificate for\n\nRuth Schaffner, without explanation of Karim's relationship to\n\nSchaffner or the effect of that relationship upon his citizenship\n\nstatus.       Therefore, we conclude that the BIA supportably found\n\nthat       such   evidence   did    \"not     require   a   remand   for   its\n\nconsideration.\"\n\n              The BIA's rulings on Karim's remaining claims are fully\n\nsupported by the record.           Karim argues that the IJ erred in re-\n\ncalendaring his case without conforming to the regulations that\n\ngovern re-opening of an immigration case. The record establishes\n\nthat the case was \"administratively closed\" in October 2005, and\n\n\"re-calendared\" in November 2006.            \"Administrative closure is a\n\nprocedural convenience that may be granted if both parties to the\n\n\n\n       1\n       In light of Karim's pleading admitting alienage, it is\nunnecessary to consider his claim that reliance upon his passport,\nvisa and other documents seized during the search of his apartment\nviolated his Fourth Amendment and due process rights. See Kandamar\nv. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2006) (holding that any\nerror that occurred from allegedly unconstitutional seizure would\nbe harmless in light of untainted evidence of petitioner's\nremovability).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fremoval proceedings agree, but it does not constitute a final\n\norder. . . Rather, administrative closure of a case temporarily\n\nremoves a case from an immigration judge's calendar or from the\n\nBoard's docket.\" Lopez-Reyes v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 20, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2007)(emphasis added).      The BIA properly found that the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security \"was not required to meet the\n\nrequirements   of   a   motion   to    reopen.\"   And   because   the\n\nadministrative closure did not constitute a final order, Karim's\n\nres judicata and double jeopardy claims lack merit.\n\n          The BIA properly ruled that the IJ did not err in\n\ndetermining that Karim's applications for relief from removal\n\nwere abandoned after he failed to meet the extended deadline for\n\nfiling them.   The only explanation Karim gave for his failure to\n\nconform with the deadline was his claim of U.S. citizenship.      He\n\nrequested a continuance to obtain documents to present to the\n\ncourt.   But he did not specify that the documents related to\n\napplications for relief from removal. In the absence of a showing\n\nby Karim of good cause, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in\n\nfailing to grant another continuance. See Alsamhouri v. Gonzales,\n\n484 F.3d 117, 122 (1st Cir. 2007).        As the BIA properly found,\n\nKarim has never explained what evidence he would have presented\n\nin support of his applications for relief.        Therefore, he has\n\nfailed to show prejudice from the IJ's determination that the\n\napplications were abandoned.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            Karim's   remaining      claims   relating      to    evidentiary\n\nrulings during his immigration proceedings are without merit.\n\n\"The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in [immigration]\n\nproceedings, but the less rigid constraints of due process impose\n\nouter   limits   based      upon     considerations    of    fairness       and\n\nreliability.\" Yongo v. INS, 355 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nKarim has not explained how being provided in advance with copies\n\nof documents submitted into evidence by the government would have\n\nmade a difference in the outcome of his case.                \"It is beyond\n\nperadventure that before a petitioner in an immigration case may\n\nadvance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some\n\ncognizable   prejudice      fairly    attributable    to    the    challenged\n\nprocess.\" Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).                As\n\ndiscussed    above,   the   IJ     appropriately   relied        upon   Karim's\n\nconcession to the facts alleged in the NTA in determining that he\n\nwas removable as charged.        To the extent that the IJ relied upon\n\nKarim's conviction for marriage fraud, it was only in denying his\n\nrequest for voluntary departure. \"[B]y statute, this court lacks\n\nauthority to review a refusal to allow voluntary departure.\"\n\nKarim v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 109, 112 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Finally, the record supports the BIA's finding that\n\nthere was \"no evidence of improper conduct on the part of counsel\n\n[for the government]\" in Karim's immigration proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          The decision of the BIA dismissing Karim's appeal is\n\naffirmed and the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f",
