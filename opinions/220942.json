Albert Kuperman, a former\n\ninmate at the New Hampshire State Prison, challenges a district\n\ncourt order granting summary judgment to the defendant prison\n\nofficials.      The New Hampshire State Prison system requires all\n\ninmates to be clean-shaven, unless they obtain a waiver based on a\n\nmedical condition or on their religious beliefs.1                 An inmate who\n\nobtains   a    shaving   waiver   based    on   his   religious    beliefs   may\n\n“maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard.”\n\n              While incarcerated in state prison, Kuperman, an Orthodox\n\nJew, filed a pro se complaint claiming that he should not have been\n\nrequired to shave at all, because doing so unduly impinged on his\n\nsincerely-held religious beliefs.          More specifically, he asserted\n\na claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the prison shaving\n\nregulation (sometimes referred to as “PPD 7.17”) violated his\n\nrights under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause and the\n\n\n     1\n          The section of the New Hampshire Department of\nCorrections Policy and Procedure Directive 7.17 which addresses\nreligious waivers, section IV.D., states as follows:\n     Shaving Waivers: Inmates declaring membership in\n     recognized faith groups, and demonstrating a sincerely\n     held religious belief in which the growing of facial hair\n     is of religious significance may request a shaving\n     waiver. If approved, the shaving waiver allows an inmate\n     to maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard.           No\n     sculpting, shaping or selective shaving is allowed; all\n     facial hair must be trimmed equally. If an inmate with\n     a shaving waiver is found to have shaped his beard, he\n     must shave clean and start again. Abuse of the shaving\n     waiver guidelines may result in revocation of the shaving\n     waiver.    Violations of the shaving waiver will be\n     reported to the appropriate Unit Manager who will\n     determine what action will be taken.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.                    He also argued\n\nthat it violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\n\nPersons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc-1 et seq.2                 The complaint\n\nsought   injunctive     relief,     monetary       damages,    and    declaratory\n\njudgment.\n\n            The defendants are William Wrenn, Commissioner of the New\n\nHampshire Department of Corrections, and Richard Gerry, Warden of\n\nthe New Hampshire State Prison (collectively referred to as “Prison\n\nOfficials”).        Kuperman    sued   them   in    both   their     official      and\n\npersonal     capacities.        During   preliminary        screening       of     the\n\ncomplaint,    the    district    court   identified        which     claims      could\n\nproceed.3     As part of that screening, it dismissed Kuperman’s\n\nofficial    capacity    claims     except     to    the    extent    they     sought\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Kuperman originally asserted some additional claims, but\nthey will not be discussed because they were dismissed or withdrawn\nbefore this appeal was filed.\n     3\n          Preliminary screening was required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915A,\nwhich provides in relevant part as follows:\n     (a) Screening.—The court shall review, before docketing,\n     if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable\n     after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which\n     a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or\n     officer or employee of a governmental entity.\n     (b) Grounds for Dismissal.—On review, the court shall\n     identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or\n     any portion of the complaint, if the complaint—\n          (1) is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a\n     claim upon which relief may be granted; or\n          (2) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is\n     immune from such relief.\n\n                                       -3-\n\finjunctive relief.   Kuperman does not challenge that dismissal on\n\nappeal.\n\n          Prison Officials filed a motion seeking summary judgment\n\non all remaining claims.   Kuperman, who by this stage had obtained\n\ncounsel, opposed the motion, but submitted no new affidavits or\n\nother admissible evidence to rebut Prison Officials’ arguments.4\n\nUltimately, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nPrison Officials on all claims.    Kuperman filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n          Because our review of the record reveals no dispute of\n\nmaterial fact and shows that Prison Officials are entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          Kuperman’s summary judgment opposition included a single-\npage document which appears to be minutes of an Inmate\nCommunications Committee meeting held on June 16, 2010. Kuperman\nfailed to make any showing as to grounds under which the document\ncould be admitted as evidence. See Gorski v. N.H. Dep’t of Corr.,\n290 F.3d 466, 475-76 (1st Cir. 2002).       Even overlooking that\nproblem, however, the content of the document (including its\nreference to a discussion about a “proposal on the elimination of\nthe current shaving policy” and a comment allegedly made by a\nprison Health Services representative that “things would be a lot\neasier . . . if this policy were to be discontinued”) is\ninsufficient to create a dispute of material fact, when viewed in\nthe context of the overall record.      An affidavit submitted by\nPrison Officials explained that they were considering whether to\nchange the shaving policy to permit all inmates to maintain a 1/4-\ninch neatly trimmed beard, without having to obtain a shaving\nwaiver.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                           MOTION TO DISMISS\n\n          Because Kuperman completed his sentence and was released\n\nfrom state custody while his appeal was pending, Prison Officials\n\nmoved to dismiss his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nas moot. Kuperman agrees that his claims for injunctive relief are\n\nmoot.   But he insists that his claims for declaratory relief and\n\nmonetary damages survive.      We can decide only ongoing cases and\n\ncontroversies, of course.      See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1;\n\nPreiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975).           So if an event\n\noccurs that makes it impossible for us to provide some form of\n\nmeaningful   relief,   there   is,   generally   speaking,   no   case    or\n\ncontroversy, and we must dismiss the appeal as moot.          See, e.g.,\n\nChurch of Scientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992).           Our\n\nfirst task, then, is to see whether Kuperman’s release from prison\n\neliminates any possibility of further judicial relief, which would\n\nrender his claims moot.\n\n                       Official Capacity Claims\n\n          During preliminary screening of Kuperman’s complaint, the\n\ndistrict court jettisoned his official capacity claims except to\n\nthe extent they sought injunctive relief — a ruling Kuperman does\n\nnot contest here.      Kuperman concedes that his release moots his\n\ninjunctive relief requests.      See, e.g., Rendelman v. Rouse, 569\n\nF.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir. 2009).       That leaves us with this:     § 1983\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fand RLUIPA claims against Prison Officials in their personal\n\ncapacities seeking monetary and declaratory relief.\n\n                          Personal Capacity Claims\n\n           A claim is moot only if no relief is available.                   See\n\nChurch of Scientology, 506 U.S. at 12.           Prison Officials appear to\n\nconcede that Kuperman’s claims for monetary relief survive, given\n\nthat their motion to dismiss mentions Kuperman’s request for\n\nmonetary   relief   but    asks   us   to    dismiss   only   his   claims   for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.            Indeed, as a former prisoner\n\nalleging   a   constitutional     violation     that   occurred     during   his\n\nincarceration, Kuperman may obtain nominal and punitive damages\n\nunder § 1983.5   See, e.g., Royal v. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 723 (8th\n\nCir. 2004); Thompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d 411, 416 (2d Cir. 2002);\n\nSearles v. Van Bebber, 251 F.3d 869, 879, 881 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\nBecause some relief is available on Kuperman’s claims, they are not\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          Although neither party discussed the Prison Litigation\nReform Act, we note that it could preclude Kuperman from recovering\non his § 1983 claim seeking compensatory damages. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1997e(e). Section 1997e(e) provides that “[n]o Federal civil\naction may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury\nsuffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical\ninjury.” Although some courts have interpreted section 1997e(e)’s\nlimitation not to apply to constitutional claims, see generally\nThompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d 411, 416-17 (2d Cir. 2002) (collecting\ncases), we need not reach the issue. It does not matter whether\ncompensatory damages are available to Kuperman, because his\nrequests for nominal and punitive damages are enough to keep his\nclaims alive.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fmoot.6   See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 n.8 (1969);\n\nChico Serv. Station, Inc. v. Sol Puerto Rico Ltd., 633 F.3d 20, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 2011) (citing Church of Scientology, 506 U.S. at 13).\n\n          For the same reason, Prison Officials’ argument that\n\nKuperman is no longer entitled to declaratory relief is beside the\n\npoint.   Our question is whether Kuperman can obtain some relief,\n\nand he can.   Therefore, his claims are not moot.\n\n          We grant Prison Officials’ motion to dismiss Kuperman's\n\nclaims seeking injunctive relief, and analyze his remaining claims\n\non the merits.\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          We review orders granting summary judgment de novo,\n\nresolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party.    Spratt v. R.I. Dep’t\n\nof Corr., 482 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Iverson v. City\n\nof Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006)).   Summary judgment is\n\nproper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\n\nundisputed facts show that the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.   Id.\n\n\n\n     6\n           As discussed in more detail infra, we reserve ruling on\nthe issue of whether personal-capacity claims are available under\nRLUIPA. See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1,\n8-9 (1978) (expressing no opinion on the validity of respondents’\nclaim for actual and punitive damages, but noting that the request\nsaved the claim from mootness because it “is not so insubstantial\nor so clearly foreclosed by prior decisions that this case may not\nproceed”).\n\n                                -7-\n\f                                 MERITS\n\n            As the moving parties, Prison Officials had the initial\n\nburden of informing the judge of the basis for their motion and\n\nidentifying the portions of the record that demonstrate the absence\n\nof any genuine issue of material fact.       See Rivera-Colón v. Mills,\n\n635 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n\n477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986)).      If they did that, then Kuperman had\n\nto show, “through submissions of evidentiary quality, that a\n\ntrialworthy issue persists.”      Iverson, 452 F.3d at 98.      On issues\n\nfor which Kuperman would bear the burden of proof at trial, he had\n\nto   introduce   definite,   competent    evidence   to   survive   summary\n\njudgment.     See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n                             First Amendment7\n\n            Section 1983 provides a cause of action against those\n\nwho, acting under color of state law, violate federal law.               42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983; see also Rodríguez-Cirilo v. García, 115 F.3d 50, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).    Kuperman’s § 1983 claim is based in part on his\n\ncontention that the prison shaving regulation prevented him from\n\n\n\n\n      7\n          Kuperman’s First Amendment claim proceeded against both\nPrison Officials, Wrenn and Gerry. Because our analysis does not\nrequire us to differentiate each defendant’s role, we continue to\nrefer to them collectively.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fpracticing his religion, in violation of the First Amendment’s Free\n\nExercise Clause.8\n\n             A prison regulation which restricts an inmate’s First\n\nAmendment rights is permissible if it is “reasonably related to\n\nlegitimate penological interests.”        Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78,\n\n89 (1987).      The factors relevant in deciding the regulation’s\n\nconstitutionality are: (1) whether there is a valid, rational\n\nconnection between the regulation and the legitimate government\n\ninterest put forward to justify it; (2) whether alternative means\n\nto exercise the right exist; (3) the impact that accommodating the\n\nright will have on prison resources; and (4) the absence of\n\nalternatives to the prison regulation.          Id. at 89-90.    We will\n\nrefer to these as the “Turner factors.”         Of course, courts “must\n\naccord substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison\n\nadministrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining\n\nthe legitimate goals of a corrections system and for determining\n\nthe   most   appropriate   means   to   accomplish   them.”   Overton   v.\n\nBazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003); see also Brown v. Plata, 131 S.\n\nCt. 1910, 1928 (2011).      When contesting the reasonableness of a\n\nprison’s regulation, the inmate bears the burden of persuasion.\n\nSee Overton, 539 U.S. at 132.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n          “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment\nof religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .”\nU.S. Const. amend. I.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          Applying the first Turner factor, we consider whether the\n\nbeard-length restriction is reasonably related to the penological\n\ninterests asserted by Prison Officials to justify it.   See Turner,\n\n482 U.S. at 89-90.   Prison Officials submitted an affidavit from\n\nCharles Boyajian, Unit Manager of the Special Housing Unit and the\n\nClose Custody Unit of the New Hampshire State Prison for Men,\n\nstating that the shaving regulation promotes safety and security\n\ninterests and good hygiene.9    Prison Officials insist that the\n\nbeard-length restriction is reasonably related to prison security\n\nbecause it (1) helps guards identify inmates inside the prison to\n\nensure they do not enter prohibited areas, (2) makes it harder for\n\ninmates to hide weapons or contraband, and (3) prevents an inmate\n\nfrom quickly changing his appearance if he escapes.\n\n          Kuperman’s evidence does not refute these contentions.\n\nOn appeal, he contends otherwise, pointing to a letter from Rabbi\n\nWiener of the Jewish Council of Greater Coney Island, and an\n\naffidavit from another inmate, Wayne Sargent.       Rabbi Wiener’s\n\nletter, which was attached to the complaint and not sworn to under\n\noath, establishes that wearing a full, untrimmed beard is important\n\nin Jewish law.   Yet it says nothing which casts doubt on Prison\n\n\n     9\n          There is very little evidence in the record supporting\nPrison Officials’ contention that the shaving regulation promotes\ninmate hygiene. But we need not reach this question because we\nconclude infra that the regulation is reasonably related to the\nlegitimate penological interest of prison security.      Although\nPrison Officials refer to the interest asserted as “safety and\nsecurity,” we prefer the more concise term “prison security.”\n\n                               -10-\n\fOfficials’ contention that the shaving regulation promotes prison\n\nsecurity.10     The other document Kuperman relied on, the Sargent\n\naffidavit, indicates that some inmates were allowed to grow beards\n\nlonger than 1/4-inch in length, but contains nothing which could be\n\nused    to   rebut   Prison   Officials’    assertion   that    the   shaving\n\nregulation promotes important penological interests.\n\n             Finishing up the first Turner factor, we briefly dispatch\n\na couple of Kuperman’s non-starters.        He argues that even if he had\n\nbeen allowed to grow a longer beard, he personally would not have\n\nposed a security risk.        But courts do not require an actual breach\n\nof security before upholding a regulation designed to prevent it.\n\nSee, e.g., Turner, 482 U.S. at 89; O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482\n\nU.S. 342, 349 (1987).         And his contention that Prison Officials\n\nfailed to meet their burden because they did not produce studies or\n\nindependent     expert    testimony    showing   that    this    particular\n\nregulation promotes prison security overstates their burden.              See\n\nBeard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 531-32 (2006) (statements of prison\n\nofficial to the effect that the regulation serves the function\n\nidentified were sufficient when the articulated connections between\n\nthe regulation and the penological objective are “logical ones”).\n\nBased on Prison Officials’ explanation of the rationale for the\n\n\n\n       10\n          As was true of the document attached to Kuperman’s\nsummary judgment opposition, Kuperman failed to make any showing as\nto grounds under which the letter could be admitted as evidence.\nSee Gorski, 290 F.3d at 475-76.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fshaving regulation, we conclude that they met their burden of\n\ndemonstrating that it is reasonably related to the legitimate\n\npenological interest of maintaining prison security.\n\n           Proceeding to the second Turner factor, we look at\n\nwhether    alternative       means    for      exercising     the      inmate’s\n\nconstitutionally-protected right remain open to him.                Turner, 482\n\nU.S. at 90.     Kuperman contends that because shaving is an act of\n\nsacrilege to a member of the Orthodox Jewish faith, there were no\n\nalternative means available to him.          His argument misses the mark.\n\nOur   inquiry    is    not   into    whether    a      religiously-acceptable\n\nalternative to growing a full beard existed. Instead, we consider\n\nwhether alternative means remained open for Kuperman to exercise\n\nthe constitutionally-protected right at issue — here, free exercise\n\nof his religion.      See O’Lone, 482 U.S. at 351-52 (inmates were not\n\ndeprived of “all forms of religious exercise”); Turner, 482 U.S. at\n\n92 (correspondence regulation did not deprive prisoners of “all\n\nmeans of expression”); Freeman v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice,\n\n369 F.3d 854, 861 (5th Cir. 2004) (“The pertinent question is not\n\nwhether   the    inmates     have    been    denied      specific     religious\n\naccommodations, but whether, more broadly, the prison affords the\n\ninmates   opportunities      to   exercise     their    faith.”);     Green   v.\n\nPolunsky, 229 F.3d 486, 489 n.15 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing O’Lone,\n\n482 U.S. at 352) (“[W]e look to whether inmates are allowed other\n\nmeans to express their religious beliefs (on a general level) not\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fwhether   they   were   allowed    a    means   to    express   their       specific\n\nreligious belief in the necessity of wearing a beard.”).\n\n            Although the record is sparse on this point, PPD 7.17\n\nitself states that “[a]ll inmates shall have access to religious\n\nresources, services, instruction or counseling on a voluntary\n\nbasis. . . . The institutions will provide all inmates with the\n\nopportunity to pursue any recognized belief or practice, subject to\n\nthe restrictions of their custody level” and “[t]he institution\n\nshall extend to all inmates the greatest amount of freedom and\n\nopportunity to pursue any recognized religious belief or practice.”\n\nIt includes specific procedures by which inmates could have access\n\nto religious publications, religious diets, religious apparel, and\n\npersonal and group religious items.                  Kuperman has introduced\n\nnothing indicating that, other than the shaving regulation, the\n\nprison interfered with the free exercise of his religious beliefs.\n\nAccordingly, we find the record sufficient to demonstrate that\n\nKuperman had available to him alternative means to exercise his\n\nright to free expression of his religion.\n\n            We move on to the third Turner factor — the impact on\n\nguards, other inmates, and the allocation of prison resources\n\ngenerally   if   the    asserted       constitutional     right      were    to   be\n\naccommodated.     See Turner, 482 U.S. at 90.             In other words, we\n\nconsider how allowing some inmates to grow full beards would affect\n\nthe   prison.     The   Boyajian       affidavit     touches    on   this    issue,\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fexplaining that because longer beards create opportunities for\n\ninmates to transport contraband or weapons, staff would be required\n\nto conduct more frequent searches of inmates, which would increase\n\nconflicts between staff and inmates and place staff at greater risk\n\nof assault.   It also states that a more liberal grooming policy\n\nwould make identifying prisoners more expensive and burdensome\n\nbecause it is “impractical and a strain on prison resources to\n\nissue multiple identification cards for every inmate for every\n\npossible length or shape of beard.”\n\n           Kuperman’s response is that permitting full beards would\n\nhave only a nominal effect on prison resources.    The only document\n\nhe references in support of this contention is a magistrate judge’s\n\nreport and recommendation from a completely different case brought\n\nby Kuperman concerning suspension of his kosher diet while in\n\nprison.    Kuperman claims that because only a small number of\n\ninmates requested kosher meals, only a small number of prisoners\n\nwould choose to grow full beards.      The report and recommendation\n\nactually says nothing about how many other prisoners sought kosher\n\nmeals.    We need not credit conclusory statements made without\n\nsupport in the record.   See Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist., 584 F.3d\n\n314, 325 (1st Cir. 2009).      Kuperman also fails to address the\n\nadditional burden which non-uniform rules place on prison staff.\n\nBased on the record before us, the third Turner factor weighs in\n\nfavor of Prison Officials, who have shown that accommodating\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fKuperman’s   desire   to   grow   a   full   beard   would   have   adversely\n\nimpacted prison resources.\n\n          This brings us to the final Turner factor, whether there\n\nwere “ready alternatives” to the challenged regulation.                  See\n\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90.      “[T]he absence of ready alternatives is\n\nevidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.”                   Id.\n\nKuperman suggests that instead of requiring inmates to shave,\n\nPrison Officials could have required inmates with full beards to\n\nsearch their own beards in the presence of correctional officers,\n\nor staff could have used combs during beard searches.                He also\n\nproposed that prisons use technology to digitally alter photographs\n\nof an escaped inmate to show him without a beard.\n\n          The Boyajian affidavit demonstrates that Prison Officials\n\nconsidered and rejected alternatives to PPD 7.17.              It says that\n\n“[c]onducting ‘beard searches’ or issuing multiple identification\n\ncards showing an inmate with or without a beard are not reasonable\n\nor feasible alternatives to the shaving policy” because they would\n\nunduly strain prison resources and relations between staff and\n\ninmates, and because multiple identification cards would make it\n\ndifficult to identify inmates quickly.         Although the statements in\n\nthe record are bare-boned, Prison Officials are not required to\n\n“set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of\n\naccommodating   the   claimant’s      constitutional    complaint.”      See\n\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90-91.            Rather, we look to “whether the\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fprisoner has pointed to some obvious regulatory alternative that\n\nfully accommodates the asserted right while not imposing more than\n\na de minimis cost to the valid penological goal.”     Overton, 539\n\nU.S. at 136.   Kuperman has not done so, and so we find there were\n\nno ready alternatives to the regulation at issue here.\n\n          Having found that all four of the Turner factors weigh in\n\nfavor of Prison Officials, we hold that Prison Officials are\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Kuperman’s First Amendment claim.\n\nOther courts considering prison grooming regulations have reached\n\nsimilar conclusions.   See, e.g., Fegans v. Norris, 537 F.3d 897,\n\n906-07 (8th Cir. 2008) (regulation prohibiting beards did not\n\nviolate First Amendment); McRae v. Johnson, 261 F. App’x 554, 558\n\n(4th Cir. 2008) (unpublished decision) (same); Pollock v. Marshall,\n\n845 F.2d 656, 659-60 (6th Cir. 1988) (regulation restricting\n\ninmates’ hair length did not violate First Amendment); Oakes v.\n\nGreen, Civil Action No. 08-CV-12-HRW, 2008 WL 559683, at *4 (E.D.\n\nKy. Feb. 27, 2008) (unpublished decision) (regulation prohibiting\n\nbeards did not violate First Amendment); Daker v. Wetherington, 469\n\nF. Supp. 2d 1231, 1237, 1239 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (same).11\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          We cite unpublished decisions with the recognition that\nthey are persuasive authority but are not binding within their\nrespective jurisdictions. See Fed. R. App. P. 32.1(a).\n\n                               -16-\n\f                             Fourteenth Amendment12\n\n             In Kuperman’s second § 1983 claim, he argues that forcing\n\nhim to limit the length of his beard violated the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause.13                  Essentially, he contends\n\nthat Gerry allowed inmates in more secure units to grow longer\n\nbeards while restricting inmates in the general population to 1/4-\n\ninch beards, and that this unequal treatment was not rationally\n\nrelated to a legitimate penological interest.                 As did his earlier\n\ncontentions, this one falls short given the record before us.\n\n             Equal protection means that “similarly situated persons\n\nare    to   receive       substantially       similar     treatment     from    their\n\ngovernment.”        Tapalian v. Tusino, 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing Barrington Cove Ltd. P’ship v. R.I. Hous. & Mortg. Fin.\n\nCorp., 246 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001)).                    To establish an equal\n\nprotection     violation,       a    plaintiff     must    introduce     sufficient\n\nevidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that, compared\n\nwith     others     similarly       situated,     the    plaintiff     was     treated\n\ndifferently because of an improper consideration, such as his\n\nreligion.      See id.      Equal protection does not, however, require\n\nprison      staff    to    treat     all     inmate     groups   the    same     when\n\n\n\n       12\n          Kuperman’s Fourteenth Amendment claim proceeded against\nonly Warden Gerry.\n       13\n          The Fourteenth Amendment provides that states shall not\n“deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.” U.S.\nConst. art. XIV, § 1.\n\n                                           -17-\n\fdifferentiation is necessary to avoid a threat to prison security.\n\nSee, e.g., Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S.\n\n119, 136 (1977).\n\n          The Boyajian affidavit and an affidavit submitted by\n\nLieutenant Paul Cascio, Lieutenant of Security for the Secure\n\nPsychiatric Unit and the Residential Treatment Unit of the New\n\nHampshire State Prison, show that the shaving policy applied to all\n\ninmates, regardless of where in the prison they resided. Prisoners\n\nin the general population who did not have shaving waivers were\n\nrequired to be clean-shaven on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n\nInmates in some high-security units — who were not permitted to\n\nhave razors — were shaved by barbers once each week or shaved using\n\nclippers once every two weeks under staff supervision.    Although\n\nthe shaving policy was implemented differently in different areas\n\nof the prison, Gerry articulated a rational basis for allowing\n\ninmates in high-security units to go a week or two between shaves\n\n— the dangers arising from letting them personally possess razors\n\nand the lack of resources necessary to shave them more frequently.\n\n          Kuperman contends on appeal that the Sargent affidavit\n\ncreated a dispute of material fact on his equal protection claim.\n\nThe affidavit states that while Sargent was an inmate in the New\n\nHampshire State Prison, he was at one point permitted to grow his\n\nbeard to three inches long; that at another time in another unit he\n\nwas permitted to grow his beard to about two inches long; that in\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fanother prison he “often” had his beard up to one inch long; that\n\nhe saw one inmate living in the general population with a beard\n\nlonger than three inches; and that he saw other inmates in a high-\n\nsecurity unit with full beards which appeared to be longer than\n\nthree inches.     Construing the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Kuperman, as we must at this stage, the Sargent affidavit\n\nsuggests Gerry selectively enforced the shaving regulation.\n\n            To affect the summary judgment motion on his equal\n\nprotection    claim,    however,     Kuperman    needed       to     fortify     his\n\nselective-enforcement       claim   with    evidence       showing    that     Gerry\n\nenforced    the   shaving   regulation      against    him    because     of    his\n\nreligion.    See Tapalian, 377 F.3d at 5.            The record before us is\n\ndevoid of any such evidence. Because Kuperman failed to show that,\n\nbased on his religion, he was treated differently from other\n\nsimilarly    situated   inmates     with    regard    to    shaving,    Gerry     is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Kuperman’s equal protection claim.14\n\n                               RLUIPA Claim\n\n            As a preliminary matter, we note that some other circuits\n\nhave held that personal-capacity claims are unavailable under\n\n\n     14\n          Kuperman also contends on appeal that the prison’s\nprocedures for implementing its shaving policy are deficient.\nAlthough these contentions sound like an attempt to mount a\nprocedural due process challenge to the shaving regulation,\nKuperman failed to raise such a claim in his complaint or anywhere\nin the record before the district court. We will not consider it\nfor the first time on appeal. See Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration &\nCustoms Enforcement Div. of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d 1, 12\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                     -19-\n\fRLUIPA.   See, e.g, Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 889 (7th Cir.\n\n2009); Rendelman, 569 F.3d at 184; Sossamon v. Texas (Sossamon I),\n\n560 F.3d 316, 329 (5th Cir. 2009), aff'd on other grounds, Sossamon\n\nv. Texas (Sossamon II), 131 S. Ct. 1651, 1663 (2011); Smith v.\n\nAllen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1275 & n.11 (11th Cir. 2007).    They reason\n\nthat because Congress passed RLUIPA under the Spending Clause,\n\ncourts should not interpret it to impose liability on individuals\n\nwho do not themselves receive federal funds.15     See Nelson, 570\n\nF.3d at 886-88; Smith, 502 F.3d at 1273-75; see also U.S. Const.\n\nart. I, § 8, cl. 1.   We explain briefly.\n\n          The Spending Clause permits Congress to attach conditions\n\ndesigned to promote its policy objectives on the receipt of federal\n\nfunds.    See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).\n\nSpending Clause legislation has been described as creating a\n\n“contract” between the federal government and the recipient of\n\nfederal funds.    See, e.g., Sossamon II, 131 S. Ct. at 1661\n\n(acknowledging the contract-law analogy).\n\n     [C]ourts have consistently recognized the limited reach\n     of Congress’ Spending Power legislation, concluding that\n     statutes passed under the Spending Clause may, as a\n     condition of funding, subject the grant recipient to\n     liability in a private cause of action, but that the\n     Spending Power cannot be used to subject individual\n     defendants, such as state employees, to individual\n     liability in a private cause of action.\n\n\n\n     15\n          We note that RLUIPA was also enacted pursuant to\nCongress’s Commerce Clause authority. Sossamon II, 131 S. Ct. at\n1656; see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2).\n\n                               -20-\n\fSmith, 502 F.3d at 1274 (citing Title IX cases).    These courts have\n\nconcluded that because RLUIPA liability arises from receipt of\n\nfederal funds, only the grant recipient — the state — may be held\n\nliable for a violation of RLUIPA.   See Sossamon I, 560 F.3d at 328\n\n(citing Smith, 502 F.3d at 1272-73); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n\n1(b).\n\n           Prison Officials have not challenged the viability of\n\nKuperman’s personal-capacity claim, and we need not reach the\n\nissue.    As we explain in the next section, even assuming such a\n\nclaim to be available, Kuperman is not entitled to relief under\n\nRLUIPA.   We therefore reserve ruling on whether personal-capacity\n\nclaims are available under RLUIPA, as have our sister courts in the\n\nSecond and Ninth Circuits.   See Hall v. Ekpe, No. 09-4492-pr, 2011\n\nWL 2600514, at *1 (2d Cir. 2011); Florer v. Congregation Pidyon\n\nShevuyim, N.A., 639 F.3d 916, 922 n.3 (9th Cir. 2011).\n\n           RLUIPA provides greater protection to inmates’ free-\n\nexercise rights than does the First Amendment.     See, e.g., Spratt,\n\n482 F.3d at 42 n.12.   It bars prisons receiving federal funds from\n\nsubstantially burdening an inmate’s religious exercise unless the\n\nregulation under attack is the least restrictive way to advance a\n\ncompelling state interest.     See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544\n\nU.S. 709, 715-16 (2005).     Prison Officials conceded, for summary\n\njudgment purposes only, that the shaving regulation substantially\n\nburdened Kuperman’s religious exercise.     So the battle is over\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fwhether     they   showed    that   PPD     7.17   furthers    a    compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and whether it was the least restrictive\n\nmeans of doing so.\n\n            In our discussion of Kuperman’s § 1983 claims, we noted\n\nthat Prison Officials submitted evidence showing that the shaving\n\nregulation promotes prison security in several specific ways.\n\nBecause prison security is undoubtedly a compelling state interest,\n\nwe conclude that they have met their burden of demonstrating that\n\nPPD 7.l7 furthers a compelling governmental interest.               See, e.g.,\n\nSpratt, 482 F.3d at 39 (citing Cutter, 544 U.S. at 725 n.13);\n\nFegans, 537 F.3d at 906.\n\n            But to survive challenge under RLUIPA, Prison Officials\n\nmust   also    show   that   the    shaving   regulation      was   the   least\n\nrestrictive means available to further that interest.               See Spratt,\n\n482 F.3d at 40-41.     They rely on the Boyajian affidavit to satisfy\n\nthat requirement.      Because most of its key passages have already\n\nbeen quoted in our First Amendment analysis, we refrain from\n\nquoting them again here.      Boyajian specifically addressed concerns\n\nabout longer beards being used to conceal weapons and contraband\n\nand about additional time and risk to staff if beard searches were\n\nrequired.     He explained that issuing multiple identification cards\n\nwould be too complicated given all of the different possible types\n\nof beards and the need for staff to be able to quickly identify\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\finmates.     And he mentioned the risk that escaped inmates with\n\nlonger beards could more quickly change their appearance.\n\n            We further note that the shaving regulation allowed\n\ninmates whose religious beliefs value growing facial hair to\n\nmaintain 1/4-inch beards, which is less restrictive than enacting\n\na regulation prohibiting beards altogether, as some other prisons\n\nhave done.    Compare PPD 7.17 with Gooden v. Crain, 353 F. App’x\n\n885, 886-87, 890 (5th Cir. 2009)(unpublished decision)(upholding\n\nregulation prohibiting beards unless inmate obtains a medical\n\nexception) and Fegans, 537 F.3d at 901, 907 (same).\n\n            Kuperman contends that the shaving regulation was not the\n\nleast restrictive means available to Prison Officials, but he\n\nsubmitted    no   admissible   evidence   to   counterbalance   Prison\n\nOfficials’ affidavits.    Because the unrebutted Prison Officials’\n\naffidavits show that they considered and rejected alternatives to\n\nthe shaving regulation, we find that it meets RLUIPA’s least\n\nrestrictive means test.\n\n            Accordingly, assuming for argument’s sake that Kuperman\n\ncan assert a personal-capacity claim under RLUIPA, Prison Officials\n\nare entitled to summary judgment on his RLUIPA claim.     Once again,\n\nour conclusion is consistent with that reached by other courts\n\nconsidering even more restrictive regulations.     See Gooden, 353 F.\n\nApp’x at 886-87, 890 (regulation prohibiting beards did not violate\n\nRLUIPA); Fegans, 537 F.3d at 901, 907 (same); McRae, 261 F. App’x\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fat 558 (same); Oakes, 2008 WL 559683, at *4 (same); Daker, 469 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 1237 (same).   But see Mayweathers v. Terhune, 328 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1086, 1096 (E.D. Cal. 2004) (regulation prohibiting beards\n\nviolated RLUIPA); Gartrell v. Ashcroft, 191 F. Supp. 2d 23, 36\n\n(D.D.C. 2002) (regulation prohibiting beards violated the Religious\n\nFreedom Restoration Act, the predecessor to RLUIPA).\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons recited above, we grant Prison Officials’\n\nmotion to dismiss Kuperman’s claims seeking injunctive relief.   We\n\naffirm the judgment below granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nPrison Officials on Kuperman’s remaining claims.       No costs to\n\neither party.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

Tierney, and the Law Office of Nancy S. Tierney, on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Laura E.B. Lombardi, Assistant Attorney General, and Michael A. Delaney, Attorney General, on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Albert Kuperman, a former inmate at the New Hampshire State Prison, challenges a district court order granting summary judgment to the defendant prison officials. The New Hampshire State Prison system requires all inmates to be clean-shaven, unless they obtain a waiver based on a medical condition or on their religious beliefs.<sup>[1]</sup> An inmate who obtains a shaving waiver based on his religious beliefs may \"maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard.\"</p>\n<p>While incarcerated in state prison, Kuperman, an Orthodox Jew, filed a <i>pro se</i> complaint claiming that he should not have been required to shave at all, because doing so unduly impinged on his sincerely-held religious beliefs. More specifically, he asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the prison shaving regulation (sometimes referred to as \"PPD 7.17\") violated his rights under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. He also argued that it violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1 <i>et seq.</i><sup>[2]</sup> The complaint sought injunctive relief, monetary damages, and declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p>The defendants are William Wrenn, Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, and Richard Gerry, Warden of the New Hampshire State Prison (collectively referred to as \"Prison Officials\"). Kuperman sued them in both their official and personal capacities. During <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> preliminary screening of the complaint, the district court identified which claims could proceed.<sup>[3]</sup> As part of that screening, it dismissed Kuperman's official capacity claims except to the extent they sought injunctive relief. Kuperman does not challenge that dismissal on appeal.</p>\n<p>Prison Officials filed a motion seeking summary judgment on all remaining claims. Kuperman, who by this stage had obtained counsel, opposed the motion, but submitted no new affidavits or other admissible evidence to rebut Prison Officials' arguments.<sup>[4]</sup> Ultimately, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Prison Officials on all claims. Kuperman filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p>Because our review of the record reveals no dispute of material fact and shows that Prison Officials are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>MOTION TO DISMISS</h2>\n<p>Because Kuperman completed his sentence and was released from state custody while his appeal was pending, Prison Officials moved to dismiss his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief as moot. Kuperman agrees that his claims for injunctive relief are moot. But he insists that his claims for declaratory relief and monetary damages survive. We can decide only ongoing cases and controversies, of course. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; <i>Preiser v. Newkirk,</i> 422 U.S. 395, 401, 95 S.Ct. 2330, 45 L.Ed.2d 272 (1975). So if an event occurs that makes it impossible for us to provide some form of meaningful relief, there is, generally speaking, no case or controversy, and we must dismiss the appeal as moot. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Church of Scientology v. United States,</i> 506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992). Our first task, then, is to see whether Kuperman's release from prison eliminates any possibility of further judicial relief, which would render his claims moot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Official Capacity Claims</i></h2>\n<p>During preliminary screening of Kuperman's complaint, the district court jettisoned his official capacity claims except to the extent they sought injunctive reliefa ruling Kuperman does not contest here. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> Kuperman concedes that his release moots his injunctive relief requests. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rendelman v. Rouse,</i> 569 F.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir.2009). That leaves us with this: § 1983 and RLUIPA claims against Prison Officials in their personal capacities seeking monetary and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Personal Capacity Claims</i></h2>\n<p>A claim is moot only if no relief is available. <i>See </i><i>Church of Scientology,</i> 506 U.S. at 12, 113 S.Ct. 447. Prison Officials appear to concede that Kuperman's claims for monetary relief survive, given that their motion to dismiss mentions Kuperman's request for monetary relief but asks us to dismiss only his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. Indeed, as a former prisoner alleging a constitutional violation that occurred during his incarceration, Kuperman may obtain nominal and punitive damages under § 1983.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Royal v. Kautzky,</i> 375 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir.2004); <i>Thompson v. Carter,</i> 284 F.3d 411, 416 (2d Cir.2002); <i>Searles v. Van Bebber,</i> 251 F.3d 869, 879, 881 (10th Cir. 2001). Because some relief is available on Kuperman's claims, they are not moot.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See </i><i>Powell v. McCormack,</i> 395 U.S. 486, 496 n. 8, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969); <i>Chico Serv. Station, Inc. v. Sol Puerto Rico Ltd.,</i> 633 F.3d 20, 36 (1st Cir.2011) (citing <i>Church of Scientology,</i> 506 U.S. at 13, 113 S.Ct. 447).</p>\n<p>For the same reason, Prison Officials' argument that Kuperman is no longer entitled to declaratory relief is beside the point. Our question is whether Kuperman can obtain some relief, and he can. Therefore, his claims are not moot.</p>\n<p>We grant Prison Officials' motion to dismiss Kuperman's claims seeking injunctive relief, and analyze his remaining claims on the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We review orders granting summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> resolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Spratt v. R.I. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 482 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2006)). Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the undisputed facts show that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>MERITS</h2>\n<p>As the moving parties, Prison Officials had the initial burden of informing the judge of the basis for their motion and identifying the portions of the record that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Colón v. Mills,</i> 635 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2011) (citing <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). If they did that, then Kuperman had to show, \"through submissions of evidentiary quality, that a trialworthy issue persists.\" <i>Iverson,</i> 452 F.3d at 98. On issues for which Kuperman would bear the burden of proof at trial, he had to introduce definite, competent evidence to survive summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>First Amendment</i><sup>[7]</sup></h2>\n<p>Section 1983 provides a cause of action against those who, acting under color of state law, violate federal law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983; <i>see also </i><i>Rodríguez-Cirilo v. García,</i> 115 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir.1997). Kuperman's § 1983 claim is based in part on his contention that the prison shaving regulation prevented him from practicing his religion, in violation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>A prison regulation which restricts an inmate's First Amendment rights is permissible if it is \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" <i>Turner v. Safley,</i> 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The factors relevant in deciding the regulation's constitutionality are: (1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the regulation and the legitimate government interest put forward to justify it; (2) whether alternative means to exercise the right exist; (3) the impact that accommodating the right will have on prison resources; and (4) the absence of alternatives to the prison regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. We will refer to these as the \"<i>Turner</i> factors.\" Of course, courts \"must accord substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections system and for determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them.\" <i>Overton v. Bazzetta,</i> 539 U.S. 126, 132, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003); <i>see also </i><i>Brown v. Plata,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1910, 1928, 179 L.Ed.2d 969 (2011). When contesting the reasonableness of a prison's regulation, the inmate bears the burden of persuasion. <i>See </i><i>Overton,</i> 539 U.S. at 132, 123 S.Ct. 2162.</p>\n<p>Applying the first <i>Turner</i> factor, we consider whether the beard-length restriction is reasonably related to the penological interests asserted by Prison Officials to justify it. <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Prison Officials submitted an affidavit from Charles Boyajian, Unit Manager of the Special Housing Unit and the Close Custody Unit of the New Hampshire State Prison for Men, stating that the shaving regulation promotes safety and security interests and good hygiene.<sup>[9]</sup> Prison Officials insist that the beard-length restriction is reasonably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> related to prison security because it (1) helps guards identify inmates inside the prison to ensure they do not enter prohibited areas, (2) makes it harder for inmates to hide weapons or contraband, and (3) prevents an inmate from quickly changing his appearance if he escapes.</p>\n<p>Kuperman's evidence does not refute these contentions. On appeal, he contends otherwise, pointing to a letter from Rabbi Wiener of the Jewish Council of Greater Coney Island, and an affidavit from another inmate, Wayne Sargent. Rabbi Wiener's letter, which was attached to the complaint and not sworn to under oath, establishes that wearing a full, untrimmed beard is important in Jewish law. Yet it says nothing which casts doubt on Prison Officials' contention that the shaving regulation promotes prison security.<sup>[10]</sup> The other document Kuperman relied on, the Sargent affidavit, indicates that some inmates were allowed to grow beards longer than 1/4-inch in length, but contains nothing which could be used to rebut Prison Officials' assertion that the shaving regulation promotes important penological interests.</p>\n<p>Finishing up the first <i>Turner</i> factor, we briefly dispatch a couple of Kuperman's non-starters. He argues that even if he had been allowed to grow a longer beard, he personally would not have posed a security risk. But courts do not require an actual breach of security before upholding a regulation designed to prevent it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254; <i>O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz,</i> 482 U.S. 342, 349, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987). And his contention that Prison Officials failed to meet their burden because they did not produce studies or independent expert testimony showing that this particular regulation promotes prison security overstates their burden. <i>See </i><i>Beard v. Banks,</i> 548 U.S. 521, 531-32, 126 S.Ct. 2572, 165 L.Ed.2d 697 (2006) (statements of prison official to the effect that the regulation serves the function identified were sufficient when the articulated connections between the regulation and the penological objective are \"logical ones\"). Based on Prison Officials' explanation of the rationale for the shaving regulation, we conclude that they met their burden of demonstrating that it is reasonably related to the legitimate penological interest of maintaining prison security.</p>\n<p>Proceeding to the second <i>Turner</i> factor, we look at whether alternative means for exercising the inmate's constitutionally-protected right remain open to him. <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Kuperman contends that because shaving is an act of sacrilege to a member of the Orthodox Jewish faith, there were no alternative means available to him. His argument misses the mark. Our inquiry is not into whether a religiously-acceptable alternative to growing a full beard existed. Instead, we consider whether alternative means remained open for Kuperman to exercise the constitutionally-protected right at issuehere, free exercise of his religion. <i>See </i><i>O'Lone,</i> 482 U.S. at 351-52, 107 S.Ct. 2400 (inmates were not deprived of \"all forms of religious exercise\"); <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 92, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (correspondence regulation did not deprive prisoners of \"all means of expression\"); <i>Freeman v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice,</i> 369 F.3d 854, 861 (5th Cir.2004) (\"The pertinent question is not whether the inmates have been denied specific religious accommodations, but whether, more broadly, the prison affords <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> the inmates opportunities to exercise their faith.\"); <i>Green v. Polunsky,</i> 229 F.3d 486, 489 n. 15 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <i>O'Lone,</i> 482 U.S. at 352, 107 S.Ct. 2400) (\"[W]e look to whether inmates are allowed other means to express their religious beliefs (on a general level) <i>not</i> whether they were allowed a means to express their specific religious belief in the necessity of wearing a beard.\").</p>\n<p>Although the record is sparse on this point, PPD 7.17 itself states that \"[a]ll inmates shall have access to religious resources, services, instruction or counseling on a voluntary basis.... The institutions will provide all inmates with the opportunity to pursue any recognized belief or practice, subject to the restrictions of their custody level\" and \"[t]he institution shall extend to all inmates the greatest amount of freedom and opportunity to pursue any recognized religious belief or practice.\" It includes specific procedures by which inmates could have access to religious publications, religious diets, religious apparel, and personal and group religious items. Kuperman has introduced nothing indicating that, other than the shaving regulation, the prison interfered with the free exercise of his religious beliefs. Accordingly, we find the record sufficient to demonstrate that Kuperman had available to him alternative means to exercise his right to free expression of his religion.</p>\n<p>We move on to the third <i>Turner</i> factorthe impact on guards, other inmates, and the allocation of prison resources generally if the asserted constitutional right were to be accommodated. <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. In other words, we consider how allowing some inmates to grow full beards would affect the prison. The Boyajian affidavit touches on this issue, explaining that because longer beards create opportunities for inmates to transport contraband or weapons, staff would be required to conduct more frequent searches of inmates, which would increase conflicts between staff and inmates and place staff at greater risk of assault. It also states that a more liberal grooming policy would make identifying prisoners more expensive and burdensome because it is \"impractical and a strain on prison resources to issue multiple identification cards for every inmate for every possible length or shape of beard.\"</p>\n<p>Kuperman's response is that permitting full beards would have only a nominal effect on prison resources. The only document he references in support of this contention is a magistrate judge's report and recommendation from a completely different case brought by Kuperman concerning suspension of his kosher diet while in prison. Kuperman claims that because only a small number of inmates requested kosher meals, only a small number of prisoners would choose to grow full beards. The report and recommendation actually says nothing about how many other prisoners sought kosher meals. We need not credit conclusory statements made without support in the record. <i>See </i><i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist.,</i> 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir.2009). Kuperman also fails to address the additional burden which non-uniform rules place on prison staff. Based on the record before us, the third <i>Turner</i> factor weighs in favor of Prison Officials, who have shown that accommodating Kuperman's desire to grow a full beard would have adversely impacted prison resources.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the final <i>Turner</i> factor, whether there were \"ready alternatives\" to the challenged regulation. <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. \"[T]he absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.\" <i>Id.</i> Kuperman suggests that instead of requiring inmates to shave, Prison Officials could have required inmates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> with full beards to search their own beards in the presence of correctional officers, or staff could have used combs during beard searches. He also proposed that prisons use technology to digitally alter photographs of an escaped inmate to show him without a beard.</p>\n<p>The Boyajian affidavit demonstrates that Prison Officials considered and rejected alternatives to PPD 7.17. It says that \"[c]onducting `beard searches' or issuing multiple identification cards showing an inmate with or without a beard are not reasonable or feasible alternatives to the shaving policy\" because they would unduly strain prison resources and relations between staff and inmates, and because multiple identification cards would make it difficult to identify inmates quickly. Although the statements in the record are bare-boned, Prison Officials are not required to \"set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant's constitutional complaint.\" <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Rather, we look to \"whether the prisoner has pointed to some obvious regulatory alternative that fully accommodates the asserted right while not imposing more than a <i>de minimis</i> cost to the valid penological goal.\" <i>Overton,</i> 539 U.S. at 136, 123 S.Ct. 2162. Kuperman has not done so, and so we find there were no ready alternatives to the regulation at issue here.</p>\n<p>Having found that all four of the <i>Turner</i> factors weigh in favor of Prison Officials, we hold that Prison Officials are entitled to summary judgment on Kuperman's First Amendment claim. Other courts considering prison grooming regulations have reached similar conclusions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fegans v. Norris,</i> 537 F.3d 897, 906-07 (8th Cir.2008) (regulation prohibiting beards did not violate First Amendment); <i>McRae v. Johnson,</i> 261 Fed.Appx. 554, 558 (4th Cir.2008) (unpublished decision) (same); <i>Pollock v. Marshall,</i> 845 F.2d 656, 659-60 (6th Cir.1988) (regulation restricting inmates' hair length did not violate First Amendment); <i>Oakes v. Green,</i> Civil Action No. 08-CV-12-HRW, 2008 WL 559683, at *4 (E.D.Ky. Feb. 27, 2008) (unpublished decision) (regulation prohibiting beards did not violate First Amendment); <i>Daker v. Wetherington,</i> 469 F.Supp.2d 1231, 1237, 1239 (N.D.Ga.2007) (same).<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>Fourteenth Amendment</i><sup>[12]</sup></h2>\n<p>In Kuperman's second § 1983 claim, he argues that forcing him to limit the length of his beard violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[13]</sup> Essentially, he contends that Gerry allowed inmates in more secure units to grow longer beards while restricting inmates in the general population to 1/4-inch beards, and that this unequal treatment was not rationally related to a legitimate penological interest. As did his earlier contentions, this one falls short given the record before us.</p>\n<p>Equal protection means that \"similarly situated persons are to receive substantially similar treatment from their government.\" <i>Tapalian v. Tusino,</i> 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. &amp; Mortg. Fin. Corp.,</i> 246 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2001)). To establish <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that, compared with others similarly situated, the plaintiff was treated differently because of an improper consideration, such as his religion. <i>See id.</i> Equal protection does not, however, require prison staff to treat all inmate groups the same when differentiation is necessary to avoid a threat to prison security. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jones v. N.C. Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.,</i> 433 U.S. 119, 136, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977).</p>\n<p>The Boyajian affidavit and an affidavit submitted by Lieutenant Paul Cascio, Lieutenant of Security for the Secure Psychiatric Unit and the Residential Treatment Unit of the New Hampshire State Prison, show that the shaving policy applied to all inmates, regardless of where in the prison they resided. Prisoners in the general population who did not have shaving waivers were required to be clean-shaven on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Inmates in some high-security unitswho were not permitted to have razorswere shaved by barbers once each week or shaved using clippers once every two weeks under staff supervision. Although the shaving policy was implemented differently in different areas of the prison, Gerry articulated a rational basis for allowing inmates in high-security units to go a week or two between shavesthe dangers arising from letting them personally possess razors and the lack of resources necessary to shave them more frequently.</p>\n<p>Kuperman contends on appeal that the Sargent affidavit created a dispute of material fact on his equal protection claim. The affidavit states that while Sargent was an inmate in the New Hampshire State Prison, he was at one point permitted to grow his beard to three inches long; that at another time in another unit he was permitted to grow his beard to about two inches long; that in another prison he \"often\" had his beard up to one inch long; that he saw one inmate living in the general population with a beard longer than three inches; and that he saw other inmates in a high-security unit with full beards which appeared to be longer than three inches. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kuperman, as we must at this stage, the Sargent affidavit suggests Gerry selectively enforced the shaving regulation.</p>\n<p>To affect the summary judgment motion on his equal protection claim, however, Kuperman needed to fortify his selective-enforcement claim with evidence showing that Gerry enforced the shaving regulation against him because of his religion. <i>See </i><i>Tapalian,</i> 377 F.3d at 5. The record before us is devoid of any such evidence. Because Kuperman failed to show that, based on his religion, he was treated differently from other similarly situated inmates with regard to shaving, Gerry is entitled to summary judgment on Kuperman's equal protection claim.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>RLUIPA Claim</i></h2>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we note that some other circuits have held that personal-capacity claims are unavailable under RLUIPA. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Nelson v. Miller,</i> 570 F.3d 868, 889 (7th Cir.2009); <i>Rendelman,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> 569 F.3d at 184; <i>Sossamon v. Texas</i> (<i>Sossamon I</i>), 560 F.3d 316, 329 (5th Cir.2009), <i>aff'd on other grounds, </i><i>Sossamon v. Texas</i> (<i>Sossamon II</i>), ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 1663, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011); <i>Smith v. Allen,</i> 502 F.3d 1255, 1275 &amp; n. 11 (11th Cir.2007). They reason that because Congress passed RLUIPA under the Spending Clause, courts should not interpret it to impose liability on individuals who do not themselves receive federal funds.<sup>[15]</sup><i>See </i><i>Nelson,</i> 570 F.3d at 886-88; <i>Smith,</i> 502 F.3d at 1273-75; <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>The Spending Clause permits Congress to attach conditions designed to promote its policy objectives on the receipt of federal funds. <i>See </i><i>South Dakota v. Dole,</i> 483 U.S. 203, 206, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). Spending Clause legislation has been described as creating a \"contract\" between the federal government and the recipient of federal funds. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sossamon II,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 1661 (acknowledging the contract-law analogy).</p>\n<blockquote>[C]ourts have consistently recognized the limited reach of Congress' Spending Power legislation, concluding that statutes passed under the Spending Clause may, as a condition of funding, subject the grant <i>recipient</i> to liability in a private cause of action, but that the Spending Power cannot be used to subject individual defendants, such as state employees, to individual liability in a private cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Smith,</i> 502 F.3d at 1274 (citing Title IX cases). These courts have concluded that because RLUIPA liability arises from receipt of federal funds, only the grant recipientthe statemay be held liable for a violation of RLUIPA. <i>See </i><i>Sossamon I,</i> 560 F.3d at 328 (citing <i>Smith,</i> 502 F.3d at 1272-73); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b).</p>\n<p>Prison Officials have not challenged the viability of Kuperman's personal-capacity claim, and we need not reach the issue. As we explain in the next section, even assuming such a claim to be available, Kuperman is not entitled to relief under RLUIPA. We therefore reserve ruling on whether personal-capacity claims are available under RLUIPA, as have our sister courts in the Second and Ninth Circuits. <i>See Hall v. Ekpe,</i> No. 09-4492-pr, ___ Fed.Appx. ___, ___, 2011 WL 2600514, at *1 (2d Cir.2011); <i>Florer v. Congregation Pidyon Shevuyim, N.A.,</i> 639 F.3d 916, 922 n. 3 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p>RLUIPA provides greater protection to inmates' free-exercise rights than does the First Amendment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Spratt,</i> 482 F.3d at 42 n. 12. It bars prisons receiving federal funds from substantially burdening an inmate's religious exercise unless the regulation under attack is the least restrictive way to advance a compelling state interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cutter v. Wilkinson,</i> 544 U.S. 709, 715-16, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005). Prison Officials conceded, for summary judgment purposes only, that the shaving regulation substantially burdened Kuperman's religious exercise. So the battle is over whether they showed that PPD 7.17 furthers a compelling governmental interest and whether it was the least restrictive means of doing so.</p>\n<p>In our discussion of Kuperman's § 1983 claims, we noted that Prison Officials submitted evidence showing that the shaving regulation promotes prison security in several specific ways. Because prison security is undoubtedly a compelling state interest, we conclude that they have met their burden of demonstrating that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> PPD 7.17 furthers a compelling governmental interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Spratt,</i> 482 F.3d at 39 (citing <i>Cutter,</i> 544 U.S. at 725 n. 13, 125 S.Ct. 2113); <i>Fegans,</i> 537 F.3d at 906.</p>\n<p>But to survive challenge under RLUIPA, Prison Officials must also show that the shaving regulation was the least restrictive means available to further that interest. <i>See </i><i>Spratt,</i> 482 F.3d at 40-41. They rely on the Boyajian affidavit to satisfy that requirement. Because most of its key passages have already been quoted in our First Amendment analysis, we refrain from quoting them again here. Boyajian specifically addressed concerns about longer beards being used to conceal weapons and contraband and about additional time and risk to staff if beard searches were required. He explained that issuing multiple identification cards would be too complicated given all of the different possible types of beards and the need for staff to be able to quickly identify inmates. And he mentioned the risk that escaped inmates with longer beards could more quickly change their appearance.</p>\n<p>We further note that the shaving regulation allowed inmates whose religious beliefs value growing facial hair to maintain 1/4-inch beards, which is less restrictive than enacting a regulation prohibiting beards altogether, as some other prisons have done. <i>Compare</i> PPD 7.17 <i>with </i><i>Gooden v. Crain,</i> 353 Fed.Appx. 885, 886-87, 890 (5th Cir.2009)(unpublished decision)(upholding regulation prohibiting beards unless inmate obtains a medical exception) and <i>Fegans,</i> 537 F.3d at 901, 907 (same).</p>\n<p>Kuperman contends that the shaving regulation was not the least restrictive means available to Prison Officials, but he submitted no admissible evidence to counterbalance Prison Officials' affidavits. Because the unrebutted Prison Officials' affidavits show that they considered and rejected alternatives to the shaving regulation, we find that it meets RLUIPA's least restrictive means test.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, assuming for argument's sake that Kuperman can assert a personal-capacity claim under RLUIPA, Prison Officials are entitled to summary judgment on his RLUIPA claim. Once again, our conclusion is consistent with that reached by other courts considering even more restrictive regulations. <i>See </i><i>Gooden,</i> 353 Fed.Appx. at 886-87, 890 (regulation prohibiting beards did not violate RLUIPA); <i>Fegans,</i> 537 F.3d at 901, 907 (same); <i>McRae,</i> 261 Fed.Appx. at 558 (same); <i>Oakes,</i> 2008 WL 559683, at *4 (same); <i>Daker,</i> 469 F.Supp.2d at 1237 (same). <i>But see </i><i>Mayweathers v. Terhune,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d 1086, 1096 (E.D.Cal.2004) (regulation prohibiting beards violated RLUIPA); <i>Gartrell v. Ashcroft,</i> 191 F.Supp.2d 23, 36 (D.D.C.2002) (regulation prohibiting beards violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the predecessor to RLUIPA).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the reasons recited above, we grant Prison Officials' motion to dismiss Kuperman's claims seeking injunctive relief. We <i>affirm</i> the judgment below granting summary judgment in favor of Prison Officials on Kuperman's remaining claims. No costs to either party.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The section of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure Directive 7.17 which addresses religious waivers, section IV.D., states as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Shaving Waivers: Inmates declaring membership in recognized faith groups, and demonstrating a sincerely held religious belief in which the growing of facial hair is of religious significance may request a shaving waiver. If approved, the shaving waiver allows an inmate to maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard. No sculpting, shaping or selective shaving is allowed; all facial hair must be trimmed equally. If an inmate with a shaving waiver is found to have shaped his beard, he must shave clean and start again. Abuse of the shaving waiver guidelines may result in revocation of the shaving waiver. Violations of the shaving waiver will be reported to the appropriate Unit Manager who will determine what action will be taken.</p>\n<p>[2]  Kuperman originally asserted some additional claims, but they will not be discussed because they were dismissed or withdrawn before this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p>[3]  Preliminary screening was required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, which provides in relevant part as follows:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Screening.The court shall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.</p>\n<p>(b) Grounds for Dismissal.On review, the court shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint</p>\n<p>(1) is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; or</p>\n<p>(2) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.</p>\n<p>[4]  Kuperman's summary judgment opposition included a single-page document which appears to be minutes of an Inmate Communications Committee meeting held on June 16, 2010. Kuperman failed to make any showing as to grounds under which the document could be admitted as evidence. <i>See </i><i>Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 290 F.3d 466, 475-76 (1st Cir.2002). Even overlooking that problem, however, the content of the document (including its reference to a discussion about a \"proposal on the elimination of the current shaving policy\" and a comment allegedly made by a prison Health Services representative that \"things would be a lot easier ... if this policy were to be discontinued\") is insufficient to create a dispute of material fact, when viewed in the context of the overall record. An affidavit submitted by Prison Officials explained that they were considering whether to change the shaving policy to permit all inmates to maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard, without having to obtain a shaving waiver.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although neither party discussed the Prison Litigation Reform Act, we note that it could preclude Kuperman from recovering on his § 1983 claim seeking compensatory damages. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). Section 1997e(e) provides that \"[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" Although some courts have interpreted section 1997e(e)'s limitation not to apply to constitutional claims, <i>see generally </i><i>Thompson v. Carter,</i> 284 F.3d 411, 416-17 (2d Cir.2002) (collecting cases), we need not reach the issue. It does not matter whether compensatory damages are available to Kuperman, because his requests for nominal and punitive damages are enough to keep his claims alive.</p>\n<p>[6]  As discussed in more detail <i>infra,</i> we reserve ruling on the issue of whether personal-capacity claims are available under RLUIPA. <i>See </i><i>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft,</i> 436 U.S. 1, 8-9, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978) (expressing no opinion on the validity of respondents' claim for actual and punitive damages, but noting that the request saved the claim from mootness because it \"is not so insubstantial or so clearly foreclosed by prior decisions that this case may not proceed\").</p>\n<p>[7]  Kuperman's First Amendment claim proceeded against both Prison Officials, Wrenn and Gerry. Because our analysis does not require us to differentiate each defendant's role, we continue to refer to them collectively.</p>\n<p>[8]  \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof....\" U.S. Const. amend. I.</p>\n<p>[9]  There is very little evidence in the record supporting Prison Officials' contention that the shaving regulation promotes inmate hygiene. But we need not reach this question because we conclude <i>infra</i> that the regulation is reasonably related to the legitimate penological interest of prison security. Although Prison Officials refer to the interest asserted as \"safety and security,\" we prefer the more concise term \"prison security.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  As was true of the document attached to Kuperman's summary judgment opposition, Kuperman failed to make any showing as to grounds under which the letter could be admitted as evidence. <i>See </i><i>Gorski,</i> 290 F.3d at 475-76.</p>\n<p>[11]  We cite unpublished decisions with the recognition that they are persuasive authority but are not binding within their respective jurisdictions. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 32.1(a).</p>\n<p>[12]  Kuperman's Fourteenth Amendment claim proceeded against only Warden Gerry.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that states shall not \"deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. art. XIV, § 1.</p>\n<p>[14]  Kuperman also contends on appeal that the prison's procedures for implementing its shaving policy are deficient. Although these contentions sound like an attempt to mount a procedural due process challenge to the shaving regulation, Kuperman failed to raise such a claim in his complaint or anywhere in the record before the district court. We will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement Div. of Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 510 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[15]  We note that RLUIPA was also enacted pursuant to Congress's Commerce Clause authority. <i>Sossamon II,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 1656; <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2).</p>\n\n</div>",

Delaney, Attorney General, on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Albert Kuperman, a former inmate at the New Hampshire State Prison, challenges a district court order granting summary judgment to the defendant prison officials. The New Hampshire State Prison system requires all inmates to be clean-shaven, unless they obtain a waiver based on a medical condition or on their religious beliefs.<sup>[1]</sup> An inmate who obtains a shaving waiver based on his religious beliefs may \"maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard.\"</p>\n<p>While incarcerated in state prison, Kuperman, an Orthodox Jew, filed a <i>pro se</i> complaint claiming that he should not have been required to shave at all, because doing so unduly impinged on his sincerely-held religious beliefs. More specifically, he asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the prison shaving regulation (sometimes referred to as \"PPD 7.17\") violated his rights under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. He also argued that it violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1 <i>et seq.</i><sup>[2]</sup> The complaint sought injunctive relief, monetary damages, and declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p>The defendants are William Wrenn, Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, and Richard Gerry, Warden of the New Hampshire State Prison (collectively referred to as \"Prison Officials\"). Kuperman sued them in both their official and personal capacities. During <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> preliminary screening of the complaint, the district court identified which claims could proceed.<sup>[3]</sup> As part of that screening, it dismissed Kuperman's official capacity claims except to the extent they sought injunctive relief. Kuperman does not challenge that dismissal on appeal.</p>\n<p>Prison Officials filed a motion seeking summary judgment on all remaining claims. Kuperman, who by this stage had obtained counsel, opposed the motion, but submitted no new affidavits or other admissible evidence to rebut Prison Officials' arguments.<sup>[4]</sup> Ultimately, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Prison Officials on all claims. Kuperman filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p>Because our review of the record reveals no dispute of material fact and shows that Prison Officials are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>MOTION TO DISMISS</h2>\n<p>Because Kuperman completed his sentence and was released from state custody while his appeal was pending, Prison Officials moved to dismiss his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief as moot. Kuperman agrees that his claims for injunctive relief are moot. But he insists that his claims for declaratory relief and monetary damages survive. We can decide only ongoing cases and controversies, of course. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; <i>Preiser v. Newkirk,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109298\"><a href=\"/opinion/109298/preiser-v-newkirk/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 401, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109298\"><a href=\"/opinion/109298/preiser-v-newkirk/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span> (1975). So if an event occurs that makes it impossible for us to provide some form of meaningful relief, there is, generally speaking, no case or controversy, and we must dismiss the appeal as moot. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Church of Scientology v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112792\"><a href=\"/opinion/112792/churchof-scientology-of-cal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112792\"><a href=\"/opinion/112792/churchof-scientology-of-cal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span> (1992). Our first task, then, is to see whether Kuperman's release from prison eliminates any possibility of further judicial relief, which would render his claims moot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Official Capacity Claims</i></h2>\n<p>During preliminary screening of Kuperman's complaint, the district court jettisoned his official capacity claims except to the extent they sought injunctive reliefa ruling Kuperman does not contest here. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> Kuperman concedes that his release moots his injunctive relief requests. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rendelman v. Rouse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1029217\"><a href=\"/opinion/1029217/rendelman-v-rouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 186 (4th Cir.2009). That leaves us with this: § 1983 and RLUIPA claims against Prison Officials in their personal capacities seeking monetary and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Personal Capacity Claims</i></h2>\n<p>A claim is moot only if no relief is available. <i>See </i><i>Church of Scientology,</i> 506 U.S. at 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112792\"><a href=\"/opinion/112792/churchof-scientology-of-cal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>. Prison Officials appear to concede that Kuperman's claims for monetary relief survive, given that their motion to dismiss mentions Kuperman's request for monetary relief but asks us to dismiss only his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. Indeed, as a former prisoner alleging a constitutional violation that occurred during his incarceration, Kuperman may obtain nominal and punitive damages under § 1983.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Royal v.

Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the undisputed facts show that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>MERITS</h2>\n<p>As the moving parties, Prison Officials had the initial burden of informing the judge of the basis for their motion and identifying the portions of the record that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Colón v.

If they did that, then Kuperman had to show, \"through submissions of evidentiary quality, that a trialworthy issue persists.\" <i>Iverson,</i> 452 F.3d at 98. On issues for which Kuperman would bear the burden of proof at trial, he had to introduce definite, competent evidence to survive summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec.

Kuperman's § 1983 claim is based in part on his contention that the prison shaving regulation prevented him from practicing his religion, in violation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>A prison regulation which restricts an inmate's First Amendment rights is permissible if it is \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" <i>Turner v.

The factors relevant in deciding the regulation's constitutionality are: (1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the regulation and the legitimate government interest put forward to justify it; (2) whether alternative means to exercise the right exist; (3) the impact that accommodating the right will have on prison resources; and (4) the absence of alternatives to the prison regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 89-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When contesting the reasonableness of a prison's regulation, the inmate bears the burden of persuasion. <i>See </i><i>Overton,</i> 539 U.S. at 132, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130150\"><a href=\"/opinion/130150/overton-v-bazzetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2162</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Applying the first <i>Turner</i> factor, we consider whether the beard-length restriction is reasonably related to the penological interests asserted by Prison Officials to justify it. <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 89-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2254</span></a></span>. Prison Officials submitted an affidavit from Charles Boyajian, Unit Manager of the Special Housing Unit and the Close Custody Unit of the New Hampshire State Prison for Men, stating that the shaving regulation promotes safety and security interests and good hygiene.<sup>[9]</sup> Prison Officials insist that the beard-length restriction is reasonably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> related to prison security because it (1) helps guards identify inmates inside the prison to ensure they do not enter prohibited areas, (2) makes it harder for inmates to hide weapons or contraband, and (3) prevents an inmate from quickly changing his appearance if he escapes.</p>\n<p>Kuperman's evidence does not refute these contentions. On appeal, he contends otherwise, pointing to a letter from Rabbi Wiener of the Jewish Council of Greater Coney Island, and an affidavit from another inmate, Wayne Sargent. Rabbi Wiener's letter, which was attached to the complaint and not sworn to under oath, establishes that wearing a full, untrimmed beard is important in Jewish law. Yet it says nothing which casts doubt on Prison Officials' contention that the shaving regulation promotes prison security.<sup>[10]</sup> The other document Kuperman relied on, the Sargent affidavit, indicates that some inmates were allowed to grow beards longer than 1/4-inch in length, but contains nothing which could be used to rebut Prison Officials' assertion that the shaving regulation promotes important penological interests.</p>\n<p>Finishing up the first <i>Turner</i> factor, we briefly dispatch a couple of Kuperman's non-starters. He argues that even if he had been allowed to grow a longer beard, he personally would not have posed a security risk. But courts do not require an actual breach of security before upholding a regulation designed to prevent it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 89, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Based on Prison Officials' explanation of the rationale for the shaving regulation, we conclude that they met their burden of demonstrating that it is reasonably related to the legitimate penological interest of maintaining prison security.</p>\n<p>Proceeding to the second <i>Turner</i> factor, we look at whether alternative means for exercising the inmate's constitutionally-protected right remain open to him. <i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2254</span></a></span>. Kuperman contends that because shaving is an act of sacrilege to a member of the Orthodox Jewish faith, there were no alternative means available to him. His argument misses the mark. Our inquiry is not into whether a religiously-acceptable alternative to growing a full beard existed. Instead, we consider whether alternative means remained open for Kuperman to exercise the constitutionally-protected right at issuehere, free exercise of his religion. <i>See </i><i>O'Lone,</i> 482 U.S. at 351-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The institutions will provide all inmates with the opportunity to pursue any recognized belief or practice, subject to the restrictions of their custody level\" and \"[t]he institution shall extend to all inmates the greatest amount of freedom and opportunity to pursue any recognized religious belief or practice.\" It includes specific procedures by which inmates could have access to religious publications, religious diets, religious apparel, and personal and group religious items. Kuperman has introduced nothing indicating that, other than the shaving regulation, the prison interfered with the free exercise of his religious beliefs. Accordingly, we find the record sufficient to demonstrate that Kuperman had available to him alternative means to exercise his right to free expression of his religion.</p>\n<p>We move on to the third <i>Turner</i> factorthe impact on guards, other inmates, and the allocation of prison resources generally if the asserted constitutional right were to be accommodated. <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2254</span></a></span>. In other words, we consider how allowing some inmates to grow full beards would affect the prison. The Boyajian affidavit touches on this issue, explaining that because longer beards create opportunities for inmates to transport contraband or weapons, staff would be required to conduct more frequent searches of inmates, which would increase conflicts between staff and inmates and place staff at greater risk of assault. It also states that a more liberal grooming policy would make identifying prisoners more expensive and burdensome because it is \"impractical and a strain on prison resources to issue multiple identification cards for every inmate for every possible length or shape of beard.\"</p>\n<p>Kuperman's response is that permitting full beards would have only a nominal effect on prison resources. The only document he references in support of this contention is a magistrate judge's report and recommendation from a completely different case brought by Kuperman concerning suspension of his kosher diet while in prison. Kuperman claims that because only a small number of inmates requested kosher meals, only a small number of prisoners would choose to grow full beards. The report and recommendation actually says nothing about how many other prisoners sought kosher meals. We need not credit conclusory statements made without support in the record. <i>See </i><i>Sutliffe v. Epping Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span>, 325 (1st Cir.2009). Kuperman also fails to address the additional burden which non-uniform rules place on prison staff. Based on the record before us, the third <i>Turner</i> factor weighs in favor of Prison Officials, who have shown that accommodating Kuperman's desire to grow a full beard would have adversely impacted prison resources.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the final <i>Turner</i> factor, whether there were \"ready alternatives\" to the challenged regulation. <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2254</span></a></span>. \"[T]he absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regulation.\" <i>Id.</i> Kuperman suggests that instead of requiring inmates to shave, Prison Officials could have required inmates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> with full beards to search their own beards in the presence of correctional officers, or staff could have used combs during beard searches. He also proposed that prisons use technology to digitally alter photographs of an escaped inmate to show him without a beard.</p>\n<p>The Boyajian affidavit demonstrates that Prison Officials considered and rejected alternatives to PPD 7.17. It says that \"[c]onducting `beard searches' or issuing multiple identification cards showing an inmate with or without a beard are not reasonable or feasible alternatives to the shaving policy\" because they would unduly strain prison resources and relations between staff and inmates, and because multiple identification cards would make it difficult to identify inmates quickly. Although the statements in the record are bare-boned, Prison Officials are not required to \"set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant's constitutional complaint.\" <i>See </i><i>Turner,</i> 482 U.S. at 90-91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2254</span></a></span>. Rather, we look to \"whether the prisoner has pointed to some obvious regulatory alternative that fully accommodates the asserted right while not imposing more than a <i>de minimis</i> cost to the valid penological goal.\" <i>Overton,</i> 539 U.S. at 136, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130150\"><a href=\"/opinion/130150/overton-v-bazzetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2162</span></a></span>. Kuperman has not done so, and so we find there were no ready alternatives to the regulation at issue here.</p>\n<p>Having found that all four of the <i>Turner</i> factors weigh in favor of Prison Officials, we hold that Prison Officials are entitled to summary judgment on Kuperman's First Amendment claim. Other courts considering prison grooming regulations have reached similar conclusions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fegans v.

As did his earlier contentions, this one falls short given the record before us.</p>\n<p>Equal protection means that \"similarly situated persons are to receive substantially similar treatment from their government.\" <i>Tapalian v.

To establish <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that, compared with others similarly situated, the plaintiff was treated differently because of an improper consideration, such as his religion. <i>See id.</i> Equal protection does not, however, require prison staff to treat all inmate groups the same when differentiation is necessary to avoid a threat to prison security. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jones v.

Prisoners in the general population who did not have shaving waivers were required to be clean-shaven on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Inmates in some high-security unitswho were not permitted to have razorswere shaved by barbers once each week or shaved using clippers once every two weeks under staff supervision. Although the shaving policy was implemented differently in different areas of the prison, Gerry articulated a rational basis for allowing inmates in high-security units to go a week or two between shavesthe dangers arising from letting them personally possess razors and the lack of resources necessary to shave them more frequently.</p>\n<p>Kuperman contends on appeal that the Sargent affidavit created a dispute of material fact on his equal protection claim. The affidavit states that while Sargent was an inmate in the New Hampshire State Prison, he was at one point permitted to grow his beard to three inches long; that at another time in another unit he was permitted to grow his beard to about two inches long; that in another prison he \"often\" had his beard up to one inch long; that he saw one inmate living in the general population with a beard longer than three inches; and that he saw other inmates in a high-security unit with full beards which appeared to be longer than three inches. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kuperman, as we must at this stage, the Sargent affidavit suggests Gerry selectively enforced the shaving regulation.</p>\n<p>To affect the summary judgment motion on his equal protection claim, however, Kuperman needed to fortify his selective-enforcement claim with evidence showing that Gerry enforced the shaving regulation against him because of his religion. <i>See </i><i>Tapalian,</i> 377 F.3d at 5. The record before us is devoid of any such evidence. Because Kuperman failed to show that, based on his religion, he was treated differently from other similarly situated inmates with regard to shaving, Gerry is entitled to summary judgment on Kuperman's equal protection claim.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>RLUIPA Claim</i></h2>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we note that some other circuits have held that personal-capacity claims are unavailable under RLUIPA. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Nelson v.

They reason that because Congress passed RLUIPA under the Spending Clause, courts should not interpret it to impose liability on individuals who do not themselves receive federal funds.<sup>[15]</sup><i>See </i><i>Nelson,</i> 570 F.3d at 886-88; <i>Smith,</i> 502 F.3d at 1273-75; <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>The Spending Clause permits Congress to attach conditions designed to promote its policy objectives on the receipt of federal funds. <i>See </i><i>South Dakota v. Dole,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111939\"><a href=\"/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 206, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111939\"><a href=\"/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span> (1987). Spending Clause legislation has been described as creating a \"contract\" between the federal government and the recipient of federal funds. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sossamon II,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 1661 (acknowledging the contract-law analogy).</p>\n<blockquote>[C]ourts have consistently recognized the limited reach of Congress' Spending Power legislation, concluding that statutes passed under the Spending Clause may, as a condition of funding, subject the grant <i>recipient</i> to liability in a private cause of action, but that the Spending Power cannot be used to subject individual defendants, such as state employees, to individual liability in a private cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Smith,</i> 502 F.3d at 1274 (citing Title IX cases). These courts have concluded that because RLUIPA liability arises from receipt of federal funds, only the grant recipientthe statemay be held liable for a violation of RLUIPA. <i>See </i><i>Sossamon I,</i> 560 F.3d at 328 (citing <i>Smith,</i> 502 F.3d at 1272-73); <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b).</p>\n<p>Prison Officials have not challenged the viability of Kuperman's personal-capacity claim, and we need not reach the issue. As we explain in the next section, even assuming such a claim to be available, Kuperman is not entitled to relief under RLUIPA. We therefore reserve ruling on whether personal-capacity claims are available under RLUIPA, as have our sister courts in the Second and Ninth Circuits. <i>See Hall v. Ekpe,</i> No. 09-4492-pr, ___ Fed.Appx. ___, ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2600514</span></span>, at *1 (2d Cir.2011); <i>Florer v.

It bars prisons receiving federal funds from substantially burdening an inmate's religious exercise unless the regulation under attack is the least restrictive way to advance a compelling state interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cutter v. Wilkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span>, 715-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span> (2005). Prison Officials conceded, for summary judgment purposes only, that the shaving regulation substantially burdened Kuperman's religious exercise. So the battle is over whether they showed that PPD 7.17 furthers a compelling governmental interest and whether it was the least restrictive means of doing so.</p>\n<p>In our discussion of Kuperman's § 1983 claims, we noted that Prison Officials submitted evidence showing that the shaving regulation promotes prison security in several specific ways. Because prison security is undoubtedly a compelling state interest, we conclude that they have met their burden of demonstrating that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> PPD 7.17 furthers a compelling governmental interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Spratt,</i> 482 F.3d at 39 (citing <i>Cutter,</i> 544 U.S. at 725 n. 13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2113</span></a></span>); <i>Fegans,</i> 537 F.3d at 906.</p>\n<p>But to survive challenge under RLUIPA, Prison Officials must also show that the shaving regulation was the least restrictive means available to further that interest. <i>See </i><i>Spratt,</i> 482 F.3d at 40-41. They rely on the Boyajian affidavit to satisfy that requirement. Because most of its key passages have already been quoted in our First Amendment analysis, we refrain from quoting them again here. Boyajian specifically addressed concerns about longer beards being used to conceal weapons and contraband and about additional time and risk to staff if beard searches were required. He explained that issuing multiple identification cards would be too complicated given all of the different possible types of beards and the need for staff to be able to quickly identify inmates. And he mentioned the risk that escaped inmates with longer beards could more quickly change their appearance.</p>\n<p>We further note that the shaving regulation allowed inmates whose religious beliefs value growing facial hair to maintain 1/4-inch beards, which is less restrictive than enacting a regulation prohibiting beards altogether, as some other prisons have done. <i>Compare</i> PPD 7.17 <i>with </i><i>Gooden v. Crain,</i> 353 Fed.Appx. 885, 886-87, 890 (5th Cir.2009)(unpublished decision)(upholding regulation prohibiting beards unless inmate obtains a medical exception) and <i>Fegans,</i> 537 F.3d at 901, 907 (same).</p>\n<p>Kuperman contends that the shaving regulation was not the least restrictive means available to Prison Officials, but he submitted no admissible evidence to counterbalance Prison Officials' affidavits. Because the unrebutted Prison Officials' affidavits show that they considered and rejected alternatives to the shaving regulation, we find that it meets RLUIPA's least restrictive means test.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, assuming for argument's sake that Kuperman can assert a personal-capacity claim under RLUIPA, Prison Officials are entitled to summary judgment on his RLUIPA claim. Once again, our conclusion is consistent with that reached by other courts considering even more restrictive regulations. <i>See </i><i>Gooden,</i> 353 Fed.Appx. at 886-87, 890 (regulation prohibiting beards did not violate RLUIPA); <i>Fegans,</i> 537 F.3d at 901, 907 (same); <i>McRae,</i> 261 Fed.Appx. at 558 (same); <i>Oakes,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">559683</span></span>, at *4 (same); <i>Daker,</i> 469 F.Supp.2d at 1237 (same). <i>But see </i><i>Mayweathers v.

We <i>affirm</i> the judgment below granting summary judgment in favor of Prison Officials on Kuperman's remaining claims. No costs to either party.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The section of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections Policy and Procedure Directive 7.17 which addresses religious waivers, section IV.D., states as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Shaving Waivers: Inmates declaring membership in recognized faith groups, and demonstrating a sincerely held religious belief in which the growing of facial hair is of religious significance may request a shaving waiver. If approved, the shaving waiver allows an inmate to maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard. No sculpting, shaping or selective shaving is allowed; all facial hair must be trimmed equally. If an inmate with a shaving waiver is found to have shaped his beard, he must shave clean and start again. Abuse of the shaving waiver guidelines may result in revocation of the shaving waiver. Violations of the shaving waiver will be reported to the appropriate Unit Manager who will determine what action will be taken.</p>\n<p>[2]  Kuperman originally asserted some additional claims, but they will not be discussed because they were dismissed or withdrawn before this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p>[3]  Preliminary screening was required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, which provides in relevant part as follows:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Screening.The court shall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.</p>\n<p>(b) Grounds for Dismissal.On review, the court shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint</p>\n<p>(1) is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; or</p>\n<p>(2) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.</p>\n<p>[4]  Kuperman's summary judgment opposition included a single-page document which appears to be minutes of an Inmate Communications Committee meeting held on June 16, 2010. Kuperman failed to make any showing as to grounds under which the document could be admitted as evidence. <i>See </i><i>Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199974\"><a href=\"/opinion/199974/gorski-v-new-hampshire-depart/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 475-76 (1st Cir.2002). Even overlooking that problem, however, the content of the document (including its reference to a discussion about a \"proposal on the elimination of the current shaving policy\" and a comment allegedly made by a prison Health Services representative that \"things would be a lot easier ... if this policy were to be discontinued\") is insufficient to create a dispute of material fact, when viewed in the context of the overall record. An affidavit submitted by Prison Officials explained that they were considering whether to change the shaving policy to permit all inmates to maintain a 1/4-inch neatly trimmed beard, without having to obtain a shaving waiver.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although neither party discussed the Prison Litigation Reform Act, we note that it could preclude Kuperman from recovering on his § 1983 claim seeking compensatory damages. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). Section 1997e(e) provides that \"[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" Although some courts have interpreted section 1997e(e)'s limitation not to apply to constitutional claims, <i>see generally </i><i>Thompson v. Carter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776987\"><a href=\"/opinion/776987/louis-thompson-v-j-carter-correctional-officer-clinton-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 416-17 (2d Cir.2002) (collecting cases), we need not reach the issue. It does not matter whether compensatory damages are available to Kuperman, because his requests for nominal and punitive damages are enough to keep his claims alive.</p>\n<p>[6]  As discussed in more detail <i>infra,</i> we reserve ruling on the issue of whether personal-capacity claims are available under RLUIPA. <i>See </i><i>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109855\"><a href=\"/opinion/109855/memphis-light-gas-water-div-v-craft/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109855\"><a href=\"/opinion/109855/memphis-light-gas-water-div-v-craft/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1554</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109855\"><a href=\"/opinion/109855/memphis-light-gas-water-div-v-craft/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span> (1978) (expressing no opinion on the validity of respondents' claim for actual and punitive damages, but noting that the request saved the claim from mootness because it \"is not so insubstantial or so clearly foreclosed by prior decisions that this case may not proceed\").</p>\n<p>[7]  Kuperman's First Amendment claim proceeded against both Prison Officials, Wrenn and Gerry. Because our analysis does not require us to differentiate each defendant's role, we continue to refer to them collectively.</p>\n<p>[8]  \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof....\" U.S. Const. amend. I.</p>\n<p>[9]  There is very little evidence in the record supporting Prison Officials' contention that the shaving regulation promotes inmate hygiene. But we need not reach this question because we conclude <i>infra</i> that the regulation is reasonably related to the legitimate penological interest of prison security. Although Prison Officials refer to the interest asserted as \"safety and security,\" we prefer the more concise term \"prison security.\"</p>\n<p>[10]  As was true of the document attached to Kuperman's summary judgment opposition, Kuperman failed to make any showing as to grounds under which the letter could be admitted as evidence. <i>See </i><i>Gorski,</i> 290 F.3d at 475-76.</p>\n<p>[11]  We cite unpublished decisions with the recognition that they are persuasive authority but are not binding within their respective jurisdictions. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 32.1(a).</p>\n<p>[12]  Kuperman's Fourteenth Amendment claim proceeded against only Warden Gerry.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that states shall not \"deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. art. XIV, § 1.</p>\n<p>[14]  Kuperman also contends on appeal that the prison's procedures for implementing its shaving policy are deficient. Although these contentions sound like an attempt to mount a procedural due process challenge to the shaving regulation, Kuperman failed to raise such a claim in his complaint or anywhere in the record before the district court. We will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement Div. of Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[15]  We note that RLUIPA was also enacted pursuant to Congress's Commerce Clause authority. <i>Sossamon II,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 1656; <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(b)(2).</p>\n\n</div>",
