A   jury   convicted   Thomas   P.\n\nBrichetto, Jr. of bank robbery and aiding and abetting bank robbery\n\n(Count One), and using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during\n\nand in relation to the commission of a violent felony (Count Two),\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), 2113(a), 2113(d).           The jury\n\nfound that on December 12, 2001, he had, with three accomplices,\n\nrobbed at gunpoint a branch of the Gorham Regional Federal Credit\n\nUnion in Gorham, Maine, of $7,079.        The jury also acquitted him on\n\na charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count Three),\n\nsee id. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e).       Largely based on what he considers\n\nto be inconsistency in the jury verdicts, Brichetto appeals from\n\nhis conviction, saying he should have been granted a directed\n\nverdict or given a new trial.\n\n             His argument is that since the government introduced\n\nevidence of only one firearm in this case -- a .25 caliber Mauser\n\nsemiautomatic pistol -- \"The jury's verdict of Not Guilty on Count\n\nThree cannot be reconciled with the Guilty verdicts on Counts One\n\nand Two.\"     He argues that the jury necessarily found a failure of\n\nproof as to an essential element of the crimes charged in Counts\n\nOne and Two,1 namely: the use of the firearm in the robbery.\n\n\n     1\n         The armed robbery statute cited in Count One provides:\n\n             (a) Whoever, by force and violence, or by\n             intimidation, takes . . . from the person or\n             presence of another . . . any property or\n             money or any other thing of value belonging to\n             . . . any . . . credit union . . . .

Brichetto, on Tanguay's evidence, had\n\nthe gun before and after the robbery and went into the bank with\n\nthe gun.    That left the question of whether Brichetto was the\n\nrobber the teller saw.    The teller said the robber had a gun and\n\nwore a ski mask. Tanguay testified that Brichetto wore a \"stocking\n\ncap\" on the day of the robbery.        A knit cap was recovered from\n\nTanguay's car, and laboratory analysis of the DNA on the hat band\n\nshowed that it matched Brichetto's DNA. Additionally, a photograph\n\ntaken from the surveillance camera inside the bank during the\n\nrobbery shows the robber wearing a knit ski cap vaulting over the\n\ncounter with an object in his hand that a jury could easily\n\nconclude was a gun.   Indeed, the jury found by special verdict that\n\nBrichetto had brandished a firearm in the course of the robbery.\n\n           The fact that no gun was ever found or that the witnesses\n\ndescribed the gun in different ways does not mean that the evidence\n\nwas insufficient to convict.
