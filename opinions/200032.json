Sheehan for appellant.\n     Nancy J. Smith, Senior Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nPhilip T. McLaughlin, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           July 16, 2002\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         Robert Miller filed suit against\n\nthe New Hampshire Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"), claiming that\n\nhis superiors at the New Hampshire State Prison retaliated against\n\nhim for engaging in protected conduct, in violation of Title VII of\n\nthe   Civil    Rights    Act    of     1964,    42     U.S.C.      ยง   2000e,      et    seq.\n\nSpecifically, Miller maintained that he was disciplined, denied\n\npositions for which he was qualified, and constructively discharged\n\nafter he supported one of his subordinates in her sexual harassment\n\nclaim. The DOC moved for summary judgment on the grounds that many\n\nof the events Miller complained of fell outside Title VII's 300-day\nstatute of limitations; that the events within the limitations\n\nperiod were insufficient to support Miller's claim of constructive\ndischarge;     and    that    Miller     failed       to   show    that     the    DOC    was\nmotivated by discriminatory animus when it refused to promote him\n\nor transfer him to a new position.\n              The    district    court    granted          the    motion    and    entered\njudgment for the DOC. The court reasoned, first, that Miller could\n\nnot recover for alleged retaliation that occurred outside the\nstatute of limitations.              It then concluded that the more recent\nevents were either not discriminatory, or too trivial to amount to\n\na constructive discharge. See Miller v. N.H. Dep't of Corrections,\n\nCiv. No. 99-522-M, slip op. at 34-63 (D.N.H. Nov. 13, 2001)\n(unpublished).\n\n              We    believe    the    district        court      analyzed    the    issues\ncorrectly.         As we have explained elsewhere, \"when a trial court\n\naccurately     takes    the     measure    of     a    case      and   articulates       its\n\n                                          -2-\n\frationale clearly and convincingly, an appellate court should\n\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\n\nwords resonate.\"           Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383\n(1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).                          We apply that\n\ntenet here, and affirm largely on the basis of the district court's\n\nthorough and       well-reasoned          opinion.           In    light   of   the   recent\ndecision of the Supreme Court in National Railroad Passenger Corp.\n\nv. Morgan, 122 S. Ct. 2061 (2002), however, we add the following\n\ncomments on the statute of limitations issue.\n\n                                               I.\n\n               The district court described the underlying facts in\n\ndetail.     See Miller, slip op. at 4-32.                     We offer an abbreviated\naccount here.         In 1995, Miller served as the unit manager of the\nHancock    Unit       at    the   New   Hampshire          State   Prison.       Among   his\n\nsubordinates were Officers Sherri White and Tab Colby. In the fall\nof 1995, Miller heard from a third party that Colby had told other\nofficers that White had engaged in oral sex with one of the\n\ninmates.       Miller passed that information along to White, who (with\nMiller's       assistance)        filed    an        internal      complaint    of    sexual\nharassment on November 3, 1995.\n\n               On November 15, 1995, the DOC's Administrator of Security\nissued a report sharply criticizing Miller's management of the\nHancock Unit and urging that he be transferred elsewhere. A second\n\nreport    --    which       summarized     the       DOC    investigation       of    White's\ncomplaint -- also faulted Miller for his \"lack of leadership in\n\ndirecting       his        employees      in    maintaining         professionalism        in\n\n                                               -3-\n\frespecting their fellow co-workers.\" The latter report recommended\n\nthat Miller be disciplined.\n\n           As a result of the two reports, Miller was transferred to\nthe Reception and Diagnostic Unit in December of 1995.      Moreover,\n\nMiller's annual evaluation, issued in March of 1996, concluded that\n\nhis performance the previous year had fallen \"below expectations.\"\nShortly thereafter, Miller received an official letter of warning.\n\nThe letter stated that \"[y]our poor judgment in dealing with your\n\nsubordinate   staff   impacted   the   effective   operations   of   the\n\n[Hancock] Unit and created dissention [sic], shift bashing and\n\njealousy amongst staff; resulting in sexual rumors,\" and admonished\n\nMiller to take \"immediate corrective action.\"\n\n           Concerned by what he viewed as unfair criticism, Miller\nappealed the 1996 letter of warning.     In a March, 1996, memorandum\n\nto the Commissioner of the DOC, Miller argued:     \"I am being used as\n\na scapegoat and retaliated against because I reported [Colby's]\nmisconduct, mishandling of the investigation [into White's charges]\n\nand continued pollution of the environment.\"        Miller reiterated\n\nthat sentiment in a second memorandum, stating: \"I feel abused and\n\nretaliated against. . . . I am again asking for a thorough\n\ninvestigation of the environment and retaliation.\"\n\n           Unpersuaded, the commissioner denied the appeal in August\n\nof 1996.   Some time later, Miller learned that White had lied to\n\nhim about certain matters related to her complaint.       Accordingly,\n\nhe chose not to pursue the next step in the appeals process --\n\ntaking the matter to the Personnel Appeals Board.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f             According    to   Miller's      deposition    testimony,    he    \"was\n\ntreated very well\" from August of 1996 until some time in late\n\n1998.   Miller claims that three things happened in 1998 and 1999\nthat triggered a new round of retaliation.              First, he renewed his\n\nefforts to get the 1996 letter of warning removed from his file.\n\nSecond, he learned for the first time that Colby had lied during\nthe DOC's investigation into White's harassment charges.                     Miller\n\nwas furious that he had not been informed of Colby's deceit, and\n\nmade his views known to his superiors at the prison.                    Finally,\n\nMiller testified in White's Title VII trial in January of 1999.\n\n           Miller points to several instances of alleged retaliation\n\nin 1998 and 1999.      For our purposes, it is sufficient to focus on\n\none.    In early 1999, Miller applied for a probation and parole\nofficer (\"PPO\") position. Of the 13 candidates interviewed, Miller\n\nhad the third-highest score on the oral interview and the highest\n\noverall score (the combination of the oral score and a \"factor\"\nscore based on seniority and past performance).                 The position was\n\noffered to the applicant with the highest score on the interview,\n\nbut the eleventh-highest overall score.              Miller believes he was\n\ndenied the job because of his protected conduct in disclosing the\n\nalleged sexual harassment of White.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           Miller filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment    Opportunity      Commission      (\"EEOC\")    in   March   of    1999,\nclaiming   that   he     had   been   subjected    to     unlawful   retaliation\n\nbeginning in December of 1995.            In due course, he filed suit in\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdistrict court, again complaining of retaliation beginning with the\n\n1995 transfer to the Reception and Diagnostic Unit.           The DOC moved\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that, inter alia, Miller's\n\nclaims with respect to retaliation in 1995 and 1996 were time-\n\nbarred.\n\n            Under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(e), Miller was\nobligated to file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days \"after the\n\nalleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\"1         Miller filed his\n\ncharge on March 22, 1999.           Thus, he can recover for events\n\noccurring during the previous 300 days; that is, on or after May\n\n22, 1998.\n\n            Miller argues, however, that the \"continuing violation\n\ndoctrine\" allows him to reach back to events in 1995 and 1996 (the\ntransfer    to   the   Reception   and   Diagnostic   Unit,   the   negative\n\nevaluation, and the letter of warning) because those events were\n\nrelated to the allegedly retaliatory acts that occurred within the\nlimitations period.      The district court rejected that claim on the\n\nground that Miller believed he was being discriminated against at\n\nthe time that the early (now time barred) events occurred.             Thus,\n\napplying our pre-Morgan precedents, the court concluded that Miller\n\n\n     1\n      Section 2000e-5 sets out a general limitations period of 180\ndays.    That period is extended to 300 days in deferral\njurisdictions such as New Hampshire if the plaintiff \"'has\ninitially instituted proceedings with [an authorized] State or\nlocal agency.'\" Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d\n275, 278 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(e))\n(alteration in original).    Miller filed a charge with the New\nHampshire Human Rights Commission on March 19, 1999. The charge\nwas received by the EEOC for federal filing purposes on March 22,\n1999.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwas not entitled to the benefits of the continuing violation\n\ndoctrine.\n\n            The Supreme Court's recent decision in Morgan clarified\nwhen a Title VII plaintiff may present claims based on actions that\n\noccurred outside the 300-day limitations period.          Morgan held that\n\na plaintiff seeking to recover for a discrete act of discrimination\n-- as opposed to a pattern of harassing conduct that, taken as a\n\nwhole, constitutes a hostile work environment -- must file a charge\n\nwith the EEOC within 300 days \"of the date of the act or lose the\n\nability to recover for it.\"        122 S. Ct. at 2071-72.           The Court\n\nstated    explicitly   that   \"discrete    discriminatory    acts    are   not\n\nactionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts\n\nalleged in timely filed charges.\"         Id. at 2072.   It cited acts such\nas termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal\n\nto hire as examples of discrete acts that are easy to identify and\n\nthus should be acted on promptly.         Id. at 2073.    Under Morgan, it\nis clear that the 1995 transfer is a discrete act and is time\n\nbarred.\n            The same is true for the 1996 letter of warning and\n\nperformance evaluation.        Relying on our decision in Thomas v.\n\nEastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 1999), Miller argues that\n\nthe statute of limitations did not begin to run on those events\n\nuntil 1999, when he was denied the PPO position.          It was only then,\n\nhe insists, that the \"tangible effects\" of the earlier letter of\n\nwarning and evaluation became apparent to him.           Id. at 50.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f            Thomas was concerned with identifying the date on which\n\na Title VII claim accrues -- an issue left open in Morgan, 122 S.\n\nCt. at 2073 n.7.      However, focusing on the question of accrual does\nnot help Miller here.           As the district court pointed out, Miller\n\nhimself described the 1996 letter of warning as \"formal discipline\"\n\nthat    represented      a     tangible     injury.        Consistent     with     that\nunderstanding, Miller promptly appealed the letter of warning\n\nthrough the DOC's internal review procedures.                    In a memorandum to\n\nthe    commissioner      of    the   DOC,    he   wrote,    \"I    feel    abused   and\n\nretaliated against,\" and demanded that the letter of warning be\n\nremoved from his file and that a new evaluation be issued \"that is\n\nconsistent with my performance.\"                That recognition eliminates any\n\nargument   that    the       warning   and   evaluation      did    not    \"have    any\ncrystallized implications or apparent tangible effects\" at the time\n\nthey were issued.             Thomas, 183 F.3d at 55.             We conclude that\n\nMiller's claims regarding the letter of warning and performance\nevaluation accrued in 1996 and, as such, are now barred by the\n\nstatute of limitations.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f",

The district court rejected that claim on the ground that Miller believed he was being discriminated against at the time that the early (now time barred) events occurred.

The DOC moved for summary judgment on the grounds that many of the events Miller complained of fell outside Title VII's 300-day statute of limitations; that the events within the limitations period were insufficient to support Miller's claim of constructive discharge; and that Miller failed to show that the DOC was motivated by discriminatory animus when it refused to promote him or transfer him to a new position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion and entered judgment for the DOC. The court reasoned, first, that Miller could not recover for alleged retaliation that occurred outside the statute of limitations. It then concluded that the more recent events were either not discriminatory, or too trivial to amount to a constructive discharge. <i>See Miller v. N.H. Dep't of Corrections,</i> Civ.

As we have explained elsewhere, \"when a trial court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates its rationale clearly and convincingly, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\" <i>Cruz-Ramos v.

We apply that tenet here, and affirm largely on the basis of the district court's thorough and well-reasoned opinion. In light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <i>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121149\"><a href=\"/opinion/121149/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2061</span></a></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2002), however, we add the following comments on the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court described the underlying facts in detail. <i>See Miller,</i> slip op. at 4-32. We offer an abbreviated account here. In 1995, Miller served as the unit manager of the Hancock Unit at the New Hampshire State Prison. Among his subordinates were Officers Sherri White and Tab Colby. In the fall of 1995, Miller heard from a third party that Colby had told other officers that White had engaged in oral sex with one of the inmates. Miller passed that information along to White, who (with Miller's assistance) filed an internal complaint of sexual harassment on November 3, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 1995, the DOC's Administrator of Security issued a report sharply criticizing Miller's management of the Hancock Unit and urging that he be transferred elsewhere. A second report &#8212; which summarized the DOC investigation of White's complaint &#8212; also faulted Miller for his \"lack of leadership in directing his employees in maintaining professionalism in respecting their fellow co-workers.\" The latter report recommended that Miller be disciplined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the two reports, Miller was transferred to the Reception and Diagnostic Unit in December of 1995. Moreover, Miller's annual evaluation, issued in March of 1996, concluded that his performance the previous year had fallen \"below expectations.\" Shortly thereafter, Miller received an official letter of warning. The letter stated that \"[y]our poor judgment in dealing with your subordinate staff impacted the effective operations of the [Hancock] Unit and created dissention [sic], shift bashing and jealousy amongst staff; resulting in sexual rumors,\" and admonished Miller to take \"immediate corrective action.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned by what he viewed as unfair criticism, Miller appealed the 1996 letter of warning. In a March, 1996, memorandum to the Commissioner of the DOC, Miller argued: \"I am being used as a scapegoat and retaliated against because I reported [Colby's] misconduct, mishandling of the investigation [into White's charges] and continued pollution of the environment.\" Miller reiterated that sentiment in a second memorandum, stating: \"I feel abused and retaliated against.... I am again asking for a thorough investigation of the environment and retaliation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unpersuaded, the commissioner denied the appeal in August of 1996. Some time later, Miller learned that White had lied to him about certain matters related to her complaint. Accordingly, he chose not to pursue the next step in the appeals process &#8212; taking the matter to the Personnel Appeals Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Miller's deposition testimony, he \"was treated very well\" from August of 1996 until some time in late 1998. Miller claims that three things happened in 1998 and 1999 that triggered a new round of retaliation. First, he renewed his efforts to get the 1996 letter of warning removed from his file. Second, he learned for the first time that Colby had lied during the DOC's investigation into White's harassment charges. Miller was furious that he had not been informed of Colby's deceit, and made his views known to his superiors at the prison. Finally, Miller testified in White's Title VII trial in January of 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller points to several instances of alleged retaliation in 1998 and 1999. For our purposes, it is sufficient to focus on one. In early 1999, Miller applied for a probation and parole officer (\"PPO\") position. Of the 13 candidates interviewed, Miller had the third-highest score on the oral interview and the highest overall score (the combination of the oral score and a \"factor\" score based on seniority and past performance). The position was offered to the applicant with the highest score on the interview, but the eleventh-highest overall score. Miller believes he was denied the job because of his protected conduct in disclosing the alleged sexual harassment of White.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in March of 1999, claiming that he had been subjected to unlawful retaliation beginning in December of 1995. In due course, he filed suit in district court, again complaining of retaliation beginning with the 1995 transfer to the Reception and Diagnostic Unit. The DOC moved for summary judgment on the ground that, <i>inter alia,</i> Miller's claims with respect to retaliation in 1995 and 1996 were time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e), Miller was obligated to file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Miller filed his charge on March 22, 1999.
