Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n               Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mary A. Davis, by Appointment of the Court, with whom Tisdale\n& Davis, P.A., was on brief for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael\nK. Loucks, Acting United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          November 17, 2009\n\f             STAHL, Circuit Judge.         Defendant-Appellant Ronald Pena\n\nappeals both his conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine\n\nbase with intent to distribute and carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime.               His primary contentions are\n\nthat his conviction rested on improperly admitted fingerprint\n\nevidence and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of\n\neither charge. After a careful review, we reject Pena’s claims and\n\naffirm the district court.\n\n                   I. Facts and Procedural Background\n\n             Because Pena challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nbrought   against    him,    we   recite      the   facts     in    the      light   most\n\nfavorable to the jury’s verdict.           United States v. Garcia-Alvarez,\n\n541 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing United States v. Vázquez-\n\nBotet, 532 F.3d 37, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2008)).              As a result of a phone\n\ncall placed to the Brockton Police on August 27, 2005 at about 2:00\n\np.m., officers of the Brockton Police Department were dispatched to\n\nthe   area   of   North     Warren   Avenue     to     look    for       a     particular\n\nindividual.       Sergeant    Kenneth    Lofstrom,       who       was    in    a   marked\n\ncruiser, observing Pena walking down the street, pulled up next to\n\nPena and asked if he could speak with him.               Pena responded, \"Why?\n\nWhat’s up?\"    A second marked cruiser pulled up, and as the officer\n\ndriving that cruiser exited the vehicle, Pena took off running\n\nthrough a vacant lot on North Warren Avenue.                   He then ran across\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fWalnut Street and through a backyard at 18-20 Crowell Street before\n\nbeing apprehended by police and arrested.\n\n          Officers then searched for evidence in the area where\n\nPena had been observed running.         They found a Sidekick II cell\n\nphone as well as a green baseball cap.      Pena had been wearing such\n\na cap before fleeing the police.    The officers also found a loaded\n\nSmith & Wesson Model .357 Magnum revolver lying on the ground in\n\nplain view and, a few feet from the firearm, a clear plastic bag\n\nwith other, smaller clear plastic bags inside of it containing a\n\nwhite substance. A state laboratory analysis later determined that\n\nthe bags contained a net weight of 43.19 grams of cocaine base.1\n\n          When   Pena   was   transported    to   the   Brockton   Police\n\nDepartment for booking, officers recovered $2,781 in United States\n\ncurrency from his front right pocket.       Pena was fingerprinted and\n\nadvised of his Miranda rights.    He subsequently asked the officers\n\nif they had found his cell phone, and when Pena was shown the\n\nSidekick II phone, he identified it as his.\n\n          On December 7, 2005, the grand jury returned a two-count\n\nindictment charging Pena with possession of cocaine base with\n\nintent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (the\n\n\"drug charge\" or \"Count One\"); and carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime, and possession of a firearm\n\n\n     1\n       At trial, the jury heard testimony that the street value of\nthat amount of cocaine base, packaged in that fashion, would be\nclose to $2,100.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fin furtherance of that crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\n\n(the \"firearm charge\" or \"Count Two\").\n\n           A ten-day jury trial commenced on May 29, 2007.             At a\n\nmotions hearing prior to opening statements, Pena moved to exclude\n\ntestimony regarding fingerprint evidence, arguing that it failed to\n\nmeet the standard for expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\nThe district court provisionally denied the motion and allowed\n\nthree troopers from the Massachusetts State Police trained in\n\nfingerprint analysis to testify at trial that they compared a\n\npartial latent fingerprint found on the revolver to an inked\n\nfingerprint of Pena’s left thumb using the ACE-V method (analysis,\n\ncomparison, evaluation, and verification), and matched the latent\n\nfingerprint with the inked fingerprint to the exclusion of all\n\nothers.   Pena renewed his objection to the testimony, and the\n\ndistrict court again denied the motion in an oral ruling.\n\n           Also, Christina Rosado, a civilian witness residing at 95\n\nNorth Warren Avenue, testified that on the afternoon of August 27,\n\n2005, she looked out her kitchen window and saw a man run across\n\nher backyard, reach into the area of his right hip, and make two\n\nseparate throwing motions, as if he were throwing something away.\n\nRosado testified that she then observed the man continue to run\n\nuntil he was out of her line of sight.\n\n           On June 8, 2007, on the seventh day of trial, Pena moved\n\nfor   judgment   of   acquittal,   asserting   that   the   evidence    was\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\finsufficient to sustain a conviction on either count charged in the\n\nindictment.      The district court orally denied the motion, and on\n\nJune 14, 2007, Pena was convicted on both counts of the indictment.\n\nPena filed a post-judgment motion for acquittal on Count Two, and\n\nthat motion was also denied.           On February 26, 2008, the district\n\ncourt sentenced Pena to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling\n\n120 months as well as four years of supervised release.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           On appeal we consider the following issues: (1) whether\n\nthe   district    court   erred   in    admitting   the   testimony   of   the\n\nMassachusetts State Troopers regarding the fingerprint evidence,\n\nand (2) whether the totality of the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsupport the verdict.2\n\nA. Admissibility of Expert Testimony Regarding Fingerprint\nEvidence\n\n           We review Pena’s claim that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting expert testimony regarding fingerprint evidence for abuse\n\nof discretion.      United States v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n           Pena challenges the ACE-V method used by the state\n\ntroopers in matching the partial latent fingerprint recovered from\n\n\n\n      2\n       We also briefly consider claims of error which Pena raises\nin his pro-se Supplemental Brief regarding the court’s charging\ninstructions on reasonable doubt and the elements of the offenses\nas well as the identification of the drug type as crack for\npurposes of sentencing.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe firearm to Pena’s inked fingerprint.           Pena claims that the\n\nmethod was not scientific and that the troopers’ conclusion that\n\nhis fingerprint matched the partial latent print was based on no\n\ndiscernible standard.       Specifically, Pena argues that the ACE-V\n\nmethod   was   unreliable    because   it    involved   merely   a   visual\n\ncomparison of the two prints where the trooper conducting the\n\ninitial analysis knew that the inked print was taken from a suspect\n\nand the trooper made no diagrams, charts, or notes as part of his\n\nevaluation.    Given our standard of review, we are not persuaded.\n\n           Federal Rule of Evidence 702 permits a witness qualified\n\nas an expert to offer opinion testimony if \"(1) the testimony is\n\nbased upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the\n\nproduct of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has\n\napplied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the\n\ncase.\"   As the Supreme Court has held, it is the task of the trial\n\njudge to ensure that an expert’s testimony \"both rests on a\n\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\"            Daubert\n\nv. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993).\n\nThis involves a preliminary assessment of \"whether the reasoning or\n\nmethodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of\n\nwhether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to\n\nthe facts in issue.\"        Id. at 592-93.     The Court later extended\n\nDaubert’s application to technical and other specialized knowledge\n\nin addition to scientific testimony. See Seahorse Marine Supplies,\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fInc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 295 F.3d 68, 81 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citing Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141\n\n(1999)).\n\n             In this case, the district court declined to hold a\n\nDaubert hearing and initially denied Pena’s motion to exclude the\n\nfingerprint evidence.        On Day 6 of trial, Massachusetts State\n\nTrooper Kevin Halle gave extensive testimony about the ACE-V\n\nmethod,     his   training   and   experience       using    the   method    for\n\nfingerprint identification, and how he used the method in Pena’s\n\ncase.     He explained that after he had analyzed the partial latent\n\nprint, compared it to the prints on Pena’s fingerprint card, and\n\ndetermined that it matched Pena’s left thumb print, he had two\n\nother troopers independently verify his findings.                   Those two\n\ntroopers then testified as to their verification of the match.\n\n             Though Trooper Halle acknowledged that the Massachusetts\n\nState Police used no specific minimum number of points to confirm\n\na   fingerprint    match,    and   the   district    court    expressed     some\n\nreservation about the reliability of the testimony on that basis,3\n\nthe court ultimately decided to admit the testimony, noting that\n\n\"the case law is overwhelmingly in favor of admitting fingerprint\n\nexperts under virtually any circumstance.\" Consequently, the court\n\n\n\n      3\n       The court also expressed concern about \"the lack of uniform\nstandards, the problem that the proficiency rates, error rates are\nbasically determined without a controlled group\" and the fact that\n\"no one has ever tested the premise of uniqueness.\"\n\n                                     -7-\n\freasoned, the only way it would have considered excluding the\n\ntestimony or giving a limiting instruction \"is if there had been\n\ndata,     real        evidence        presented        about     the    limitations     of\n\nfingerprinting.\" Instead, as the court acknowledged, Pena’s motion\n\nto exclude relied on \"one article from the Fordham Law Review, and\n\nthat’s not enough to carry the weight of the exclusion motion.\"\n\n            The       district        court    did     not     abuse   its     discretion.\n\nNumerous       courts     have    found        expert     testimony      on    fingerprint\n\nidentification         based     on    the     ACE-V    method    to    be    sufficiently\n\nreliable under Daubert. See United States v. Baines, 573 F.3d 979,\n\n992 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Mitchell, 365 F.3d 215, 246\n\n(3d Cir. 2004); United States v. Sullivan, 246 F. Supp. 2d 700, 704\n\n(E.D. Ky. 2003); United States v. Llera Plaza, 188 F. Supp. 2d 549,\n\n575-76 (E.D. Pa. 2002); Commonwealth v. Patterson, 840 N.E.2d 12,\n\n32-33 (Mass. 2005) (finding ACE-V method reliable for single latent\n\nfingerprint impressions). Though acknowledging the lack of minimum\n\npoints    and    relative        subjectivity        of   certain      ACE-V    protocols,\n\nincluding that followed by the FBI, courts have nonetheless found\n\nthat    most     of     the    Daubert        factors     support      admitting   latent\n\nfingerprint identification evidence obtained pursuant to the ACE-V\n\nmethod. See Baines, 573 F.3d at 990-92; Mitchell, 365 F.3d at 241,\n\n246.     As this court has stated, against such a backdrop, \"it is\n\ndifficult to discern any abuse of discretion\" when the district\n\ncourt decides to admit expert testimony that relies on the ACE-V\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fmethod.      United States v. Mahone, 453 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nThe same holds true in this case.4\n\nB. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n              We review preserved challenges to sufficiency of the\n\nevidence de novo.      United States v. Azubike, 564 F.3d 59, 64 (1st\n\nCir.       2009).    We   examine   the   evidence   \"both   direct   and\n\ncircumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and\n\ndecide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences\n\ndrawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged\n\ncrime.\" United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (citing United States v. Fenton, 367 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Pena also argues that the district court erroneously shifted\nto him the burden of refuting the reliability of the expert\ntestimony. Though somewhat vague, Pena’s argument appears to be\nthat once the trial judge acknowledged the questionable nature of\nthe evidence, she \"abdicated her role\" by not holding a Daubert\nhearing and instead requiring Pena to produce data and experts to\ndemonstrate why the evidence should not be admitted. This argument\nalso fails.\n     A district court does not abuse its discretion by dispensing\nwith a Daubert hearing if no novel challenge is raised.        See\nMitchell, 365 F.3d at 246. Here, Pena raised no new favorable case\nlaw or expert testimony to challenge the admissibility of the\nfingerprint identification evidence, instead citing only a single\n2002 student note from the Fordham Law Review.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f1. The Drug Charge5\n\n          In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena challenges the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence as to Count One of the indictment,\n\nwhich charged him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine\n\nbase in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).6   Pena claims that the\n\ntestimony of Ms. Rosado was \"uncorroborated and unsubstantiated\"\n\nand that \"no other evidence showed that [he] possessed a firearm or\n\nany drugs, at any time at all.\"   According to Pena, the only other\n\nevidence relied upon by the government was his sudden flight from\n\npolice.   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, as we must, we find Pena’s argument unavailing.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The government argues that Pena waived his sufficiency\nchallenge as to Count One by failing to renew his motion for\njudgment of acquittal at the close of evidence and by also failing\nto contest his conviction as to that count in his post-verdict\nmotion. However, a review of the trial transcript indicates that\nPena appears to have renewed his motion after both parties rested,\nso his motion was not waived. Whatever the standard of review,\nPena's claim fails as there is more than sufficient evidence to\nsupport his conviction.\n     6\n       In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence,\nPena appears to raise a separate argument that the police did not\nhave grounds to stop or arrest him. Pena claims that the anonymous\ntip on which the Brockton Police were acting when they approached\nhim did not exhibit sufficient indicia of reliability under Florida\nv. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), and his subsequent actions, namely\nhis flight from the police, did not amount to reasonable suspicion\nthat he was engaged in criminal activity. Pena never made this\nargument to the district court in a motion to suppress, and it is\ntherefore deemed waived. See United States v. Santos Batista, 239\nF.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Failure to raise suppression\narguments before trial 'shall constitute waiver thereof.'\" (quoting\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(f))).\n\n                               -10-\n\f                  Ms.   Rosado    testified    that   on   the   date    and    time   in\n\nquestion, she observed a man matching Pena’s general description7\n\nrun across her backyard, reach into his right hip area, and make\n\ntwo separate throwing motions.                She recounted the same to officers\n\nsearching the area minutes after the incident.                   The officers then\n\nfound the cell phone, firearm, and plastic bag containing drugs\n\nalong the flight path.              Pena admitted the phone was his, and a\n\nfingerprint match was made as to the firearm.                           Based on this\n\nevidence, a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat       Pena    possessed      the   bag   containing    cocaine      base    before\n\ndiscarding it (along with the firearm and cell phone) while fleeing\n\nthe police.8\n\n2. The Firearm Charge\n\n                  Pena also argues that the government did not produce\n\nsufficient evidence to support his conviction on Count Two of the\n\nindictment, which charged him with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\n\n(\"Section 924(c)\").              Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) prescribes a\n\n\n\n       7\n      Ms. Rosado testified that the man she saw looked to be about\ntwenty years old, with dark skin. She stated that he was chubby,\nhad black hair in braids, and was wearing black pants and a white\nshort-sleeve shirt.    One of the officers testified that the\ndefendant was wearing a white tee shirt and blue jeans -- a\ndistinction without a difference.\n       8\n       The jury could also easily have concluded that the drugs\nwere intended for distribution. The jury heard testimony that such\na large amount (43.19 grams), packaged in individual sandwich bags\nand with a street value of over $2,100, would ordinarily be\npossessed by a dealer rather than an end user.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fmandatory minimum sentence for any person who \"during and in\n\nrelation to any . . . drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries\n\na firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\n\nfirearm.\"   We focus here on the possession offense.9   To obtain a\n\nconviction, the government must prove that the defendant: 1)\n\ncommitted a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a\n\nfirearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug\n\ntrafficking crime.   United States v. Marin, 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).    At oral argument, Pena’s counsel conceded that the\n\nfirst two elements of the charge were met: Pena was convicted of a\n\ndrug trafficking crime, and he was carrying a gun when approached\n\nby police.10    However, Pena challenges the sufficiency of the\n\n\n     9\n        Congress added the \"possess[ion]\" \"in furtherance of\"\nlanguage to the statute in 1998 in response to Bailey v. United\nStates, 516 U.S. 137 (1995), where the Supreme Court held that\nunder the prior version of the statute, \"the Government must show\nthat the defendant actively employed the firearm during and in\nrelation to the predicate crime.\" See United States v. Grace, 367\nF.3d 29, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Bailey, 516 U.S. at 150)\n(emphasis added).    The statute also continues to prescribe a\nviolation for the acts of 1) using or 2) carrying a firearm \"during\nand in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime. As Pena was charged\nboth with \"carry[ing]\" a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the\ndrug offense and \"possess[ing]\" a firearm \"in furtherance of\" that\noffense, the government could have obtained a conviction under\neither avenue of proof. See United States v. Lott, 310 F.3d 1231,\n1246 (10th Cir. 2002). As we find sufficient evidence to support\na jury finding that Pena possessed the firearm in furtherance of\nhis possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, we need not\naddress whether the government also proved that he carried a\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense.\n     10\n        In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena states that his\ncounsel’s concession on this point contradicted his own position.\nHe states that he \"negates any inference whatsoever that suggests\n\n                               -12-\n\fevidence as to the \"in furtherance of\" element, arguing that the\n\ngovernment never established a link between the gun and the drug\n\ntrafficking crime.     We reject this claim.\n\n          To   prove   that    a   defendant   possessed   a   firearm   \"in\n\nfurtherance\" of the predicate drug crime, the government must show\n\na sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that\n\nthe firearm advances or promotes the drug crime.           Marin, 523 F.3d\n\nat 27 (citing Grace, 367 F.3d at 34-35; United States v. Garner,\n\n338 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 2003)).          The mere presence of a firearm\n\nin the area where the drug offense occurred is insufficient.\n\nGrace, 367 F.3d at 35.        In assessing whether a sufficient nexus\n\nexists, we consider several factors: whether the firearm was\n\nloaded, whether the firearm was easily accessible, the proximity of\n\nthe firearm to the drugs, and the surrounding circumstances.\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 387, 399-400 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(citing United States v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).\n\n          In this case, each of these factors supports a conclusion\n\nthat Pena possessed the gun \"in furtherance of\" the drug crime.\n\nThe .357 Magnum was loaded, and there was circumstantial evidence\n\n\nhe threw the firearm and drugs allegedly recovered on [the day in\nquestion].\" Though Pena denies that the firearm recovered by the\npolice was ever in his possession, the fingerprint evidence taken\nfrom the firearm, the fact that the gun was found along the flight\npath, and the testimony of Ms. Rosado were sufficient to allow a\nreasonable jury to conclude that Pena had, in fact, been in\npossession of the revolver when initially stopped by police.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthat Pena was carrying both it and the drugs on his person.     Cf.\n\nGrace, 367 F.3d at 31 (affirming conviction where unloaded gun was\n\nkept under a bed in a drawer that was blocked by a duffel bag,\n\ntrash can, and box of books, no ammunition was in the house, and\n\ndrugs were stored in a different room than the gun).\n\n          In addition to this evidence, the government presented\n\nevidence that could lead a rational jury to infer that Pena was\n\ncarrying the firearm to protect his drugs and drug proceeds, a\n\npurpose that we have found establishes the required nexus between\n\nthe drugs and the firearm.   Grace, 367 F.3d at 35 (citing United\n\nStates v. Luciano, 329 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003)).   Pena was carrying\n\n$2,781 in cash at the time of his arrest, and there was evidence\n\nthat the drugs he discarded had a street value of $2,100.   The jury\n\nalso heard evidence that the area where Pena was approached and\n\neventually arrested was a high-crime area in which numerous drug\n\nand gun crimes and robberies had taken place.\n\n          This evidence was sufficient to convince a rational jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Pena possessed the .357 Magnum \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime.\n\nC. Other Matters\n\n          In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena mounts a potpourri\n\nof arguments, none of which were raised below.     We thus briefly\n\nconsider each, reviewing only for plain error.    United States v.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fGarcia-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Carvell, 74 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n          First,    Pena   argues   that   the   court’s   instruction   on\n\nreasonable doubt confused jurors and allowed the jury to return a\n\nconviction based on a finding that Pena was \"probably guilty\"\n\nrather than guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.          Pena cites only a\n\nsmall portion of the court’s reasonable doubt instruction, which\n\ncomprises over two pages of the trial transcript.          In viewing the\n\ninstruction as a whole, we find that it did not mislead the jury as\n\nto the government’s burden of proof.             The instruction made it\n\neminently clear that the jury had to find Pena guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n          Pena also contends that the court erroneously instructed\n\nthe jury with regard to the term \"use,\" citing Bailey v. United\n\nStates, 516 U.S. 137 (1995), for the proposition that \"use for\n\npurposes of a § 924(c) violation means to actively deploy or\n\ndischarge and not mere possession or presence.\"         (emphasis in pro-\n\nse Supplemental Brief).     Pena suggests that by employing the term\n\n\"use,\" the court constructively amended the indictment because the\n\nindictment did not charge Pena with \"use\" of a firearm.\n\n          While the court did, in fact, use the term \"use\" once in\n\nthe context of its instruction on the \"in furtherance of\" element,\n\n\"use\" of a firearm was not an issue in this case, and in any event\n\nthe court’s use of that term did not prejudice Pena.            There was\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fample evidence that Pena possessed a firearm in furtherance of the\n\ndrug crime, and even if the jury thought it had to find \"use,\" that\n\nwould have been a benefit not a detriment to Pena.11\n\n                Finally, Pena argues that he was improperly sentenced as\n\na crack offender, attempting to draw a distinction between the\n\nterms        \"crack\"   and   \"cocaine   base,\"   which   were   used   somewhat\n\ninterchangeably by the court and the government at trial and\n\nsentencing.        However, for the purpose of the statute under which\n\nPena was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii),12 the distinction\n\n\n        11\n       Pena raises numerous additional challenges to the court’s\ninstructions as to each count, each of which is without merit.\nWith regard to Count One, possession with intent to distribute,\nPena contends that the district court defined \"to possess\" without\ndefining \"to distribute\" or \"trafficking.\" It is unclear how the\ndefinition of trafficking is relevant to the elements of Count One,\nand the court did define the term \"to distribute.\"       Pena next\nargues that the court constructively amended the indictment by\nusing the term \"crack\" in the verdict slip when the indictment\ncharged him with possession with intent to distribute \"cocaine\nbase.\" Pena’s claim is incorrect because the verdict slip in fact\nuses the term \"cocaine base,\" not \"crack.\"\n     Additionally, Pena contends that the court gave the jury\ncontradictory instructions as to whether or not the government was\nrequired to prove what type of drug was possessed. Here, too, Pena\nis incorrect. The court specifically instructed the jury that the\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance\nactually possessed was cocaine base.\n     Regarding Count Two, Pena argues that the court failed to\nexplain the first element of the Section 924(c) offense and to\ndefine the term \"trafficking\" within that element. Again, Pena’s\nclaim is without foundation. The court did, in fact, explain that\nthe first element of Count Two was that Pena committed a drug\ntrafficking offense and further instructed that the crime of\npossessing cocaine base with intent to distribute charged in Count\nOne was a \"drug trafficking crime\" for the purpose of the statute.\n        12\n       Though the district court did not note the statute or its\nterms on the record at sentencing, the indictment specifically\n\n                                        -16-\n\fbetween   crack   and   cocaine   base    is   meaningless.   Unlike   the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) does not define \"cocaine\n\nbase,\" and we have held that the term, as used in the statute,\n\nincludes all forms of cocaine base, including but not limited to\n\ncrack.    United States v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (citing United States v. Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (opinion on panel rehearing)). Consequently, regardless\n\nof whether the government proved that Pena possessed 43.19 grams of\n\ncrack or 43.19 grams of some other form of cocaine base, his\n\nsentence under the statute would have been the same.             As Pena\n\nadmits that the government presented \"ample evidence\" that the\n\nsubstance attributed to him was cocaine base, the court clearly did\n\nnot commit plain error in sentencing him to the mandatory minimum\n\nprescribed by the statute.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we affirm Pena’s\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\ncharged Pena with a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii),\npossession with intent to distribute \"5 grams or more of a mixture\nor substance . . . which contains cocaine base.\"\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

Loucks, Acting United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Ronald Pena appeals both his conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. His primary contentions are that his conviction rested on improperly admitted fingerprint evidence and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of either charge. After a careful review, we reject Pena's claims and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts and Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>Because Pena challenges the sufficiency of the evidence brought against him, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Garcia-Alvarez,</i> 541 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing <i>United States v. Vazquez-Botet,</i> 532 F.3d 37, 42-43 (1st Cir.2008)). As a result of a phone call placed to the Brockton Police on August 27, 2005 at about 2:00 p.m., officers of the Brockton Police Department were dispatched to the area of North Warren Avenue to look for a particular individual. Sergeant Kenneth Lofstrom, who was in a marked cruiser, observing Pena walking down the street, pulled up next to Pena and asked if he could speak with him. Pena responded, \"Why? What's up?\" A second marked cruiser pulled up, and as the officer driving that cruiser exited the vehicle, Pena took off running through a vacant lot on North Warren Avenue. He then ran across Walnut Street and through a backyard at 18-20 Crowell Street before being apprehended by police and arrested.</p>\n<p>Officers then searched for evidence in the area where Pena had been observed running. They found a Sidekick II cell phone as well as a green baseball cap. Pena had been wearing such a cap before fleeing the police. The officers also found a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson Model .357 Magnum revolver lying on the ground in plain view and, a few feet from the firearm, a clear plastic bag with other, smaller clear plastic bags inside of it containing a white substance. A state laboratory analysis later determined that the bags contained a net weight of 43.19 grams of cocaine base.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>When Pena was transported to the Brockton Police Department for booking, officers recovered $2,781 in United States currency from his front right pocket. Pena was fingerprinted and advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. He subsequently asked the officers if they had found his cell phone, and when Pena was shown the Sidekick II phone, he identified it as his.</p>\n<p>On December 7, 2005, the grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Pena with possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (the \"drug charge\" or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> \"Count One\"); and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of that crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (the \"firearm charge\" or \"Count Two\").</p>\n<p>A ten-day jury trial commenced on May 29, 2007. At a motions hearing prior to opening statements, Pena moved to exclude testimony regarding fingerprint evidence, arguing that it failed to meet the standard for expert testimony under Fed. R.Evid. 702. The district court provisionally denied the motion and allowed three troopers from the Massachusetts State Police trained in fingerprint analysis to testify at trial that they compared a partial latent fingerprint found on the revolver to an inked fingerprint of Pena's left thumb using the ACE-V method (analysis, comparison, evaluation, and verification), and matched the latent fingerprint with the inked fingerprint to the exclusion of all others. Pena renewed his objection to the testimony, and the district court again denied the motion in an oral ruling.</p>\n<p>Also, Christina Rosado, a civilian witness residing at 95 North Warren Avenue, testified that on the afternoon of August 27, 2005, she looked out her kitchen window and saw a man run across her backyard, reach into the area of his right hip, and make two separate throwing motions, as if he were throwing something away. Rosado testified that she then observed the man continue to run until he was out of her line of sight.</p>\n<p>On June 8, 2007, on the seventh day of trial, Pena moved for judgment of acquittal, asserting that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on either count charged in the indictment. The district court orally denied the motion, and on June 14, 2007, Pena was convicted on both counts of the indictment. Pena filed a post-judgment motion for acquittal on Count Two, and that motion was also denied. On February 26, 2008, the district court sentenced Pena to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling 120 months as well as four years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal we consider the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in admitting the testimony of the Massachusetts State Troopers regarding the fingerprint evidence, and (2) whether the totality of the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Admissibility of Expert Testimony Regarding Fingerprint Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review Pena's claim that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony regarding fingerprint evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Pena challenges the ACE-V method used by the state troopers in matching the partial latent fingerprint recovered from the firearm to Pena's inked fingerprint. Pena claims that the method was not scientific and that the troopers' conclusion that his fingerprint matched the partial latent print was based on no discernible standard. Specifically, Pena argues that the ACE-V method was unreliable because it involved merely a visual comparison of the two prints where the trooper conducting the initial analysis knew that the inked print was taken from a suspect and the trooper made no diagrams, charts, or notes as part of his evaluation. Given our standard of review, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> Federal Rule of Evidence 702 permits a witness qualified as an expert to offer opinion testimony if \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" As the Supreme Court has held, it is the task of the trial judge to ensure that an expert's testimony \"both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\" <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). This involves a preliminary assessment of \"whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786. The Court later extended <i>Daubert's</i> application to technical and other specialized knowledge in addition to scientific testimony. <i>See </i><i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> 295 F.3d 68, 81 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael,</i> 526 U.S. 137, 141, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999)).</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court declined to hold a <i>Daubert</i> hearing and initially denied Pena's motion to exclude the fingerprint evidence. On Day 6 of trial, Massachusetts State Trooper Kevin Halle gave extensive testimony about the ACE-V method, his training and experience using the method for fingerprint identification, and how he used the method in Pena's case. He explained that after he had analyzed the partial latent print, compared it to the prints on Pena's fingerprint card, and determined that it matched Pena's left thumb print, he had two other troopers independently verify his findings. Those two troopers then testified as to their verification of the match.</p>\n<p>Though Trooper Halle acknowledged that the Massachusetts State Police used no specific minimum number of points to confirm a fingerprint match, and the district court expressed some reservation about the reliability of the testimony on that basis,<sup>[3]</sup> the court ultimately decided to admit the testimony, noting that \"the case law is overwhelmingly in favor of admitting fingerprint experts under virtually any circumstance.\" Consequently, the court reasoned, the only way it would have considered excluding the testimony or giving a limiting instruction \"is if there had been data, real evidence presented about the limitations of fingerprinting.\" Instead, as the court acknowledged, Pena's motion to exclude relied on \"one article from the Fordham Law Review, and that's not enough to carry the weight of the exclusion motion.\"</p>\n<p>The district court did not abuse its discretion. Numerous courts have found expert testimony on fingerprint identification based on the ACE-V method to be sufficiently reliable under <i>Daubert. See </i><i>United States v. Baines,</i> 573 F.3d 979, 992 (10th Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d 215, 246 (3d Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Sullivan,</i> 246 F.Supp.2d 700, 704 (E.D.Ky.2003); <i>United States v. Llera Plaza,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d 549, 575-76 (E.D.Pa.2002); <i>Commonwealth v. Patterson,</i> 445 Mass. 626, 840 N.E.2d 12, 32-33 (2005) (finding ACE-V method reliable for single latent fingerprint impressions). Though acknowledging the lack of minimum points and relative subjectivity of certain ACE-V protocols, including that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> followed by the FBI, courts have nonetheless found that most of the <i>Daubert</i> factors support admitting latent fingerprint identification evidence obtained pursuant to the ACE-V method. <i>See </i><i>Baines,</i> 573 F.3d at 990-92; <i>Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d at 241, 246. As this court has stated, against such a backdrop, \"it is difficult to discern any abuse of discretion\" when the district court decides to admit expert testimony that relies on the ACE-V method. <i>United States v. Mahone,</i> 453 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.2006). The same holds true in this case.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review preserved challenges to sufficiency of the evidence de novo. <i>United States v. Azubike,</i> 564 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2009). We examine the evidence \"both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\" <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>United States v. Fenton,</i> 367 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Drug Charge<sup>[5]</sup></h2>\n<p>In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to Count One of the indictment, which charged him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).<sup>[6]</sup> Pena claims that the testimony of Ms. Rosado was \"uncorroborated and unsubstantiated\" and that \"no other evidence showed that [he] possessed a firearm or any drugs, at any time at all.\" According to Pena, the only other evidence relied upon by the government was his sudden flight from police. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as we must, we find Pena's argument unavailing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> Ms. Rosado testified that on the date and time in question, she observed a man matching Pena's general description<sup>[7]</sup> run across her backyard, reach into his right hip area, and make two separate throwing motions. She recounted the same to officers searching the area minutes after the incident. The officers then found the cell phone, firearm, and plastic bag containing drugs along the flight path. Pena admitted the phone was his, and a fingerprint match was made as to the firearm. Based on this evidence, a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Pena possessed the bag containing cocaine base before discarding it (along with the firearm and cell phone) while fleeing the police.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Firearm Charge</h2>\n<p>Pena also argues that the government did not produce sufficient evidence to support his conviction on Count Two of the indictment, which charged him with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (\"Section 924(c)\"). Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence for any person who \"during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\" We focus here on the possession offense.<sup>[9]</sup> To obtain a conviction, the government must prove that the defendant: 1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime. <i>United States v. Marin,</i> 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2008). At oral argument, Pena's counsel conceded that the first two elements of the charge were met: Pena was convicted of a drug trafficking crime, and he was carrying a gun when approached by police.<sup>[10]</sup> However, Pena <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to the \"in furtherance of\" element, arguing that the government never established a link between the gun and the drug trafficking crime. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p>To prove that a defendant possessed a firearm \"in furtherance\" of the predicate drug crime, the government must show a sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime. <i>Marin,</i> 523 F.3d at 27 (citing <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 34-35; <i>United States v. Garner,</i> 338 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.2003)). The mere presence of a firearm in the area where the drug offense occurred is insufficient. <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35. In assessing whether a sufficient nexus exists, we consider several factors: whether the firearm was loaded, whether the firearm was easily accessible, the proximity of the firearm to the drugs, and the surrounding circumstances. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d 387, 399-400 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>United States v. Carlos Cruz,</i> 352 F.3d 499, 509 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>In this case, each of these factors supports a conclusion that Pena possessed the gun \"in furtherance of\" the drug crime. The .357 Magnum was loaded, and there was circumstantial evidence that Pena was carrying both it and the drugs on his person. <i>Cf. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 31 (affirming conviction where unloaded gun was kept under a bed in a drawer that was blocked by a duffel bag, trash can, and box of books, no ammunition was in the house, and drugs were stored in a different room than the gun).</p>\n<p>In addition to this evidence, the government presented evidence that could lead a rational jury to infer that Pena was carrying the firearm to protect his drugs and drug proceeds, a purpose that we have found establishes the required nexus between the drugs and the firearm. <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35 (citing <i>United States v. Luciano,</i> 329 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2003)). Pena was carrying $2,781 in cash at the time of his arrest, and there was evidence that the drugs he discarded had a street value of $2,100. The jury also heard evidence that the area where Pena was approached and eventually arrested was a high-crime area in which numerous drug and gun crimes and robberies had taken place.</p>\n<p>This evidence was sufficient to convince a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Pena possessed the .357 Magnum \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Other Matters</h2>\n<p>In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena mounts a potpourri of arguments, none of which were raised below. We thus briefly consider each, reviewing only for plain error. <i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>United States v. Carvell,</i> 74 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p>First, Pena argues that the court's instruction on reasonable doubt confused jurors and allowed the jury to return a conviction based on a finding that Pena was \"<i>probably</i> guilty\" rather than guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Pena cites only a small portion of the court's reasonable doubt instruction, which comprises over two pages of the trial transcript. In viewing the instruction as a whole, we find that it did not mislead the jury as to the government's burden of proof. The instruction made it eminently clear that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> jury had to find Pena guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Pena also contends that the court erroneously instructed the jury with regard to the term \"use,\" citing <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), for the proposition that \"<i>use</i> for purposes of a § 924(c) violation means to actively <i>deploy</i> or <i>discharge</i> and not mere possession or presence.\" (emphasis in pro-se Supplemental Brief). Pena suggests that by employing the term \"use,\" the court constructively amended the indictment because the indictment did not charge Pena with \"use\" of a firearm.</p>\n<p>While the court did, in fact, use the term \"use\" once in the context of its instruction on the \"in furtherance of\" element, \"use\" of a firearm was not an issue in this case, and in any event the court's use of that term did not prejudice Pena. There was ample evidence that Pena possessed a firearm in furtherance of the drug crime, and even if the jury thought it had to find \"use,\" that would have been a benefit not a detriment to Pena.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, Pena argues that he was improperly sentenced as a crack offender, attempting to draw a distinction between the terms \"crack\" and \"cocaine base,\" which were used somewhat interchangeably by the court and the government at trial and sentencing. However, for the purpose of the statute under which Pena was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii),<sup>[12]</sup> the distinction between crack and cocaine base is meaningless. Unlike the Sentencing Guidelines, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) does not define \"cocaine base,\" and we have held that the term, as used in the statute, includes <i>all</i> forms of cocaine base, including but not limited to crack. <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v. Lopez-Gil,</i> 965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir.1992) (opinion on panel rehearing)). Consequently, regardless of whether the government proved that Pena possessed 43.19 grams of crack or 43.19 grams of some other form of cocaine base, his sentence under the statute would have been the same. As Pena admits that the government presented \"ample evidence\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> that the substance attributed to him was cocaine base, the court clearly did not commit plain error in sentencing him to the mandatory minimum prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we affirm Pena's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At trial, the jury heard testimony that the street value of that amount of cocaine base, packaged in that fashion, would be close to $2,100.</p>\n<p>[2]  We also briefly consider claims of error which Pena raises in his pro-se Supplemental Brief regarding the court's charging instructions on reasonable doubt and the elements of the offenses as well as the identification of the drug type as crack for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p>[3]  The court also expressed concern about \"the lack of uniform standards, the problem that the proficiency rates, error rates are basically determined without a controlled group\" and the fact that \"no one has ever tested the premise of uniqueness.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Pena also argues that the district court erroneously shifted to him the burden of refuting the reliability of the expert testimony. Though somewhat vague, Pena's argument appears to be that once the trial judge acknowledged the questionable nature of the evidence, she \"abdicated her role\" by not holding a <i>Daubert</i> hearing and instead requiring Pena to produce data and experts to demonstrate why the evidence should not be admitted. This argument also fails.\n</p>\n<p>A district court does not abuse its discretion by dispensing with a <i>Daubert</i> hearing if no novel challenge is raised. <i>See </i><i>Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d at 246. Here, Pena raised no new favorable case law or expert testimony to challenge the admissibility of the fingerprint identification evidence, instead citing only a single 2002 student note from the Fordham Law Review.</p>\n<p>[5]  The government argues that Pena waived his sufficiency challenge as to Count One by failing to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence and by also failing to contest his conviction as to that count in his post-verdict motion. However, a review of the trial transcript indicates that Pena appears to have renewed his motion after both parties rested, so his motion was not waived. Whatever the standard of review, Pena's claim fails as there is more than sufficient evidence to support his conviction.</p>\n<p>[6]  In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, Pena appears to raise a separate argument that the police did not have grounds to stop or arrest him. Pena claims that the anonymous tip on which the Brockton Police were acting when they approached him did not exhibit sufficient indicia of reliability under <i>Florida v. J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. 266, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000), and his subsequent actions, namely his flight from the police, did not amount to reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity. Pena never made this argument to the district court in a motion to suppress, and it is therefore deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santos Batista,</i> 239 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Failure to raise suppression arguments before trial `shall constitute waiver thereof.'\" (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f))).</p>\n<p>[7]  Ms. Rosado testified that the man she saw looked to be about twenty years old, with dark skin. She stated that he was chubby, had black hair in braids, and was wearing black pants and a white short-sleeve shirt. One of the officers testified that the defendant was wearing a white tee shirt and blue jeans  a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p>[8]  The jury could also easily have concluded that the drugs were intended for distribution. The jury heard testimony that such a large amount (43.19 grams), packaged in individual sandwich bags and with a street value of over $2,100, would ordinarily be possessed by a dealer rather than an end user.</p>\n<p>[9]  Congress added the \"possess[ion]\" \"in furtherance of\" language to the statute in 1998 in response to <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), where the Supreme Court held that under the prior version of the statute, \"the Government must show that the defendant <i>actively employed</i> the firearm during and in relation to the predicate crime.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d 29, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting <i>Bailey,</i> 516 U.S. at 150, 116 S.Ct. 501) (emphasis added). The statute also continues to prescribe a violation for the acts of 1) using or 2) carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime. As Pena was charged both with \"carry[ing]\" a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the drug offense and \"possess[ing]\" a firearm \"in furtherance of\" that offense, the government could have obtained a conviction under either avenue of proof. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lott,</i> 310 F.3d 1231, 1246 (10th Cir.2002). As we find sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Pena possessed the firearm in furtherance of his possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, we need not address whether the government also proved that he carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p>[10]  In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena states that his counsel's concession on this point contradicted his own position. He states that he \"negates any inference whatsoever that suggests he threw the firearm and drugs allegedly recovered on [the day in question].\" Though Pena denies that the firearm recovered by the police was ever in his possession, the fingerprint evidence taken from the firearm, the fact that the gun was found along the flight path, and the testimony of Ms. Rosado were sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Pena had, in fact, been in possession of the revolver when initially stopped by police.</p>\n<p>[11]  Pena raises numerous additional challenges to the court's instructions as to each count, each of which is without merit. With regard to Count One, possession with intent to distribute, Pena contends that the district court defined \"to possess\" without defining \"to distribute\" or \"trafficking.\" It is unclear how the definition of trafficking is relevant to the elements of Count One, and the court did define the term \"to distribute.\" Pena next argues that the court constructively amended the indictment by using the term \"crack\" in the verdict slip when the indictment charged him with possession with intent to distribute \"cocaine base.\" Pena's claim is incorrect because the verdict slip in fact uses the term \"cocaine base,\" not \"crack.\"\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, Pena contends that the court gave the jury contradictory instructions as to whether or not the government was required to prove what type of drug was possessed. Here, too, Pena is incorrect. The court specifically instructed the jury that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance actually possessed was cocaine base.</p>\n<p>Regarding Count Two, Pena argues that the court failed to explain the first element of the Section 924(c) offense and to define the term \"trafficking\" within that element. Again, Pena's claim is without foundation. The court did, in fact, explain that the first element of Count Two was that Pena committed a drug trafficking offense and further instructed that the crime of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute charged in Count One was a \"drug trafficking crime\" for the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>[12]  Though the district court did not note the statute or its terms on the record at sentencing, the indictment specifically charged Pena with a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii), possession with intent to distribute \"5 grams or more of a mixture or substance . . . which contains cocaine base.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

After a careful review, we reject Pena's claims and affirm the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Facts and Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>Because Pena challenges the sufficiency of the evidence brought against him, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Garcia-Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203467\"><a href=\"/opinion/203467/united-states-v-garcia-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing <i>United States v. Vazquez-Botet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425795\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425795/united-states-v-vazquez-botet/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 42-43 (1st Cir.2008)). As a result of a phone call placed to the Brockton Police on August 27, 2005 at about 2:00 p.m., officers of the Brockton Police Department were dispatched to the area of North Warren Avenue to look for a particular individual. Sergeant Kenneth Lofstrom, who was in a marked cruiser, observing Pena walking down the street, pulled up next to Pena and asked if he could speak with him. Pena responded, \"Why? What's up?\" A second marked cruiser pulled up, and as the officer driving that cruiser exited the vehicle, Pena took off running through a vacant lot on North Warren Avenue. He then ran across Walnut Street and through a backyard at 18-20 Crowell Street before being apprehended by police and arrested.</p>\n<p>Officers then searched for evidence in the area where Pena had been observed running. They found a Sidekick II cell phone as well as a green baseball cap. Pena had been wearing such a cap before fleeing the police. The officers also found a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson Model .357 Magnum revolver lying on the ground in plain view and, a few feet from the firearm, a clear plastic bag with other, smaller clear plastic bags inside of it containing a white substance. A state laboratory analysis later determined that the bags contained a net weight of 43.19 grams of cocaine base.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>When Pena was transported to the Brockton Police Department for booking, officers recovered $2,781 in United States currency from his front right pocket. Pena was fingerprinted and advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. He subsequently asked the officers if they had found his cell phone, and when Pena was shown the Sidekick II phone, he identified it as his.</p>\n<p>On December 7, 2005, the grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Pena with possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (the \"drug charge\" or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> \"Count One\"); and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of that crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (the \"firearm charge\" or \"Count Two\").</p>\n<p>A ten-day jury trial commenced on May 29, 2007. At a motions hearing prior to opening statements, Pena moved to exclude testimony regarding fingerprint evidence, arguing that it failed to meet the standard for expert testimony under Fed. R.Evid. 702. The district court provisionally denied the motion and allowed three troopers from the Massachusetts State Police trained in fingerprint analysis to testify at trial that they compared a partial latent fingerprint found on the revolver to an inked fingerprint of Pena's left thumb using the ACE-V method (analysis, comparison, evaluation, and verification), and matched the latent fingerprint with the inked fingerprint to the exclusion of all others. Pena renewed his objection to the testimony, and the district court again denied the motion in an oral ruling.</p>\n<p>Also, Christina Rosado, a civilian witness residing at 95 North Warren Avenue, testified that on the afternoon of August 27, 2005, she looked out her kitchen window and saw a man run across her backyard, reach into the area of his right hip, and make two separate throwing motions, as if he were throwing something away. Rosado testified that she then observed the man continue to run until he was out of her line of sight.</p>\n<p>On June 8, 2007, on the seventh day of trial, Pena moved for judgment of acquittal, asserting that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on either count charged in the indictment. The district court orally denied the motion, and on June 14, 2007, Pena was convicted on both counts of the indictment. Pena filed a post-judgment motion for acquittal on Count Two, and that motion was also denied. On February 26, 2008, the district court sentenced Pena to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling 120 months as well as four years of supervised release.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal we consider the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in admitting the testimony of the Massachusetts State Troopers regarding the fingerprint evidence, and (2) whether the totality of the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Admissibility of Expert Testimony Regarding Fingerprint Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review Pena's claim that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony regarding fingerprint evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200085\"><a href=\"/opinion/200085/united-states-v-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Pena challenges the ACE-V method used by the state troopers in matching the partial latent fingerprint recovered from the firearm to Pena's inked fingerprint. Pena claims that the method was not scientific and that the troopers' conclusion that his fingerprint matched the partial latent print was based on no discernible standard. Specifically, Pena argues that the ACE-V method was unreliable because it involved merely a visual comparison of the two prints where the trooper conducting the initial analysis knew that the inked print was taken from a suspect and the trooper made no diagrams, charts, or notes as part of his evaluation. Given our standard of review, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> Federal Rule of Evidence 702 permits a witness qualified as an expert to offer opinion testimony if \"(1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" As the Supreme Court has held, it is the task of the trial judge to ensure that an expert's testimony \"both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\" <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 597, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court later extended <i>Daubert's</i> application to technical and other specialized knowledge in addition to scientific testimony. <i>See </i><i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200019\"><a href=\"/opinion/200019/supplies-inc-v-pr-sun-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span> (1999)).</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court declined to hold a <i>Daubert</i> hearing and initially denied Pena's motion to exclude the fingerprint evidence. On Day 6 of trial, Massachusetts State Trooper Kevin Halle gave extensive testimony about the ACE-V method, his training and experience using the method for fingerprint identification, and how he used the method in Pena's case. He explained that after he had analyzed the partial latent print, compared it to the prints on Pena's fingerprint card, and determined that it matched Pena's left thumb print, he had two other troopers independently verify his findings. Those two troopers then testified as to their verification of the match.</p>\n<p>Though Trooper Halle acknowledged that the Massachusetts State Police used no specific minimum number of points to confirm a fingerprint match, and the district court expressed some reservation about the reliability of the testimony on that basis,<sup>[3]</sup> the court ultimately decided to admit the testimony, noting that \"the case law is overwhelmingly in favor of admitting fingerprint experts under virtually any circumstance.\" Consequently, the court reasoned, the only way it would have considered excluding the testimony or giving a limiting instruction \"is if there had been data, real evidence presented about the limitations of fingerprinting.\" Instead, as the court acknowledged, Pena's motion to exclude relied on \"one article from the Fordham Law Review, and that's not enough to carry the weight of the exclusion motion.\"</p>\n<p>The district court did not abuse its discretion. Numerous courts have found expert testimony on fingerprint identification based on the ACE-V method to be sufficiently reliable under <i>Daubert. See </i><i>United States v. Baines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172432\"><a href=\"/opinion/172432/united-states-v-baines/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 992 (10th Cir.2009); <i>United States v.

Though acknowledging the lack of minimum points and relative subjectivity of certain ACE-V protocols, including that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> followed by the FBI, courts have nonetheless found that most of the <i>Daubert</i> factors support admitting latent fingerprint identification evidence obtained pursuant to the ACE-V method. <i>See </i><i>Baines,</i> 573 F.3d at 990-92; <i>Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d at 241, 246. As this court has stated, against such a backdrop, \"it is difficult to discern any abuse of discretion\" when the district court decides to admit expert testimony that relies on the ACE-V method. <i>United States v.

The same holds true in this case.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>We review preserved challenges to sufficiency of the evidence de novo. <i>United States v. Azubike,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203791\"><a href=\"/opinion/203791/united-states-v-azubike/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2009). We examine the evidence \"both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\" <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203469\"><a href=\"/opinion/203469/united-states-v-cruz-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>United States v.

The Drug Charge<sup>[5]</sup></h2>\n<p>In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to Count One of the indictment, which charged him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).<sup>[6]</sup> Pena claims that the testimony of Ms. Rosado was \"uncorroborated and unsubstantiated\" and that \"no other evidence showed that [he] possessed a firearm or any drugs, at any time at all.\" According to Pena, the only other evidence relied upon by the government was his sudden flight from police. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as we must, we find Pena's argument unavailing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> Ms. Rosado testified that on the date and time in question, she observed a man matching Pena's general description<sup>[7]</sup> run across her backyard, reach into his right hip area, and make two separate throwing motions. She recounted the same to officers searching the area minutes after the incident. The officers then found the cell phone, firearm, and plastic bag containing drugs along the flight path. Pena admitted the phone was his, and a fingerprint match was made as to the firearm. Based on this evidence, a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Pena possessed the bag containing cocaine base before discarding it (along with the firearm and cell phone) while fleeing the police.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Firearm Charge</h2>\n<p>Pena also argues that the government did not produce sufficient evidence to support his conviction on Count Two of the indictment, which charged him with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (\"Section 924(c)\"). Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence for any person who \"during and in relation to any . . . drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.\" We focus here on the possession offense.<sup>[9]</sup> To obtain a conviction, the government must prove that the defendant: 1) committed a drug trafficking crime; 2) knowingly possessed a firearm; and 3) possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime. <i>United States v. Marin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203236\"><a href=\"/opinion/203236/united-states-v-marin/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2008). At oral argument, Pena's counsel conceded that the first two elements of the charge were met: Pena was convicted of a drug trafficking crime, and he was carrying a gun when approached by police.<sup>[10]</sup> However, Pena <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to the \"in furtherance of\" element, arguing that the government never established a link between the gun and the drug trafficking crime. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p>To prove that a defendant possessed a firearm \"in furtherance\" of the predicate drug crime, the government must show a sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime. <i>Marin,</i> 523 F.3d at 27 (citing <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 34-35; <i>United States v. Garner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200584\"><a href=\"/opinion/200584/united-states-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 81 (1st Cir.2003)). The mere presence of a firearm in the area where the drug offense occurred is insufficient. <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35. In assessing whether a sufficient nexus exists, we consider several factors: whether the firearm was loaded, whether the firearm was easily accessible, the proximity of the firearm to the drugs, and the surrounding circumstances. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202591\"><a href=\"/opinion/202591/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 399-400 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>United States v. Carlos Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200775\"><a href=\"/opinion/200775/united-states-v-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 509 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>In this case, each of these factors supports a conclusion that Pena possessed the gun \"in furtherance of\" the drug crime. The .357 Magnum was loaded, and there was circumstantial evidence that Pena was carrying both it and the drugs on his person. <i>Cf. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 31 (affirming conviction where unloaded gun was kept under a bed in a drawer that was blocked by a duffel bag, trash can, and box of books, no ammunition was in the house, and drugs were stored in a different room than the gun).</p>\n<p>In addition to this evidence, the government presented evidence that could lead a rational jury to infer that Pena was carrying the firearm to protect his drugs and drug proceeds, a purpose that we have found establishes the required nexus between the drugs and the firearm. <i>Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 35 (citing <i>United States v. Luciano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200453\"><a href=\"/opinion/200453/united-states-v-luciano/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003)). Pena was carrying $2,781 in cash at the time of his arrest, and there was evidence that the drugs he discarded had a street value of $2,100. The jury also heard evidence that the area where Pena was approached and eventually arrested was a high-crime area in which numerous drug and gun crimes and robberies had taken place.</p>\n<p>This evidence was sufficient to convince a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Pena possessed the .357 Magnum \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Other Matters</h2>\n<p>In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena mounts a potpourri of arguments, none of which were raised below. We thus briefly consider each, reviewing only for plain error. <i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202688\"><a href=\"/opinion/202688/united-states-v-garcia-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>United States v. Carvell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196531\"><a href=\"/opinion/196531/united-states-v-carvell/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p>First, Pena argues that the court's instruction on reasonable doubt confused jurors and allowed the jury to return a conviction based on a finding that Pena was \"<i>probably</i> guilty\" rather than guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Pena cites only a small portion of the court's reasonable doubt instruction, which comprises over two pages of the trial transcript. In viewing the instruction as a whole, we find that it did not mislead the jury as to the government's burden of proof. The instruction made it eminently clear that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> jury had to find Pena guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>Pena also contends that the court erroneously instructed the jury with regard to the term \"use,\" citing <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span> (1995), for the proposition that \"<i>use</i> for purposes of a § 924(c) violation means to actively <i>deploy</i> or <i>discharge</i> and not mere possession or presence.\" (emphasis in pro-se Supplemental Brief). Pena suggests that by employing the term \"use,\" the court constructively amended the indictment because the indictment did not charge Pena with \"use\" of a firearm.</p>\n<p>While the court did, in fact, use the term \"use\" once in the context of its instruction on the \"in furtherance of\" element, \"use\" of a firearm was not an issue in this case, and in any event the court's use of that term did not prejudice Pena. There was ample evidence that Pena possessed a firearm in furtherance of the drug crime, and even if the jury thought it had to find \"use,\" that would have been a benefit not a detriment to Pena.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, Pena argues that he was improperly sentenced as a crack offender, attempting to draw a distinction between the terms \"crack\" and \"cocaine base,\" which were used somewhat interchangeably by the court and the government at trial and sentencing. However, for the purpose of the statute under which Pena was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii),<sup>[12]</sup> the distinction between crack and cocaine base is meaningless. Unlike the Sentencing Guidelines, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) does not define \"cocaine base,\" and we have held that the term, as used in the statute, includes <i>all</i> forms of cocaine base, including but not limited to crack. <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199073\"><a href=\"/opinion/199073/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v. Lopez-Gil,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584140\"><a href=\"/opinion/584140/united-states-v-jesus-m-lopez-gil/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1134 (1st Cir.1992) (opinion on panel rehearing)). Consequently, regardless of whether the government proved that Pena possessed 43.19 grams of crack or 43.19 grams of some other form of cocaine base, his sentence under the statute would have been the same. As Pena admits that the government presented \"ample evidence\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> that the substance attributed to him was cocaine base, the court clearly did not commit plain error in sentencing him to the mandatory minimum prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we affirm Pena's conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At trial, the jury heard testimony that the street value of that amount of cocaine base, packaged in that fashion, would be close to $2,100.</p>\n<p>[2]  We also briefly consider claims of error which Pena raises in his pro-se Supplemental Brief regarding the court's charging instructions on reasonable doubt and the elements of the offenses as well as the identification of the drug type as crack for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p>[3]  The court also expressed concern about \"the lack of uniform standards, the problem that the proficiency rates, error rates are basically determined without a controlled group\" and the fact that \"no one has ever tested the premise of uniqueness.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Pena also argues that the district court erroneously shifted to him the burden of refuting the reliability of the expert testimony. Though somewhat vague, Pena's argument appears to be that once the trial judge acknowledged the questionable nature of the evidence, she \"abdicated her role\" by not holding a <i>Daubert</i> hearing and instead requiring Pena to produce data and experts to demonstrate why the evidence should not be admitted. This argument also fails.\n</p>\n<p>A district court does not abuse its discretion by dispensing with a <i>Daubert</i> hearing if no novel challenge is raised. <i>See </i><i>Mitchell,</i> 365 F.3d at 246. Here, Pena raised no new favorable case law or expert testimony to challenge the admissibility of the fingerprint identification evidence, instead citing only a single 2002 student note from the Fordham Law Review.</p>\n<p>[5]  The government argues that Pena waived his sufficiency challenge as to Count One by failing to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence and by also failing to contest his conviction as to that count in his post-verdict motion. However, a review of the trial transcript indicates that Pena appears to have renewed his motion after both parties rested, so his motion was not waived. Whatever the standard of review, Pena's claim fails as there is more than sufficient evidence to support his conviction.</p>\n<p>[6]  In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, Pena appears to raise a separate argument that the police did not have grounds to stop or arrest him. Pena claims that the anonymous tip on which the Brockton Police were acting when they approached him did not exhibit sufficient indicia of reliability under <i>Florida v. J.L.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118352\"><a href=\"/opinion/118352/florida-v-jl/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (2000), and his subsequent actions, namely his flight from the police, did not amount to reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity. Pena never made this argument to the district court in a motion to suppress, and it is therefore deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Santos Batista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199226\"><a href=\"/opinion/199226/united-states-v-santos-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Failure to raise suppression arguments before trial `shall constitute waiver thereof.'\" (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f))).</p>\n<p>[7]  Ms. Rosado testified that the man she saw looked to be about twenty years old, with dark skin. She stated that he was chubby, had black hair in braids, and was wearing black pants and a white short-sleeve shirt. One of the officers testified that the defendant was wearing a white tee shirt and blue jeans  a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p>[8]  The jury could also easily have concluded that the drugs were intended for distribution. The jury heard testimony that such a large amount (43.19 grams), packaged in individual sandwich bags and with a street value of over $2,100, would ordinarily be possessed by a dealer rather than an end user.</p>\n<p>[9]  Congress added the \"possess[ion]\" \"in furtherance of\" language to the statute in 1998 in response to <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span> (1995), where the Supreme Court held that under the prior version of the statute, \"the Government must show that the defendant <i>actively employed</i> the firearm during and in relation to the predicate crime.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Grace,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200995\"><a href=\"/opinion/200995/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting <i>Bailey,</i> 516 U.S. at 150, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>) (emphasis added). The statute also continues to prescribe a violation for the acts of 1) using or 2) carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime. As Pena was charged both with \"carry[ing]\" a firearm \"during and in relation to\" the drug offense and \"possess[ing]\" a firearm \"in furtherance of\" that offense, the government could have obtained a conviction under either avenue of proof. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779902\"><a href=\"/opinion/779902/united-states-v-gary-allen-lott-united-states-of-america-v-johnny-marton/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span>, 1246 (10th Cir.2002). As we find sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that Pena possessed the firearm in furtherance of his possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, we need not address whether the government also proved that he carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p>[10]  In his pro-se Supplemental Brief, Pena states that his counsel's concession on this point contradicted his own position. He states that he \"negates any inference whatsoever that suggests he threw the firearm and drugs allegedly recovered on [the day in question].\" Though Pena denies that the firearm recovered by the police was ever in his possession, the fingerprint evidence taken from the firearm, the fact that the gun was found along the flight path, and the testimony of Ms. Rosado were sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Pena had, in fact, been in possession of the revolver when initially stopped by police.</p>\n<p>[11]  Pena raises numerous additional challenges to the court's instructions as to each count, each of which is without merit. With regard to Count One, possession with intent to distribute, Pena contends that the district court defined \"to possess\" without defining \"to distribute\" or \"trafficking.\" It is unclear how the definition of trafficking is relevant to the elements of Count One, and the court did define the term \"to distribute.\" Pena next argues that the court constructively amended the indictment by using the term \"crack\" in the verdict slip when the indictment charged him with possession with intent to distribute \"cocaine base.\" Pena's claim is incorrect because the verdict slip in fact uses the term \"cocaine base,\" not \"crack.\"\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, Pena contends that the court gave the jury contradictory instructions as to whether or not the government was required to prove what type of drug was possessed. Here, too, Pena is incorrect. The court specifically instructed the jury that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance actually possessed was cocaine base.</p>\n<p>Regarding Count Two, Pena argues that the court failed to explain the first element of the Section 924(c) offense and to define the term \"trafficking\" within that element. Again, Pena's claim is without foundation. The court did, in fact, explain that the first element of Count Two was that Pena committed a drug trafficking offense and further instructed that the crime of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute charged in Count One was a \"drug trafficking crime\" for the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>[12]  Though the district court did not note the statute or its terms on the record at sentencing, the indictment specifically charged Pena with a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii), possession with intent to distribute \"5 grams or more of a mixture or substance . . . which contains cocaine base.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
