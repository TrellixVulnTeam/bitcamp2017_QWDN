Jorge Mercado (“Mercado”) and\n\nAngel Nazario (“Nazario”) brought an action against defendants, the\n\nPuerto   Rico   Tourism   Company   (“PRTC”),   Milton   Segarra,   Nelson\n\nCardona, José Faz, Mariano Méndez (“M. Méndez”), William Méndez,\n\nand Anabel Jaime, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2003).        Plaintiffs\n\ncomplained that they were terminated and constructively discharged\n\nbecause of their political affiliation. The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for defendants upon finding that the plaintiffs\n\nhad failed to comply with Local Rule 311.12.       The plaintiffs filed\n\nthis appeal, challenging whether the district court (1) properly\n\ndeemed as admitted defendants’ statement of uncontested facts; and\n\n(2) properly concluded that defendants had not violated Mercado’s\n\nand Nazario’s due process and First Amendment rights.         We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                           Statement of Facts\n\nA.   Mercado\n\n            Mercado worked as the Gaming Official Supervisor, a\n\ncareer position, at the PRTC since 1996.          His duties included,\n\ninter alia, visiting casinos to ensure compliance with the Games of\n\nChance Statute.\n\n            On or about December 1999, Mercado visited the Hotel\n\nAmbassador Plaza with a check made to the order of the New\n\nProgressive Party (“NPP”) for the amount of one thousand dollars\n\n($1,000).    The check bore the name Carlos Pesquera on the lower\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fleft-hand side.     On the reverse of the check, Mercado wrote the\n\nname of a bank, his name “Georgie Mercado” and the word “tourism.”\n\nM. Méndez, the Ambassador Hotel’s Cage and Collection Manager,\n\ncashed the check.\n\n          On February 16, 2001, Mercado requested treatment at the\n\nState Insurance Fund.    He thereafter requested medical leave and\n\nlicense without pay from August 23, 2001, until October 31, 2001.\n\nMercado returned to work on November 1, 2001.    On June 27, 2002,\n\nMercado was dismissed for violations of Section 12-3 of the PRTC\n\nHuman Resources Regulations, which prohibit, in relevant part:\n\n          (3)   Availing yourself of your job’s duties\n          and powers, property or public funds to\n          directly or indirectly benefit from the same,\n          for family member or any other person,\n          business or entity, to gain advantages,\n          benefits or privileges not allowed by the law.\n          (5) Accepting or soliciting from anyone,\n          either directly or indirectly for any member\n          of your family unit, or any other person,\n          business or entity, asset of any financial\n          value, including gifts, loans, promises,\n          favors or services, in exchange of an action\n          by said official or public employee, being\n          influenced to favor that or any other person.\n          (16)   Using   your  official   position   for\n          political ends - partisan or for other ends\n          that are not compatible with public service.\n          (17) Perform duties or tasks that result in a\n          conflict of interest with your obligations as\n          a public employee.\n          (18) Conduct that is improper or is against\n          duties, which taint the good name of the\n          [PRTC] or of the Government of Puerto Rico.\n\nAlicea v. Puerto Rico Tourism Co., 270 F. Supp. 2d 243, 248 (D.P.R.\n\n2003).\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Mercado’s   letter   of    dismissal   also   stated   that   his\n\nconduct constituted a violation of the PRTC’s Discipline Manual,\n\nwhich enumerates the following as violations of the same:\n\n           (22)   Conduct yourself in such a way that\n           taints the good name of the Company, either\n           during or out of regular work hours as a\n           public employee.\n           (61)   Performing   services    or   financial\n           relationships with individuals or entities who\n           are considered to be a conflict of interest\n           with your duties as a public employee.\n           (62) Performing tasks, activities or duties\n           that entail conflicts of interest against your\n           duties as a public employee.\n           (66) Embezzlement or undue use of funds,\n           assets or services of the [PRTC].\n\nId.\n\n          The letter additionally stated that Mercado could appeal\n\nthe decision before the Office of the Examiner of the PRTC within\n\nfifteen days, but Mercado failed to do so.\n\n          Mercado did not avail himself of several opportunities to\n\nappeal his dismissal in an administrative hearing.\n\nB.    Nazario\n\n          Nazario started working at the PRTC on August 4, 1999, as\n\nDirector of Information Systems, a Career Civil Service position.\n\nOn April 14, 2000, former governor Pedro Rosselló issued Executive\n\nOrder OE-2000-19, which established that Directors of Computer\n\nInformation Systems at government agencies should be designated by\n\nthe nominating authority and that such a position would be a trust\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fposition.1     On February 20, 2001, the PRTC named Daniela González\n\n(“González”) as Principal Officer of Information Systems.          Nazario\n\nwas ordered to report to González.            On March 9, 2002, Nazario\n\nrequested and received a transfer with a pay increase to the\n\nMunicipality of San Juan, effective April 15, 2001.\n\n                                     II.\n\n                                   Analysis\n\n             The plaintiffs now challenge the district court’s entry\n\nof   summary     judgment   on     their   due   process   and   political\n\ndiscrimination claims.       The plaintiffs argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in concluding that they had failed to comply with Local\n\nRule 311.12, which requires that they file their own statement of\n\nfacts when opposing a summary judgment motion.             Plaintiffs also\n\nargue that the district court improperly dismissed their first\n\namendment and due process claims on the merits.\n\n             In reviewing the application of Local Rule 311.12, we\n\nrecognize     that   “[d]istrict     courts   enjoy   broad   latitude   in\n\nadministering local rules.” Air Line Pilots Assoc. v. Precision\n\nValley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 1994).         We review\n\na court’s granting of summary judgment de novo. Euromodas, Inc. v.\n\nZanella, Ltd., 368 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2004); Podiatrist Ass’n,\n\nInc. v. La Cruz Azul de P.R., Inc., 332 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     1\n      Trust employees may be discharged at will and without cause.\nSee Correa Martínez v. Arrillaga Beléndez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 n.2 (1st\nCir. 1990).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fA.   Local Rule 311.12\n\n          According to Local Rule 311.12, a party who moves for\n\nsummary judgment must submit “a separate, short, and concise\n\nstatement of the material facts as to which the moving party\n\ncontends there is no genuine issue to be tried and the basis of\n\nsuch contention as to each material fact.” D.P.R.R. 311.12.2    The\n\nopposing party must then file a statement “of the material facts as\n\nto which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be\n\ntried.”   Id.   Failure to file such a statement will result in the\n\ncourt deeming admitted the movant’s statement.       Id. (movant’s\n\nstatement will be “deemed admitted unless controverted by the\n\nstatement required to be served by the opposing party.”).\n\n          As we have previously declared, “[w]e have consistently\n\nupheld the enforcement of [the District Court of Puerto Rico’s\n\nlocal rule], noting repeatedly that ‘parties ignore [it] at their\n\nperil’ and that ‘failure to present a statement of disputed facts,\n\nembroidered with specific citations to the record, justifies the\n\ncourt’s deeming the facts presented in the movant’s statement of\n\nundisputed facts admitted.’”    Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodríguez,\n\n360 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209\n\nF.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n\n\n     2\n      The District of Puerto Rico amended its local rules in\nSeptember of 2003. Because the summary judgment motions in this\ncase were adjudicated prior thereto, we refer throughout to the\npre-amended version.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f               The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred when\n\nit deemed defendant’s facts admitted because of plaintiffs’ failure\n\nto comply with Local Rule 311.12. Plaintiffs argue that defendants\n\nthemselves failed to refer to the record in their statement of\n\nfacts.\n\n               The   district    court       correctly    ascertained    that   the\n\nplaintiffs’ statement of facts failed to adhere to Local Rule\n\n311.12.        Instead   of     filing   a    statement    of   contested   facts,\n\nplaintiffs filed their own uncontested facts lacking any references\n\nto the record that might aid the court in making its decision.\n\nPlaintiffs also filed “Commentaries to Defendants’ Uncontested\n\nFacts,” in which plaintiffs make reference to testimonies that are\n\nnot in evidence.          Plaintiffs further made numerous conclusory\n\nallegations and assertions of fact for which they offered no\n\nsupport. District courts are not required to ferret through sloppy\n\nrecords in search of evidence supporting a party’s case.                        See\n\nMorales v. A.C. Orssleff’s EFTF, 246 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(“[I]n his submission to the district court, plaintiff made only a\n\ngeneral reference to [a witness’s] testimony without pinpointing\n\nwhere in that 89-page deposition support for that reference could\n\nbe found.       This is precisely the situation that Local Rule 311.12\n\nseeks     to    avoid.”).        Additionally,      contrary     to     plaintiffs’\n\nallegations, defendants’ statement of facts contained references to\n\nthe record, making plaintiffs’ argument devoid of any merit.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f              Therefore, the facts pleaded by defendants were properly\n\ndeemed admitted according with Local Rule 311.12.                 See D.P.R.R.\n\n311.12.\n\nB.     First Amendment\n\n              The First Amendment protects non-policymaking public\n\nemployees from adverse employment actions based on their political\n\nopinions.      See Padilla-García v. Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69,\n\n74 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497\n\nU.S. 62, 75-76 (1990).            We employ a two-part, burden-shifting\n\nanalysis to evaluate claims of political discrimination. See Mount\n\nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287\n\n(1977); Padilla-García, 212 F.3d at 74. To establish a prima-facie\n\ncase,     a   plaintiff    must   show     that   party   affiliation    was   a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor behind a challenged employment\n\naction.       See Padilla-García, 212 F.3d at 74.         “[A] plaintiff may\n\nnot prevail simply by asserting an inequity and tacking on the\n\nself-serving conclusion that the defendant was motivated by a\n\ndiscriminatory animus.” Correa-Martínez v. Arrillaga-Beléndez, 903\n\nF.2d    49,    53   (1st   Cir.   1990).      Assuming    proof   of    unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, the burden then shifts to the defendant, who must\n\nestablish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he would have\n\ntaken the same action regardless of the plaintiff’s political\n\nbeliefs.      Id.; see Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-Díaz, 385 F.3d 23,\n\n30 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f             In other words, an employer “still prevails by showing\n\nthat it would have reached the same decision in the absence of the\n\nprotected conduct.”            Id. (citing Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S.\n\n574, 593 (1998)).          Thus, “even if a plaintiff meets his or her\n\ninitial     burden    of       showing   that       political       affiliation     was    a\n\nmotivating factor for an employment decision, that is insufficient\n\nto   establish      discrimination       as     a    matter     of    law   because      the\n\nplaintiff’s case at that point does not ‘distinguish[ ] between a\n\nresult     caused    by    a    constitutional        violation       and   one    not    so\n\ncaused.’”     Id. (citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 286).                          We have\n\nnoted that adopting “a view of causation that focuses solely on\n\nwhether protected conduct played a part in an employment decision\n\n. . . would put an ‘employee in a better position as a result of\n\nthe exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would\n\nhave occupied [otherwise].’” Id. (quoting Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n\n285).      “However,       if    a   plaintiff       does     not    produce      evidence\n\nsufficient     to    allow       a   reasonable        inference       that    political\n\ndiscrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nchallenged employment action, we need not analyze defendant’s Mt.\n\nHealthy defense.”          Vázquez-Valentín, 358 F.3d at 30.\n\n             We now review Mercado’s and Nazario’s claims.\n\n      1.     Jorge Mercado\n\n             Mercado argues that the district court erred when it\n\ndismissed his claim because it was uncontested that his supervisors\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fwere aware that he was a member of the opposite political party.\n\n“[S]tatements    of    political     affiliation--unaccompanied          by   any\n\nspecific factual information to support [the] claim and unrelated\n\nto   any    employment     action      taken      by     [defendant]     against\n\n[plaintiff]–[are] patently insufficient to establish an act of\n\npolitical discrimination.”          López Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, 230\n\nF.3d 409, 414 (1st Cir. 2000).         Here, there is no evidence on the\n\nrecord showing that Mercado’s dismissal was the result of his\n\npolitical affiliation. Instead, the evidence suggests that Mercado\n\nwas dismissed for cashing a check made out to a third party, in\n\nviolation of the PRTC Human Resources Regulations.\n\n            Although the record indicates that Mercado was an NPP\n\nmember,    Mercado    failed   to   proffer    evidence      of    any   specific\n\ndiscriminatory conduct which proves that his political patronage\n\nwas a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse\n\nemployment decisions taken against him.                Failure to proffer such\n\nevidence warranted dismissal of his First Amendment claim.                    See\n\nVázquez-Valentín, 385 F.3d at 38 (stating that “[e]ven if a jury\n\ncould reasonably infer that defendants knew that plaintiff was a\n\nmember of the NPP, that still is insufficient.                Proving that her\n\npolitical affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nadverse    decision   requires      more   than   ‘[m]erely       juxtaposing   a\n\nprotected characteristic–someone else’s politics–with the fact that\n\nthe plaintiff was treated unfairly.’”) (quoting Correa-Martínez,\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f903 F.2d at 58).             Thus, the district court correctly dismissed\n\nMercado’s First Amendment claim.\n\n        2.   Angel Nazario\n\n             In    order       to   show     adverse    employment       action,    a\n\nprerequisite to his political discrimination claim, Nazario must\n\nprove    that     he   was    constructively       discharged   as   a   result    of\n\nGonzález’ appointment as Principal Officer of Information Systems,\n\nand the resulting changes to Nazario’s duties.                  To prove that he\n\nwas constructively discharged, a plaintiff must show that the new\n\n“working conditions imposed by the employer had become so onerous,\n\nabusive, or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee’s\n\nposition would have felt compelled to resign.”                  Suarez v. Pueblo\n\nIntern., Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Aviles-\n\nMartínez, 963 F.3d at 6 (citing Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp.,\n\n798 F.2d 559, 561 (1st Cir. 1986)).\n\n             Nazario argued that requiring him to respond to a new\n\nsupervisor made him feel humiliated, and that defendants’ actions\n\nconstituted an attempt to force him out of the PRTC because of his\n\npolitical       affiliation.          Such        conclusory    allegations        are\n\ninsufficient to establish the prima facie case of constructive\n\ndischarge.      To show that the work conditions forced him to resign,\n\na plaintiff must show that “the employer’s challenged actions\n\nresult in a work situation ‘unreasonably inferior’ to the norm for\n\nthe position.” Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209,\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f1218 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3\n\nF.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir. 1993) (constructive discharge occurs when\n\n“working conditions [are] so intolerable[ ] that a reasonable\n\nperson would feel compelled to forsake his job rather than to\n\nsubmit to looming indignities”). Further, Nazario fails to proffer\n\nany evidence suggesting that the new work conditions were inferior\n\nto the norm or that requiring him to respond to a superior was a\n\nresult of political animus.           We, therefore, conclude that the\n\ndistrict court properly dismissed Nazario’s First Amendment claim.\n\nC.   Due Process\n\n           The    Due   Process   Clause    of     the   Fourteenth   Amendment\n\nguarantees     public   employees    who    have    a    property   interest   in\n\ncontinued employment the right to at least an informal hearing\n\nbefore they are discharged.         González-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,\n\n377 F.3d 81,     86 (1st Cir. 2004); Santana v. Calderón, 342 F.3d 18,\n\n23 (1st Cir. 2003); Kauffman v. P.R. Tel.

In order to establish a procedural due process\n\nclaim under § 1983, “Plaintiffs must allege they have a property\n\ninterest as defined by state law and, second, that the defendants,\n\nacting under color of state law, deprived [them] of that property\n\ninterest without constitutionally adequate process.”                PFZ Props.,\n\nInc. v. Rodríguez, 928 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1991); see Logan v.\n\nZimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428 (1982).              “Under Puerto Rico\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\flaw, career employees have a property interest in their continued\n\nemployment.”     González-De-Blasini, 377 F.3d at 86; Kaufman v.

Jorge Mercado\n\n            As a career employee, Mercado had a property interest in\n\nhis position, which vested him with a pre-termination hearing prior\n\nto dismissal.     Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546; see also O’Neill v.\n\nBaker, 210 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir. 2000).           The record here indicates\n\nthat defendants granted Mercado a due process hearing, but he\n\nfailed to attend. Defendants rescheduled the hearing several times,\n\nbut Mercado repeatedly failed to appear.           Defendants then allowed\n\nMercado to object to the dismissal in writing.                Mercado seemed to\n\nargue that his due process rights were violated when the hearing\n\nwas   cancelled    after     he   failed   to   appear   on     three   separate\n\noccasions.\n\n            The district court correctly found that defendants did\n\nnot violate Mercado’s due process rights when his inability to\n\npresent    his   side   of   the   story    was   due    to    his   failure   to\n\nparticipate.\n\n      2.     Angel Nazario\n\n            As we previously explained, Nazario voluntarily quit his\n\ncareer position at PRTC when he requested a transfer to the\n\nMunicipality of San Juan.          Thus, as the district court stated,\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fNazario voluntarily gave up his property interest in his career\n\nposition and does not have a due process right to a hearing.\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, the district court’s\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -15-\n\f",

The check bore the name Carlos Pesquera on the lower left-hand side. On the reverse of the check, Mercado wrote the name of a bank, his name \"Georgie Mercado\" and the word \"tourism.\" M.

Nazario was ordered to report to Gonzalez.

The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that they had failed to comply with Local Rule 311.12, which requires that they file their own statement of facts when opposing a summary judgment motion. Plaintiffs also argue that the district court improperly dismissed their first amendment and due process claims on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the application of Local Rule 311.12, we recognize that \"[d]istrict courts enjoy broad latitude in administering local rules.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Assoc. v.

Instead of filing a statement of contested facts, plaintiffs filed their own uncontested facts lacking <i>any</i> references to the record that might aid the court in making its decision. Plaintiffs also filed \"Commentaries to Defendants' Uncontested Facts,\" in which plaintiffs make reference to testimonies that are not in evidence. Plaintiffs further made numerous conclusory allegations and assertions of fact for which they offered no support. District courts are not required to ferret through sloppy records in search of evidence supporting a party's case. <i>See Morales v. A.C. Orssleff's EFTF,</i> 246 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[I]n his submission to the district court, plaintiff made only a general reference to [a witness's] testimony without pinpointing where in that 89-page deposition support for that reference could be found.

We employ a two-part, burden-shifting analysis to evaluate claims of political discrimination. <i>See Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 74. To establish a prima-facie case, a plaintiff must show that party affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind a challenged employment action. <i>See Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 74. \"[A] plaintiff may not prevail simply by asserting an inequity and tacking on the self-serving conclusion that the defendant was motivated by a discriminatory animus.\" <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> 903 F.2d 49, 53 (1st Cir.1990). Assuming proof of unlawful discrimination, the burden then shifts to the defendant, who must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiff's political beliefs. <i>Id.; see Vazquez-Valentin v. Santiago-Diaz,</i> 385 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, an employer \"still prevails by showing that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Crawford-El v. Britton,</i> 523 U.S. 574, 593, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998)). Thus, \"even if a plaintiff meets his or her initial burden of showing that political affiliation was a motivating factor for an employment decision, that is insufficient to establish discrimination as a matter of law because the plaintiff's case at that point does not `distinguish [ ] between a result caused by a constitutional violation and one not so caused.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 286, 97 S.Ct. 568). We have noted that adopting \"a view of causation that focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part in an employment decision ... would put an `employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied [otherwise].'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct. 568). \"However, if a plaintiff does not produce evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable inference that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action, we need not analyze defendant's Mt.

Rubianes,</i> 230 F.3d 409, 414 (1st Cir.2000). Here, there is no evidence on the record showing that Mercado's dismissal was the result of his political affiliation. Instead, the evidence suggests that Mercado was dismissed for cashing a check made out to a third party, in violation of the PRTC Human Resources Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the record indicates that Mercado was an NPP member, Mercado failed to proffer evidence of any specific discriminatory conduct which proves that his political patronage was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment decisions taken against him. Failure to proffer such evidence warranted dismissal of his First Amendment claim. <i>See Vazquez-Valentin,</i> 385 F.3d at 38 (stating that \"[e]ven if a jury could reasonably infer that defendants knew that plaintiff was a member of the NPP, that still is insufficient. Proving that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse decision requires more than `[m]erely juxtaposing a protected characteristic-someone else's politics &#8212; with the fact that the plaintiff was treated unfairly.'\") (quoting <i>Correa-Martinez,</i> 903 F.2d at 58). Thus, the district court correctly dismissed Mercado's First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Angel Nazario</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to show adverse employment action, a prerequisite to his political discrimination claim, Nazario must prove that he was constructively discharged as a result of Gonzalez' appointment as Principal Officer of Information Systems, and the resulting changes to Nazario's duties. To prove that he was constructively discharged, a plaintiff must show that the new \"working conditions imposed by the employer had become so onerous, abusive, or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.\" <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Intern., Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig,</i> 963 F.3d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing <i>Calhoun v. Acme Cleveland Corp.,</i> 798 F.2d 559, 561 (1st Cir.1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nazario argued that requiring him to respond to a new supervisor made him feel humiliated, and that defendants' actions constituted an attempt to force him out of the PRTC because of his political affiliation. Such conclusory allegations are insufficient to establish the prima facie case of constructive discharge. To show that the work conditions forced him to resign, a plaintiff must show that \"the employer's challenged actions result in a work situation `unreasonably inferior' to the norm for the position.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1218 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd.,</i> 3 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir.1993) (constructive discharge occurs when \"working conditions [are] so intolerable[] that a reasonable person would feel compelled to forsake his job rather than to submit to looming indignities\"). Further, Nazario fails to proffer any evidence suggesting that the new work conditions were inferior to the norm or that requiring him to respond to a superior was a result of political animus. We, therefore, conclude that the district court properly dismissed Nazario's First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Due Process</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees public employees who have a property interest in continued employment the right to at least an informal hearing before they are discharged. <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini v.

Here, there is no evidence on the record showing that Mercado's dismissal was the result of his political affiliation. Instead, the evidence suggests that Mercado was dismissed for cashing a check made out to a third party, in violation of the PRTC Human Resources Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the record indicates that Mercado was an NPP member, Mercado failed to proffer evidence of any specific discriminatory conduct which proves that his political patronage was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment decisions taken against him. Failure to proffer such evidence warranted dismissal of his First Amendment claim. <i>See Vazquez-Valentin,</i> 385 F.3d at 38 (stating that \"[e]ven if a jury could reasonably infer that defendants knew that plaintiff was a member of the NPP, that still is insufficient. Proving that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse decision requires more than `[m]erely juxtaposing a protected characteristic-someone else's politics &#8212; with the fact that the plaintiff was treated unfairly.'\") (quoting <i>Correa-Martinez,</i> 903 F.2d at 58). Thus, the district court correctly dismissed Mercado's First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Angel Nazario</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to show adverse employment action, a prerequisite to his political discrimination claim, Nazario must prove that he was constructively discharged as a result of Gonzalez' appointment as Principal Officer of Information Systems, and the resulting changes to Nazario's duties.

Such conclusory allegations are insufficient to establish the prima facie case of constructive discharge. To show that the work conditions forced him to resign, a plaintiff must show that \"the employer's challenged actions result in a work situation `unreasonably inferior' to the norm for the position.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v.

Further, Nazario fails to proffer any evidence suggesting that the new work conditions were inferior to the norm or that requiring him to respond to a superior was a result of political animus.
