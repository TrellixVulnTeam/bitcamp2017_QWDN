Jerome Griffin (\"Griffin\") was convicted of crack\ncocaine offenses and sentenced to be incarcerated for 198 months,\na term below the properly calculated guideline range.                    Griffin\nappealed, arguing that the sentence was unreasonable under 18\nU.S.C. § 3553(a).        We are called on to apply our recent en banc\ndecision in United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir.\n2006) to determine whether Griffin’s sentence was unreasonable. We\nhold it was not, and AFFIRM the district court’s sentence.\n\n\nBackground\n      On September 25, 2002, Griffin pled guilty in the United\nStates     District    Court   for   New    Hampshire   to    three    counts    of\ndistribution     of    cocaine   base,     and   possession    with    intent    to\ndistribute fifty or more grams of cocaine base \"crack\" and five\nkilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21\nU.S.C. § 846 and § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii).                          The\nsentencing     court   accepted      the   factual   findings    and   guideline\napplications     in    the    Presentence    Investigation      Report   (\"PSR\")\nwithout objection from either party.\n      The PSR found Griffin accountable for more than 1.5 kilograms\nof cocaine base, requiring a base offense level under U.S.S.G. §\n2D1.1(c)(2) of 38.           A three-level adjustment for acceptance of\nresponsibility resulted in a total offense level of 35.                Griffin’s\nprior criminal record placed him in criminal history category III,\nand   as   a   result,   the     undisputed      guideline    sentencing   range\ncalculated by the PSR was 210 to 262 months.\n      The government recommended a sentence at the low end of the\n\n                                       -2-\n\fguideline    range:    210    months.         Griffin   sought   the    statutory\nmandatory minimum of 120 months.                In support of his request,\nGriffin offered four arguments: (1) that he had been an exemplary\ninmate since his incarceration in March 2002; (2) that he had\nperformed    well     while   on   supervised      release   from      his   prior\nconviction; (3) that the district court could, under United States\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), consider Griffin’s cooperation with\n\nprosecutors as mitigation, even without a U.S.S.G. § 5K2.1 motion\nfrom the government; and (4) that the unfairness of the 100:1\ncocaine base crack to cocaine ratio should operate to reduce his\nsentence.\n     The      sentencing           court–District         Judge         DiClerico\npresiding–imposed a term of 198 months imprisonment followed by\nfive (5) years of supervised release.1              Griffin then filed this\ntimely appeal, arguing 198 months to be unreasonably high in light\nof alleged mitigating factors.\n\n\nDiscussion\n     We have jurisdiction over Griffin’s direct appeal from his\n\n\n1\n   This is the sentence from which Griffin appeals; however, it is\nthe third time he was sentenced. The district court initially\nsentenced Griffin to 210 months on February 5, 2003.       Griffin\nfailed to file a timely notice of appeal, but later moved pro se\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255, contending that counsel had failed to\nprosecute an appeal at his request. After an evidentiary hearing\non November 12, 2003, the district court vacated and reimposed the\nsentence so that Griffin could appeal to the First Circuit. This\nhe did, but during the pendency of this revitalized direct appeal,\nBooker was decided.    Accordingly, on May 25, 2005, this court\nvacated the 2003 sentence of 210 months and remanded the case for\nre-sentencing, which resulted in the 198 month sentence on appeal.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffinal criminal judgment of conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291\nand 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a).        Booker requires that appellate courts\nreview sentences for \"reasonableness.\"               543 U.S. 220, 260-63\n(2005); see also United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76\n(1st   Cir.   2005)    (explicating       Booker).    Where,    as   here,   the\nsentencing court is charged with committing an error of judgment as\nopposed to an error of law, our review of the length of the\nsentence demands \"substantial deference to the judgment calls of\n[the] nisi prius court....\"         U.S. v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir.\n2006).\n       Our recent en banc decision in Jimenez-Beltre outlines the\nsteps we take to evaluate Griffin’s sentence for reasonableness.\n440 F.3d at 516-19.        Under the post-Booker approach, \"district\ncourts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those\nGuidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\"                Booker,\n543 U.S. at 264.      However, Jimenez-Beltre rejects the proposition,\nadvanced by the U.S. Attorney here, that a sentence within the\nproperly calculated guideline range is \"inherently unreviewable on\nappeal on grounds of ‘unreasonableness.’\"2                440 F.3d at 517-18\n(\"find[ing]    it     [un]helpful    to    talk   about   the   Guidelines   as\npresumptively controlling or a guidelines sentence as per se\nreasonable.\") \"[M]aking the guidelines ‘presumptive' or ‘per se\n\n\n2\n  Several circuits have used the presumption language. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Tobacco, 428 F.3d 1148, 1151 (8th Cir. 2005); United States v.\nMykytiuk, 415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir. 2005). The per se label has also\nbeen urged.   See United States v. Webb, 403 F.3d 373, 385 (6th Cir.\n2005). However, it has thus far been rejected. See United States v.\nTalley, 431 F.3d 784, 786-87 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v.\nCunningham, 429 F.3d 673, 676 (7th Cir. 2005); Webb, 403 F.3d at 385 n.9.\n\n                                      -4-\n\freasonable' does not make them mandatory,\" but \"it tends in that\ndirection; and anyway terms like ‘presumptive' and ‘per se' are\nmore ambiguous labels than they at first appear.\"             Id.   A \"more\nuseful compass,\" reasoned the court, is the district judge’s\nexplanation of how he arrived at a sentence and justified it\nagainst objections.     Id.\n     Booker requires consideration of the other sentencing factors\nenumerated by Congress in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).          Booker, 543 U.S.\nat 258-60 (\"Without the ‘mandatory' provision, the [Sentencing] Act\nnonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines\ntogether with other sentencing goals\").        The Guidelines cannot be\ncalled just \"another factor\" in this statutory list, 18 U.S.C. §\n3553(a) (2000), but they are still \"generalizations\" and accounted,\nexplicitly or implicitly, for the defense arguments.                Jimenez-\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 518.    Only through analysis of a district court's\n\"sequential determination of the guideline range, including any\nproposed departures, followed by the further determination whether\nother   factors   identified   by   either   side   warrant   an    ultimate\nsentence above or below the guideline range\" can reasonableness be\nassessed.   Id. at 518-19.\n     Where, as here, a sentence falls outside the applicable\nguideline range, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) already requires a district\ncourt to enumerate reasons to justify it.            Jimenez-Beltre goes\nfurther, emphasizing \"the provision of a reasoned explanation, a\nplausible outcome and–where these criteria are met–some deference\nto different judgments by the district judges on the scene.\"             Id.\nat 519.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f     A.   Reasoned Explanation\n     Following    Jimenez-Beltre,       we    look    first     to    whether    the\ndistrict court offered a reasoned explanation for its sentence. In\nthis case, it did.           In re-sentencing Griffin, District Judge\nDiClerico explained that he had weighed: \"the sentencing range\nunder the advisory guidelines\"; \"the policies underlying those\nguidelines\"; and \"all of the Section 3553(a) sentencing factors.\"\nJudge   DiClerico     responded   to    all    of    the    defense     arguments.\nFurthermore, Judge DiClerico revealed that he had focused special\nattention on eight factors, namely:\n     1.    the government’s recommendation of 210 months and\n           Griffin’s recommendation of 120 months;\n     2.    Griffin’s limited cooperation with the government;\n     3.    the seriousness of the offenses and large quantities of\n           contraband involved;\n     4.    the need to deter Griffin and others;\n     5.    the degree of culpability of Griffin relative to his co-\n           defendants;\n     6.    Griffin’s criminal history and risk of recidivism;\n     7.    Griffin’s good behavior while in custody, including drug\n           treatment; and\n     8.    the need for drug abuse aftercare and search and seizure\n           special conditions during supervised release.\n\n     These reasons for sentencing Griffin below the guideline\nrange, but above the statuary mandatory minimum, are essentially\ncoextensive with the § 3553(a) factors.             Thus, Judge DiClerico has\nmet, if not exceeded, the ideal of transparency in sentencing\naspired to by Jimenez-Beltre.\n     B.   Reasonableness\n     We next examine the plausibility of the district court’s\nresult,   and    we   hold    Griffin’s      sentence      of   198    months   was\nreasonable.      Griffin     argues   that    198    months     is    greater   than\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fnecessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C.\n3553(a)(2).       On reasonableness review, however, Griffin’s position\ncannot prevail.\n     First,       Griffin    received       a    sentence        below       the    properly\ncalculated guideline range.           A district court is entitled to start\nwith and accord the Guidelines \"substantial weight.\"                          See Jimenez-\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 516.          A presumption of reasonableness may not\nattach to a guidelines sentence, but a sentence below the guideline\nrange nonetheless suggests mitigating factors are already at work.\nIndeed, the district court here weighed each mitigating factor\nGriffin cited in support of an even shorter sentence.                                  Judge\nDiClerico was not impressed by these factors.                         Neither are we.\n     Griffin cites his sizable family, his strict Roman Catholic\nupbringing, his failure to learn the value of education from his\nparents, his lack of vocational skills and consequent work as a\nlaborer,    and,    ultimately,       his       descent    into       drug    and    alcohol\naddiction.        These     factors   simply       do     not    meaningfully         lessen\nGriffin’s culpability for this second and far more serious drug\noffense.    Griffin also cites exemplary behavior and submission to\nsubstance abuse programing so far in prison.                          While commendable,\nneither bears very strongly on a sentence meant to reflect the\ngravity of offenses Griffin committed prior to his imprisonment.\n     We    find    nothing    unreasonable         about        the    district      court’s\njudgment that Griffin’s cooperation with authorities was only\nminimal; about its findings regarding Griffin’s role in or degree\nof culpability for the conspiracy; or about its conclusion that a\nlesser    term    would     not   adequately       deter    a     40-year-old         repeat\n\n                                        -7-\n\foffender such as Griffin, or might have a detrimental effect on\ngeneral deterrence.\n     Finally,    our    recent   decision    in   Pho   explicitly    rejected\nGriffin’s argument that the Guidelines' disparate treatment of\ncrack and powder cocaine justifies a sentence below the advisory\nguideline range.       433 F.3d at 63.\n     By   contrast,     the   aggravating    factors     in    this   case   are\nundisputed.     Griffin was held accountable (without objection) for\n1.5 kilograms of cocaine base \"crack.\"              According to the U.S.\nAttorney, this quantity \"was one of the biggest ever in the State\nof New Hampshire.\"      It was also Griffin’s second crack conviction.\nEven worse, Griffin offended while still on supervised release\nfollowing 30 months in prison for his first offense, and Griffin’s\nco-conspirators were involved on both occasions.              Overall, Griffin\nis a drug user unable to function in society without resorting to\ndrug offenses to pay for his habit.         The risk of recidivism is thus\nhigher than average, and Judge DiClerico’s sentence is reasonable.\n\n\nConclusion\n     Because Judge DiClerico’s well-described explanation convinces\nus court that Griffin’s sentence is defensible on reasonableness\ngrounds, Jimenez-Beltre directs us to defer to Judge DiClerico’s\njudgment.    Accordingly, we AFFIRM Griffin’s sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

A \"more\nuseful compass,\" reasoned the court, is the district judge’s\nexplanation of how he arrived at a sentence and justified it\nagainst objections.     Id.\n     Booker requires consideration of the other sentencing factors\nenumerated by Congress in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).          Booker, 543 U.S.\nat 258-60 (\"Without the ‘mandatory' provision, the [Sentencing] Act\nnonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines\ntogether with other sentencing goals\").        The Guidelines cannot be\ncalled just \"another factor\" in this statutory list, 18 U.S.C. §\n3553(a) (2000), but they are still \"generalizations\" and accounted,\nexplicitly or implicitly, for the defense arguments.                Jimenez-\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 518.    Only through analysis of a district court's\n\"sequential determination of the guideline range, including any\nproposed departures, followed by the further determination whether\nother   factors   identified   by   either   side   warrant   an    ultimate\nsentence above or below the guideline range\" can reasonableness be\nassessed.   Id. at 518-19.\n     Where, as here, a sentence falls outside the applicable\nguideline range, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) already requires a district\ncourt to enumerate reasons to justify it.            Jimenez-Beltre goes\nfurther, emphasizing \"the provision of a reasoned explanation, a\nplausible outcome and–where these criteria are met–some deference\nto different judgments by the district judges on the scene.\"             Id.\nat 519.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f     A.   Reasoned Explanation\n     Following    Jimenez-Beltre,       we    look    first     to    whether    the\ndistrict court offered a reasoned explanation for its sentence. In\nthis case, it did.           In re-sentencing Griffin, District Judge\nDiClerico explained that he had weighed: \"the sentencing range\nunder the advisory guidelines\"; \"the policies underlying those\nguidelines\"; and \"all of the Section 3553(a) sentencing factors.\"\nJudge   DiClerico     responded   to    all    of    the    defense     arguments.\nFurthermore, Judge DiClerico revealed that he had focused special\nattention on eight factors, namely:\n     1.    the government’s recommendation of 210 months and\n           Griffin’s recommendation of 120 months;\n     2.    Griffin’s limited cooperation with the government;\n     3.    the seriousness of the offenses and large quantities of\n           contraband involved;\n     4.    the need to deter Griffin and others;\n     5.    the degree of culpability of Griffin relative to his co-\n           defendants;\n     6.    Griffin’s criminal history and risk of recidivism;\n     7.    Griffin’s good behavior while in custody, including drug\n           treatment; and\n     8.    the need for drug abuse aftercare and search and seizure\n           special conditions during supervised release.\n\n     These reasons for sentencing Griffin below the guideline\nrange, but above the statuary mandatory minimum, are essentially\ncoextensive with the § 3553(a) factors.             Thus, Judge DiClerico has\nmet, if not exceeded, the ideal of transparency in sentencing\naspired to by Jimenez-Beltre.\n     B.   Reasonableness\n     We next examine the plausibility of the district court’s\nresult,   and    we   hold    Griffin’s      sentence      of   198    months   was\nreasonable.      Griffin     argues   that    198    months     is    greater   than\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fnecessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C.\n3553(a)(2).       On reasonableness review, however, Griffin’s position\ncannot prevail.\n     First,       Griffin    received       a    sentence        below       the    properly\ncalculated guideline range.           A district court is entitled to start\nwith and accord the Guidelines \"substantial weight.\"                          See Jimenez-\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 516.          A presumption of reasonableness may not\nattach to a guidelines sentence, but a sentence below the guideline\nrange nonetheless suggests mitigating factors are already at work.\nIndeed, the district court here weighed each mitigating factor\nGriffin cited in support of an even shorter sentence.                                  Judge\nDiClerico was not impressed by these factors.                         Neither are we.\n     Griffin cites his sizable family, his strict Roman Catholic\nupbringing, his failure to learn the value of education from his\nparents, his lack of vocational skills and consequent work as a\nlaborer,    and,    ultimately,       his       descent    into       drug    and    alcohol\naddiction.        These     factors   simply       do     not    meaningfully         lessen\nGriffin’s culpability for this second and far more serious drug\noffense.    Griffin also cites exemplary behavior and submission to\nsubstance abuse programing so far in prison.                          While commendable,\nneither bears very strongly on a sentence meant to reflect the\ngravity of offenses Griffin committed prior to his imprisonment.\n     We    find    nothing    unreasonable         about        the    district      court’s\njudgment that Griffin’s cooperation with authorities was only\nminimal; about its findings regarding Griffin’s role in or degree\nof culpability for the conspiracy; or about its conclusion that a\nlesser    term    would     not   adequately       deter    a     40-year-old         repeat\n\n                                        -7-\n\foffender such as Griffin, or might have a detrimental effect on\ngeneral deterrence.\n     Finally,    our    recent   decision    in   Pho   explicitly    rejected\nGriffin’s argument that the Guidelines' disparate treatment of\ncrack and powder cocaine justifies a sentence below the advisory\nguideline range.       433 F.3d at 63.\n     By   contrast,     the   aggravating    factors     in    this   case   are\nundisputed.     Griffin was held accountable (without objection) for\n1.5 kilograms of cocaine base \"crack.\"              According to the U.S.\nAttorney, this quantity \"was one of the biggest ever in the State\nof New Hampshire.\"      It was also Griffin’s second crack conviction.\nEven worse, Griffin offended while still on supervised release\nfollowing 30 months in prison for his first offense, and Griffin’s\nco-conspirators were involved on both occasions.              Overall, Griffin\nis a drug user unable to function in society without resorting to\ndrug offenses to pay for his habit.         The risk of recidivism is thus\nhigher than average, and Judge DiClerico’s sentence is reasonable.\n\n\nConclusion\n     Because Judge DiClerico’s well-described explanation convinces\nus court that Griffin’s sentence is defensible on reasonableness\ngrounds, Jimenez-Beltre directs us to defer to Judge DiClerico’s\njudgment.    Accordingly, we AFFIRM Griffin’s sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f</pre>",
