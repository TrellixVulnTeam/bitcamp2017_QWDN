This is an appeal\n\nfrom a district court decision enforcing an arbitration award. The\n\nAirline Pilots Association, International (the “Association” or\n\n“ALPA”) petitioned the district court to enforce an award on behalf\n\nof Shahir Selim against Pan American Airways Corporation (“Pan\n\nAm”).    The district court granted that petition in full.                      We now\n\naffirm in part and reverse in part, with directions that the\n\ndistrict    court       remand    to    the    original   arbitration        panel   for\n\nclarification of the award.\n\n                                   I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            Shahir Selim is an airline pilot.               He worked for Pan Am\n\nunder a collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement” or “CBA”).\n\nThe Association is the collective bargaining representative for the\n\npilots employed by Pan Am.\n\n            The Agreement provides for unresolved grievances arising\n\nunder it to be submitted to binding arbitration before the Pan Am\n\nAirway     Pilots'       System    Board        of   Adjustment   (the       “Board”).\n\nGrievances are heard by panels comprised of representatives of Pan\n\nAm and the Association, along with one neutral arbitrator.\n\n            Between       August       and    October   2001,   Selim    filed       five\n\ngrievances against Pan Am.              Only two are relevant here:\n\n                    •      Failure       to    Promote.   Selim   was    a\n\n            Flight Engineer when he began working for Pan\n\n            Am in 1999.          He submitted a permanent bid to\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f          be upgraded to First Officer or, preferably,\n\n          Captain.         He became a First Officer in January\n\n          2000.        In March 2000, Pan Am promoted to\n\n          Captain a pilot with less seniority than Selim\n\n          without giving him a chance to train for and\n\n          be upgraded to Captain upon completion of the\n\n          required training.         On August 28, 2001, Selim\n\n          grieved the Company's failure to promote him.\n\n                  •        Improper Discharge.    On October 5,\n\n          2001, while Selim was preparing to board a Pan\n\n          Am flight as a passenger, he took issue with\n\n          instructions from flight personnel that he\n\n          check baggage that he thought he could carry\n\n          on.     Pan Am fired Selim on October 29, 2001\n\n          based       on    that   incident.     Selim   filed   a\n\n          grievance challenging his termination.\n\n          When the parties could not resolve Selim's grievances,\n\nthe Association pursued arbitration before the Board.                A three-\n\nmember Board panel held hearings on all five grievances in May and\n\nJune 2002.   It issued its decision and award (the “Arbitration\n\nDecision” and “Award”) on November 7, 2002.\n\n          Meanwhile, according to Pan Am, economic difficulties\n\nforced it to institute a system-wide furlough of its pilots,\n\nbeginning in September 2002.           Pan Am claims that a pilot with\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fSelim's seniority would have been placed on unpaid furlough on\n\nSeptember 12, 2002.1\n\n           The   Association    claims    Pan   Am   never   notified Selim\n\n(before or after the Board decision) that he was being furloughed,\n\nas required by the Agreement.      According to the Association, this\n\nfailure to notify Selim prevented him from grieving the furlough if\n\nhe had thought it improper.       The Association also claims that if\n\nSelim had been furloughed, rather than discharged, he would have\n\nbeen entitled to benefits he did not receive.          It notes that there\n\nmay be other factual issues or problems with Pan Am's claim that\n\nSelim would have been furloughed on the specified dates.\n\n           On May 28, 2003, Pan Am sent Selim a letter notifying him\n\nthat he was “hereby recalled from furlough status and directed to\n\nreport for active employment,” effective June 23, 2003.               Selim\n\nreturned   to    work   as   directed.     Meanwhile,    the    Association\n\nmaintained, and it has continued to maintain, that he was never in\n\nfact furloughed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Pan Am's allegations regarding the furlough are contained\nin an affidavit it submitted in district court in opposition to the\nAssociation's summary judgment motion. See infra pp. 6 and 20-21.\nThe Association does not deny that the system-wide furlough\noccurred, nor that Selim would have been subject to it (in\naccordance with his seniority) if he had not previously been fired.\nAs discussed below, there is some question as to whether Pan Am\nproperly introduced the facts regarding the furlough.            We\nnonetheless recite these facts here for background.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f     A.    The Arbitration Decision and Award\n\n           In the November 2002 Arbitration Decision, the Board\n\nresolved four grievances in Selim's favor2 and one against him.3\n\nThe Award concluded with a “Note” (by the neutral arbitrator)\n\nstating:   “Concerning all of the above awards, I shall retain\n\njurisdiction to resolve any financial matters if the parties are\n\nunable to agree.”\n\n           As to the grievances relevant on appeal:\n\n           1.   Failure to Promote.   The Board found that Pan Am\n\nshould have chosen Selim for Captain training in March 2000.     It\n\nheld that Pan Am's failure to give him the opportunity to complete\n\nthis training represented a continuing violation of his seniority\n\nrights. Because Selim had not filed his grievance until August 28,\n\n2001, the Board was “reluctant to grant back pay for one and one-\n\nhalf years since no official complaint had been made.”     The Award\n\ntherefore provided:\n\n           The Company shall retroactively recompute the\n           Grievant's wage scale to that of Captain\n           effective August 28, 2001 and he shall be\n           selected for Captain's training for the next\n           upgrade to Captain. . . .\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          The four grievances resolved in Selim's favor involved:\n(1) reimbursement of moving expenses; (2) unreasonably keeping\nSelim out of service for medical reasons despite his having passed\ntwo physicals; (3) failing to give him the chance for promotion to\nCaptain in accord with his seniority; and (4) his discharge.\n     3\n           This grievance involved reimbursement of travel expenses.\n\n                                -5-\n\f            2.        Improper Discharge.     The Board found that, in the\n\nincident for which he was fired, Selim had “resisted a reasonable\n\ninstruction to check his flight bag.”              The Board determined that\n\nthis conduct, while “serious,” was not as egregious as Pan Am\n\nalleged.         It   noted   that     “Grievant    had     never    been   warned,\n\ndisciplined, or even counseled about his conduct” previously.                   The\n\nBoard held that his conduct did “not justify discharge for a first\n\noffense.”    It “reduced [the discharge] to a 90 day suspension.”\n\nThe Award provided:\n\n            The termination of the Grievant is set aside.\n            He shall be reimbursed to service with\n            retention of seniority and other benefits, but\n            he shall receive a 90 day suspension.\n\n     B.     Proceedings in the District Court\n\n            In April 2003, the Association filed this lawsuit to\n\nenforce the Award.         Pan Am had not then complied with any of the\n\nAward's requirements, despite several demand letters from the\n\nAssociation.\n\n            On March 15, 2004, the Association filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment supported by a statement of material facts not in\n\ndispute. Pan Am responded with an “Objection” to the motion.                     In\n\nboth its Objection and its supporting memorandum of law, Pan Am\n\nmaintained   that       “there   are    genuine    issues    of     material   fact”\n\nprecluding summary judgment.             Pan Am bolstered this claim with\n\nspecific citations to supporting affidavits.                It did not, however,\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsupport its legal memorandum with a separate statement of the\n\nmaterial facts that it claimed were in dispute.\n\n           Pan   Am   argued,   inter    alia,   that:   (1)     the     award   of\n\nCaptain's pay to Selim was improper because the Agreement allowed\n\nonly those who had completed Captain's training to be paid at that\n\nrate, and Selim had not done so; and (2) any back pay award should\n\nnot include pay for the time Selim would have been on furlough if\n\nhe had not been discharged.\n\n           On June 22, 2004, the district court granted the summary\n\njudgment   motion     in    full.   The    district      court    adopted        the\n\nAssociation's statement of facts.         It deemed those facts admitted\n\npursuant to Rule 7.2 of the Local Rules of the District of New\n\nHampshire because Pan Am “did not include a statement of material\n\nfacts as to which it contends a genuine dispute exists.”\n\n           The district court rejected Pan Am's argument that the\n\nretroactive   award    of    Captain's    pay    to   Selim,     prior    to     his\n\ncompletion of training, was inconsistent with the Agreement and\n\ntherefore exceeded the Board's authority.              The court focused on\n\narbitrators' broad discretion in shaping remedies:\n\n           When   an  arbitrator   is   commissioned   to\n           interpret and apply the collective bargaining\n           agreement, he is to bring his informed\n           judgment to bear in order to reach a fair\n           solution of a problem.     This is especially\n           true when it comes to formulating remedies.\n           There the need is for flexibility in meeting a\n           wide variety of situations.\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f(citing United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel & Car Corp., 363\n\nU.S. 593, 597 (1960)).      Recognizing that the Agreement did not\n\nprovide “specific remedies . . . for breach of contract,” the court\n\nheld that the “arbitrators had discretion to formulate an award to\n\neffectuate the purposes of the agreement.”\n\n          The district court also rejected Pan Am's argument that\n\nSelim should not receive back pay for the period from September 11,\n\n2002 through June 23, 2003, when he allegedly would have been on\n\nunpaid furlough if he had been reinstated on January 13, 2002, when\n\nthe 90-day   suspension   authorized   by   the   Award   expired.   The\n\ndistrict court refused to consider Pan Am's claim that the back pay\n\naward should be understood not to include pay for that nine-month\n\nfurlough period. The court explained that this “partial defense to\n\npayment” was “not raised before the arbitrators” nor in Pan Am's\n\nanswer or discovery plan.    It held that:\n\n          Defendant could have, and should have, raised\n          this matter before the Board either before the\n          Award or shortly thereafter. It is beyond the\n          jurisdiction of this court to change the Award,\n          that is, to address the merits. The award is\n          enforced as issued and plaintiff is to be paid\n          effective as of January 13, 2002.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f                                  II.    DISCUSSION\n\n     A.        Standard of Review\n\n               We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.     Boston & Maine Corp. v. Bhd. of Maint. of Way Employees,\n\n94 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n               In reviewing a decision enforcing an arbitration award,\n\nwe give great deference to the arbitration process, as we expect\n\nthe district court to do.           Id. at 18-19.       Indeed, court review of\n\narbitral       decisions     is    “extremely         narrow    and      exceedingly\n\ndeferential.”       Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321,\n\n330 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation omitted).                      Courts should\n\n“vacate an arbitral award only in rare circumstances, such as when\n\nthere    was    misconduct   by    the    arbitrator,      when    the    arbitrator\n\nexceeded the scope of her authority, or when the award was made in\n\nmanifest disregard of the law.”             JCI Communications v. Int'l Bhd.\n\nof Elec. Workers, 324 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n        B.     Failure to Promote\n\n               Pan Am argues that the Board “cannot have . . . intended”\n\nto award Selim Captain's pay prior to his completion of Captain's\n\ntraining       because   that     “would        be   contrary     to   several   CBA\n\nprovisions.”      Therefore, Pan Am claims, the Award is ambiguous and\n\nthis issue should be remanded to the Board for reconsideration.\n\n               The Award provides that the “Company shall retroactively\n\nrecompute the Grievant's wage scale to that of Captain effective\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fAugust 28, 2001.”    (Emphasis added.)         There is nothing ambiguous\n\nabout this directive.\n\n           The Award further provides that Selim “shall be selected\n\nfor Captain's training for the next upgrade to Captain.”                       The\n\nsimultaneous award of a retroactive raise and provision for future\n\ntraining confirms the Board's awareness that Selim would receive\n\nCaptain's pay before completing that training. Moreover, the Board\n\nacknowledged that “Grievant would have to successfully complete\n\nthat training before he could actually serve as a Captain . . . .”\n\nThere is no reason to believe the Board did not mean what it said,\n\nand so no reason to send the promotion issue back to the Board.\n\n           Pan Am's argument therefore reduces to the claim that the\n\nBoard   exceeded   its    authority    by    crafting      a   remedy   that    is\n\ninconsistent with the Agreement. Pan Am points to the provision in\n\nthe Agreement that a “pilot may not be promoted based on seniority\n\nunless he [h]as met the basic Company qualifications . . . .”                  CBA\n\nSection 22(D)(3).    It also cites to the provision that a pilot's\n\npay is to be “based on his status and longevity with the Company.”\n\nCBA Section 3 (emphasis added).        Pan Am further notes that a pilot\n\npromoted   to   Captain   receives    a     raise   only   after   “successful\n\ncompletion” of training, and the raise is retroactive only to the\n\ndate training began.      CBA Section 24(F).\n\n           According to Pan Am, these provisions preclude paying\n\nanyone who has not qualified to serve as a Captain at the Captain's\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\frate.     Pan Am points out that the Board's “jurisdiction shall not\n\nextend to changes in . . . rates of compensation” covered by the\n\nAgreement.     CBA § 21(C)(1).      Therefore, Pan Am argues, the Board\n\nexceeded its jurisdiction by requiring payment to Selim at a rate\n\nto which he was not entitled under the Agreement.\n\n             The district court was right to reject this argument.\n\n“[W]here it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine\n\nremedies for contract violations that he finds, courts have no\n\nauthority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect.”\n\nUnited Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38\n\n(1987).     The Supreme Court has recognized that in “formulating\n\nremedies,” arbitrators must have “flexibility in meeting a wide\n\nvariety of situations.”          Enter. Wheel, 363 U.S. at 597.              Courts\n\nmust not “review the merits of an arbitration award.”                    Id. at 596.\n\n            Nothing in the Agreement establishes the appropriate\n\nremedy for     a   violation     such   as     the   one   found   here.      It   is\n\nunquestionably within the Board's jurisdiction to interpret the\n\nAgreement    as    needed   to   resolve       grievances    and    to    determine\n\nappropriate remedies for any violation of it. “Where, as here, the\n\nagreement    neither   requires     nor      bars    particular    remedies,       the\n\narbitrator's discretion is at its zenith.”                 Kraft Foods, Inc. v.\n\nOffice & Prof'l Employees Int'l Union, 203 F.3d 98, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (internal quotation omitted).              The Board had discretion to\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fdetermine that Selim ought not be penalized for Pan Am's failure to\n\nprovide him the opportunity to train for and become a Captain.\n\n            Pan   Am    also     argues     that    the      Board    exceeded     its\n\njurisdiction by “chang[ing]” “rates of compensation” under the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.               See CBA § 21(C)(1).             On the\n\ncontrary, however, the Board did not change the rates of pay\n\nprovided for under the Agreement.               Instead, it determined what\n\ndamages Selim had suffered as a result of Pan Am's breach of\n\ncontract and crafted a remedy to compensate him for those damages.\n\nThere is nothing extraordinary or problematic about such a remedy.\n\nCf. Kraft Foods, 203 F.3d at 101-02 (clause barring arbitrator from\n\nmodifying      collective      bargaining      agreement      does     not     prevent\n\narbitrator from crafting appropriate remedy to cure breach).\n\n            Pan Am argues that the Award improperly placed Selim in\n\na   position    “that   he   had   no   right      to   be   in”     without    having\n\nsuccessfully qualified for it.            The lone case it cites for this\n\nmerely affirms a decision by a district court (as distinguished\n\nfrom an arbitrator) denying back pay in a particular case. Cabarga\n\nCruz v. Fundacion Educativa Ana G. Mendez, Inc., 822 F.2d 188, 192-\n\n93 (1st Cir. 1987) (approving denial of back pay where plaintiff\n\nneither asked for a chance to pass the test the employer denied him\n\nnor provided any evidence he would have passed it).                    Cabarga does\n\nnot hold, or even suggest, that back pay is never an acceptable\n\nremedy when an employer's actions prevented an employee from\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fsatisfying some prerequisite to the position in question, much less\n\nthat it is an unacceptable remedy in an arbitration.                          The case is\n\nsimply inapplicable here, as we do not review the merits of an\n\narbitrator's       decision.        The    question       of   whether    this       is   an\n\nappropriate or fair remedy goes directly to the merits -- and is\n\nthus well within the Board's discretion.\n\n     C.     Improper Discharge\n\n            The     Board    reduced       Selim's      discharge        to    a     90-day\n\nsuspension.    The Award provided that Selim “shall be reimbursed to\n\nservice with retention of seniority and other benefits” following\n\nhis suspension.       The suspension period expired January 13, 2002.\n\n            The    parties     agree      that   this     means   Selim       was    to   be\n\nreinstated with back pay as of January 13, 2002.                   They disagree as\n\nto what that means with respect to the 9-month period (from\n\nSeptember 12, 2002 through June 23, 2003) during which Pan Am\n\nclaims Selim would have been on furlough along with all other\n\npilots of his seniority.\n\n            The district court refused to consider this argument. It\n\nheld that “Defendant could have, and should have, raised this\n\nmatter    before    the     Board   either       before    the    Award       or    shortly\n\nthereafter.”       (Emphasis added.)             The court stated that it was\n\nbeyond its jurisdiction “to change the Award, that is, to address\n\nthe merits.       The Award is enforced as issued . . . .”                     (Emphasis\n\nadded.)\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f              In reviewing this holding, we distinguish between two\n\nquestions -- one substantive, one procedural -- that the district\n\ncourt did not address separately. First, what does the Award mean?\n\nDoes it require payment for the hypothetical furlough period, or is\n\nit ambiguous?      Second, it is a separate question whether, if the\n\nAward is ambiguous, Pan Am has forfeited its right to pursue its\n\ninterpretation of the Award.\n\n              We must determine whether each of these questions is for\n\nthe arbitrator or the court in the first instance.\n\n              1.   What the Award Means\n\n              Implicit in the district court's holding that it could\n\nnot “change” the Award is the assumption that the Award “as issued”\n\nmeant what the Association said the Award meant.           Though claiming\n\nto avoid the issue of what the Award required, the court simply\n\nadopted, without       analysis   or    justification,   the   Association's\n\nreading of it.     That is, the holding assumes that the Award in fact\n\nrequires back pay for all days after January 13, 2002, and not just\n\nthose days that Selim would have been paid absent his wrongful\n\ntermination.\n\n              We find that Pan Am has raised a legitimate question as\n\nto how the Award should be interpreted.             The Award is naturally\n\nsilent as to how a furlough period should be treated, since that\n\nissue   was    never   raised   before    the   Board.   The   Board's   only\n\nstatement -- that Selim should “be reimbursed to service with\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fretention of seniority” -- does not directly mention back pay, much\n\nless   address   how   it   is   to   be     calculated,   in   light   of   the\n\nhypothetical furlough period or otherwise.\n\n           While the Board's opinion establishes that the award for\n\nback pay is to begin 90 days after Selim's wrongful termination\n\n(i.e., January 13, 2002), this need not mean that he is entitled to\n\nbe paid from that day forward, without regard to any changes in\n\ncircumstance or relevant external factors.           Pan Am points out that\n\nthe Board approved disciplining Selim for his conduct (albeit less\n\nharshly than it had originally done).            Pan Am thus argues that it\n\nis unreasonable to think the Board intended Selim to receive more\n\nthan he would have received had he never been fired, as would\n\nhappen here if he is paid for the hypothetical furlough period.\n\n           Instead, Pan Am argues that the back pay remedy should be\n\ninterpreted as a traditional “make-whole” remedy. It points to the\n\nAgreement's provision that a pilot who has wrongly been held out of\n\nservice shall “be reinstated without loss of seniority, and shall\n\nbe paid for such time lost in an amount which he normally would\n\nhave earned had he been continued in service during such period.”\n\nCBA Section 19(E)(1) (emphasis added).            According to Pan Am, the\n\nBoard's Award should be understood as consistent with this remedial\n\nprovision.   The “clear intent,” Pan Am says, “is for a wrongfully-\n\ndischarged employee to be reinstated and reimbursed so as to put\n\nhim in the position he would have been in if the termination had\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fnot taken place.”      Here, Pan Am says, that cannot be accomplished\n\nby paying Selim for a nine-month period when all other pilots of\n\nhis seniority level were on unpaid furlough.\n\n          Pan   Am's    construction      of   the   Award   is    sufficiently\n\nplausible for us to find the Award ambiguous with respect to how\n\nback pay should be calculated in light of the furlough.                    Given\n\nthis, Pan Am's interpretation -- that back pay should be calculated\n\nso as to put Selim in the position he would have been but for the\n\nunlawful discharge      --    is   not   inconsistent   with      the   Award   or\n\notherwise unreasonable.        Cf. Roman v. Maietta Constr., Inc., 147\n\nF.3d 71, 76-77 (1st Cir. 1998) (upholding deduction of compensatory\n\ntime from back pay award even though deduction was not statutorily\n\nauthorized; calculation was “fair and permissible,” and “plaintiffs\n\nare entitled to be made whole, not to a windfall”); E. Me. Med.\n\nCtr. v. NLRB, 658 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1981) (“caution[ing] the\n\nBoard to exercise care in calculating back pay to include only\n\nthose amounts that would have been granted but for the hospital's\n\nunlawful conduct”).          We therefore reject the district court's\n\nconclusion that enforcing the Award “as issued” requires adopting\n\nthe Association's interpretation of it.\n\n          2.    Procedural Objections to Clarification of the Award\n\n          Ordinarily, a dispute as to how to interpret an arbitral\n\naward such as the present one should be remanded to, and resolved\n\nby, the Board that issued it.        Although the parties do not mention\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fit, the Railway Labor Act4 requires arbitration agreements between\n\nairlines and their employees to “provide that any difference\n\narising as to the meaning, or the application of the provisions, of\n\nan award made by a board of arbitration shall be referred back for\n\na ruling to the same board, or, by agreement, to a subcommittee of\n\nsuch board.”   45 U.S.C. § 158(m).\n\n          Where an attempt to “enforce” an award generates or\n\nreveals a dispute requiring interpretation of the award's scope or\n\napplication, that dispute “must be referred to a reconvened board\n\nof arbitration for determination.”    W. Air Lines, Inc. v. Labor\n\nComm'r of Div. of Labor Law Enforcement, 167 F.2d 566, 567 (9th\n\nCir. 1948) (reversing district court order enforcing arbitration\n\naward and directing remand to arbitrator for clarification of\n\naward). See Locals 2222, 2320-2327, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v.\n\nNew Eng. Tel. & Tel. Co., 628 F.2d 644, 647 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(confirming authority of courts to resubmit arbitration award to\n\noriginal arbitrators for interpretation and affirming remand for\n\nthat purpose); see generally Stanton v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 669\n\nF.2d 833, 836 (1st Cir. 1982) (affirming remand for arbitration)\n\n(“The policy favoring arbitration extends with particular force to\n\narbitration by system boards of adjustment[, which] . . . are\n\n\n     4\n          The provisions of the Railway Labor Act (with a few\nexceptions not relevant here) “cover every common carrier by air\nengaged in interstate or foreign commerce.” 45 U.S.C. § 181. The\napplicable provisions include those requiring and governing\narbitration of employment disputes, including 45 U.S.C. §§ 157-159.\n\n                               -17-\n\fcreated by the Railway Labor Act for the resolution of disputes\n\nbetween an air carrier and its employees [and] are the mandatory,\n\nexclusive      and   comprehensive       system    for    resolving        grievance\n\ndisputes.”) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n              Moreover, the Award here expressly notes the retention of\n\n“jurisdiction to resolve any financial matters if the parties are\n\nunable to agree.”         All this argues for remanding the question of\n\nhow the Award should be interpreted to the Board.\n\n              Nonetheless, the Association argues that the district\n\ncourt properly found that “Pan Am's contention that Mr. Selim would\n\nhave been furloughed from September 2002 to June 2003 . . . was\n\nuntimely raised and therefore would not be considered.”                    It claims\n\nthat Pan Am “had an obligation to raise the matter” of whether\n\nSelim would have been on furlough “before the System Board.”\n\n              Pan Am argues that “[n]othing in the Arbitration Decision\n\nor   ALPA's    petition     put   [it]    on    notice   of   a    claim    for   the\n\nextraordinary relief of an award of back pay for unpaid furlough\n\ntime.”   That is,     since the Award is ambiguous, there is no reason\n\nto   charge    Pan   Am   with    any   greater   reason      to   anticipate     the\n\nAssociation's interpretation than the Association had to anticipate\n\nPan Am's interpretation.           Thus, Pan Am argues that the district\n\ncourt “penalize[d] [it] for failing to predict a highly unusual\n\ninterpretation of an arbitration award.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f             We cannot accept the parties' invitation to enter this\n\nthicket and determine whether Pan Am's actions, or failures to act,\n\npreclude it from seeking clarification of the Award from the Board.\n\nThe question of whether Pan Am has forfeited its right to have this\n\nissue arbitrated is itself properly addressed initially to the\n\nBoard rather than to the federal courts.\n\n             Although it might not be apparent on the surface, at\n\nbottom   the       question   here    is   a   classic   one    of   procedural\n\narbitrability:        is it for the court or the arbitrator to decide\n\ninitially    whether      a   party   is   foreclosed    from   arbitrating    a\n\nparticular issue, otherwise subject to arbitration?                     We have\n\naddressed this question in related contexts: “issues of procedural\n\narbitrability are for the arbitrator to decide.”               Local 285, Serv.\n\nEmployees Int'l Union v. Nonotuck Res. Assocs., Inc., 64 F.3d 735,\n\n739 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston,\n\n376 U.S. 543, 557 (1964)).           “Once it is determined, . . . that the\n\nparties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to\n\narbitration, ‘procedural’ questions which grow out of the dispute\n\nand   bear    on    its   final   disposition     should   be    left   to   the\n\narbitrator.”        John Wiley, 376 U.S. at 557.         Such issues include\n\n“whether [grievance] procedures have been followed or excused, or\n\nwhether the unexcused failure to follow them avoids the duty to\n\narbitrate.”    Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f             It is thus up to the Board to determine in the first\n\ninstance here whether Pan Am, by its conduct, forfeited its right\n\nto argue that Selim was (or would have been) furloughed, or that\n\nthe   back   pay   award   does   not   (or   should   not)   encompass   the\n\nhypothetical furlough period.           These questions “grow out of the\n\ndispute and bear on its final disposition.”            Id.    Barring Pan Am\n\nfrom seeking remand to the Board based on conduct that is for the\n\nBoard to evaluate would interfere with the parties' agreed method\n\nof resolving their disputes, and would not reflect the deference\n\nfederal courts owe arbitrators whose awards are before the courts\n\nfor enforcement.\n\n             Similarly, the factual issues the Association has raised\n\nregarding whether Selim was, or would have been, on furlough for\n\nthe period in question are not for the federal courts to resolve.\n\nFor example, whether Pan Am was required to notify Selim of the\n\nfurlough and failed to do so, whether it failed to provide him with\n\nbenefits the Agreement required it to provide, and, if so, whether\n\nit should be estopped from claiming he would have been furloughed\n\nare all questions that go to the merits of the dispute and so\n\nshould be addressed to the Board. That such factual disputes might\n\nexist does not foreclose us from causing the matter to be returned\n\nto the Board.\n\n             Nor do we believe that the Association could prevail by\n\narguing that Pan Am forfeited its right to seek remand to the Board\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fbecause of its failure to raise this issue earlier in federal court\n\n(as opposed to before the Board).     First, this was not the basis\n\nfor the district court's decision.    Although the court criticized\n\nPan Am for failing to raise this issue earlier in federal court,\n\nand adopted the Association's statement of facts because of Pan\n\nAm's violation of Local Rule 7.2, the court did not treat this\n\nconduct as grounds for procedural default.      Instead, the court\n\nrested its holding that Pan Am could not raise this “partial\n\ndefense” because it had not “raised this matter before the Board”\n\non the premises that: (1) any change to the Award could come only\n\nfrom the Board; and (2) the Award      “as issued” required payment\n\nwithout any deduction for the furlough dates in question. We agree\n\nwith the former proposition, but not the latter.     Indeed, it is\n\nprecisely because foreclosing Pan Am from making this argument\n\nmight change the Award -- by giving it an effect the Board never\n\nintended -- that we hesitate to reach such a result unnecessarily.\n\nWhile there may be some circumstances in which a party's conduct in\n\ncourt can control or alter the resolution of a matter the parties\n\nagreed to handle through arbitration, this is not such a case.\n\n          Pan Am's technical violation of Local Rule 7.2 does not\n\nprovide a reason to bar Pan Am from pursuing its interpretation of\n\nthe Award before the Board.    We need not determine whether the\n\nfactual issues regarding the furlough were adequately raised below\n\nor are properly in the record.        Because we conclude that the\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fparties' dispute must be resolved by the Board, not the federal\n\ncourts, what matters for our purposes is only the existence of the\n\ndispute, not its merits.   It is therefore irrelevant whether the\n\nfacts underlying the dispute are properly before us.\n\n          Although the Association suggests that Pan Am's argument\n\nthat the back pay award does not include the furlough time should\n\nbe considered an “affirmative defense” that Pan Am waived by not\n\npleading it in its answer, it does not explain why.    Any action to\n\nenforce an award necessarily (though often implicitly) involves the\n\nquestion of how that award is to be interpreted.       In a dispute\n\nbetween two potentially plausible interpretations, there is no\n\nbasis for considering one interpretation an “affirmative defense.”\n\nPan Am's “failure” to include its interpretation in its answer or\n\nas part of the discovery plan cannot justify taking away from the\n\nBoard the first opportunity to interpret the Award with respect to\n\na question the Board had not earlier confronted or anticipated.\n\nCf. Stanton, 669 F.2d at 838 (holding that airline's conduct was\n\n“neither so shocking nor so likely to taint the workings” of the\n\narbitration board “that somehow [it] ought to be ‘estopped’ from\n\nusing grievance arbitration” in particular case).\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion\n\nis AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part, and this case is REMANDED\n\nwith directions that the district court remand the matter to the\n\noriginal arbitration panel for clarification of the Award.\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

The Airline Pilots Association, International (the \"Association\" or \"ALPA\") petitioned the district court to enforce an award on behalf of Shahir Selim against Pan American Airways Corporation (\"Pan Am\"). The district court granted that petition in full. We now affirm in part and reverse in part, with directions that the district court remand to the original arbitration panel for clarification of the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shahir Selim is an airline pilot. He worked for Pan Am under a collective bargaining agreement (the \"Agreement\" or \"CBA\"). The Association is the collective bargaining representative for the pilots employed by Pan Am.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement provides for unresolved grievances arising under it to be submitted to binding arbitration before the Pan Am Airway Pilots' System Board of Adjustment (the \"Board\"). Grievances are heard by panels comprised of representatives of Pan Am and the Association, along with one neutral arbitrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between August and October 2001, Selim filed five grievances against Pan Am. Only two are relevant here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; <i>Failure to Promote.</i> Selim was a Flight Engineer when he began working for Pan Am in 1999. He submitted a permanent bid to be upgraded to First Officer or, preferably, Captain. He became a First Officer in January 2000. In March 2000, Pan Am promoted to Captain a pilot with less seniority than Selim without giving him a chance to train for and be upgraded to Captain upon completion of the required training. On August 28, 2001, Selim grieved the Company's failure to promote him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; <i>Improper Discharge.</i> On October 5, 2001, while Selim was preparing to board a Pan Am flight as a passenger, he took issue with instructions from flight personnel that he check baggage that he thought he could carry on. Pan Am fired Selim on October 29, 2001 based on that incident. Selim filed a grievance challenging his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the parties could not resolve Selim's grievances, the Association pursued arbitration before the Board. A three-member Board panel held hearings on all five grievances in May and June 2002. It issued its decision and award (the \"Arbitration Decision\" and \"Award\") on November 7, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, according to Pan Am, economic difficulties forced it to institute a system-wide furlough of its pilots, beginning in September 2002. Pan Am claims that a pilot with Selim's seniority would have been placed on unpaid furlough on September 12, 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Association claims Pan Am never notified Selim (before <i>or</i> after the Board decision) that he was being furloughed, as required by the Agreement. According to the Association, this failure to notify Selim prevented him from grieving the furlough if he had thought it improper. The Association also claims that if Selim had been furloughed, rather than discharged, he would have been entitled to benefits he did not receive. It notes that there may be other factual issues or problems with Pan Am's claim that Selim would have been furloughed on the specified dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 2003, Pan Am sent Selim a letter notifying him that he was \"hereby recalled from furlough status and directed to report for active employment,\" effective June 23, 2003. Selim returned to work as directed. Meanwhile, the Association maintained, and it has continued to maintain, that he was never in fact furloughed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Arbitration Decision and Award</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the November 2002 Arbitration Decision, the Board resolved four grievances in Selim's favor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and one against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Award concluded with a \"Note\" (by the neutral arbitrator) stating: \"Concerning all of the above awards, I shall retain jurisdiction to resolve any financial matters if the parties are unable to agree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As to the grievances relevant on appeal:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Failure to Promote.</i> The Board found that Pan Am should have chosen Selim for Captain training in March 2000. It held that Pan Am's failure to give him the opportunity to complete this training represented a continuing violation of his seniority rights. Because Selim had not filed his grievance until August 28, 2001, the Board was \"reluctant to grant back pay for one and one-half years since no official complaint had been made.\" The Award therefore provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company shall retroactively recompute the Grievant's wage scale to that of Captain effective August 28, 2001 and he shall be selected for Captain's training for the next upgrade to Captain....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Improper Discharge.</i> The Board found that, in the incident for which he was fired, Selim had \"resisted a reasonable instruction to check his flight bag.\" The Board determined that this conduct, while \"serious,\" was not as egregious as Pan Am alleged. It noted that \"Grievant had never been warned, disciplined, or even counseled about his conduct\" previously. The Board held that his conduct did \"not justify discharge for a first offense.\" It \"reduced [the discharge] to a 90 day suspension.\" The Award provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The termination of the Grievant is set aside. He shall be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority and other benefits, but he shall receive a 90 day suspension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Proceedings in the District Court</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, the Association filed this lawsuit to enforce the Award. Pan Am had not then complied with any of the Award's requirements, despite several demand letters from the Association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 2004, the Association filed a motion for summary judgment supported by a statement of material facts not in dispute. Pan Am responded with an \"Objection\" to the motion. In both its Objection and its supporting memorandum of law, Pan Am maintained that \"there are genuine issues of material fact\" precluding summary judgment. Pan Am bolstered this claim with specific citations to supporting affidavits. It did not, however, support its legal memorandum with a separate statement of the material facts that it claimed were in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that: (1) the award of Captain's pay to Selim was improper because the Agreement allowed only those who had completed Captain's training to be paid at that rate, and Selim had not done so; and (2) any back pay award should not include pay for the time Selim would have been on furlough if he had not been discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 2004, the district court granted the summary judgment motion in full. The district court adopted the Association's statement of facts. It deemed those facts admitted pursuant to Rule 7.2 of the Local Rules of the District of New Hampshire because Pan Am \"did not include a statement of material facts as to which it contends a genuine dispute exists.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Pan Am's argument that the retroactive award of Captain's pay to Selim, prior to his completion of training, was inconsistent with the Agreement and therefore exceeded the Board's authority. The court focused on arbitrators' broad discretion in shaping remedies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an arbitrator is commissioned to interpret and apply the collective bargaining agreement, he is to bring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem. This is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies. There the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citing <i>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel &amp; Car Corp.,</i> 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960)). Recognizing that the Agreement did not provide \"specific remedies ... for breach of contract,\" the court held that the \"arbitrators had discretion to formulate an award to effectuate the purposes of the agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also rejected Pan Am's argument that Selim should not receive back pay for the period from September 11, 2002 through June 23, 2003, when he allegedly would have been on unpaid furlough if he had been reinstated on January 13, 2002, when the 90-day suspension authorized by the Award expired. The district court refused to consider Pan Am's claim that the back pay award should be understood not to include pay for that nine-month furlough period. The court explained that this \"partial defense to payment\" was \"not raised before the arbitrators\" nor in Pan Am's answer or discovery plan. It held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant could have, and should have, raised this matter before the Board either before the Award or shortly thereafter.

Indeed, court review of arbitral decisions is \"extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential.\" <i>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson,</i> 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation omitted). Courts should \"vacate an arbitral award only in rare circumstances, such as when there was misconduct by the arbitrator, when the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority, or when the award was made in manifest disregard of the law.\" <i>JCI Communications v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec.

There is nothing ambiguous about this directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Award further provides that Selim \"shall be selected for Captain's training for the next upgrade to Captain.\" The simultaneous award of a retroactive raise and provision for future training confirms the Board's awareness that Selim would receive Captain's pay before completing that training. Moreover, the Board acknowledged that \"Grievant would have to successfully complete that training before he could actually serve as a Captain....\" There is no reason to believe the Board did not mean what it said, and so no reason to send the promotion issue back to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am's argument therefore reduces to the claim that the Board exceeded its authority by crafting a remedy that is inconsistent with the Agreement. Pan Am points to the provision in the Agreement that a \"pilot may not be promoted based on seniority unless he [h]as met the basic Company qualifications....\" CBA Section 22(D)(3). It also cites to the provision that a pilot's pay is to be \"based on <i>his status</i> and longevity with the Company.\" CBA Section 3 (emphasis added). Pan Am further notes that a pilot promoted to Captain receives a raise only after \"successful completion\" of training, and the raise is retroactive only to the date training began. CBA Section 24(F).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Pan Am, these provisions preclude paying anyone who has not qualified to serve as a Captain at the Captain's rate. Pan Am points out that the Board's \"jurisdiction shall not extend to changes in ... rates of compensation\" covered by the Agreement. CBA &#167; 21(C)(1). Therefore, Pan Am argues, the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by requiring payment to Selim at a rate to which he was not entitled under the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was right to reject this argument. \"[W]here it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he finds, courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect.\" <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987). The Supreme Court has recognized that in \"formulating remedies,\" arbitrators must have \"flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.\" <i>Enter. Wheel,</i> 363 U.S. at 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358. Courts must not \"review the merits of an arbitration award.\" <i>Id.</i> at 596, 80 S.Ct. 1358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the Agreement establishes the appropriate remedy for a violation such as the one found here. It is unquestionably within the Board's jurisdiction to interpret the Agreement as needed to resolve grievances and to determine appropriate remedies for any violation of it. \"Where, as here, the agreement neither requires nor bars particular remedies, the arbitrator's discretion is at its zenith.\" <i>Kraft Foods, Inc. v. Office &amp; Prof'l Employees Int'l Union,</i> 203 F.3d 98, 102 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation omitted). The Board had discretion to determine that Selim ought not be penalized for Pan Am's failure to provide him the opportunity to train for and become a Captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am also argues that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by \"chang[ing]\" \"rates of compensation\" under the collective bargaining agreement. <i>See</i> CBA &#167; 21(C)(1). On the contrary, however, the Board did not change the rates of pay provided for under the Agreement. Instead, it determined what damages Selim had suffered as a result of Pan Am's breach of contract and crafted a remedy to compensate him for those damages. There is nothing extraordinary or problematic about such a remedy. <i>Cf. Kraft Foods,</i> 203 F.3d at 101-02 (clause barring arbitrator from modifying collective bargaining agreement does not prevent arbitrator from crafting appropriate remedy to cure breach).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am argues that the Award improperly placed Selim in a position \"that he had no right to be in\" without having successfully qualified for it. The lone case it cites for this merely affirms a decision by a district court (as distinguished from an arbitrator) denying back pay in a particular case. <i>Cabarga Cruz v. Fundacion Educativa Ana G. Mendez, Inc.,</i> 822 F.2d 188, 192-93 (1st Cir.1987) (approving denial of back pay where plaintiff neither asked for a chance to pass the test the employer denied him nor provided any evidence he would have passed it). <i>Cabarga</i> does not hold, or even suggest, that back pay is never an acceptable remedy when an employer's actions prevented an employee from satisfying some prerequisite to the position in question, much less that it is an unacceptable remedy in an arbitration. The case is simply inapplicable here, as we do not review the merits of an arbitrator's decision. The question of whether this is an appropriate or fair remedy goes directly to the merits &#8212; and is thus well within the Board's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Improper Discharge</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board reduced Selim's discharge to a 90-day suspension. The Award provided that Selim \"shall be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority and other benefits\" following his suspension. The suspension period expired January 13, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that this means Selim was to be reinstated with back pay as of January 13, 2002. They disagree as to what that means with respect to the 9-month period (from September 12, 2002 through June 23, 2003) during which Pan Am claims Selim would have been on furlough along with all other pilots of his seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to consider this argument. It held that \"Defendant could have, and should have, raised this matter <i>before the Board</i> either before the Award or shortly thereafter.\" (Emphasis added.) The court stated that it was beyond its jurisdiction \"to <i>change</i> the Award, that is, to address the merits. The Award <i>is enforced as issued</i>....\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing this holding, we distinguish between two questions &#8212; one substantive, one procedural-that the district court did not address separately. First, what does the Award mean? Does it require payment for the hypothetical furlough period, or is it ambiguous? Second, it is a separate question whether, if the Award is ambiguous, Pan Am has forfeited its right to pursue its interpretation of the Award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine whether each of these questions is for the arbitrator or the court in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>What the Award Means</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicit in the district court's holding that it could not \"change\" the Award is the assumption that the Award \"<i>as issued</i>\" meant what the Association said the Award meant. Though claiming to avoid the issue of what the Award required, the court simply adopted, without analysis or justification, the Association's reading of it. That is, the holding assumes that the Award in fact requires back pay for <i>all days</i> after January 13, 2002, and not just those days that Selim <i>would have been paid</i> absent his wrongful termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that Pan Am has raised a legitimate question as to how the Award should be interpreted. The Award is naturally silent as to how a furlough period should be treated, since that issue was never raised before the Board. The Board's only statement &#8212; that Selim should \"<i>be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority</i>\" &#8212; does not directly mention back pay, much less address how it is to be calculated, in light of the hypothetical furlough period or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Board's opinion establishes that the award for back pay is to begin 90 days after Selim's wrongful termination (i.e., January 13, 2002), this need not mean that he is entitled to be paid from that day forward, without regard to any changes in circumstance or relevant external factors. Pan Am points out that the Board approved disciplining Selim for his conduct (albeit less harshly than it had originally done). Pan Am thus argues that it is unreasonable to think the Board intended Selim to receive <i>more</i> than he would have received had he never been fired, as would happen here if he is paid for the hypothetical furlough period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Pan Am argues that the back pay remedy should be interpreted as a traditional \"make-whole\" remedy. It points to the Agreement's provision that a pilot who has wrongly been held out of service shall \"be reinstated without loss of seniority, and shall be paid for such time lost in an <i>amount which he normally would have earned had he been continued in service during such period.</i>\" CBA Section 19(E)(1) (emphasis added). According to Pan Am, the Board's Award should be understood as consistent with this remedial provision. The \"clear intent,\" Pan Am says, \"is for a wrongfully-discharged employee to be reinstated and reimbursed so as to put him in the position he would have been in <i>if the termination had not taken place.</i>\" Here, Pan Am says, that cannot be accomplished by paying Selim for a nine-month period when all other pilots of his seniority level were on unpaid furlough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am's construction of the Award is sufficiently plausible for us to find the Award ambiguous with respect to how back pay should be calculated in light of the furlough. Given this, Pan Am's interpretation &#8212; that back pay should be calculated so as to put Selim in the position he would have been but for the unlawful discharge &#8212; is not inconsistent with the Award or otherwise unreasonable. <i>Cf. Roman v. Maietta Constr., Inc.,</i> 147 F.3d 71, 76-77 (1st Cir.1998) (upholding deduction of compensatory time from back pay award even though deduction was not statutorily authorized; calculation was \"fair and permissible,\" and \"plaintiffs are entitled to be made whole, not to a windfall\"); <i>E. Me. Med. Ctr. v. NLRB,</i> 658 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1981) (\"caution[ing] the Board to exercise care in calculating back pay to include only those amounts that would have been granted but for the hospital's unlawful conduct\"). We therefore reject the district court's conclusion that enforcing the Award \"as issued\" requires adopting the Association's interpretation of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Procedural Objections to Clarification of the Award</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a dispute as to how to interpret an arbitral award such as the present one should be remanded to, and resolved by, the Board that issued it. Although the parties do not mention it, the Railway Labor Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>requires</i> arbitration agreements between airlines and their employees to \"provide that any difference arising as to the meaning, or the application of the provisions, of an award made by a board of arbitration <i>shall be referred back for a ruling to the same board,</i> or, by agreement, to a subcommittee of such board.\" 45 U.S.C. &#167; 158(m).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an attempt to \"enforce\" an award generates or reveals a dispute requiring interpretation of the award's scope or application, that dispute \"must be referred to a reconvened board of arbitration for determination.\" <i>W.

Thus, Pan Am argues that the district court \"penalize[d][it] for failing to predict a highly unusual interpretation of an arbitration award.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot accept the parties' invitation to enter this thicket and determine whether Pan Am's actions, or failures to act, preclude it from seeking clarification of the Award from the Board. The question of whether Pan Am has forfeited its right to have this issue arbitrated is itself properly addressed initially to the Board rather than to the federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it might not be apparent on the surface, at bottom the question here is a classic one of procedural arbitrability: is it for the court or the arbitrator to decide initially whether a party is foreclosed from arbitrating a particular issue, otherwise subject to arbitration? We have addressed this question in related contexts: \"issues of procedural arbitrability are for the arbitrator to decide.\" <i>Local 285, Serv. Employees Int'l Union v. Nonotuck Res. Assocs., Inc.,</i> 64 F.3d 735, 739 (1st Cir.1995) (citing <i>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston,</i> 376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964)). \"Once it is determined, ... that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration, `procedural' questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator.\" <i>John Wiley,</i> 376 U.S. at 557, 84 S.Ct. 909. Such issues include \"whether [grievance] procedures have been followed or excused, or whether the unexcused failure to follow them avoids the duty to arbitrate.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus up to the Board to determine in the first instance here whether Pan Am, by its conduct, forfeited its right to argue that Selim was (or would have been) furloughed, or that the back pay award does not (or should not) encompass the hypothetical furlough period. These questions \"grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition.\" <i>Id.</i> Barring Pan Am from seeking remand to the Board based on conduct that is for the Board to evaluate would interfere with the parties' agreed method of resolving their disputes, and would not reflect the deference federal courts owe arbitrators whose awards are before the courts for enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the factual issues the Association has raised regarding whether Selim was, or would have been, on furlough for the period in question are not for the federal courts to resolve. For example, whether Pan Am was required to notify Selim of the furlough and failed to do so, whether it failed to provide him with benefits the Agreement required it to provide, and, if so, whether it should be estopped from claiming he would have been furloughed are all questions that go to the merits of the dispute and so should be addressed to the Board. That such factual disputes might exist does not foreclose us from causing the matter to be returned to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we believe that the Association could prevail by arguing that Pan Am forfeited its right to seek remand to the Board because of its failure to raise this issue earlier in federal court (as opposed to before the Board). First, this was not the basis for the district court's decision. Although the court criticized Pan Am for failing to raise this issue earlier in federal court, and adopted the Association's statement of facts because of Pan Am's violation of Local Rule 7.2, the court did not treat this conduct as grounds for procedural default. Instead, the court rested its holding that Pan Am could not raise this \"partial defense\" because it had not \"raised this matter before the Board\" on the premises that: (1) any change to the Award could come only from the Board; and (2) the Award \"as issued\" required payment without any deduction for the furlough dates in question. We agree with the former proposition, but not the latter. Indeed, it is precisely <i>because</i> foreclosing Pan Am from making this argument might change the Award &#8212; by giving it an effect the Board never intended &#8212; that we hesitate to reach such a result unnecessarily. While there <i>may</i> be some circumstances in which a party's conduct in court can control or alter the resolution of a matter the parties agreed to handle through arbitration, this is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am's technical violation of Local Rule 7.2 does not provide a reason to bar Pan Am from pursuing its interpretation of the Award before the Board. We need not determine whether the factual issues regarding the furlough were adequately raised below or are properly in the record. Because we conclude that the parties' dispute must be resolved by the Board, not the federal courts, what matters for our purposes is only the existence of the dispute, not its merits. It is therefore irrelevant whether the facts underlying the dispute are properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Association suggests that Pan Am's argument that the back pay award does not include the furlough time should be considered an \"affirmative defense\" that Pan Am waived by not pleading it in its answer, it does not explain why. Any action to enforce an award necessarily (though often implicitly) involves the question of how that award is to be interpreted. In a dispute between two potentially plausible interpretations, there is no basis for considering one interpretation an \"affirmative defense.\" Pan Am's \"failure\" to include its interpretation in its answer or as part of the discovery plan cannot justify taking away from the Board the first opportunity to interpret the Award with respect to a question the Board had not earlier confronted or anticipated. <i>Cf. Stanton,</i> 669 F.2d at 838 (holding that airline's conduct was \"neither so shocking nor so likely to taint the workings\" of the arbitration board \"that somehow [it] ought to be `estopped' from using grievance arbitration\" in particular case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part, and this case is REMANDED with directions that the district court remand the matter to the original arbitration panel for clarification of the Award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pan Am's allegations regarding the furlough are contained in an affidavit it submitted in district court in opposition to the Association's summary judgment motion<i>See infra</i> pp. 29 and 34-35.

The Airline Pilots Association, International (the \"Association\" or \"ALPA\") petitioned the district court to enforce an award on behalf of Shahir Selim against Pan American Airways Corporation (\"Pan Am\"). The district court granted that petition in full. We now affirm in part and reverse in part, with directions that the district court remand to the original arbitration panel for clarification of the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shahir Selim is an airline pilot. He worked for Pan Am under a collective bargaining agreement (the \"Agreement\" or \"CBA\"). The Association is the collective bargaining representative for the pilots employed by Pan Am.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement provides for unresolved grievances arising under it to be submitted to binding arbitration before the Pan Am Airway Pilots' System Board of Adjustment (the \"Board\"). Grievances are heard by panels comprised of representatives of Pan Am and the Association, along with one neutral arbitrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between August and October 2001, Selim filed five grievances against Pan Am. Only two are relevant here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; <i>Failure to Promote.</i> Selim was a Flight Engineer when he began working for Pan Am in 1999. He submitted a permanent bid to be upgraded to First Officer or, preferably, Captain. He became a First Officer in January 2000. In March 2000, Pan Am promoted to Captain a pilot with less seniority than Selim without giving him a chance to train for and be upgraded to Captain upon completion of the required training. On August 28, 2001, Selim grieved the Company's failure to promote him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; <i>Improper Discharge.</i> On October 5, 2001, while Selim was preparing to board a Pan Am flight as a passenger, he took issue with instructions from flight personnel that he check baggage that he thought he could carry on. Pan Am fired Selim on October 29, 2001 based on that incident. Selim filed a grievance challenging his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the parties could not resolve Selim's grievances, the Association pursued arbitration before the Board. A three-member Board panel held hearings on all five grievances in May and June 2002. It issued its decision and award (the \"Arbitration Decision\" and \"Award\") on November 7, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, according to Pan Am, economic difficulties forced it to institute a system-wide furlough of its pilots, beginning in September 2002. Pan Am claims that a pilot with Selim's seniority would have been placed on unpaid furlough on September 12, 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Association claims Pan Am never notified Selim (before <i>or</i> after the Board decision) that he was being furloughed, as required by the Agreement. According to the Association, this failure to notify Selim prevented him from grieving the furlough if he had thought it improper. The Association also claims that if Selim had been furloughed, rather than discharged, he would have been entitled to benefits he did not receive. It notes that there may be other factual issues or problems with Pan Am's claim that Selim would have been furloughed on the specified dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 2003, Pan Am sent Selim a letter notifying him that he was \"hereby recalled from furlough status and directed to report for active employment,\" effective June 23, 2003. Selim returned to work as directed. Meanwhile, the Association maintained, and it has continued to maintain, that he was never in fact furloughed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Arbitration Decision and Award</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the November 2002 Arbitration Decision, the Board resolved four grievances in Selim's favor<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and one against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Award concluded with a \"Note\" (by the neutral arbitrator) stating: \"Concerning all of the above awards, I shall retain jurisdiction to resolve any financial matters if the parties are unable to agree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As to the grievances relevant on appeal:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Failure to Promote.</i> The Board found that Pan Am should have chosen Selim for Captain training in March 2000. It held that Pan Am's failure to give him the opportunity to complete this training represented a continuing violation of his seniority rights. Because Selim had not filed his grievance until August 28, 2001, the Board was \"reluctant to grant back pay for one and one-half years since no official complaint had been made.\" The Award therefore provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company shall retroactively recompute the Grievant's wage scale to that of Captain effective August 28, 2001 and he shall be selected for Captain's training for the next upgrade to Captain....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Improper Discharge.</i> The Board found that, in the incident for which he was fired, Selim had \"resisted a reasonable instruction to check his flight bag.\" The Board determined that this conduct, while \"serious,\" was not as egregious as Pan Am alleged. It noted that \"Grievant had never been warned, disciplined, or even counseled about his conduct\" previously. The Board held that his conduct did \"not justify discharge for a first offense.\" It \"reduced [the discharge] to a 90 day suspension.\" The Award provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The termination of the Grievant is set aside. He shall be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority and other benefits, but he shall receive a 90 day suspension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Proceedings in the District Court</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2003, the Association filed this lawsuit to enforce the Award. Pan Am had not then complied with any of the Award's requirements, despite several demand letters from the Association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 2004, the Association filed a motion for summary judgment supported by a statement of material facts not in dispute. Pan Am responded with an \"Objection\" to the motion. In both its Objection and its supporting memorandum of law, Pan Am maintained that \"there are genuine issues of material fact\" precluding summary judgment. Pan Am bolstered this claim with specific citations to supporting affidavits. It did not, however, support its legal memorandum with a separate statement of the material facts that it claimed were in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am argued, <i>inter alia,</i> that: (1) the award of Captain's pay to Selim was improper because the Agreement allowed only those who had completed Captain's training to be paid at that rate, and Selim had not done so; and (2) any back pay award should not include pay for the time Selim would have been on furlough if he had not been discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 2004, the district court granted the summary judgment motion in full. The district court adopted the Association's statement of facts. It deemed those facts admitted pursuant to Rule 7.2 of the Local Rules of the District of New Hampshire because Pan Am \"did not include a statement of material facts as to which it contends a genuine dispute exists.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Pan Am's argument that the retroactive award of Captain's pay to Selim, prior to his completion of training, was inconsistent with the Agreement and therefore exceeded the Board's authority. The court focused on arbitrators' broad discretion in shaping remedies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an arbitrator is commissioned to interpret and apply the collective bargaining agreement, he is to bring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem. This is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies. There the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citing <i>United Steelworkers of Am. v.

The district court refused to consider Pan Am's claim that the back pay award should be understood not to include pay for that nine-month furlough period. The court explained that this \"partial defense to payment\" was \"not raised before the arbitrators\" nor in Pan Am's answer or discovery plan.

Moreover, the Board acknowledged that \"Grievant would have to successfully complete that training before he could actually serve as a Captain....\" There is no reason to believe the Board did not mean what it said, and so no reason to send the promotion issue back to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am's argument therefore reduces to the claim that the Board exceeded its authority by crafting a remedy that is inconsistent with the Agreement. Pan Am points to the provision in the Agreement that a \"pilot may not be promoted based on seniority unless he [h]as met the basic Company qualifications....\" CBA Section 22(D)(3). It also cites to the provision that a pilot's pay is to be \"based on <i>his status</i> and longevity with the Company.\" CBA Section 3 (emphasis added). Pan Am further notes that a pilot promoted to Captain receives a raise only after \"successful completion\" of training, and the raise is retroactive only to the date training began.

Pan Am points out that the Board's \"jurisdiction shall not extend to changes in ... rates of compensation\" covered by the Agreement. CBA &#167; 21(C)(1). Therefore, Pan Am argues, the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by requiring payment to Selim at a rate to which he was not entitled under the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was right to reject this argument. \"[W]here it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he finds, courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect.\" <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union v.

It is unquestionably within the Board's jurisdiction to interpret the Agreement as needed to resolve grievances and to determine appropriate remedies for any violation of it. \"Where, as here, the agreement neither requires nor bars particular remedies, the arbitrator's discretion is at its zenith.\" <i>Kraft Foods, Inc. v. Office &amp; Prof'l Employees Int'l Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198828\"><a href=\"/opinion/198828/foods-inc-v-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation omitted). The Board had discretion to determine that Selim ought not be penalized for Pan Am's failure to provide him the opportunity to train for and become a Captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am also argues that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction by \"chang[ing]\" \"rates of compensation\" under the collective bargaining agreement. <i>See</i> CBA &#167; 21(C)(1). On the contrary, however, the Board did not change the rates of pay provided for under the Agreement. Instead, it determined what damages Selim had suffered as a result of Pan Am's breach of contract and crafted a remedy to compensate him for those damages. There is nothing extraordinary or problematic about such a remedy. <i>Cf. Kraft Foods,</i> 203 F.3d at 101-02 (clause barring arbitrator from modifying collective bargaining agreement does not prevent arbitrator from crafting appropriate remedy to cure breach).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am argues that the Award improperly placed Selim in a position \"that he had no right to be in\" without having successfully qualified for it. The lone case it cites for this merely affirms a decision by a district court (as distinguished from an arbitrator) denying back pay in a particular case. <i>Cabarga Cruz v. Fundacion Educativa Ana G. Mendez, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490518\"><a href=\"/opinion/490518/dr-ricardo-cabarga-cruz-v-fundacion-educativa-ana-g-mendez-inc-dr/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 192-93 (1st Cir.1987) (approving denial of back pay where plaintiff neither asked for a chance to pass the test the employer denied him nor provided any evidence he would have passed it). <i>Cabarga</i> does not hold, or even suggest, that back pay is never an acceptable remedy when an employer's actions prevented an employee from satisfying some prerequisite to the position in question, much less that it is an unacceptable remedy in an arbitration. The case is simply inapplicable here, as we do not review the merits of an arbitrator's decision. The question of whether this is an appropriate or fair remedy goes directly to the merits &#8212; and is thus well within the Board's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Improper Discharge</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board reduced Selim's discharge to a 90-day suspension. The Award provided that Selim \"shall be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority and other benefits\" following his suspension. The suspension period expired January 13, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that this means Selim was to be reinstated with back pay as of January 13, 2002. They disagree as to what that means with respect to the 9-month period (from September 12, 2002 through June 23, 2003) during which Pan Am claims Selim would have been on furlough along with all other pilots of his seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to consider this argument. It held that \"Defendant could have, and should have, raised this matter <i>before the Board</i> either before the Award or shortly thereafter.\" (Emphasis added.) The court stated that it was beyond its jurisdiction \"to <i>change</i> the Award, that is, to address the merits. The Award <i>is enforced as issued</i>....\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing this holding, we distinguish between two questions &#8212; one substantive, one procedural-that the district court did not address separately. First, what does the Award mean? Does it require payment for the hypothetical furlough period, or is it ambiguous? Second, it is a separate question whether, if the Award is ambiguous, Pan Am has forfeited its right to pursue its interpretation of the Award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine whether each of these questions is for the arbitrator or the court in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>What the Award Means</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicit in the district court's holding that it could not \"change\" the Award is the assumption that the Award \"<i>as issued</i>\" meant what the Association said the Award meant. Though claiming to avoid the issue of what the Award required, the court simply adopted, without analysis or justification, the Association's reading of it. That is, the holding assumes that the Award in fact requires back pay for <i>all days</i> after January 13, 2002, and not just those days that Selim <i>would have been paid</i> absent his wrongful termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that Pan Am has raised a legitimate question as to how the Award should be interpreted. The Award is naturally silent as to how a furlough period should be treated, since that issue was never raised before the Board. The Board's only statement &#8212; that Selim should \"<i>be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority</i>\" &#8212; does not directly mention back pay, much less address how it is to be calculated, in light of the hypothetical furlough period or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Board's opinion establishes that the award for back pay is to begin 90 days after Selim's wrongful termination (i.e., January 13, 2002), this need not mean that he is entitled to be paid from that day forward, without regard to any changes in circumstance or relevant external factors. Pan Am points out that the Board approved disciplining Selim for his conduct (albeit less harshly than it had originally done). Pan Am thus argues that it is unreasonable to think the Board intended Selim to receive <i>more</i> than he would have received had he never been fired, as would happen here if he is paid for the hypothetical furlough period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Pan Am argues that the back pay remedy should be interpreted as a traditional \"make-whole\" remedy. It points to the Agreement's provision that a pilot who has wrongly been held out of service shall \"be reinstated without loss of seniority, and shall be paid for such time lost in an <i>amount which he normally would have earned had he been continued in service during such period.</i>\" CBA Section 19(E)(1) (emphasis added). According to Pan Am, the Board's Award should be understood as consistent with this remedial provision. The \"clear intent,\" Pan Am says, \"is for a wrongfully-discharged employee to be reinstated and reimbursed so as to put him in the position he would have been in <i>if the termination had not taken place.</i>\" Here, Pan Am says, that cannot be accomplished by paying Selim for a nine-month period when all other pilots of his seniority level were on unpaid furlough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am's construction of the Award is sufficiently plausible for us to find the Award ambiguous with respect to how back pay should be calculated in light of the furlough. Given this, Pan Am's interpretation &#8212; that back pay should be calculated so as to put Selim in the position he would have been but for the unlawful discharge &#8212; is not inconsistent with the Award or otherwise unreasonable. <i>Cf. Roman v. Maietta Constr., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755371\"><a href=\"/opinion/755371/steven-roman-v-maietta-construction-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 76-77 (1st Cir.1998) (upholding deduction of compensatory time from back pay award even though deduction was not statutorily authorized; calculation was \"fair and permissible,\" and \"plaintiffs are entitled to be made whole, not to a windfall\"); <i>E.

We therefore reject the district court's conclusion that enforcing the Award \"as issued\" requires adopting the Association's interpretation of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Procedural Objections to Clarification of the Award</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a dispute as to how to interpret an arbitral award such as the present one should be remanded to, and resolved by, the Board that issued it.

Thus, Pan Am argues that the district court \"penalize[d][it] for failing to predict a highly unusual interpretation of an arbitration award.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot accept the parties' invitation to enter this thicket and determine whether Pan Am's actions, or failures to act, preclude it from seeking clarification of the Award from the Board.

Such issues include \"whether [grievance] procedures have been followed or excused, or whether the unexcused failure to follow them avoids the duty to arbitrate.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus up to the Board to determine in the first instance here whether Pan Am, by its conduct, forfeited its right to argue that Selim was (or would have been) furloughed, or that the back pay award does not (or should not) encompass the hypothetical furlough period. These questions \"grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition.\" <i>Id.</i> Barring Pan Am from seeking remand to the Board based on conduct that is for the Board to evaluate would interfere with the parties' agreed method of resolving their disputes, and would not reflect the deference federal courts owe arbitrators whose awards are before the courts for enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the factual issues the Association has raised regarding whether Selim was, or would have been, on furlough for the period in question are not for the federal courts to resolve. For example, whether Pan Am was required to notify Selim of the furlough and failed to do so, whether it failed to provide him with benefits the Agreement required it to provide, and, if so, whether it should be estopped from claiming he would have been furloughed are all questions that go to the merits of the dispute and so should be addressed to the Board. That such factual disputes might exist does not foreclose us from causing the matter to be returned to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we believe that the Association could prevail by arguing that Pan Am forfeited its right to seek remand to the Board because of its failure to raise this issue earlier in federal court (as opposed to before the Board). First, this was not the basis for the district court's decision. Although the court criticized Pan Am for failing to raise this issue earlier in federal court, and adopted the Association's statement of facts because of Pan Am's violation of Local Rule 7.2, the court did not treat this conduct as grounds for procedural default. Instead, the court rested its holding that Pan Am could not raise this \"partial defense\" because it had not \"raised this matter before the Board\" on the premises that: (1) any change to the Award could come only from the Board; and (2) the Award \"as issued\" required payment without any deduction for the furlough dates in question. We agree with the former proposition, but not the latter. Indeed, it is precisely <i>because</i> foreclosing Pan Am from making this argument might change the Award &#8212; by giving it an effect the Board never intended &#8212; that we hesitate to reach such a result unnecessarily. While there <i>may</i> be some circumstances in which a party's conduct in court can control or alter the resolution of a matter the parties agreed to handle through arbitration, this is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan Am's technical violation of Local Rule 7.2 does not provide a reason to bar Pan Am from pursuing its interpretation of the Award before the Board. We need not determine whether the factual issues regarding the furlough were adequately raised below or are properly in the record. Because we conclude that the parties' dispute must be resolved by the Board, not the federal courts, what matters for our purposes is only the existence of the dispute, not its merits. It is therefore irrelevant whether the facts underlying the dispute are properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Association suggests that Pan Am's argument that the back pay award does not include the furlough time should be considered an \"affirmative defense\" that Pan Am waived by not pleading it in its answer, it does not explain why. Any action to enforce an award necessarily (though often implicitly) involves the question of how that award is to be interpreted. In a dispute between two potentially plausible interpretations, there is no basis for considering one interpretation an \"affirmative defense.\" Pan Am's \"failure\" to include its interpretation in its answer or as part of the discovery plan cannot justify taking away from the Board the first opportunity to interpret the Award with respect to a question the Board had not earlier confronted or anticipated. <i>Cf. Stanton,</i> 669 F.2d at 838 (holding that airline's conduct was \"neither so shocking nor so likely to taint the workings\" of the arbitration board \"that somehow [it] ought to be `estopped' from using grievance arbitration\" in particular case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's opinion is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part, and this case is REMANDED with directions that the district court remand the matter to the original arbitration panel for clarification of the Award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pan Am's allegations regarding the furlough are contained in an affidavit it submitted in district court in opposition to the Association's summary judgment motion<i>See infra</i> pp. 29 and 34-35.
