Plaintiff Prisma Zona Exploratoria\n\nde Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Prisma Zona\") sued the Children's Trust Fund\n\nof Puerto Rico (the \"Trust Fund\") and others (including several\n\nhigh officials in the Puerto Rican government) under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§   1983    (2000).        Prisma   Zona      claims     that    the     defendants\n\ndiscriminated against it because of its affiliation with a rival\n\npolitical    party,   in    violation    of      its   rights   under    the   First\n\nAmendment and to due process and equal protection.                     The district\n\ncourt dismissed the suit under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state\n\na claim.    Prisma Zona Exploratoria de P.R., Inc. v. Calderón, 162\n\nF. Supp. 2d 1, 9-10 (D.P.R. 2001).            This appeal followed.\n\n            The   background    facts      are    largely   uncontested.        For\n\npresent purposes, we assume the truth of the allegations in the\n\ncomplaint and draw inferences in favor of the non-moving party,\n\nhere Prisma Zona.      Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).     However, we also draw where necessary upon undisputed\n\ndocuments that are in substance cross-referenced in the complaint.\n\nWatterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1993); accord Beddall\n\nv. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nAt oral argument, both sides said that the case could be treated as\n\none for summary judgment.\n\n            In January 1999, then Governor Pedro Rosselló of Puerto\n\nRico, a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), announced a\n\nplan to create a children's museum in Puerto Rico.                      The museum,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fmodeled on similar initiatives in Boston and elsewhere, was to\n\ninclude interactive exhibits, a theater and other attractions.               It\n\nwas to be built and operated using a portion of Puerto Rico's share\n\nof the master tobacco settlement of November 1998.\n\n           In April 1999, the Tourism Company, a state agency,\n\ncreated   a    public   corporation,         Prisma   El   Exploratorio,    Inc.\n\n(\"Exploratorio\"),       to   develop    the     preliminary    phase   of   the\n\nchildren's museum.       Prisma Zona says the plan was eventually to\n\nturn over ownership and control of the museum to a private non-\n\nprofit entity to free it from \"political partisanship.\"                      The\n\nfollowing month Exploratorio secured a $20 million line of credit\n\nwith the Government Development Bank (the \"Bank\")--another state\n\nentity--to help pay for the design and construction of the museum\n\nfacilities; the line of credit was to be repaid using the tobacco\n\nsettlement proceeds.         Ground breaking for the museum was held on\n\nOctober 7, 1999.\n\n              On July 30, 1999, Puerto Rico created the Children's\n\nTrust Fund, a public corporation, and assigned to it Puerto Rico's\n\nshare of the tobacco settlement.              Act No. 173 of July 30, 1999\n\n(codified at 24 LPRA § 3121 et seq. (2002)).               The statute created\n\na board of directors for the Trust Fund, consisting of four ex\n\nofficio members (the Governor, the Secretary of Justice, the\n\nPresident of the Bank, and the Director of the Office of Management\n\nand Budget) and three private persons appointed by the Governor,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fand gave it broad authority to allocate trust funds to improve the\n\nwelfare of Puerto Rico's children.        Id. §§ 4-5.    The Bank provides\n\nall   of   the   Trust   Fund's   staffing,   conducts    its    day-to-day\n\nmanagement, and serves as its disbursement agent and financial\n\nadvisor.    Id. §§ 12, 14.\n\n             On September 29, 1999, the Trust Fund board adopted\n\nregulations, pursuant to its statutory authority, establishing\n\nrequirements for the receipt and use of trust funds.            In addition,\n\nthe board approved Exploratorio's request for up to $60 million to\n\ncover museum expenses. Prisma Zona says the board also resolved to\n\ntransfer the grant to the private entity that would eventually\n\nsucceed to the project.\n\n            Earlier in that same month, several private citizens\n\nformed Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Prisma\n\nZona\"),    the   plaintiff   in   this    action,   to    take    over   the\n\nconstruction, ownership, and operation of the children's museum.\n\nThe company's founders and management had close ties to the NPP and\n\nits board of directors was selected by Governor Rosselló.                The\n\npresent case revolves around this new entity's effort to secure\n\ncontrol over the children's museum and its funds and the rebuff of\n\nthose efforts by a new administration under a different party.\n\n            In May 2000, Prisma Zona began negotiations with the\n\nTourism Company and its subsidiary Exploratorio to acquire the\n\nmuseum assets and to assume the responsibility for its development.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fOn June 16, 2000, it requested $60 million from the Trust Fund to\n\npay for the museum assets and to complete its construction and an\n\nadditional $17.5 million to operate it for three years.             The Trust\n\nFund board approved Prisma Zona's requests on August 30, 2000.\n\nThat day, Governor Rosselló (as president of the Trust Fund board)\n\nsent Prisma Zona a letter informing it of the board's approval but\n\nnoting additional required steps, including review of Prisma Zona's\n\nbudget and finalization of a contract containing \"details on the\n\nprocedures for the disbursement of funds.\"\n\n              On November 15, 2000, the Trust Fund issued $400 million\n\nin bonds to fund its projects and transferred nearly $10 million to\n\nthe Bank to cancel Exploratorio's outstanding line of credit. Both\n\nthe   Trust    Fund   and   the   Bank   (which   managed   the   bond   sale)\n\nrepresented in various documents (including a prospectus, tax\n\ncertificate, and bond contract) that a portion of the bond sale\n\nproceeds would be used for the \"acquisition, construction, and\n\nequipping of a children's museum . . . in Isla Grande, Santurce,\n\nPuerto Rico, to be owned and operated by [Prisma Zona].\"\n\n              On   November   29,    2000,    Prisma    Zona      reached   an\n\nunderstanding with the Tourism Company and Exploratorio to acquire\n\nthe museum project (the \"Transfer Agreement\"). The following month\n\nPrisma Zona began negotiating a service contract with the Trust\n\nFund. The Trust Fund prepared two form contracts (one each for the\n\ncapital and operational grants) and sent them to Prisma Zona for\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fits review on December 28, 2000. Prisma Zona says it made only\n\n\"minor\" changes to these documents before faxing them back to the\n\nTrust   Fund    the   same   day.         The   Trust    Fund   never    responded.\n\nNonetheless, Prisma Zona alleges that at this time \"the parties had\n\nagreed to the terms of the [service contracts] and the only action\n\nneeded was the non-discretionary ministerial act of signing the\n\nagreement.\"\n\n           As these events were unfolding, Puerto Rico was holding\n\nits 2000   elections.         During      the   campaign     for   Governor,     Sila\n\nCalderón, the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") candidate, promised\n\nto   investigate      a   number   of     Rosselló   administration          projects,\n\nincluding the children's museum, for corruption and misuse of\n\npublic monies. Calderón defeated the NPP candidate at the polls on\n\nNovember   7,    2000,      and    took    office       on   January    2,    2001.\n\n           In its subsequent complaint Prisma Zona alleged that from\n\nthe outset the new PDP administration attempted to undermine Prisma\n\nZona's role in the museum project because of its ties to NPP and\n\nformer Governor Rosselló. In particular, Prisma Zona said the Bank\n\n(as the Trust Fund's disbursement agent) has refused to pay museum\n\ninvoices that Prisma Zona has submitted since January 2001 and that\n\nthe Bank subjected it to a sham audit.                  Prisma Zona also alleged\n\nthat in May 2001, the Tourism Company filed a \"frivolous\" suit in\n\ncommonwealth court, seeking to invalidate the Transfer Agreement.\n\n(Thereafter the Puerto Rico Superior Court declared the Transfer\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAgreement void under Puerto Rico law.                Compañía de Turismo de\n\nPuerto Rico v. Prisma Zona Exploratoria de PR Inc., KAC2001-3380\n\n(506) (April 4, 2002).)\n\n                Prisma Zona filed this civil rights action in district\n\ncourt on June 22, 2001, naming as defendants the Trust Fund, the\n\nBank and various individuals in the Calderón administration.1\n\nPrisma Zona says defendants' refusal to carry through with the\n\ntransfer of assets and funding was motivated by Prisma Zona's\n\npolitical ties and violated its First Amendment, due process, and\n\nequal protection rights.         For relief, Prisma Zona seeks imposition\n\nof   a       constructive   trust,   disbursement   of   the   trust   funds,   a\n\ngenerally phrased injunction against the alleged harassment, and\n\npunitive damages.           After limited discovery, the district court\n\ndismissed the suit under Rule 12(b)(6).             Prisma Zona, 162 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 9-10.\n\n                The district court ruled that Prisma Zona did not have a\n\nbinding contract with the Trust Fund obligating it to fund Prisma\n\nZona.        Prisma Zona, 162 F. Supp. 2d at 4.       The court further held\n\nthat absent such a contract or its effective equivalent (e.g., an\n\n\n\n         1\n      The individual defendants include Sila Calderón, the Governor\nof Puerto Rico and president of the Trust Fund's board; Juan Agosto\nAlicea, president of the Bank and vice-president of the Trust\nFund's board; José V. Pagán, vice-president of the Bank and\nexecutive director of the Trust Fund; Jorge Pesquera, the executive\ndirector of the Tourism Company until June 30, 2001; and Milton\nSegarra Pancorbo, the current executive director of the Tourism\nCompany.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fongoing commercial relationship), the Trust Fund was free not to\n\ncontract with Prisma Zona even if political motives prompted that\n\ndecision.    Id. at 7-8.   Finally, the court said that even if First\n\nAmendment precedents were extended to cover new entities seeking to\n\ncontract, the defendants had a so-called Mount Healthy defense\n\nbecause they would for independent reasons have refused to disburse\n\nthe funds.    Id. at 8; see Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\n\n            The legal landscape for Prisma Zona's First Amendment\n\nclaim is a set of Supreme Court decisions starting in the 1970s.\n\nPolitically motivated hiring, firing and contracting by governments\n\nhas a long history in the United States; civil service reform\n\nstatutes are largely a response to this tradition.     But beginning\n\nwith Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme Court has\n\nadded a new layer of protection based on First Amendment grounds.\n\nSee also Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62 (1990);\n\nBranti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980).      How far that protection\n\nextends, often a debatable matter, is an issue of law which we\n\nreview de novo.\n\n            Prisma Zona claims that a completed contract exists\n\nbetween it and the Trust Fund.    Although a binding contract is not\n\nnecessarily a condition of First Amendment protection, it would\n\ngive Prisma Zona a much firmer basis in Supreme Court precedent to\n\nargue that it was protected from a politically motivated refusal to\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdeal, see, e.g., Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 685\n\n(1996), quite apart from its use as an independent basis for relief\n\nunder local law.    We accordingly begin with that question here.\n\n            In a nutshell, Prisma Zona applied to the Trust Fund for\n\nfunding to buy the museum assets, complete construction and operate\n\nthe project for three years.        The Trust Fund's president--then\n\nGovernor Rosselló--responded on August 30, 2000, that the board had\n\n\"favorably considered your proposed initiative,\" but his letter\n\ncontinued:\n\n            The granting of Assistance Service [i.e.,\n            funding] is subject to a review of the budget\n            and the details of the initiative. Prior to\n            receiving the funds requested, you must meet\n            with the Officers of the Trust to . . .\n            [verify information and budget] and to\n            finalize the Contract of Assistance Service.\n            The contract must contain details on the\n            procedures for the disbursement of funds.\n\nThe letter set forth other conditions that would govern the grant\n\nand said that if Prisma Zona indicated its agreement, the Trust\n\nFund would arrange for a further meeting.\n\n             Prisma Zona indicated its agreement and in December the\n\nparties moved toward adoption of two detailed \"service\" contracts,\n\none to    fund   capital   commitments   and   the   other   for   operating\n\nexpenses.     (From the government's standpoint, a private provider\n\nsuch as Prisma Zona agrees to provide services in exchange for the\n\ngrant.)     However, the Trust Fund's drafts were delivered only on\n\nDecember 28, 2000, they were returned with suggested changes by\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fPrisma Zona, and no final service contracts were signed.              Instead,\n\non January 2, 2001, a new administration took power in Puerto Rico\n\nand the Trust Fund declined to proceed.\n\n              On this appeal, Prisma Zona says that the original August\n\n30   letter    and   its   acceptance    constituted    a   binding   contract\n\npromising funding, that this contract was not \"conditioned\" on the\n\nadoption of service contracts, and in any event the latter were\n\nvirtually complete by the end of December save for a few details\n\nthat were not \"material.\"         Prisma Zona argues that under Puerto\n\nRico law, contract formation is a question of fact, turning on the\n\nintent of the parties, and at the very least the fact question\n\ncould not be resolved on a motion to dismiss but entitled Prisma\n\nZona to a jury trial.\n\n              Whether or not one calls the August 30 letter and reply\n\na \"contract,\" the critical question (given the relief sought) is\n\nwhether the Trust Fund ever assumed a binding obligation to make\n\ngrants to Prisma Zona.           As to this, the August 30 letter is\n\nexplicit on its face: that--other conditions aside--no funds could\n\nbe   provided     until    the   parties    had   \"finalized\"   the    service\n\ncontracts.      Further, as the district court pointed out, the Trust\n\nFund's own formal regulations provide that \"[a] service contract\n\nwill be entered into between the Trust Fund and the beneficiary\n\nentity\" and set forth issues that had to be addressed (e.g.,\n\n\"specific      clauses     delineating     the    responsibilities    of   the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fparties\").    Prisma Zona, 162 F. Supp. 2d at 4; accord Regulations\n\nfor the Requisites of Eligibility and the Criteria for Statutory\n\nMonitoring under the Statute for the Children's Fund, art. 5(c)\n\n(\"Trust Fund Regulations\").\n\n           Alternatively, Prisma Zona suggests that the letter and\n\nreply were \"a contract to make a contract.\"         This assumes, as we\n\nwill do at this stage, that Prisma Zona could develop factual\n\nevidence of such an intent on both sides.         But even if (assuming\n\nfurther)     this   theory   is   allowable   despite   the   Trust   Fund\n\nRegulations just quoted--and this is far from clear--a contract to\n\nmake a contract is enforceable only where all material terms have\n\nbeen agreed upon.       1 Corbin, Contracts, § 2.8, at 131, 133-34\n\n(Perillo ed. 1993).     Prisma Zona's own statements, and the service\n\ncontract drafts which it attaches, show that material issues were\n\nstill open.\n\n           Most obviously, the service contract drafts left blank a\n\nnumber of important terms, such as the amount of the grant.             In\n\naddition, in returning the service contract drafts with proposed\n\nchanges, Prisma Zona asked for a number of substantive changes. It\n\nwanted to limit the Trust Fund's ability to terminate the grant for\n\ncause to an exercise of reasonable discretion.           The Trust Fund\n\ndrafts required Prisma Zona to indemnify the Trust Fund for legal\n\nexpenses arising out of the grant--hardly a trivial matter, as this\n\ncase illustrates. In response, Prisma Zona's mark-ups required the\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fTrust Fund to use the government's legal representation before\n\nincurring separate expenses that Prisma Zona would have to cover.\n\nParties still short of agreement as to such substantive terms have\n\nnot completed their bargaining.\n\n            Nor is Prisma Zona's position helped by the surrounding\n\ncircumstances that it says bear out the claim of an existing\n\ncontract.    For example, the bond prospectus apparently said that\n\nfunds would go to Prisma Zona to operate the museum; but--whatever\n\nthe securities law implications--this is a statement as to what was\n\nintended, not a statement that the necessary contracts had already\n\nbeen negotiated.    Similarly, Prisma Zona says that the Trust Fund\n\nin fact paid out almost $10 million for Prisma Zona's acquisition\n\nof the museum, but this appears to have been an intra-governmental\n\npayment from the Trust Fund to the Tourism Company to reimburse it\n\nfor funding the museum's initial investment.\n\n            All such events show is what is already conceded, namely,\n\nthat the Rosselló administration intended that the various agencies\n\ninvolved cooperate to transfer the museum and additional funding to\n\nPrisma Zona.   Indeed, the process was not only intended, but steps\n\njust short of a final legal commitment continued even after the\n\nNovember 2000 election.    Nevertheless, the service contracts were\n\nnot completed, let alone signed, before the new administration took\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\foffice      in    January   2001.        Thus,    there     was   no    binding      legal\n\nobligation to fund Prisma Zona.2\n\n                 Prisma Zona has another string to its bow.               It says that\n\nit   need    not     have   a   right    to   a    benefit    (in      this    case,   the\n\ncontractual right to funding) to be protected under the First\n\nAmendment against a politically motivated denial of that benefit.\n\nAs   an   abstraction,      this    is    so:     several    early     cases    involved\n\npolitical firings of low-level employees who lacked civil service\n\nor contract protection.            Branti, 445 U.S. at 515; Elrod, 427 U.S.\n\nat 350-51 (plurality opinion).                Today's protection also extends\n\nbeyond      discharging     current      employees     to    employee         hiring   and\n\npromotion decisions.            Rutan, 497 U.S. at 79.\n\n                 Although   current      or     would-be     employees        have     been\n\nspecially favored, the Court has also afforded some protection to\n\nbusinesses that deal with the government, O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc.\n\nv.

We decline,\nnot only because the theory is only adverted to perfunctorily on\nappeal, United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied 494 U.S. 1082 (1990), but also because its argument fails\nentirely to demonstrate the unjust enrichment that would invoke\nthis court's equitable powers, see Corporación Insular de Seguros\nv. Reyes Munoz, 849 F. Supp. 126, 135 (D.P.R. 1994) (discussing the\nrequirements of constructive trust under both Puerto Rican and\ngeneral contract law).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fless       certain   once   one   goes    beyond   existing   commercial\n\nrelationships, see id. at 685.      The next area of contest appears to\n\nrevolve around those who wish for the first time to bid for\n\ngovernment contracts. On this issue, the Supreme Court has not yet\n\nspoken definitively, and the circuits appear to be divided.3\n\n              Happily, such large questions as to whether the Elrod\n\nline will continue to expand need not be decided to dispose of this\n\ncase.      We will assume, purely arguendo, that a state government\n\ncould not invite bids to supply pencils to the state with the\n\ncaveat that no company headed by a Democrat could apply.        Further,\n\nat this stage of fact development, Prisma Zona is entitled to the\n\nassumption--which may or may not be correct--that party politics\n\nplayed a role in the Calderón administration's refusal to make the\n\npreviously intended grant.\n\n              Nevertheless, whatever may be true of pencil contracts,\n\nwe decline to hold that the First Amendment requires politically\n\nimmaculate state decision-making in cases like this. Even in core\n\ncases involving politically motivated hirings and firings, the\n\nSupreme Court has itself recognized that a wholly antiseptic\n\napplication of the Elrod principle is unrealistic.       Instead, party\n\n\n       3\n      See, e.g. Lucas v. Monroe County, 203 F.3d 964, 972 (6th Cir.\n2000) (tow truck operator who had never been called was protected\nfrom removal from the call list), McClintock v. Eichelberger, 169\nF.3d 812, 817 (3d Cir.) (limiting Umbehr and O'Hare to ongoing\ncommercial relationships), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 876 (1999);\nTarpley v. Jeffers, 96 F.3d 921, 924 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The First\nAmendment bars patronage hiring of independent contractors.\").\n\n                                   -15-\n\faffiliation is an appropriate consideration in hiring and firing\n\ndecisions   with   respect    to   government    positions    that    may   be\n\ncharacterized as \"policymaking\" or \"confidential.\"             Branti, 445\n\nU.S. at 517-18; see also Durieux-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves, 274 F.3d\n\n4, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2001); cf. Walker v. City of Lakewood, 272 F.3d\n\n1114, 1132 (9th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1607 (2002).\n\n            Here, Prisma seeks to attack a set of decisions related\n\nto the possible privatization (whether to do so and through whom)\n\nof the operation of a children's museum and directing to it\n\nmillions of dollars of public monies. Where policy choices of this\n\nmagnitude are presented, courts ought not be second-guessing how\n\nmuch party politics in the narrower sense may also have played a\n\nrole.   Cf. Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44, 54-55 (1998).               If\n\npolitical considerations are permissible in the hiring and firing\n\nof   upper-level    government     employees,    surely     they   are   also\n\nappropriate in a case like this one.\n\n            Imagine that the President of the United States were\n\nconsidering   whether   a    new   federally    supported    billion-dollar\n\npipeline were to run through one state or another. Numerous policy\n\nand technical arguments exist on both sides; it also happens that\n\none state supported the President in the last election and the\n\nother did not.     Only an extreme enthusiast could suppose that the\n\nFirst Amendment would license an inquisition into the question\n\nwhether politics played some part in the deliberations.              Firing a\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fstreet sweeper who voted for the loser is one thing; turning over\n\na publicly funded $70 million museum to the opposition party is\n\nquite another.\n\n               Prisma Zona asserts that even without a contract its\n\ninterest goes beyond that of a mere job applicant or contract\n\nbidder.    It says that it has started a relationship with the Trust\n\nFund and has committed substantial resources to the endeavor,\n\nreasonably anticipating that it would receive the grant.                   But the\n\nconcern that underlies the exception as to policymaking functions--\n\nand   which     we    apply    here   by    analogy--is    not   limited       to   new\n\napplicants. Policymakers can be replaced, despite reliance, absent\n\nlegal tenure or contract.\n\n               If the complaint's facts are assumed as true, it is at\n\nleast likely that Prisma Zona's own selection as the prospective\n\ngrantee under the NPP administration--and perhaps the decision to\n\nprivatize the museum in the first place--was not uninfluenced by\n\nparty politics.        Prisma Zona seems to think that this is fine for\n\nselection but not for de-selection.                Others might think that turn-\n\nabout is fair play.           Our own concern is exhausted by finding that\n\nPrisma Zona has not set forth a First Amendment violation even if\n\nthe facts are as alleged.\n\n               Prisma Zona makes three other constitutional claims, none\n\nof which requires much discussion. First, it says that its efforts\n\nto    secure    and   its     expectation     of    receiving    the   grant    funds\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fconstituted a property interest, which would at least qualify for\n\nprotection under Puerto Rico statutes related to quasi-contract and\n\nconstructive trust, and that this interest in turn is protected\n\nagainst impairment by the Due Process Clause. Prisma Zona makes no\n\nserious effort to establish that either state-law doctrine applies\n\non the facts of this case.      Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142\n\nF.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998) (undeveloped arguments are deemed\n\nabandoned).\n\n          Next, in two paragraphs, Prisma Zona says that its right\n\nto procedural due process was violated because it was denied \"some\n\nkind of hearing.\"    See, e.g., United States v. Fla. East Coast Ry.\n\nCo., 410 U.S. 224, 239 & n.7 (1973).            Prisma Zona appears (the\n\nargument is quite unclear) to be claiming that it was entitled to\n\nmake some kind of presentation to the Trust Fund before the grant\n\nwas set aside.   But its brief is silent about its efforts to secure\n\na hearing, what it wanted to demonstrate at such a hearing, and\n\nwhat purpose a hearing would have served.         Again, the argument is\n\nnot seriously developed and we mention it only to say that it has\n\nnot been overlooked.\n\n          Finally,     Prisma   Zona   relies    upon   equal   protection\n\nprinciples.   It says that other grants made by the Trust Fund were\n\ncarried out and that the refusal to complete the grants to Prisma\n\nZona was an irrational discrimination motivated solely by political\n\naffiliation. To the extent that this claim pretends to be anything\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fmore than a restatement of the failed First Amendment claim, it too\n\nis undeveloped and abandoned.    Prisma Zona does not point to any\n\nsimilarly situated grantee, let alone a context so similar to this\n\none as to suggest that it was irrational to treat that grantee and\n\nPrisma Zona differently.\n\n          Our conclusion that Prisma Zona has failed to state a\n\nclaim under section 1983 makes it unnecessary for us to address the\n\nremaining issues noted by the parties: these include the district\n\ncourt's finding of a Mount Healthy defense (which Prisma Zona\n\nattacks), Prisma Zona, 162 F. Supp. 2d at 8; 11th amendment and\n\nqualified immunity claims (presented by some of the defendants as\n\nan alternative ground for affirmance); and the significance of the\n\nintervening decision of the Puerto Rico Superior Court, discussed\n\nabove, invalidating as ultra vires the original decision by the\n\nTourism Company and Exploratorio to empower Prisma Zona to operate\n\nthe children's museum, Compañía de Turismo, KAC2001-3380 (506).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

(\"Prisma Zona\") sued the Children's Trust Fund of Puerto Rico (the \"Trust Fund\") and others (including several high officials in the Puerto Rican government) under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). Prisma Zona claims that the defendants discriminated against it because of its affiliation with a rival political party, in violation of its rights under the First Amendment and to due process and equal protection. The district court dismissed the suit under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <i>Prisma Zona Exploratoria de P.R., Inc. v. Calder&#243;n,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d 1, 9-10 (D.P.R.2001).

For present purposes, we assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint and draw inferences in favor of the non-moving party, here Prisma Zona. <i>Aulson v. Blanchard,</i> 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996). However, we also draw where necessary upon undisputed documents that are in substance cross-referenced in the complaint. <i>Watterson v.

At oral argument, both sides said that the case could be treated as one for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1999, then Governor Pedro Rossell&#243; of Puerto Rico, a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), announced a plan to create a children's museum in Puerto Rico. The museum, modeled on similar initiatives in Boston and elsewhere, was to include interactive exhibits, a theater and other attractions. It was to be built and operated using a portion of Puerto Rico's share of the master tobacco settlement of November 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1999, the Tourism Company, a state agency, created a public corporation, Prisma El Exploratorio, Inc. (\"Exploratorio\"), to develop the preliminary phase of the children's museum. Prisma Zona says the plan was eventually to turn over ownership and control of the museum to a private non-profit entity to free it from \"political partisanship.\" The following month Exploratorio secured a $20 million line of credit with the Government Development Bank (the \"Bank\") &#8212; another state entity &#8212; to help pay for the design and construction of the museum facilities; the line of credit was to be repaid using the tobacco settlement proceeds. Ground breaking for the museum was held on October 7, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 30, 1999, Puerto Rico created the Children's Trust Fund, a public corporation, and assigned to it Puerto Rico's share of the tobacco settlement. Act No. 173 of July 30, 1999 (codified at 24 LPRA &#167; 3121 <i>et seq.</i> (2002)). The statute created a board of directors for the Trust Fund, consisting of four <i>ex officio</i> members (the Governor, the Secretary of Justice, the President of the Bank, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) and three private persons appointed by the Governor, and gave it broad authority to allocate trust funds to improve the welfare of Puerto Rico's children. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 4-5. The Bank provides all of the Trust Fund's staffing, conducts its day-to-day management, and serves as its disbursement agent and financial advisor. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 12, 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1999, the Trust Fund board adopted regulations, pursuant to its statutory authority, establishing requirements for the receipt and use of trust funds. In addition, the board approved Exploratorio's request for up to $60 million to cover museum expenses. Prisma Zona says the board also resolved to transfer the grant to the private entity that would eventually succeed to the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier in that same month, several private citizens formed Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Prisma Zona\"), the plaintiff in this action, to take over the construction, ownership, and operation of the children's museum. The company's founders and management had close ties to the NPP and its board of directors was selected by Governor Rossell&#243;. The present case revolves around this new entity's effort to secure control over the children's museum and its funds and the rebuff of those efforts by a new administration under a different party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Prisma Zona began negotiations with the Tourism Company and its subsidiary Exploratorio to acquire the museum assets and to assume the responsibility for its development. On June 16, 2000, it requested $60 million from the Trust Fund to pay for the museum assets and to complete its construction and an additional $17.5 million to operate it for three years. The Trust Fund board approved Prisma Zona's requests on August 30, 2000. That day, Governor Rossell&#243; (as president of the Trust Fund board) sent Prisma Zona a letter informing it of the board's approval but noting additional required steps, including review of Prisma Zona's budget and finalization of a contract containing \"details on the procedures for the disbursement of funds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2000, the Trust Fund issued $400 million in bonds to fund its projects and transferred nearly $10 million to the Bank to cancel Exploratorio's outstanding line of credit. Both the Trust Fund and the Bank (which managed the bond sale) represented in various documents (including a prospectus, tax certificate, and bond contract) that a portion of the bond sale proceeds would be used for the \"acquisition, construction, and equipping of a children's museum ... in Isla Grande, Santurce, Puerto Rico, to be owned and operated by [Prisma Zona].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2000, Prisma Zona reached an understanding with the Tourism Company and Exploratorio to acquire the museum project (the \"Transfer Agreement\"). The following month Prisma Zona began negotiating a service contract with the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund prepared two form contracts (one each for the capital and operational grants) and sent them to Prisma Zona for its review on December 28, 2000. Prisma Zona says it made only \"minor\" changes to these documents before faxing them back to the Trust Fund the same day. The Trust Fund never responded. Nonetheless, Prisma Zona alleges that at this time \"the parties had agreed to the terms of the [service contracts] and the only action needed was the non-discretionary ministerial act of signing the agreement.\" As these events were unfolding, Puerto Rico was holding its 2000 elections. During the campaign for Governor, Sila Calder&#243;n, the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") candidate, promised to investigate a number of Rossell&#243; administration projects, including the children's museum, for corruption and misuse of public monies. Calder&#243;n defeated the NPP candidate at the polls on November 7, 2000, and took office on January 2, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its subsequent complaint Prisma Zona alleged that from the outset the new PDP administration attempted to undermine Prisma Zona's role in the museum project because of its ties to NPP and former Governor Rossell&#243;. In particular, Prisma Zona said the Bank (as the Trust Fund's disbursement agent) has refused to pay museum invoices that Prisma Zona has submitted since January 2001 and that the Bank subjected it to a sham audit. Prisma Zona also alleged that in May 2001, the Tourism Company filed a \"frivolous\" suit in commonwealth court, seeking to invalidate the Transfer Agreement. (Thereafter the Puerto Rico Superior Court declared the Transfer Agreement void under Puerto Rico law. <i>Compa&#241;&#237;a de Turismo de Puerto Rico v. Prisma Zona Exploratoria de PR Inc.,</i> KAC2001-3380 (506) (April 4, 2002).)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona filed this civil rights action in district court on June 22, 2001, naming as defendants the Trust Fund, the Bank and various individuals in the Calder&#243;n administration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Prisma Zona says defendants' refusal to carry through with the transfer of assets and funding was motivated by Prisma Zona's political ties and violated its First Amendment, due process, and equal protection rights. For relief, Prisma Zona seeks imposition of a constructive trust, disbursement of the trust funds, a generally phrased injunction against the alleged harassment, and punitive damages. After limited discovery, the district court dismissed the suit under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Prisma Zona,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Prisma Zona did not have a binding contract with the Trust Fund obligating it to fund Prisma Zona. <i>Prisma Zona,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d at 4. The court further held that absent such a contract or its effective equivalent (<i>e.g.,</i> an ongoing commercial relationship), the Trust Fund was free not to contract with Prisma Zona even if political motives prompted that decision. <i>Id.</i> at 7-8. Finally, the court said that even if First Amendment precedents were extended to cover new entities seeking to contract, the defendants had a so-called <i>Mount Healthy</i> defense because they would for independent reasons have refused to disburse the funds. <i>Id.</i> at 8; <i>see Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal landscape for Prisma Zona's First Amendment claim is a set of Supreme Court decisions starting in the 1970s. Politically motivated hiring, firing and contracting by governments has a long history in the United States; civil service reform statutes are largely a response to this tradition. But beginning with <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), the Supreme Court has added a new layer of protection based on First Amendment grounds. <i>See also Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990); <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). How far that protection extends, often a debatable matter, is an issue of law which we review <i>de novo.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona claims that a completed contract exists between it and the Trust Fund. Although a binding contract is not necessarily a condition of First Amendment protection, it would give Prisma Zona a much firmer basis in Supreme Court precedent to argue that it was protected from a politically motivated refusal to deal, <i>see, e.g., Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. 668, 685 (1996), quite apart from its use as an independent basis for relief under local law. We accordingly begin with that question here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, Prisma Zona applied to the Trust Fund for funding to buy the museum assets, complete construction and operate the project for three years. The Trust Fund's president &#8212; then Governor Rossell&#243; &#8212; responded on August 30, 2000, that the board had \"favorably considered your proposed initiative,\" but his letter continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of Assistance Service [<i>i.e.,</i> funding] is subject to a review of the budget and the details of the initiative. Prior to receiving the funds requested, you must meet with the Officers of the Trust to ... [verify information and budget] and to finalize the Contract of Assistance Service. The contract must contain details on the procedures for the disbursement of funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter set forth other conditions that would govern the grant and said that if Prisma Zona indicated its agreement, the Trust Fund would arrange for a further meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona indicated its agreement and in December the parties moved toward adoption of two detailed \"service\" contracts, one to fund capital commitments and the other for operating expenses. (From the government's standpoint, a private provider such as Prisma Zona agrees to provide services in exchange for the grant.) However, the Trust Fund's drafts were delivered only on December 28, 2000, they were returned with suggested changes by Prisma Zona, and no final service contracts were signed. Instead, on January 2, 2001, a new administration took power in Puerto Rico and the Trust Fund declined to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Prisma Zona says that the original August 30 letter and its acceptance constituted a binding contract promising funding, that this contract was not \"conditioned\" on the adoption of service contracts, and in any event the latter were virtually complete by the end of December save for a few details that were not \"material.\" Prisma Zona argues that under Puerto Rico law, contract formation is a question of fact, turning on the intent of the parties, and at the very least the fact question could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss but entitled Prisma Zona to a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not one calls the August 30 letter and reply a \"contract,\" the critical question (given the relief sought) is whether the Trust Fund ever assumed a binding obligation to make grants to Prisma Zona. As to this, the August 30 letter is explicit on its face: that &#8212; other conditions aside &#8212; no funds could be provided until the parties had \"finalized\" the service contracts. Further, as the district court pointed out, the Trust Fund's own formal regulations provide that \"[a] service contract will be entered into between the Trust Fund and the beneficiary entity\" and set forth issues that had to be addressed (<i>e.g.,</i> \"specific clauses delineating the responsibilities of the parties\"). <i>Prisma Zona,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d at 4; <i>accord</i> Regulations for the Requisites of Eligibility and the Criteria for Statutory Monitoring under the Statute for the Children's Fund, art. 5(c) (\"Trust Fund Regulations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Prisma Zona suggests that the letter and reply were \"a contract to make a contract.\" This assumes, as we will do at this stage, that Prisma Zona could develop factual evidence of such an intent on both sides. But even if (assuming further) this theory is allowable despite the Trust Fund Regulations just quoted &#8212; and this is far from clear &#8212; a contract to make a contract is enforceable only where all material terms have been agreed upon. 1 Corbin, <i>Contracts,</i> &#167; 2.8, at 131, 133-34 (Perillo ed.1993). Prisma Zona's own statements, and the service contract drafts which it attaches, show that material issues were still open.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most obviously, the service contract drafts left blank a number of important terms, such as the amount of the grant. In addition, in returning the service contract drafts with proposed changes, Prisma Zona asked for a number of substantive changes. It wanted to limit the Trust Fund's ability to terminate the grant for cause to an exercise of reasonable discretion. The Trust Fund drafts required Prisma Zona to indemnify the Trust Fund for legal expenses arising out of the grant &#8212; hardly a trivial matter, as this case illustrates. In response, Prisma Zona's mark-ups required the Trust Fund to use the government's legal representation before incurring separate expenses that Prisma Zona would have to cover. Parties still short of agreement as to such substantive terms have not completed their bargaining.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is Prisma Zona's position helped by the surrounding circumstances that it says bear out the claim of an existing contract. For example, the bond prospectus apparently said that funds would go to Prisma Zona to operate the museum; but &#8212; whatever the securities law implications &#8212; this is a statement as to what was intended, not a statement that the necessary contracts had already been negotiated. Similarly, Prisma Zona says that the Trust Fund in fact paid out almost $10 million for Prisma Zona's acquisition of the museum, but this appears to have been an intra-governmental payment from the Trust Fund to the Tourism Company to reimburse it for funding the museum's initial investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All such events show is what is already conceded, namely, that the Rossell&#243; administration intended that the various agencies involved cooperate to transfer the museum and additional funding to Prisma Zona. Indeed, the process was not only intended, but steps just short of a final legal commitment continued even after the November 2000 election. Nevertheless, the service contracts were not completed, let alone signed, before the new administration took office in January 2001. Thus, there was no binding legal obligation to fund Prisma Zona.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona has another string to its bow. It says that it need not have a <i>right</i> to a benefit (in this case, the contractual right to funding) to be protected under the First Amendment against a politically motivated denial of that benefit. As an abstraction, this is so: several early cases involved political firings of low-level employees who lacked civil service or contract protection. <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 515, 100 S.Ct. 1287; <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 350-51, 96 S.Ct. 2673 (plurality opinion). Today's protection also extends beyond discharging current employees to employee hiring and promotion decisions. <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. 2729.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although current or would-be employees have been specially favored, the Court has also afforded some protection to businesses that deal with the government, <i>O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake,</i> 518 U.S. 712, 714-15, 116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996) (removal from list of private towing services); <i>Umbehr,</i> 518 U.S. at 686, 116 S.Ct. 2361 (non-renewal of trash hauling contract), although here the coverage is less certain once one goes beyond existing commercial relationships, <i>see id.</i> at 685, 116 S.Ct. 2361. The next area of contest appears to revolve around those who wish for the first time to bid for government contracts. On this issue, the Supreme Court has not yet spoken definitively, and the circuits appear to be divided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Happily, such large questions as to whether the <i>Elrod</i> line will continue to expand need not be decided to dispose of this case. We will assume, purely <i>arguendo,</i> that a state government could not invite bids to supply pencils to the state with the caveat that no company headed by a Democrat could apply. Further, at this stage of fact development, Prisma Zona is entitled to the assumption &#8212; which may or may not be correct &#8212; that party politics played a role in the Calder&#243;n administration's refusal to make the previously intended grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, whatever may be true of pencil contracts, we decline to hold that the First Amendment requires politically immaculate state decision-making in cases like this. Even in core cases involving politically motivated hirings and firings, the Supreme Court has itself recognized that a wholly antiseptic application of the <i>Elrod</i> principle is unrealistic. Instead, party affiliation <i>is</i> an appropriate consideration in hiring and firing decisions with respect to government positions that may be characterized as \"policymaking\" or \"confidential.\" <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 517-18, 100 S.Ct. 1287; <i>see also Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4, 9-10 (1st Cir.2001); <i>cf. Walker v. City of Lakewood,</i> 272 F.3d 1114, 1132 (9th Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1607, 152 L.Ed.2d 621 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Prisma seeks to attack a set of decisions related to the possible privatization (whether to do so and through whom) of the operation of a children's museum and directing to it millions of dollars of public monies. Where policy choices of this magnitude are presented, courts ought not be second-guessing how much party politics in the narrower sense may also have played a role. <i>Cf. Bogan v. Scott-Harris,</i> 523 U.S. 44, 54-55, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998). If political considerations are permissible in the hiring and firing of upper-level government employees, surely they are also appropriate in a case like this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imagine that the President of the United States were considering whether a new federally supported billion-dollar pipeline were to run through one state or another. Numerous policy and technical arguments exist on both sides; it also happens that one state supported the President in the last election and the other did not. Only an extreme enthusiast could suppose that the First Amendment would license an inquisition into the question whether politics played some part in the deliberations. Firing a street sweeper who voted for the loser is one thing; turning over a publicly funded $70 million museum to the opposition party is quite another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona asserts that even without a contract its interest goes beyond that of a mere job applicant or contract bidder. It says that it has started a relationship with the Trust Fund and has committed substantial resources to the endeavor, reasonably anticipating that it would receive the grant. But the concern that underlies the exception as to policymaking functions &#8212; and which we apply here by analogy &#8212; is not limited to new applicants. Policymakers <i>can</i> be replaced, despite reliance, absent legal tenure or contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the complaint's facts are assumed as true, it is at least likely that Prisma Zona's own selection as the prospective grantee under the NPP administration &#8212; and perhaps the decision to privatize the museum in the first place &#8212; was not uninfluenced by party politics. Prisma Zona seems to think that this is fine for selection but not for de-selection. Others might think that turn-about is fair play. Our own concern is exhausted by finding that Prisma Zona has not set forth a First Amendment violation even if the facts are as alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona makes three other constitutional claims, none of which requires much discussion. First, it says that its efforts to secure and its expectation of receiving the grant funds constituted a property interest, which would at least qualify for protection under Puerto Rico statutes related to quasi-contract and constructive trust, and that this interest in turn is protected against impairment by the Due Process Clause. Prisma Zona makes no serious effort to establish that either state-law doctrine applies on the facts of this case. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998) (undeveloped arguments are deemed abandoned).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in two paragraphs, Prisma Zona says that its right to procedural due process was violated because it was denied \"some kind of hearing.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fla. East Coast Ry. Co.,</i> 410 U.S. 224, 239 &amp; n. 7, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973). Prisma Zona appears (the argument is quite unclear) to be claiming that it was entitled to make some kind of presentation to the Trust Fund before the grant was set aside. But its brief is silent about its efforts to secure a hearing, what it wanted to demonstrate at such a hearing, and what purpose a hearing would have served. Again, the argument is not seriously developed and we mention it only to say that it has not been overlooked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Prisma Zona relies upon equal protection principles. It says that other grants made by the Trust Fund were carried out and that the refusal to complete the grants to Prisma Zona was an irrational discrimination motivated solely by political affiliation. To the extent that this claim pretends to be anything more than a restatement of the failed First Amendment claim, it too is undeveloped and abandoned. Prisma Zona does not point to any similarly situated grantee, let alone a context so similar to this one as to suggest that it was irrational to treat that grantee and Prisma Zona differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Prisma Zona has failed to state a claim under section 1983 makes it unnecessary for us to address the remaining issues noted by the parties: these include the district court's finding of a <i>Mount Healthy</i> defense (which Prisma Zona attacks), <i>Prisma Zona,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d at 8; 11th amendment and qualified immunity claims (presented by some of the defendants as an alternative ground for affirmance); and the significance of the intervening decision of the Puerto Rico Superior Court, discussed above, invalidating as <i>ultra vires</i> the original decision by the Tourism Company and Exploratorio to empower Prisma Zona to operate the children's museum, <i>Compa&#241;&#237;a de Turismo,</i> KAC2001-3380 (506).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The individual defendants include Sila Calder&#243;n, the Governor of Puerto Rico and president of the Trust Fund's board; Juan Agosto Alicea, president of the Bank and vice-president of the Trust Fund's board; Jos&#233; V.

We decline, not only because the theory is only adverted to perfunctorily on appeal,<i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i> 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990), but also because its argument fails entirely to demonstrate the unjust enrichment that would invoke this court's equitable powers, <i>see Corporaci&#243;n Insular de Seguros v.

At oral argument, both sides said that the case could be treated as one for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1999, then Governor Pedro Rossell&#243; of Puerto Rico, a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), announced a plan to create a children's museum in Puerto Rico. The museum, modeled on similar initiatives in Boston and elsewhere, was to include interactive exhibits, a theater and other attractions. It was to be built and operated using a portion of Puerto Rico's share of the master tobacco settlement of November 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1999, the Tourism Company, a state agency, created a public corporation, Prisma El Exploratorio, Inc. (\"Exploratorio\"), to develop the preliminary phase of the children's museum. Prisma Zona says the plan was eventually to turn over ownership and control of the museum to a private non-profit entity to free it from \"political partisanship.\" The following month Exploratorio secured a $20 million line of credit with the Government Development Bank (the \"Bank\") &#8212; another state entity &#8212; to help pay for the design and construction of the museum facilities; the line of credit was to be repaid using the tobacco settlement proceeds. Ground breaking for the museum was held on October 7, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 30, 1999, Puerto Rico created the Children's Trust Fund, a public corporation, and assigned to it Puerto Rico's share of the tobacco settlement. Act No. 173 of July 30, 1999 (codified at 24 LPRA &#167; 3121 <i>et seq.</i> (2002)). The statute created a board of directors for the Trust Fund, consisting of four <i>ex officio</i> members (the Governor, the Secretary of Justice, the President of the Bank, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) and three private persons appointed by the Governor, and gave it broad authority to allocate trust funds to improve the welfare of Puerto Rico's children. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 4-5. The Bank provides all of the Trust Fund's staffing, conducts its day-to-day management, and serves as its disbursement agent and financial advisor. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 12, 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1999, the Trust Fund board adopted regulations, pursuant to its statutory authority, establishing requirements for the receipt and use of trust funds. In addition, the board approved Exploratorio's request for up to $60 million to cover museum expenses. Prisma Zona says the board also resolved to transfer the grant to the private entity that would eventually succeed to the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier in that same month, several private citizens formed Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Prisma Zona\"), the plaintiff in this action, to take over the construction, ownership, and operation of the children's museum. The company's founders and management had close ties to the NPP and its board of directors was selected by Governor Rossell&#243;. The present case revolves around this new entity's effort to secure control over the children's museum and its funds and the rebuff of those efforts by a new administration under a different party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Prisma Zona began negotiations with the Tourism Company and its subsidiary Exploratorio to acquire the museum assets and to assume the responsibility for its development. On June 16, 2000, it requested $60 million from the Trust Fund to pay for the museum assets and to complete its construction and an additional $17.5 million to operate it for three years. The Trust Fund board approved Prisma Zona's requests on August 30, 2000. That day, Governor Rossell&#243; (as president of the Trust Fund board) sent Prisma Zona a letter informing it of the board's approval but noting additional required steps, including review of Prisma Zona's budget and finalization of a contract containing \"details on the procedures for the disbursement of funds.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 15, 2000, the Trust Fund issued $400 million in bonds to fund its projects and transferred nearly $10 million to the Bank to cancel Exploratorio's outstanding line of credit. Both the Trust Fund and the Bank (which managed the bond sale) represented in various documents (including a prospectus, tax certificate, and bond contract) that a portion of the bond sale proceeds would be used for the \"acquisition, construction, and equipping of a children's museum ... in Isla Grande, Santurce, Puerto Rico, to be owned and operated by [Prisma Zona].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2000, Prisma Zona reached an understanding with the Tourism Company and Exploratorio to acquire the museum project (the \"Transfer Agreement\"). The following month Prisma Zona began negotiating a service contract with the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund prepared two form contracts (one each for the capital and operational grants) and sent them to Prisma Zona for its review on December 28, 2000. Prisma Zona says it made only \"minor\" changes to these documents before faxing them back to the Trust Fund the same day. The Trust Fund never responded. Nonetheless, Prisma Zona alleges that at this time \"the parties had agreed to the terms of the [service contracts] and the only action needed was the non-discretionary ministerial act of signing the agreement.\" As these events were unfolding, Puerto Rico was holding its 2000 elections. During the campaign for Governor, Sila Calder&#243;n, the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") candidate, promised to investigate a number of Rossell&#243; administration projects, including the children's museum, for corruption and misuse of public monies. Calder&#243;n defeated the NPP candidate at the polls on November 7, 2000, and took office on January 2, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its subsequent complaint Prisma Zona alleged that from the outset the new PDP administration attempted to undermine Prisma Zona's role in the museum project because of its ties to NPP and former Governor Rossell&#243;. In particular, Prisma Zona said the Bank (as the Trust Fund's disbursement agent) has refused to pay museum invoices that Prisma Zona has submitted since January 2001 and that the Bank subjected it to a sham audit. Prisma Zona also alleged that in May 2001, the Tourism Company filed a \"frivolous\" suit in commonwealth court, seeking to invalidate the Transfer Agreement. (Thereafter the Puerto Rico Superior Court declared the Transfer Agreement void under Puerto Rico law. <i>Compa&#241;&#237;a de Turismo de Puerto Rico v.

For relief, Prisma Zona seeks imposition of a constructive trust, disbursement of the trust funds, a generally phrased injunction against the alleged harassment, and punitive damages.

How far that protection extends, often a debatable matter, is an issue of law which we review <i>de novo.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona claims that a completed contract exists between it and the Trust Fund. Although a binding contract is not necessarily a condition of First Amendment protection, it would give Prisma Zona a much firmer basis in Supreme Court precedent to argue that it was protected from a politically motivated refusal to deal, <i>see, e.g., Bd. of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118059\"><a href=\"/opinion/118059/board-of-commrs-wabaunsee-cty-v-umbehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 685 (1996), quite apart from its use as an independent basis for relief under local law. We accordingly begin with that question here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, Prisma Zona applied to the Trust Fund for funding to buy the museum assets, complete construction and operate the project for three years. The Trust Fund's president &#8212; then Governor Rossell&#243; &#8212; responded on August 30, 2000, that the board had \"favorably considered your proposed initiative,\" but his letter continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of Assistance Service [<i>i.e.,</i> funding] is subject to a review of the budget and the details of the initiative. Prior to receiving the funds requested, you must meet with the Officers of the Trust to ... [verify information and budget] and to finalize the Contract of Assistance Service. The contract must contain details on the procedures for the disbursement of funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter set forth other conditions that would govern the grant and said that if Prisma Zona indicated its agreement, the Trust Fund would arrange for a further meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona indicated its agreement and in December the parties moved toward adoption of two detailed \"service\" contracts, one to fund capital commitments and the other for operating expenses. (From the government's standpoint, a private provider such as Prisma Zona agrees to provide services in exchange for the grant.) However, the Trust Fund's drafts were delivered only on December 28, 2000, they were returned with suggested changes by Prisma Zona, and no final service contracts were signed. Instead, on January 2, 2001, a new administration took power in Puerto Rico and the Trust Fund declined to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Prisma Zona says that the original August 30 letter and its acceptance constituted a binding contract promising funding, that this contract was not \"conditioned\" on the adoption of service contracts, and in any event the latter were virtually complete by the end of December save for a few details that were not \"material.\" Prisma Zona argues that under Puerto Rico law, contract formation is a question of fact, turning on the intent of the parties, and at the very least the fact question could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss but entitled Prisma Zona to a jury trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not one calls the August 30 letter and reply a \"contract,\" the critical question (given the relief sought) is whether the Trust Fund ever assumed a binding obligation to make grants to Prisma Zona. As to this, the August 30 letter is explicit on its face: that &#8212; other conditions aside &#8212; no funds could be provided until the parties had \"finalized\" the service contracts. Further, as the district court pointed out, the Trust Fund's own formal regulations provide that \"[a] service contract will be entered into between the Trust Fund and the beneficiary entity\" and set forth issues that had to be addressed (<i>e.g.,</i> \"specific clauses delineating the responsibilities of the parties\"). <i>Prisma Zona,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d at 4; <i>accord</i> Regulations for the Requisites of Eligibility and the Criteria for Statutory Monitoring under the Statute for the Children's Fund, art. 5(c) (\"Trust Fund Regulations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Prisma Zona suggests that the letter and reply were \"a contract to make a contract.\" This assumes, as we will do at this stage, that Prisma Zona could develop factual evidence of such an intent on both sides. But even if (assuming further) this theory is allowable despite the Trust Fund Regulations just quoted &#8212; and this is far from clear &#8212; a contract to make a contract is enforceable only where all material terms have been agreed upon. 1 Corbin, <i>Contracts,</i> &#167; 2.8, at 131, 133-34 (Perillo ed.1993). Prisma Zona's own statements, and the service contract drafts which it attaches, show that material issues were still open.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most obviously, the service contract drafts left blank a number of important terms, such as the amount of the grant. In addition, in returning the service contract drafts with proposed changes, Prisma Zona asked for a number of substantive changes. It wanted to limit the Trust Fund's ability to terminate the grant for cause to an exercise of reasonable discretion. The Trust Fund drafts required Prisma Zona to indemnify the Trust Fund for legal expenses arising out of the grant &#8212; hardly a trivial matter, as this case illustrates. In response, Prisma Zona's mark-ups required the Trust Fund to use the government's legal representation before incurring separate expenses that Prisma Zona would have to cover. Parties still short of agreement as to such substantive terms have not completed their bargaining.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is Prisma Zona's position helped by the surrounding circumstances that it says bear out the claim of an existing contract. For example, the bond prospectus apparently said that funds would go to Prisma Zona to operate the museum; but &#8212; whatever the securities law implications &#8212; this is a statement as to what was intended, not a statement that the necessary contracts had already been negotiated. Similarly, Prisma Zona says that the Trust Fund in fact paid out almost $10 million for Prisma Zona's acquisition of the museum, but this appears to have been an intra-governmental payment from the Trust Fund to the Tourism Company to reimburse it for funding the museum's initial investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All such events show is what is already conceded, namely, that the Rossell&#243; administration intended that the various agencies involved cooperate to transfer the museum and additional funding to Prisma Zona. Indeed, the process was not only intended, but steps just short of a final legal commitment continued even after the November 2000 election. Nevertheless, the service contracts were not completed, let alone signed, before the new administration took office in January 2001. Thus, there was no binding legal obligation to fund Prisma Zona.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona has another string to its bow. It says that it need not have a <i>right</i> to a benefit (in this case, the contractual right to funding) to be protected under the First Amendment against a politically motivated denial of that benefit. As an abstraction, this is so: several early cases involved political firings of low-level employees who lacked civil service or contract protection. <i>Branti,</i> 445 U.S. at 515, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We will assume, purely <i>arguendo,</i> that a state government could not invite bids to supply pencils to the state with the caveat that no company headed by a Democrat could apply. Further, at this stage of fact development, Prisma Zona is entitled to the assumption &#8212; which may or may not be correct &#8212; that party politics played a role in the Calder&#243;n administration's refusal to make the previously intended grant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, whatever may be true of pencil contracts, we decline to hold that the First Amendment requires politically immaculate state decision-making in cases like this.

Where policy choices of this magnitude are presented, courts ought not be second-guessing how much party politics in the narrower sense may also have played a role. <i>Cf. Bogan v.

If political considerations are permissible in the hiring and firing of upper-level government employees, surely they are also appropriate in a case like this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Imagine that the President of the United States were considering whether a new federally supported billion-dollar pipeline were to run through one state or another. Numerous policy and technical arguments exist on both sides; it also happens that one state supported the President in the last election and the other did not. Only an extreme enthusiast could suppose that the First Amendment would license an inquisition into the question whether politics played some part in the deliberations. Firing a street sweeper who voted for the loser is one thing; turning over a publicly funded $70 million museum to the opposition party is quite another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona asserts that even without a contract its interest goes beyond that of a mere job applicant or contract bidder. It says that it has started a relationship with the Trust Fund and has committed substantial resources to the endeavor, reasonably anticipating that it would receive the grant. But the concern that underlies the exception as to policymaking functions &#8212; and which we apply here by analogy &#8212; is not limited to new applicants. Policymakers <i>can</i> be replaced, despite reliance, absent legal tenure or contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the complaint's facts are assumed as true, it is at least likely that Prisma Zona's own selection as the prospective grantee under the NPP administration &#8212; and perhaps the decision to privatize the museum in the first place &#8212; was not uninfluenced by party politics. Prisma Zona seems to think that this is fine for selection but not for de-selection. Others might think that turn-about is fair play. Our own concern is exhausted by finding that Prisma Zona has not set forth a First Amendment violation even if the facts are as alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prisma Zona makes three other constitutional claims, none of which requires much discussion. First, it says that its efforts to secure and its expectation of receiving the grant funds constituted a property interest, which would at least qualify for protection under Puerto Rico statutes related to quasi-contract and constructive trust, and that this interest in turn is protected against impairment by the Due Process Clause. Prisma Zona makes no serious effort to establish that either state-law doctrine applies on the facts of this case. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1998) (undeveloped arguments are deemed abandoned).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in two paragraphs, Prisma Zona says that its right to procedural due process was violated because it was denied \"some kind of hearing.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fla. East Coast Ry. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108715\"><a href=\"/opinion/108715/united-states-v-florida-east-coast-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 239 &amp; n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108715\"><a href=\"/opinion/108715/united-states-v-florida-east-coast-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span> (1973). Prisma Zona appears (the argument is quite unclear) to be claiming that it was entitled to make some kind of presentation to the Trust Fund before the grant was set aside. But its brief is silent about its efforts to secure a hearing, what it wanted to demonstrate at such a hearing, and what purpose a hearing would have served. Again, the argument is not seriously developed and we mention it only to say that it has not been overlooked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Prisma Zona relies upon equal protection principles. It says that other grants made by the Trust Fund were carried out and that the refusal to complete the grants to Prisma Zona was an irrational discrimination motivated solely by political affiliation. To the extent that this claim pretends to be anything more than a restatement of the failed First Amendment claim, it too is undeveloped and abandoned. Prisma Zona does not point to any similarly situated grantee, let alone a context so similar to this one as to suggest that it was irrational to treat that grantee and Prisma Zona differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Prisma Zona has failed to state a claim under section 1983 makes it unnecessary for us to address the remaining issues noted by the parties: these include the district court's finding of a <i>Mount Healthy</i> defense (which Prisma Zona attacks), <i>Prisma Zona,</i> 162 F.Supp.2d at 8; 11th amendment and qualified immunity claims (presented by some of the defendants as an alternative ground for affirmance); and the significance of the intervening decision of the Puerto Rico Superior Court, discussed above, invalidating as <i>ultra vires</i> the original decision by the Tourism Company and Exploratorio to empower Prisma Zona to operate the children's museum, <i>Compa&#241;&#237;a de Turismo,</i> KAC2001-3380 (506).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The individual defendants include Sila Calder&#243;n, the Governor of Puerto Rico and president of the Trust Fund's board; Juan Agosto Alicea, president of the Bank and vice-president of the Trust Fund's board; Jos&#233; V.
