Harris on brief for petitioner.\n     Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nTerri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, and Kristina R. Sracic, Trial Attorney, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                         January 12, 2009\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.      The petitioner, Xiaofeng Liu, is\n\na Chinese national.       He overstayed his visitor's visa, remained in\n\nthe United States illegally, and eventually applied for asylum.\n\nWhen   the    authorities    responded      by    placing     him   in   removal\n\nproceedings,     he    conceded    removability     but     cross-applied   for\n\ncancellation of removal, asylum, and other redress.\n\n             After a full hearing, an immigration judge (IJ) denied\n\nthe petitioner's pleas for relief and ordered him deported to his\n\nhomeland.     The petitioner appealed to the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA).        The BIA, without opinion, summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ's ukase.\n\n             The petitioner eschewed the opportunity to seek judicial\n\nreview of this decision.       Instead, on March 19, 2007, he moved for\n\nreconsideration, alleging that his \"personal situation has been\n\nfurther compromised.\"       To bolster this allegation, he attached a\n\nstatement dated March 7, 2007, in which he maintained, without a\n\nshred of support, that he would be subject to persecution in the\n\nRepublic of China because he had applied (albeit unsuccessfully)\n\nfor asylum in the United States.            He also reiterated the claims\n\noriginally made before the IJ.\n\n             On February 27, 2008, the BIA denied the motion to\n\nreconsider, finding that, for the most part, the motion \"merely\n\nrepeat[ed]\"    arguments     and   evidence      previously    advanced.     In\n\naddition, the BIA noted that the petitioner did not specifically\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fidentify any error of law or fact in the prior decisions of either\n\nthe BIA or the IJ.              Because the petitioner did not furnish\n\n\"objective material evidence or legal authority\" sufficient to\n\nsupport his motion, the BIA denied it.                This timely petition for\n\njudicial review followed.\n\n               We need not tarry.           The only decision before us is the\n\nBIA's denial of the motion to reconsider; the original order\n\ndenying asylum and other relief is not implicated.1                 See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(1); see also Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 394-400 (1995).\n\n               Motions for reconsideration are disfavored in immigration\n\ncases.       See, e.g., INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992).               The\n\nparty seeking reconsideration has the burden of establishing that\n\nit is warranted.           INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110-11 (1988).            At a\n\nbare       minimum,   \"a    motion    for   reconsideration   has   to   give    the\n\ntribunal to which it is addressed a reason for changing its mind.\"\n\nAhmed v. Ashcroft, 388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir. 2004).\n\n               Virtually by definition, a motion for reconsideration\n\nposits that the decider — here, the BIA — made some sort of error\n\nin the earlier decision.             See Turri v. INS, 997 F.2d 1306, 1311 n.4\n\n(10th Cir. 1993).          It follows that the moving party must specify a\n\nparticular error of law or fact in that earlier decision.                   See 8\n\n\n       1\n      Be that as it may, we may nonetheless review the underlying\ndecision to the extent necessary to determine whether the BIA\nabused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. See\nAbdullah v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 2006); Esenwah v.\nAshcroft, 378 F.3d 763, 765 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                            -3-\n\fU.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).             When the motion\n\nsimply regurgitates contentions that were previously made and\n\nrejected,    the     movant   has   no      legal   basis    to   insist   upon\n\nreconsideration.      See Ahmed, 388 F.3d at 249.\n\n            This is such a case.         Consequently, disposition of this\n\npetition does not require extended discussion. Thus, we reject the\n\npetitioner's arguments out of hand, pausing only to make four brief\n\ncomments.\n\n            First,    we   review   the     BIA's   denial   of   a   motion   to\n\nreconsider solely for abuse of discretion.             Doherty, 502 U.S. at\n\n323-24; Abudu, 485 U.S. at 107; Onwuamaegbu v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d\n\n405, 407 (1st Cir. 2006); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).                This is\n\nan extremely deferential standard, under which we must uphold the\n\nBIA's decision unless that decision is \"arbitrary, irrational, or\n\ncontrary to law.\"      Abdullah, 461 F.3d at 99 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The BIA's denial of reconsideration here\n\ndoes not fall within that pejorative description.\n\n            Second, the record bears out the BIA's conclusion that\n\nthe petitioner's motion for reconsideration was deficient because\n\nit failed to identify any material error of law or fact in the\n\nearlier decisions.      This circumstance, in and of itself, justifies\n\nthe rejection of the motion.        See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also\n\nZhao v. United States Dep't of Justice, 265 F.3d 83, 90-91 (2d Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          Third, the assertion that the petitioner will be exposed\n\nto persecution because he unsuccessfully sought asylum is a red\n\nherring. For one thing, that assertion was never voiced before the\n\nIJ and, thus, was not properly before the BIA.      See Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).   For another thing, the\n\nassertion is meritless: if the mere filing of an asylum application\n\nwere a ground for defeating removal, that would create a perverse\n\nincentive that would totally frustrate the government's legitimate\n\ninterest in enforcement of the immigration laws.\n\n          Fourth, and finally, the petitioner's brief seems to be\n\na thinly-veiled jeremiad bemoaning the BIA's election to affirm the\n\nIJ's order without opinion.   But the BIA has the authority, under\n\napplicable regulations, to use the \"affirmance without opinion\"\n\nmechanism.    See 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(e)(4)(i).    Moreover, we have\n\nexplicitly upheld the validity of that regulation, Albathani v.\n\nINS, 318 F.3d 365, 377 (1st Cir. 2003), and that holding is\n\ncontrolling here.   The \"affirmance without opinion\" practice is,\n\ntherefore, generally acceptable.\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deny the petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",

This is an extremely deferential standard, under which we must uphold the BIA's decision unless that decision is \"arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\" <i>Abdullah,</i> 461 F.3d at 99 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The BIA's denial of reconsideration here does not fall within that pejorative description.</p>\n<p>Second, the record bears out the BIA's conclusion that the petitioner's motion for reconsideration was deficient because it failed to identify any material error of law or fact in the earlier decisions. This circumstance, in and of itself, justifies the rejection of the motion. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Zhao v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774878\"><a href=\"/opinion/774878/ke-zhen-zhao-v-united-states-department-of-justice-janet-reno-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 90-91 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Third, the assertion that the petitioner will be exposed to persecution because he unsuccessfully sought asylum is a red herring. For one thing, that assertion was never voiced before the IJ and, thus, was not properly before the BIA. <i>See </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2004). For another thing, the assertion is meritless: if the mere filing of an asylum application were a ground for defeating removal, that would create a perverse incentive that would totally frustrate the government's legitimate interest in enforcement of the immigration laws.</p>\n<p>Fourth, and finally, the petitioner's brief seems to be a thinly-veiled jeremiad bemoaning the BIA's election to affirm the IJ's order without opinion. But the BIA has the authority, under applicable regulations, to use the \"affirmance without opinion\" mechanism. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i). Moreover, we have explicitly upheld the validity of that regulation, <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 377 (1st Cir.2003), and that holding is controlling here. The \"affirmance without opinion\" practice is, therefore, generally acceptable.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we <i>deny</i> the petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p>So Ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Be that as it may, we may nonetheless review the underlying decision to the extent necessary to determine whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. <i>See </i><i>Abdullah v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202383\"><a href=\"/opinion/202383/abdullah-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Esenwah v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787254\"><a href=\"/opinion/787254/tony-esenwah-v-john-d-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 765 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n\n</div>",
