We\n\naffirm.\n\n                         I.    Factual Background\n\n          We review the entry of summary judgment on all claims de\n\nnovo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party\n\nopposing summary judgment, in this case González.                 Aponte-Matos\n\nv. Toledo-Dávila, 135 F.3d 182, 185 (1st Cir. 1998).                    Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n\ninterrogatories,   and    admissions      on    file,      together   with    the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n          González   is    a   member     of   the   New    Progressive      Party\n\n(\"NPP\"), which was the political party in power in Puerto Rico\n\nbefore the 2000 general elections.             After the elections, a new\n\nadministration under the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") assumed\n\ncontrol of the government. Both defendants are members of the PDP.\n\nAt all relevant times, Zayas was the Secretary of the Family\n\nDepartment   of    the    Commonwealth         of    Puerto    Rico    (\"Family\n\nDepartment\"), and Maldonado was its Human Resources Director.\n\nFollowing the change in administration, the Family Department\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fconducted an audit of its Human Resources Office covering personnel\n\ntransactions from July 1, 1998, through December 31, 2000.\n\n              González began working for the Family Department in 1972.\n\nAs of January 1993, she held a career position classified as Local\n\nService Director I.        On January 22, 1993, González was promoted to\n\nthe trust position of Regional Director III.                    During her time in\n\nthe trust position, the position of Local Service Director I was\n\neliminated and replaced by the position of Director of Integral\n\nServices I.        González occupied her trust position into 2000.                     On\n\nJune   21,    2000,     González    requested      reinstatement        to    a   career\n\nposition pursuant to the Puerto Rico Personnel Act (the \"Personnel\n\nAct\"), 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 1301-1431.1\n\n              In   a    memorandum      dated    July    20,    2000,    the      Family\n\nDepartment's Human Resources Office stated that the position of\n\nExecutive Director I was most similar to the position of Director\n\nof     Integral        Services     I    which     was      presently        occupied.\n\nNotwithstanding the memorandum's finding, on September 1, 2000, the\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Family Department reinstated González to\n\na    career   position     as     Executive      Director      IV,   which,       as   its\n\ndesignation suggests, provides greater compensation and involves\n\nmore responsibility than Executive Director I.\n\n\n\n1\n   Under the Personnel Act, a career employee who accepts a trust\nposition has an absolute right to be reinstated to a career\nposition equal to the last position she held as a career employee.\nSee 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350(a).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f              According to the complaint, beginning in January 2001,\n\nGonzález began receiving less work and responsibility.                     She also\n\noverheard co-workers make what she deemed to be derogatory comments\n\nabout her.     On February 2, 2001, González met with Zayas to discuss\n\nher situation at work.          Zayas informed González that she had been\n\nimproperly reinstated to the Executive Director IV position and\n\nthat she would have to be placed in a different position.                       Zayas\n\nalso allegedly told González that she needed González's position\n\nfor \"an employee of her trust.\"            Zayas ordered González to vacate\n\nher office and exhaust any accumulated vacation leave.                     González\n\nwent on vacation for ten days.             When she returned, she was not\n\nimmediately assigned a new office or duties.                   After several days,\n\nshe met with Maldonado, the Human Resources Manager.                      Maldonado\n\ninformed González that she would be transferred to the career\n\nposition of Executive Director I because she had been improperly\n\npromoted      to    Executive   Director     IV.        The    demotion   was     made\n\nretroactive to September 1, 2000. On April 4, 2001, González began\n\nworking in the Executive Director I position.                   On April 21, 2001,\n\nGonzález's request for early retirement was approved.\n\n              González filed the present complaint against the Family\n\nDepartment seeking monetary damages.           She alleged violations under\n\n42   U.S.C.    §§    1981,   1983,   and   1986    of    the    First,    Fifth    and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as\n\nArticle II, §§ 1, 6, and 7 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fof Puerto Rico.       González alleged that she had a property right\n\nprotected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nto   her   career     position   as    Executive   Director      IV,   and   that\n\ndefendants unconstitutionally discriminated against her on the\n\nbasis of her political affiliation in violation of the First\n\nAmendment.2\n\n            On May 1, 2003, Zayas and Maldonado filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment and the district court granted the motion for\n\nsummary judgment, mooted the remaining motions, and dismissed all\n\nclaims against Zayas and Maldonado.            This appeal followed.\n\n                                 II.    Analysis\n\nA.   The Political Discrimination Claim\n\n            When alleging a claim of political discrimination, a\n\nplaintiff     bears   the   burden     of   producing   sufficient     evidence,\n\nwhether     direct     or    circumstantial,       that    she     engaged     in\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct and that political affiliation\n\n\n\n2\n   On June 14, 2002, the Family Department filed a motion to\ndismiss, arguing that it was entitled to sovereign immunity under\nthe Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. The\ndistrict court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint\nagainst the Family Department and Zayas and Maldonado in their\nofficial capacities on November 21, 2002. This appeal was filed on\nSeptember 2, 2003. In her appellate brief, González argued that\nthe Family Department did not have sovereign immunity pursuant to\nthe Eleventh Amendment.      As defendants pointed out at oral\nargument, we do not have jurisdiction to review the partial\njudgment because the time to appeal has expired. See Fed. R. App.\nP. 4(a)(1)(A)(stating that, in a civil case, the notice of appeal\nmust be filed with the district court clerk within 30 days of the\ndate when the judgment is entered).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fwas a substantial or motivating factor behind the challenged\n\nemployment action.    See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429\n\nU.S. 274, 287 (1977); Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodríguez, 360 F.3d\n\n42, 47 (1st Cir. 2004).    The plaintiff must point \"to evidence on\n\nthe record which, if credited, would permit a rational fact finder\n\nto conclude that the challenged personnel action occurred and\n\nstemmed from a politically based discriminatory animus.\"        LaRou v.\n\nRidlon, 98 F.3d 659, 661 (1st Cir. 1996)(quoting Rivera-Cotto v.\n\nRivera, 38 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir. 1994)(internal quotations\n\nomitted)).\n\n           The district court found that González failed to provide\n\nany evidence that establishes a genuine issue of material fact as\n\nto   whether   her   political   affiliation   was   a   substantial   or\n\nmotivating factor behind the alleged adverse employment action. In\n\nthe view of the district court, González did not even establish\n\nthat her political affiliation was known to the defendants.\n\n             We agree with the district court that González has not\n\nmet the burden of showing that her political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor for the challenged employment\n\naction.   González has adduced no evidence that the defendants knew\n\nshe was a member of the NPP.     She attempts to bolster her political\n\ndiscrimination cause of action by alleging that Zayas and Maldonado\n\nmust have been aware of her political affiliation because she was\n\na well-known supporter of the NPP in the community, had held a\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fprevious trust position under the NPP administration, and was\n\nallegedly demoted shortly after the PDP assumed power.                           González\n\npoints to Zayas's statement that she wanted González's office and\n\nposition to go to an employee of her trust as indication of a\n\ncausal link between her political beliefs and the change in her\n\nemployment conditions.\n\n           This evidence is insufficient to show that political\n\naffiliation was a substantial factor in the challenged employment\n\naction.    Compare Cosme-Rosado, 360 F.3d at 48 (finding that the\n\nmayor's stated intention to \"rid the town of NPP activists\" was not\n\nenough to show that political affiliation was motive) with Padilla-\n\nGarcía v. Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 75-76 (1st Cir. 2000)(where\n\nevidence     showed    that    defendants         knew        of   plaintiffs'     party\n\naffiliation, plaintiff was conspicuous party member and witnesses\n\ntestified as to defendant's desire to humiliate plaintiff there was\n\ngenuine issue     of   material      fact    to    warrant         denial   of    summary\n\njudgment).      While \"we recognize that a prima facie case for\n\npolitical discrimination may be built on circumstantial evidence,\"\n\nGonzález has not generated \"the specific facts necessary to take\n\nthe asserted     claim   out    of   the     realm       of    speculative,       general\n\nallegations.\"    Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).    We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nplaintiff's political discrimination claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fB.   The Due Process Claim\n\n            González's   second    claim    is     that       she   has     a\n\nconstitutionally   protected   property    right   to   her    position    as\n\nExecutive Director IV and that she was deprived of this right\n\nwithout due process of law.    The district court held that González\n\ndid not have a property interest in the Executive Director IV\n\nposition because it was obtained in violation of Puerto Rico law.\n\nWe agree.\n\n            Under the Fourteenth Amendment, a public employee who\n\npossesses a property interest in continued employment cannot be\n\ndischarged without due process of law.       See Santana v. Calderón,\n\n342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2003); Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio,\n\n221 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2000).    The Constitution does not create\n\nproperty interests; \"they are created and their dimensions are\n\ndefined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\n\nindependent source such as state law.\"     Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408\n\nU.S. 564, 577 (1972); see also Santana, 342 F.3d at 23-24.                \"In\n\norder to establish a constitutionally protected property interest,\n\na plaintiff must demonstrate that she has a legally recognized\n\nexpectation that she will retain her position . . . .\"              Santana,\n\n342 F.3d at 24.\n\n            Under Puerto Rico law, career employees have a property\n\ninterest in their continued employment.      See Figueroa-Serrano, 221\n\nF.3d at 6; Kauffman, 841 F.2d at 1173.      However, \"public employees\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fhired   for    career   positions   in   violation   of   the   Puerto   Rico\n\nPersonnel Act, or agency regulations promulgated thereunder, may\n\nnot claim property rights to continued expectations of employment\n\nbecause their career appointments are null and void ab initio.\"\n\nKauffman, 841 F.2d at 1173; see also De Feliciano v. De Jesús, 873\n\nF.2d 447, 452-55 (1st Cir. 1989).          The Personnel Act sets up a\n\nmerit system for career employees.        See generally 3 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 1333.       Under this system, career employees must, among other\n\nrequirements, pass a competitive examination to be eligible for\n\nappointment or promotion to a career position. See, e.g., Ramos-\n\nMeléndez v. Valdejully, 960 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1992)(holding that,\n\nif the plaintiff held a career position to which he was appointed\n\nwithout taking a competitive examination, he held the position\n\nillegally).      The issue before us, then, is whether González's\n\nappointment to the Executive Director IV position, after her tenure\n\nin the trust position ended, complied with Puerto Rico law.\n\n              In their motion for summary judgment, Zayas and Maldonado\n\nargued that the transfer violated the Personnel Act in two ways:\n\n(1) González had been improperly reinstated under Puerto Rico law\n\nwhich forbids any transfer of public service personnel two months\n\nprior to and two months after an election; and (2) González was\n\nimproperly reinstated to a career position three levels higher than\n\nthat to which she was entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f            We     agree    with   the     district     court's       holding      that\n\nGonzález's reinstatement did not violate the ban on transfers of\n\npublic service personnel two months prior to and two months after\n\nan election.      See 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1337.          González was reinstated\n\nto the Executive Director IV position on September 1, 2000, more\n\nthan two months before the elections were held on November 6, 2000.\n\nThe reinstatement on September 1, 2000, was therefore outside the\n\nprohibited period.\n\n             González's reinstatement to the position of Executive\n\nDirector IV, however, did violate the Personnel Act.                     González was\n\nreinstated    to    a   position    higher      than   that   to   which     she    was\n\nentitled. She was entitled, under the statute, to reinstatement in\n\na position equal to the one she last held as a career employee.\n\nSee 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350(a) (when a trust employee transfers\n\nback to a career position, she \"shall have the absolute right to be\n\nreinstated    in    a   regular    [career]      position     equal   to    the    last\n\nposition she held while in the Career service . . . .\").                    While she\n\nwas in a trust position from January 1993 to September 2000,\n\nGonzález's       original    position      was    eliminated       and     eventually\n\nreclassified as Director of Integral Services I due to an amendment\n\nin Puerto Rico law.         When González requested reinstatement to her\n\ncareer position in June 2000, Director of Integral Services I was\n\noccupied.    A memorandum prepared by the Family Department's Human\n\nResources Office on July 20, 2000, recommended that González be\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\freinstated to Executive Director I, because this position was the\n\nmost similar to her last career position.                  Because Executive\n\nDirector I was designated as equal to her prior career position,\n\nher property interest under Puerto Rico law was in the Executive\n\nDirector I position.         See Kauffman, 841 F.2d at 1173.            Thus,\n\nGonzález was entitled to reinstatement to Executive Director I, not\n\nExecutive Director IV.3      In order to be properly appointed to the\n\nExecutive IV position, González had to be appointed pursuant to 3\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 1334(2).      See id. (\"Transfers may be made from one\n\nposition to another in the same class . . . provided the employee\n\nmeets   the   requirements    for   the    position   to    which   [she]   was\n\ntransferred.\").     Under the Personnel Act, a transfer such as\n\nGonzalez's is improper, and plaintiff has presented no evidence to\n\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact as to its legality.                 See\n\nDeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"Once the\n\nmoving party has properly supported [its] motion for summary\n\njudgment, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, with respect to\n\neach issue on which [it] has the burden of proof, to demonstrate\n\nthat a trier of fact reasonably could find in [its] favor.\")(citing\n\n\n\n3\n   There is some uncertainty in the record regarding González's\ntransfer to a trust position in October 2000 and subsequent\nreinstatement to the Executive Director IV position in December\n2000. Because we find that González's original September 1, 2000\nreinstatement to Executive Director IV was improper, any subsequent\ntransfers would be tainted by the September reinstatement (at least\nduring the period in question). We therefore need not reach the\nquestion of whether any subsequent transfers occurred.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fCelotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)).             We therefore\n\naffirm the district court's order on these grounds.4\n\nC.    Scope of the Summary Judgment Record\n\n            At   the   same   time   they   moved   for   summary    judgment,\n\ndefendants filed a motion requesting leave to accept the documents\n\nsubmitted in support of the motion for summary judgment in the\n\nSpanish language pursuant to Local Rule 108.5               González filed a\n\nmotion in opposition to the filing of documents in support of\n\nmotion for summary judgment, arguing that the documents were in\n\nSpanish and all but one did not involve or mention González.               She\n\nargues    that   the   district   court     erred   in   accepting   documents\n\nsupporting defendants' motion for summary judgment filed in the\n\nSpanish language. Defendants argue that it was within the district\n\ncourt's discretion to accept the documents in Spanish until English\n\nlanguage translations were filed.           See D.P.R. R. 108.1.6\n\n\n4\n   Further, because plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether defendants violated any of\nplaintiff's rights, we need not reach the issue of qualified\nimmunity. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)(stating\nthat whether a constitutional violation occurred is the first step\nin the qualified immunity inquiry).\n5\n     Local Rule 108.1 stated:\n\n            All documents not in the English language\n            which are presented or filed in this Court,\n            whether evidence or otherwise, shall be\n            accompanied at the time of presentation or\n            filing by an English translation thereof,\n            unless the court shall otherwise order.\n6\n     This rule is now codified as Local Rule 43.           See D.P.R.

The evidence submitted in Spanish therefore does\n\nnot affect the disposition of this case.\n\n          The    main   document     in    issue     is   the     internal     audit\n\nconducted by the Family Department. The record before the district\n\ncourt did not contain an English translation of the audit.                       An\n\nEnglish translation of the audit does appear in the appendix to\n\nGonzález's appellate brief.         Since the audit did not appear in\n\nEnglish on the record before the district court when it decided the\n\nmotion for    summary   judgment,     we    cannot    now    take    the   English\n\ntranslation of this audit into account.            See Estades-Negroni, 359\n\nF.3d at 2.      The memorandum prepared by the Family Department's\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fHuman Resources Office on July 20, 2000, which was in the summary\n\njudgment    record    in    an   English    translation,      recommended      that\n\nplaintiff be reinstated to Executive Director I, because Executive\n\nDirector    I   was   the   most    similar     to    plaintiff's    last   career\n\nposition.\n\n            The   district       court    should     not   have   considered   any\n\ndocuments before it that were in the Spanish language.                      Because\n\nthere was sufficient evidence in the record in English to support\n\nthe district court's holding that no genuine issue of material fact\n\nremained, however, we may affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\nD.   The State Claims\n\n            González assigns error to the district court's dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice of her causes of action under Puerto Rico law\n\nwhen it issued a general order dismissing all claims.                       In its\n\nopinion and order, the district court discussed only González's\n\nfederal claims.        The district court then dismissed González's\n\naction with prejudice.\n\n            Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, \"district court may decline to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction\" if \"the district court has\n\ndismissed all claims under which it has original jurisdiction.\" 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1367(c); see Claudio-Gotay v. Becton Dickinson Caribe,\n\nLtd., 2004 WL 1557905, *4 (1st Cir. July 13, 2004).                  We review a\n\ndistrict court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\ffor abuse of discretion.    See Pejepscot Indus. Park, Inc. v. Maine\n\nCent. R. Co., 215 F.3d 195, 200 (1st Cir. 2000).      \"As a general\n\nprinciple, the unfavorable disposition of a plaintiff's federal\n\nclaims at the early stages of a suit . . . will trigger the\n\ndismissal without prejudice of any supplemental state-law claims.\"\n\nRodríguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).   To the extent that the federal action was dismissed with\n\nprejudice, we construe it as holding that González is at liberty to\n\nbring her unadjudicated claims before the Commonwealth courts, but\n\nher federal claims are forever barred.         See 28 U.S.C. § 2106\n\n(allowing appellate courts to modify judgments as may be just under\n\nthe circumstances).   We can discern no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of the action after ruling against\n\nGonzález on the federal claims.\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the defendants.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   \"Concurrence follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge, (Concurring in the judgment).

Toledo Davila,</i> 135 F.3d 182, 185 (1st Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez is a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), which was the political party in power in Puerto Rico before the 2000 general elections. After the elections, a new administration under the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") assumed control of the government. Both defendants are members of the PDP. At all relevant times, Zayas was the Secretary of the Family Department of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Family Department\"), and Maldonado was its Human Resources Director. Following the change in administration, the Family Department conducted an audit of its Human Resources Office covering personnel transactions from July 1, 1998, through December 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez began working for the Family Department in 1972. As of January 1993, she held a career position classified as Local Service Director I. On January 22, 1993, Gonz&#225;lez was promoted to the trust position of Regional Director III. During her time in the trust position, the position of Local Service Director I was eliminated and replaced by the position of Director of Integral Services I. Gonz&#225;lez occupied her trust position into 2000. On June 21, 2000, Gonz&#225;lez requested reinstatement to a career position pursuant to the Puerto Rico Personnel Act (the \"Personnel Act\"), 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167;1301-1431.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum dated July 20, 2000, the Family Department's Human Resources Office stated that the position of Executive Director I was most similar to the position of Director of Integral Services I which was presently occupied. Notwithstanding the memorandum's finding, on September 1, 2000, the Executive Secretary of the Family Department reinstated Gonz&#225;lez to a career position as Executive Director IV, which, as its designation suggests, provides greater compensation and involves more responsibility than Executive Director I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the complaint, beginning in January 2001, Gonz&#225;lez began receiving less work and responsibility. She also overheard co-workers make what she deemed to be derogatory comments about her. On February 2, 2001, Gonz&#225;lez met with Zayas to discuss her situation at work. Zayas informed Gonz&#225;lez that she had been improperly reinstated to the Executive Director IV position and that she would have to be placed in a different position. Zayas also allegedly told Gonz&#225;lez that she needed Gonz&#225;lez's position for \"an employee of her trust.\" Zayas ordered Gonz&#225;lez to vacate her office and exhaust any accumulated vacation leave. Gonz&#225;lez went on vacation for ten days. When she returned, she was not immediately assigned a new office or duties. After several days, she met with Maldonado, the Human Resources Manager. Maldonado informed Gonz&#225;lez that she would be transferred to the career position of Executive Director I because she had been improperly promoted to Executive Director IV. The demotion was made retroactive to September 1, 2000. On April 4, 2001, Gonz&#225;lez began working in the Executive Director I position. On April 21, 2001, Gonz&#225;lez's request for early retirement was approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez filed the present complaint against the Family Department seeking monetary damages. She alleged violations under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981, 1983, and 1986 of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as Article II, &#167;&#167; 1, 6, and 7 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Gonz&#225;lez alleged that she had a property right protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to her career position as Executive Director IV, and that defendants unconstitutionally discriminated against her on the basis of her political affiliation in violation of the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2003, Zayas and Maldonado filed a motion for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion for summary judgment, mooted the remaining motions, and dismissed all claims against Zayas and Maldonado. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Political Discrimination Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When alleging a claim of political discrimination, a plaintiff bears the burden of producing sufficient evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that she engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the challenged employment action. <i>See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 360 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir.2004). The plaintiff must point \"to evidence on the record which, if credited, would permit a rational fact finder to conclude that the challenged personnel action occurred and stemmed from a politically based discriminatory animus.\" <i>LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> 98 F.3d 659, 661 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Rivera-Cotto v. Rivera,</i> 38 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Gonz&#225;lez failed to provide any evidence that establishes a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the alleged adverse employment action. In the view of the district court, Gonz&#225;lez did not even establish that her political affiliation was known to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that Gonz&#225;lez has not met the burden of showing that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the challenged employment action. Gonz&#225;lez has adduced no evidence that the defendants knew she was a member of the NPP. She attempts to bolster her political discrimination cause of action by alleging that Zayas and Maldonado must have been aware of her political affiliation because she was a well-known supporter of the NPP in the community, had held a previous trust position under the NPP administration, and was allegedly demoted shortly after the PDP assumed power. Gonz&#225;lez points to Zayas's statement that she wanted Gonz&#225;lez's office and position to go to an employee of her trust as indication of a causal link between her political beliefs and the change in her employment conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is insufficient to show that political affiliation was a substantial factor in the challenged employment action. <i>Compare Cosme-Rosado,</i> 360 F.3d at 48 (finding that the mayor's stated intention to \"rid the town of NPP activists\" was not enough to show that political affiliation was motive) <i>with Padilla-Garc&#237;a v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 75-76 (1st Cir.2000) (where evidence showed that defendants knew of plaintiffs' party affiliation, plaintiff was conspicuous party member and witnesses testified as to defendant's desire to humiliate plaintiff there was genuine issue of material fact to warrant denial of summary judgment). While \"we recognize that a prima facie case for political discrimination may be built on circumstantial evidence,\" Gonz&#225;lez has not generated \"the specific facts necessary to take the asserted claim out of the realm of speculative, general allegations.\" <i>Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir.1988). We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's political discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez's second claim is that she has a constitutionally protected property right to her position as Executive Director IV and that she was deprived of this right without due process of law. The district court held that Gonz&#225;lez did not have a property interest in the Executive Director IV position because it was obtained in violation of Puerto Rico law. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Fourteenth Amendment, a public employee who possesses a property interest in continued employment cannot be discharged without due process of law. <i>See Santana v. Calderon,</i> 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio,</i> 221 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2000). The Constitution does not create property interests; \"they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <i>see also Santana,</i> 342 F.3d at 23-24. \"In order to establish a constitutionally protected property interest, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she has a legally recognized expectation that she will retain her position....\" <i>Santana,</i> 342 F.3d at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, career employees have a property interest in their continued employment. <i>See Figueroa-Serrano,</i> 221 F.3d at 6; <i>Kauffman,</i> 841 F.2d at 1173. However, \"public employees hired for career positions in violation of the Puerto Rico Personnel Act, or agency regulations promulgated thereunder, may not claim property rights to continued expectations of employment because their career appointments are null and void <i>ab initio.\" Kauffman,</i> 841 F.2d at 1173; <i>see also De Feliciano v. De Jesus,</i> 873 F.2d 447, 452-55 (1st Cir.1989). The Personnel Act sets up a merit system for career employees. <i>See generally</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1333. Under this system, career employees must, among other requirements, pass a competitive examination to be eligible for appointment or promotion to a career position. <i>See, e.g., Ramos-Melendez v. Valdejully,</i> 960 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that, if the plaintiff held a career position to which he was appointed without taking a competitive examination, he held the position illegally). The issue before us, then, is whether Gonz&#225;lez's appointment to the Executive Director IV position, after her tenure in the trust position ended, complied with Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their motion for summary judgment, Zayas and Maldonado argued that the transfer violated the Personnel Act in two ways: (1) Gonz&#225;lez had been improperly reinstated under Puerto Rico law which forbids any transfer of public service personnel two months prior to and two months after an election; and (2) Gonz&#225;lez was improperly reinstated to a career position three levels higher than that to which she was entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's holding that Gonz&#225;lez's reinstatement did not violate the ban on transfers of public service personnel two months prior to and two months after an election. <i>See</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;1337. Gonz&#225;lez was reinstated to the Executive Director IV position on September 1, 2000, more than two months before the elections were held on November 6, 2000. The reinstatement on September 1, 2000, was therefore outside the prohibited period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez's reinstatement to the position of Executive Director IV, however, did violate the Personnel Act. Gonz&#225;lez was reinstated to a position higher than that to which she was entitled. She was entitled, under the statute, to reinstatement in a position equal to the one she last held as a career employee. <i>See</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1350(a) (when a trust employee transfers back to a career position, she \"shall have the absolute right to be reinstated in a regular [career] position equal to the last position she held while in the Career service....\"). While she was in a trust position from January 1993 to September 2000, Gonz&#225;lez's original position was eliminated and eventually reclassified as Director of Integral Services I due to an amendment in Puerto Rico law. When Gonz&#225;lez requested reinstatement to her career position in June 2000, Director of Integral Services I was occupied. A memorandum prepared by the Family Department's Human Resources Office on July 20, 2000, recommended that Gonz&#225;lez be reinstated to Executive Director I, because this position was the most similar to her last career position. Because Executive Director I was designated as equal to her prior career position, her property interest under Puerto Rico law was in the Executive Director I position. <i>See Kauffman,</i> 841 F.2d at 1173. Thus, Gonz&#225;lez was entitled to reinstatement to Executive Director I, not Executive Director IV.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In order to be properly appointed to the Executive IV position, Gonz&#225;lez had to be appointed pursuant to 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1334(2). <i>See id.</i> (\"Transfers may be made from one position to another in the same class ... provided the employee meets the requirements for the position to which [she] was transferred.\"). Under the Personnel Act, a transfer such as Gonz&#225;lez's is improper, and plaintiff has presented no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to its legality. <i>See DeNovellis v. Shalala,</i> 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir.1997) (\"Once the moving party has properly supported [its] motion for summary judgment, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, with respect to each issue on which [it] has the burden of proof, to demonstrate that a trier of fact reasonably could find in [its] favor.\")(citing <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). We therefore affirm the district court's order on these grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Scope of the Summary Judgment Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time they moved for summary judgment, defendants filed a motion requesting leave to accept the documents submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment in the Spanish language pursuant to Local Rule 108.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Gonz&#225;lez filed a motion in opposition to the filing of documents in support of motion for summary judgment, arguing that the documents were in Spanish and all but one did not involve or mention Gonz&#225;lez. She argues that the district court erred in accepting documents supporting defendants' motion for summary judgment filed in the Spanish language. Defendants argue that it was within the district court's discretion to accept the documents in Spanish until English language translations were filed. <i>See</i> D.P.R. R. 108.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that \"federal litigation in Puerto Rico [must] be conducted in English.\" <i>Estades-Negroni v.

Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2002). A violation of the English language requirement \"will constitute reversible error whenever the appellant can demonstrate that the untranslated evidence has the potential to affect the disposition of an issue raised on appeal.\" <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was sufficient evidence in the record in English to sustain a finding that Gonz&#225;lez was reinstated in violation of the Personnel Act.

The record before the district court did not contain an English translation of the audit. An English translation of the audit does appear in the appendix to Gonz&#225;lez's appellate brief. Since the audit did not appear in English on the record before the district court when it decided the motion for summary judgment, we cannot now take the English translation of this audit into account. <i>See Estades-Negroni,</i> 359 F.3d at 2. The memorandum prepared by the Family Department's Human Resources Office on July 20, 2000, which was in the summary judgment record in an English translation, recommended that plaintiff be reinstated to Executive Director I, because Executive Director I was the most similar to plaintiff's last career position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court should not have considered any documents before it that were in the Spanish language.

Becton Dickinson Caribe, Ltd.,</i> 375 F.3d 99, 104, 2004 WL 1557905, *4 (1st Cir. July 13, 2004). We review a district court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <i>See Pejepscot Indus. Park, Inc. v. Maine Cent. R.

Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.1995). To the extent that the federal action was dismissed with prejudice, we construe it as holding that Gonz&#225;lez is at liberty to bring her unadjudicated claims before the Commonwealth courts, but her federal claims are forever barred. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 (allowing appellate courts to modify judgments as may be just under the circumstances).

After the elections, a new administration under the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") assumed control of the government. Both defendants are members of the PDP. At all relevant times, Zayas was the Secretary of the Family Department of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Family Department\"), and Maldonado was its Human Resources Director. Following the change in administration, the Family Department conducted an audit of its Human Resources Office covering personnel transactions from July 1, 1998, through December 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonz&#225;lez began working for the Family Department in 1972. As of January 1993, she held a career position classified as Local Service Director I. On January 22, 1993, Gonz&#225;lez was promoted to the trust position of Regional Director III. During her time in the trust position, the position of Local Service Director I was eliminated and replaced by the position of Director of Integral Services I. Gonz&#225;lez occupied her trust position into 2000. On June 21, 2000, Gonz&#225;lez requested reinstatement to a career position pursuant to the Puerto Rico Personnel Act (the \"Personnel Act\"), 3 P.R.

Notwithstanding the memorandum's finding, on September 1, 2000, the Executive Secretary of the Family Department reinstated Gonz&#225;lez to a career position as Executive Director IV, which, as its designation suggests, provides greater compensation and involves more responsibility than Executive Director I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the complaint, beginning in January 2001, Gonz&#225;lez began receiving less work and responsibility. She also overheard co-workers make what she deemed to be derogatory comments about her. On February 2, 2001, Gonz&#225;lez met with Zayas to discuss her situation at work. Zayas informed Gonz&#225;lez that she had been improperly reinstated to the Executive Director IV position and that she would have to be placed in a different position. Zayas also allegedly told Gonz&#225;lez that she needed Gonz&#225;lez's position for \"an employee of her trust.\" Zayas ordered Gonz&#225;lez to vacate her office and exhaust any accumulated vacation leave. Gonz&#225;lez went on vacation for ten days. When she returned, she was not immediately assigned a new office or duties. After several days, she met with Maldonado, the Human Resources Manager. Maldonado informed Gonz&#225;lez that she would be transferred to the career position of Executive Director I because she had been improperly promoted to Executive Director IV. The demotion was made retroactive to September 1, 2000. On April 4, 2001, Gonz&#225;lez began working in the Executive Director I position.

Gonz&#225;lez has adduced no evidence that the defendants knew she was a member of the NPP. She attempts to bolster her political discrimination cause of action by alleging that Zayas and Maldonado must have been aware of her political affiliation because she was a well-known supporter of the NPP in the community, had held a previous trust position under the NPP administration, and was allegedly demoted shortly after the PDP assumed power. Gonz&#225;lez points to Zayas's statement that she wanted Gonz&#225;lez's office and position to go to an employee of her trust as indication of a causal link between her political beliefs and the change in her employment conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is insufficient to show that political affiliation was a substantial factor in the challenged employment action. <i>Compare Cosme-Rosado,</i> 360 F.3d at 48 (finding that the mayor's stated intention to \"rid the town of NPP activists\" was not enough to show that political affiliation was motive) <i>with Padilla-Garc&#237;a v.

The issue before us, then, is whether Gonz&#225;lez's appointment to the Executive Director IV position, after her tenure in the trust position ended, complied with Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their motion for summary judgment, Zayas and Maldonado argued that the transfer violated the Personnel Act in two ways: (1) Gonz&#225;lez had been improperly reinstated under Puerto Rico law which forbids any transfer of public service personnel two months prior to and two months after an election; and (2) Gonz&#225;lez was improperly reinstated to a career position three levels higher than that to which she was entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's holding that Gonz&#225;lez's reinstatement did not violate the ban on transfers of public service personnel two months prior to and two months after an election. <i>See</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;1337. Gonz&#225;lez was reinstated to the Executive Director IV position on September 1, 2000, more than two months before the elections were held on November 6, 2000.

Gonz&#225;lez was reinstated to a position higher than that to which she was entitled. She was entitled, under the statute, to reinstatement in a position equal to the one she last held as a career employee. <i>See</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1350(a) (when a trust employee transfers back to a career position, she \"shall have the absolute right to be reinstated in a regular [career] position equal to the last position she held while in the Career service....\"). While she was in a trust position from January 1993 to September 2000, Gonz&#225;lez's original position was eliminated and eventually reclassified as Director of Integral Services I due to an amendment in Puerto Rico law. When Gonz&#225;lez requested reinstatement to her career position in June 2000, Director of Integral Services I was occupied. A memorandum prepared by the Family Department's Human Resources Office on July 20, 2000, recommended that Gonz&#225;lez be reinstated to Executive Director I, because this position was the most similar to her last career position. Because Executive Director I was designated as equal to her prior career position, her property interest under Puerto Rico law was in the Executive Director I position. <i>See Kauffman,</i> 841 F.2d at 1173. Thus, Gonz&#225;lez was entitled to reinstatement to Executive Director I, not Executive Director IV.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In order to be properly appointed to the Executive IV position, Gonz&#225;lez had to be appointed pursuant to 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1334(2). <i>See id.</i> (\"Transfers may be made from one position to another in the same class ... provided the employee meets the requirements for the position to which [she] was transferred.\"). Under the Personnel Act, a transfer such as Gonz&#225;lez's is improper, and plaintiff has presented no evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to its legality. <i>See DeNovellis v.

To the extent that the federal action was dismissed with prejudice, we construe it as holding that Gonz&#225;lez is at liberty to bring her unadjudicated claims before the Commonwealth courts, but her federal claims are forever barred. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 (allowing appellate courts to modify judgments as may be just under the circumstances).
