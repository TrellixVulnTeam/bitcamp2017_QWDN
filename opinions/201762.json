Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n          Torruella, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John Ward-Llambias for appellant.\n     Francisco M. Ramírez-Rivera, with whom Amelia Fortuño-Ruiz and\nMartinez, Odell & Calabria were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 12, 2005\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    Plaintiff-appellant Juan Cordero-\n\nSoto appeals the grant of summary judgment dismissing his claims\n\nagainst Defendant-appellee Island Finance, Inc. under the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C §§ 621-634 (\"ADEA\"). We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Cordero was forty-nine and on sick leave when he was\n\nterminated on October 27, 2000 from his position as a Branch\n\nManager of Island Finance, a loan company for which he had worked\n\nin differing capacities for more than 25 years.      On May 15, 2002,\n\nCordero filed suit in federal court, alleging that Island Finance\n\nhad terminated his employment because of his age in violation of\n\nthe ADEA.    Cordero also brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\n\nPuerto Rico law.\n\n            On January 26, 2004, Island Finance moved for summary\n\njudgment on Cordero's ADEA claims, as well as dismissal of his\n\nclaims under § 1983 and Puerto Rico law.     In its motion for summary\n\njudgment, Island Finance argued that Cordero was ineligible for\n\nback pay, front pay, or reinstatement for any ADEA violation as a\n\nmatter of law because the Social Security Administration had\n\ndesignated him disabled as of September 15, 2000, the date he went\n\non sick leave, and because Cordero continued to receive Social\n\nSecurity Disability Insurance (\"SSDI\") benefits.       Island Finance\n\nalso argued that Cordero could not recover liquidated damages,\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwhich are available only for willful violations of the ADEA.                  29\n\nU.S.C. § 626(b); see Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469\n\nU.S. 111, 125 (1985) (explaining that statutory provision \"which\n\nmakes the award of liquidated damages mandatory\" under the Fair\n\nLabor Standards Act \"is significantly qualified\" in its application\n\nto the ADEA \"by a proviso that a prevailing plaintiff is entitled\n\nto double damages 'only in cases of willful violations.'\" (quoting\n\n29 U.S.C. § 626(b))).\n\n            The    district   court    issued   an   opinion   and    order    on\n\nSeptember 30, 2004 granting Island Finance's motion for summary\n\njudgment on Cordero's ADEA claims, granting its motion to dismiss\n\nCordero's § 1983 claims, and declining to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over Cordero's claims under Puerto Rico law.                     See\n\nCordero Soto v. Island Fin., Inc., 338 F. Supp. 2d 299 (D.P.R.\n\n2004).     The court first explained that, as a result of Cordero's\n\n\"repeated lack of compliance with the deadlines to oppose both\n\nmotions,    this   Court   denied     plaintiff's    final   request    for    an\n\nextension of time. Therefore, both motions are unopposed.\" Id. at\n\n300.     However, the court later \"ordered the parties to file\n\nsupplemental briefs on the issue of Island Finance's reasons for\n\nterminating Cordero, and Cordero did file an opposition to Island\n\nFinance's brief,\" including seventeen attached exhibits.                Id. at\n\n301.   \"Of those exhibits, seven (7) were submitted in the Spanish\n\nlanguage without a certified English translation.\"              Id.    Because\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCordero \"did not ask for leave to file said exhibits in Spanish\n\nwhile he obtained the necessary translations\" or \"subsequently\n\npresent any translations,\" the court excluded the Spanish-language\n\nexhibits from consideration.         Id.\n\n           Turning to the merits of Island Finance's motion for\n\nsummary   judgment,   the    court    concluded   that   because   \"Cordero\n\ncontinues to receive benefits for a disability that prevents him\n\nfrom being gainfully employed, and has not submitted evidence that\n\nhe would be able to go back to work,\" he was ineligible as a matter\n\nof law for back pay, front pay, or reinstatement for any ADEA\n\nviolation.     Id. at 302.     The court also concluded that Cordero\n\ncould not recover liquidated damages for a willful ADEA violation.\n\nId.   Cordero filed a timely notice of appeal from the court's grant\n\nof summary judgment on his ADEA claim, challenging (1) the court's\n\ndenial of Cordero's motion for an extension of time and its\n\nexclusion of the Spanish-language exhibits, and (2) its decision on\n\nthe merits.1\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.         Scope of the Summary Judgment Record\n\n           Under the local rules of the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico, \"[u]nless within ten (10) days\n\n\n\n      1\n      Cordero does not appeal the dismissal of his § 1983 claims\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or the dismissal without\nprejudice of his claims under Puerto Rico law. See Cordero-Soto,\n338 F. Supp. 2d at 302-03.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fafter the service of a motion the opposing party files written\n\nobjection thereto, incorporating a memorandum of law, the opposing\n\nparty shall be deemed to have waived objection.\"            D.P.R. R. 7(b)\n\n(renumbered as Rule 7.1(b), effective April 5, 2004).                However,\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) confers discretion on a court\n\nto grant an extension of time after the expiration of a filing\n\ndeadline for \"excusable neglect.\"         \"In the absence of a manifest\n\nabuse of discretion, . . . we will not interfere with a district\n\ncourt's reasoned refusal to grant incremental enlargements of\n\ntime.\"   Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R., 900 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   No such abuse occurred here.\n\n            The   court   granted   Cordero's    first    request    for    an\n\nextension of time until February 25, 2004.             On March 4, 2004,\n\nCordero requested an additional extension of time until March 8,\n\n2004.2   By March 18, 2004, when Cordero still had not filed an\n\nopposition, the court issued an order declaring his motion of March\n\n4, 2004 moot and Island Finance's motion for summary judgment\n\nunopposed.   On March 30, 2004, Cordero filed a third motion for an\n\nextension of time until April 20, 2004, attaching a hospital\n\ndischarge    record   and   explaining    that   his     counsel    had    been\n\nhospitalized from March 5 through March 10, 2004 with a \"pulmonary\n\n\n\n     2\n      Cordero's motion cited \"technical difficulties with the\nimplementation of the [court's] electronic filing system,\" problems\nsaving a computer file, and schedule conflicts that had prevented\nthe filing an opposition on or before February 25, 2004.\n\n                                    -5-\n\finfection and other conditions,\" after which counsel was instructed\n\nto rest for 20 days.\n\n            Island Finance filed an opposition to Cordero's motion\n\nthe next day, arguing, inter alia, that Cordero's counsel had been\n\nwell enough to take a deposition on March 18, 2004, and therefore\n\ncould have filed his third motion for an extension before March 30,\n\n2004. The court denied Cordero's motion on April 2, 2004, stating:\n\n\"This Court notes that plaintiff has repeatedly failed to comply\n\nwith this Court's deadlines, and failed to notify this court in a\n\ntimely manner of any circumstances that could support an extension\n\nof time.\"\n\n            While we do not fault counsel for choosing to risk his\n\nown health on his client's behalf by taking a deposition, the court\n\ncould reasonably have expected him to make the small additional\n\neffort of contemporaneously filing a motion for an extension of the\n\ndeadline for responding to the pending motions.                 Under these\n\ncircumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nCordero's   third   motion   for   an   extension   of   time   to   file   an\n\nopposition.    As a consequence, the court properly treated Island\n\nFinance's motion as unopposed and its statement of facts admitted.\n\nSee Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(\"This court has held repeatedly that the district court in Puerto\n\nRico is justified in holding one party's submitted uncontested\n\nfacts to be admitted when the other party fails to file oppositions\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fin   compliance   with   local   rules.\");   D.P.R.   R.   56(e)   (\"Facts\n\ncontained in a supporting or opposing statement of material facts,\n\nif supported by record citations as required by this rule, shall be\n\ndeemed admitted unless properly controverted.\") (proposed rule\n\neffective September 29, 2003, adopted as final rule effective April\n\n5, 2004).\n\n            Nor did the court abuse its discretion by excluding from\n\nconsideration Cordero's Spanish-language exhibits.           \"It is well\n\nsettled that federal litigation in Puerto Rico [must] be conducted\n\nin English.\"   González-De Blasini v. Family Dep't, 377 F.3d 81, 88\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see\n\nPena-Crespo v. Puerto Rico, 408 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2005) (not an\n\nabuse of discretion for the district court to exclude plaintiff's\n\nexpert testimony where the plaintiff failed to provide an English\n\ntranslation of expert's report and resume, and made no attempt to\n\nremedy the omission before the court); see also 48 U.S.C. § 864;\n\nD.P.R. R. 10(b) (\"All documents not in the English language which\n\nare presented to or filed in this Court, whether as evidence or\n\notherwise, shall be accompanied at the time of presentation or\n\nfiling by an English translation thereof, unless the Court shall\n\notherwise order.\") (approved as final rule effective April 5,\n\n2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fB.        Merits\n\n          \"Even where the record is circumscribed because summary\n\njudgment was unopposed, a district court may grant summary judgment\n\nagainst the nonresponding party only 'if appropriate.'\"             Torres-\n\nRosado,   335   F.3d   at   9   (quoting   Fed.   R.    Civ.   P.   56(e)).\n\nAccordingly, \"before granting an unopposed summary judgment motion,\n\n[t]he court must inquire whether the moving party has met its\n\nburden to demonstrate undisputed facts entitling it to summary\n\njudgment as a matter of law.\"       Lopez v. Corporación Azucarera de\n\nP.R., 938 F.2d 1510, 1516 (1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted, alteration in original).\n\n          We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, based on\n\nthe record as it stood before the district court.           Torres-Rosado,\n\n335 F.3d at 9, 5.3     We view the record in the light most favorable\n\nto Cordero, the non-moving party. Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp.\n\nof N. Am., 377 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2004).            Pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c), summary judgment is warranted \"if the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\n\n     3\n      We therefore do not consider the affidavit of Hector Cardona,\nCordero's supervisor, which Cordero did not file with the court\nuntil he moved to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 59(e) on October 11, 2004. Because Cordero did not amend his\nnotice of appeal, which was filed while his Rule 59(e) motion was\npending, the court's subsequent decision denying the Rule 59(e)\nmotion is not properly before us.     See Rio Grande Cmty. Health\nCtr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir. 2005) (limiting\njurisdiction to order in notice of appeal where \"[n]o new notice of\nappeal was filed after [later] orders were entered, as required by\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii)\").\n\n                                   -8-\n\ftogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"          \"Once the moving party avers\n\nthe absence of genuine issues of material fact, the nonmovant must\n\nshow, through materials of evidentiary quality, that such a dispute\n\nexists.\"   Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           In   order   to   prevail   on   a   claim    of   pretextual   age\n\ndiscrimination, an ADEA claimant who lacks direct evidence, as\n\nCordero does, must first make out a prima facie case triggering a\n\nrebuttable presumption of age discrimination by\n\n           adduc[ing] evidence that (1) [he] was at least\n           forty years of age; (2) [his] job performance\n           met the employer's legitimate expectations;\n           (3) the employer subjected [him] to an adverse\n           employment   action   (e.g.,  an   actual   or\n           constructive discharge); and (4) the employer\n           had a continuing need for the services\n           provided by the position from which the\n           claimant was discharged.\n\nGonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 68 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nUpon a sufficient showing, the burden of production shifts to the\n\nemployer \"to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for\n\nits adverse employment action.\"        Id. at 69.       Once an employer has\n\nmade a successful proffer, the claimant must then establish that\n\nthe employer's given reason \"was pretextual\" and that the record\n\nevidence would permit a reasonable jury to infer that the real\n\nreason was \"discriminatory animus\" based on his age.             Id.\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          Applying this three-step test within the framework of a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, we conclude that Island Finance was\n\nentitled to summary judgment, although we affirm on grounds that\n\ndiffer from those given by the district court.               See Estades-\n\nNegroni, 377 F.3d at 62 (\"We may affirm the district court's\n\ndecision on any grounds supported by the record.\").               Assuming\n\nCordero has established a prima facie case of age discrimination,\n\nthe evidence supports the inference that Island Finance had a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cordero's\n\nemployment: the branch office for which Cordero was responsible\n\nperformed worse than at least 40 other branches, based on at least\n\nthree objective financial indicators.\n\n          According   to   the   affidavit    of    Sylvia     Chaluissant\n\nSepulveda,   Vice-President,   Human    Resources   Director    of   Island\n\nFinance Puerto Rico, Inc., Island Finance made the decision \"to\n\nreplace those Branch Managers whose branches[,] [based on] the\n\nBranches Comparison Report corresponding to August 2000, were not\n\nperforming as expected and whose performance ranked 41 or above in\n\nthree or more . . . areas.\"      Upon analysis of financial data for\n\neach branch, according to Chaluissant's affidavit, Island Finance\n\ndetermined that \"Mr. Juan Cordero was one of the Branch Managers\n\nwhose Branch's performance ranked 41 or above in three areas and\n\nwas not performing as expected.          The categories in which Mr.\n\nCordero's Branch was ranked 41 or above were Activity (41), Gain\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f(50) and Delinquency (43).\"      The affidavit explains that \"Activity\n\nmeasures the number of loans made by the Branch\"; \"Gain measures\n\nthe growth or reduction of their outstanding receivables, the\n\ndollars outstanding\"; and \"Delinquency measures the payments past\n\ndue on the Branch.\"      The attached \"Island Finance Puerto Rico\n\nBranches   Comparison   Report     as   of   August,   2000\"   corroborates\n\nChaluissant's statements.    Chaluissant's affidavit concludes: \"The\n\nreasons for Plaintiff's discharge were entirely based on the lack\n\nof performance of the Branch he managed.\"        Finally, the deposition\n\ntestimony of Mr. Oriol Segarra, President of Island Finance, who\n\nsigned   Cordero's   termination    letter,    also    indicates    that   the\n\ndecision of which Branch Managers to replace was based on an\n\nevaluation of the performance of each manager's branch.4\n\n           In the face of this evidence, Cordero argues that Island\n\nFinance's apparently legitimate reason for terminating him is in\n\nfact pretextual, and that its true reason was his age.             As support\n\nfor the inference of pretext, Cordero points to his own affidavit,\n\nin which he states that \"[i]n my case, as well as [those of] other\n\nmanagers and senior managers, I was transferred to another branch\n\nwith lower production shortly before my termination.               Likewise,\n\n\n     4\n      Cordero does not contest Island Finance's data analysis,\nexcept to argue that a Branch Manager's performance should be based\non more than the financial performance of his branch.          Even\nassuming this to be true, \"[c]ourts may not sit as super personnel\ndepartments, assessing the merits -- or even the rationality -- of\nemployers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\" Mesnick v. Gen.\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                   -11-\n\fother managers were transferred to better ranked branches so they\n\nwould appear as achievers in a short period of time.\"       In addition\n\nto being unsigned and undated, Cordero's affidavit provides no\n\nbasis for his personal knowledge of the facts supporting his\n\nstatements, as is required for consideration in opposition to a\n\nmotion for summary judgment.       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (affidavits\n\n\"shall be made on personal knowledge . . . [and] show affirmatively\n\nthat the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated\n\ntherein\"). Furthermore, \"[a] properly supported motion for summary\n\njudgment cannot be defeated by relying upon improbable inferences,\n\nconclusory allegations, or rank speculation\" of the sort contained\n\nin Cordero's affidavit.   Rathbun, 361 F.3d at 66.\n\n          In the absence of any \"evidence from which a reasonable\n\njury could infer, without the most tenuous insinuation,\" that\n\nIsland   Finance's   legitimate,     non-discriminatory     reason   for\n\nterminating   Cordero     \"was     actually   a   pretext     for    age\n\ndiscrimination,\" Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 826, Island Finance is\n\nentitled to summary judgment.5        The district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment dismissing Cordero's ADEA claims is affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      We therefore do not address the effect of Cordero's\nsuccessful claim for SSDI benefits on his entitlement to specific\nremedies under the ADEA.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

Assuming Cordero has established a prima facie case of age discrimination, the evidence supports the inference that Island Finance had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cordero's employment: the branch office for which Cordero was responsible performed worse than at least 40 other branches, based on at least three objective financial indicators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the affidavit of Sylvia Chaluissant Sepulveda, Vice-President, Human Resources Director of Island Finance Puerto Rico, Inc., Island Finance made the decision \"to replace those Branch Managers whose branches[,] [based on] the Branches Comparison Report corresponding to August 2000, were not performing as expected and whose performance ranked 41 or above in three or more . . . areas.\" Upon analysis of financial data for each branch, according to Chaluissant's affidavit, Island Finance determined that \"Mr. Juan Cordero was one of the Branch Managers whose Branch's performance ranked 41 or above in three areas and was not performing as expected. The categories in which Mr. Cordero's Branch was ranked 41 or above were Activity (41), Gain (50) and Delinquency (43).\" The affidavit explains that \"Activity measures the number of loans made by the Branch\"; \"Gain measures the growth or reduction of their outstanding receivables, the dollars outstanding\"; and \"Delinquency measures the payments past due on the Branch.\" The attached \"Island Finance Puerto Rico Branches Comparison Report as of August, 2000\" corroborates Chaluissant's statements. Chaluissant's affidavit concludes: \"The reasons for Plaintiff's discharge were entirely based on the lack of performance of the Branch he managed.\" Finally, the deposition testimony of Mr. Oriol Segarra, President of Island Finance, who signed Cordero's termination letter, also indicates that the decision of which Branch Managers to replace was based on an evaluation of the performance of each manager's branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of this evidence, Cordero argues that Island Finance's apparently legitimate reason for terminating him is in fact pretextual, and that its true reason was his age. As support for the inference of pretext, Cordero points to his own affidavit, in which he states that \"[i]n my case, as well as [those of] other managers and senior managers, I was transferred to another branch with lower production shortly before my termination. Likewise, other managers were transferred to better ranked branches so they would appear as achievers in a short period of time.\" In addition to being unsigned and undated, Cordero's affidavit provides no basis for his personal knowledge of the facts supporting his statements, as is required for consideration in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (affidavits \"shall be made on personal knowledge . . . [and] show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein\"). Furthermore, \"[a] properly supported motion for summary judgment cannot be defeated by relying upon improbable inferences, conclusory allegations, or rank speculation\" of the sort contained in Cordero's affidavit. <i>Rathbun,</i> 361 F.3d at 66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of any \"evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer, without the most tenuous insinuation,\" that Island Finance's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cordero \"was actually a pretext for age discrimination,\" <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 826, Island Finance is entitled to summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court's grant of summary judgment dismissing Cordero's ADEA claims is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cordero does not appeal the dismissal of his &#167; 1983 claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or the dismissal without prejudice of his claims under Puerto Rico law<i>See Cordero-Soto,</i> 338 F.Supp.2d at 302-03.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cordero's motion cited \"technical difficulties with the implementation of the [court's] electronic filing system,\" problems saving a computer file, and schedule conflicts that had prevented the filing an opposition on or before February 25, 2004</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We therefore do not consider the affidavit of Hector Cardona, Cordero's supervisor, which Cordero did not file with the court until he moved to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) on October 11, 2004.

On March 30, 2004, Cordero filed a third motion for an extension of time until April 20, 2004, attaching a hospital discharge record and explaining that his counsel had been hospitalized from March 5 through March 10, 2004 with a \"pulmonary infection and other conditions,\" after which counsel was instructed to rest for 20 days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Island Finance filed an opposition to Cordero's motion the next day, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that Cordero's counsel had been well enough to take a deposition on March 18, 2004, and therefore could have filed his third motion for an extension before March 30, 2004. The court denied Cordero's motion on April 2, 2004, stating: \"This Court notes that plaintiff has repeatedly failed to comply with this Court's deadlines, and failed to notify this court in a timely manner of any circumstances that could support an extension of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not fault counsel for choosing to risk his own health on his client's behalf by taking a deposition, the court could reasonably have expected him to make the small additional effort of contemporaneously filing a motion for an extension of the deadline for responding to the pending motions. Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cordero's third motion for an extension of time to file an opposition. As a consequence, the court properly treated Island Finance's motion as unopposed and its statement of facts admitted. <i>See Torres-Rosado v.

Upon a sufficient showing, the burden of production shifts to the employer \"to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 69. Once an employer has made a successful proffer, the claimant must then establish that the employer's given reason \"was pretextual\" and that the record evidence would permit a reasonable jury to infer that the real reason was \"discriminatory animus\" based on his age. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this three-step test within the framework of a motion for summary judgment, we conclude that Island Finance was entitled to summary judgment, although we affirm on grounds that differ from those given by the district court. <i>See Estades-Negroni,</i> 377 F.3d at 62 (\"We may affirm the district court's decision on any grounds supported by the record.\"). Assuming Cordero has established a prima facie case of age discrimination, the evidence supports the inference that Island Finance had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cordero's employment: the branch office for which Cordero was responsible performed worse than at least 40 other branches, based on at least three objective financial indicators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the affidavit of Sylvia Chaluissant Sepulveda, Vice-President, Human Resources Director of Island Finance Puerto Rico, Inc., Island Finance made the decision \"to replace those Branch Managers whose branches[,] [based on] the Branches Comparison Report corresponding to August 2000, were not performing as expected and whose performance ranked 41 or above in three or more . . . areas.\" Upon analysis of financial data for each branch, according to Chaluissant's affidavit, Island Finance determined that \"Mr. Juan Cordero was one of the Branch Managers whose Branch's performance ranked 41 or above in three areas and was not performing as expected. The categories in which Mr. Cordero's Branch was ranked 41 or above were Activity (41), Gain (50) and Delinquency (43).\" The affidavit explains that \"Activity measures the number of loans made by the Branch\"; \"Gain measures the growth or reduction of their outstanding receivables, the dollars outstanding\"; and \"Delinquency measures the payments past due on the Branch.\" The attached \"Island Finance Puerto Rico Branches Comparison Report as of August, 2000\" corroborates Chaluissant's statements. Chaluissant's affidavit concludes: \"The reasons for Plaintiff's discharge were entirely based on the lack of performance of the Branch he managed.\" Finally, the deposition testimony of Mr. Oriol Segarra, President of Island Finance, who signed Cordero's termination letter, also indicates that the decision of which Branch Managers to replace was based on an evaluation of the performance of each manager's branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of this evidence, Cordero argues that Island Finance's apparently legitimate reason for terminating him is in fact pretextual, and that its true reason was his age. As support for the inference of pretext, Cordero points to his own affidavit, in which he states that \"[i]n my case, as well as [those of] other managers and senior managers, I was transferred to another branch with lower production shortly before my termination. Likewise, other managers were transferred to better ranked branches so they would appear as achievers in a short period of time.\" In addition to being unsigned and undated, Cordero's affidavit provides no basis for his personal knowledge of the facts supporting his statements, as is required for consideration in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (affidavits \"shall be made on personal knowledge . . . [and] show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein\"). Furthermore, \"[a] properly supported motion for summary judgment cannot be defeated by relying upon improbable inferences, conclusory allegations, or rank speculation\" of the sort contained in Cordero's affidavit. <i>Rathbun,</i> 361 F.3d at 66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of any \"evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer, without the most tenuous insinuation,\" that Island Finance's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Cordero \"was actually a pretext for age discrimination,\" <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 826, Island Finance is entitled to summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court's grant of summary judgment dismissing Cordero's ADEA claims is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cordero does not appeal the dismissal of his &#167; 1983 claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or the dismissal without prejudice of his claims under Puerto Rico law<i>See Cordero-Soto,</i> 338 F.Supp.2d at 302-03.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cordero's motion cited \"technical difficulties with the implementation of the [court's] electronic filing system,\" problems saving a computer file, and schedule conflicts that had prevented the filing an opposition on or before February 25, 2004</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We therefore do not consider the affidavit of Hector Cardona, Cordero's supervisor, which Cordero did not file with the court until he moved to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) on October 11, 2004.
