TARBOX, JR.,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n      (Hon. Ronald R. Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge)\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edward J. Romano was on brief for appellant.\n     Michael P. Iannotti, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Craig N. Moore, Acting United States Attorney, was on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 22, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.      On February 7, 2000, Tarbox pled guilty to\n\nfour counts of making false and fraudulent statements to obtain\n\nfederal employees' compensation benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1920.   On April 25, 2000, he was sentenced to twelve months and\n\none day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release,\n\nand was ordered to pay $97,764 in restitution to the United States\n\nDepartment   of   Labor,   according     to   a   payment   schedule   to   be\n\ndetermined by the United States Probation Office.1          Interest on the\n\namount was waived.    He did not appeal the sentence.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court has final authority to determine a\nrestitution payment schedule, see United States v. Merric, 166 F.3d\n406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999) (remanding to the district court with\ninstruction to insert into the judgment \"a phrase or sentence\nmaking this reservation of authority explicit\"), and cannot\ndelegate such authority to the probation officer.      See also 18\nU.S.C. ยง 3572(d)(2). Here, at the time of sentencing, the district\ncourt concluded that \"it wasn't determinable how much [Tarbox]\ncould make by way of restitution during his period of supervised\nrelease\" until he finished his prison term. Accordingly, the court\ndirected the Probation Office to fashion a payment schedule upon\nTarbox's release from prison.     Ultimately, the court made the\nProbation Office's payment schedule \"official\" by its February 18,\n2003 order. We have admonished that the district court may not\nauthorize a probation officer to make post-sentencing decisions as\nto either the amount of restitution or the schedule of installment\npayments because the court cannot delegate to others its \"inherent\nresponsibility\" over matters of punishment, which includes \"final\nauthority over all payment matters.\" Merric, 166 F.3d at 409. See\nalso United States v. Miller, 77 F.3d 71, 77-78 (4th Cir. 1996);\nUnited States v. Kassar, 47 F.3d 562, 568 (2d Cir. 1995). Thus,\nthere remains the issue of whether the district court still may\nhave impermissibly delegated to the Probation Office its final\nauthority over restitution payment scheduling, despite its eventual\n\"official\" adoption of the Probation Office's schedule. Tarbox,\nhowever, raised this issue neither before the district court nor\nhere on appeal; hence, we deem it waived. See United States v.\nRosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552, 563 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            On April 4, 2001, Tarbox was released from prison.                Over\n\nthe next nine months, he paid $350 toward his restitution.                    The\n\ngovernment requested a full review of his financial status.                   At a\n\nJanuary 16, 2002 meeting, Tarbox refused to provide his wife's\n\nincome and other household income to his probation officer and the\n\nAssistant    United   States   Attorney.      On    February   7,   2002,      the\n\nProbation Office set a schedule for payment, eventually determining\n\nthat the restitution was to be paid at a rate of $1,700 per month.\n\nUpon his refusal to pay according to this schedule, the government\n\nrequested the Office of Personnel Management to offset Tarbox's net\n\nmonthly pension (due to him from the Civil Service Retirement and\n\nDisability Fund), set at $1,628.50, to recover the amount of\n\nmonthly restitution.       On August 26, 2002, Tarbox filed a Motion to\n\nDispute Restitution Payments.            He also wrote two checks in the\n\namount of one cent to the Clerk of the Court for the district\n\ncourt, one dated August 25, 2002 and the other dated September 30,\n\n2002.     On February 18, 2003, after a hearing, the district court\n\nentered an order denying his motion and ordering that Tarbox's\n\npension    payments   be   \"used   in    whatever   the   amount    is   at    any\n\nparticular time to fulfill his restitution requirement until full\n\nrestitution is made.\"       Tarbox appeals from this order, contending\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion by not adjusting\n\ndownward his monthly restitution payment schedule.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f           We review a district court's restitution order for abuse\n\nof discretion.     See United States v. Cutter, 313 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n           At issue is not the full amount of restitution to be paid\n\nby Tarbox, but in how that full amount is to be paid.        The district\n\ncourt has \"substantial discretion\" over this determination.             See\n\nUnited States v. McGlothlin, 249 F.3d 783, 784 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\nThe court shall consider:\n\n           (A) the financial resources and other assets\n           of the defendant, including whether any of\n           these assets are jointly controlled;\n           (B) projected earnings and other income of the\n           defendant; and\n           (C)   any   financial   obligations   of   the\n           defendant,     including    obligations     to\n           dependents.\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3664(f)(2).      A defendant has the burden of proving by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that he is unable to make the\n\nordered restitution payments.       See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3664(e).        At the\n\nFebruary   14,   2003   hearing,   the    government   provided   financial\n\ninformation which indicated that Tarbox's household income exceeded\n\n$100,000 and was composed of (1) $62,599 annual gross salary\n\n($2,400 biweekly); (2) his wife's estimated annual salary of\n\n$15,000; (3) $3,400 in unemployment benefits for his wife during\n\nthe summer (she works as a school bus driver); and (4) a civil\n\nservice retirement pension of $25,000 gross.             At the hearing,\n\nTarbox himself offered no documentation or other evidence of his\n\nfinancial status.       In addition, he offered little to support his\n\n                                    -4-\n\fclaim that certain health problems affected his ability to work.\n\nMoreover, he presented no evidence of his claim that his health\n\ncosts constitute an extra $200 per month \"out of pocket.\"\n\n          Finally, at the hearing, Tarbox never mentioned his\n\nchildren, while at a previous meeting with the government, he\n\nclaimed the burden of child support obligations for three children\n\nhe had with a woman other than his wife.   In any event, no evidence\n\nwas produced to substantiate this claim.\n\n          Based on the evidence presented at the February 2003\n\nhearing and upon evaluation of Tarbox's financial resources and\n\nobligations, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying Tarbox's Motion to Dispute Restitution Payments and in\n\nordering that his federal civil service pension payments be offset\n\nto satisfy the monthly payment schedule.   An offset of the pension\n\nstill leaves Tarbox ample funds on which to live.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",

An offset of the pension still leaves Tarbox ample funds on which to live.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>affirm.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court has final authority to determine a restitution payment schedule,<i>see United States v. Merric,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198307\"><a href=\"/opinion/198307/united-states-v-merric/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 409 (1st Cir.1999) (remanding to the district court with instruction to insert into the judgment \"a phrase or sentence making this reservation of authority explicit\"), and cannot delegate such authority to the probation officer. <i>See also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d)(2). Here, at the time of sentencing, the district court concluded that \"it wasn't determinable how much [Tarbox] could make by way of restitution during his period of supervised release\" until he finished his prison term. Accordingly, the court directed the Probation Office to fashion a payment schedule upon Tarbox's release from prison. Ultimately, the court made the Probation Office's payment schedule \"official\" by its February 18, 2003 order. We have admonished that the district court may not authorize a probation officer to make post-sentencing decisions as to either the amount of restitution or the schedule of installment payments because the court cannot delegate to others its \"inherent responsibility\" over matters of punishment, which includes \"final authority over all payment matters.\" <i>Merric,</i> 166 F.3d at 409. <i>See also United States v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713048\"><a href=\"/opinion/713048/united-states-v-james-barnett-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 77-78 (4th Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Kassar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689129\"><a href=\"/opinion/689129/united-states-v-hassan-kassar-aka-hassan-alkassar/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 568 (2d Cir.1995). Thus, there remains the issue of whether the district court still may have impermissibly delegated to the Probation Office its final authority over restitution payment scheduling, despite its eventual \"official\" adoption of the Probation Office's schedule. Tarbox, however, raised this issue neither before the district court nor here on appeal; hence, we deem it waived. <i>See United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 563 n. 4 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
