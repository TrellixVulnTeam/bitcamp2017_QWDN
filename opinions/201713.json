We have therefore substituted Attorney\nGeneral Gonzáles for John Ashcroft as the respondent. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 25(d)(1); Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f           Per Curiam.    Petitioner appeals an order by the Board of\n\nImmigration   Appeals    (\"BIA\")   affirming    the   Immigration   Judge's\n\n(\"IJ\") decision to deny his application for asylum because he\n\nfailed to establish an objective basis for a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.      Since there is substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord to support the BIA's order, we affirm.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n           Petitioner is a 31-year-old national of Guatemala.           He\n\nentered the United States without inspection at or near San Ysidro,\n\nCalifornia, on September 15, 1991, when he was eighteen years old.\n\nOn February 22, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization Service1\n\nserved petitioner with a Notice to Appear, alleging that he is an\n\nalien present in the United States who has not been admitted or\n\nparoled after inspection by an Immigration Officer.            Petitioner\n\nadmitted these allegations and conceded removability, but sought\n\nrelief of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture.        On February 14, 2001, the IJ denied\n\npetitioner's applications for relief and granted him the privilege\n\nof voluntary departure. The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without\n\nopinion.   This petition for review follows.2\n\n\n1\n   In March 2003, the relevant functions of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service were transferred into the new Department of\nHomeland Security and reorganized into the Bureau of Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement.\n2\n    Petitioner's brief only addresses the BIA's denial of his\napplication for asylum, and makes no argument regarding the denial\n\n                                    -2-\n\f              Between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, during a time\n\nof civil war in Guatemala, petitioner served in the military\n\nreserves. The reserves were operated by the Guatemalan government,\n\nbut separate from the Civil Patrol and the Guatemalan Army.                 One\n\nnight a week, petitioner patrolled the highways, looking for\n\nsuspicious activity and \"register[ing]\" passers-by to see if they\n\nwere \"carrying something.\"          Sometimes his duties required him to\n\ndetain      people.      Throughout   his   service     with   the   reserves,\n\npetitioner encountered members of guerrilla forces, some of whom\n\nwere aggressive.         At one point, petitioner suffered \"light harm\"\n\nwhen a guerrilla cut him on the hand.        He also testified before the\n\nIJ that in 1989, a member of his reserve group shot a man in the\n\nleg, incapacitating him. Although petitioner \"felt bad\" about this\n\nevent, no subsequent interactions resulted from the incident.               He\n\nwas never captured by guerrillas, but he was approached to join\n\nthem on multiple occasions in 1988.          To the best of petitioner's\n\nknowledge, the guerrillas sought him out because they saw him as a\n\nhealthy young man who could replenish their ranks.                   Petitioner\n\ntestified that he was never politically involved in Guatemala, and\n\nhas   not    had   any   problems   with,   or   fear   of,    the   Guatemalan\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n\nof his requests for withholding of removal and relief under the\nConvention Against Torture. Petitioner has therefore waived any\nchallenge to these issues. See Qin v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 305\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            Although peace accords between the guerrillas and the\n\nGuatemalan government were signed in 1996, petitioner contends that\n\nthe \"delinquency continues.\"        Carrying out these delinquent acts,\n\npetitioner alleges, are ex-guerrillas, whom petitioner agrees may\n\nnow be characterized as common criminals.                He fears them for\n\nseveral reasons.      First, he fears retaliation by those whom he\n\ndetained during his service.       Second, he fears retaliation for not\n\nhaving joined the guerrilla forces after repeatedly being asked to\n\ndo so.     Third, he fears that the ex-guerrillas, who may perceive\n\nhim as \"well-to-do\" since he has lived in the United States for so\n\nlong, will make him the target of their crimes in an attempt to\n\nobtain   some   of   the   money   he    has   earned   while   working   here.\n\nPetitioner fears that, even after thirteen years, he will be\n\nrecognized by ex-guerrillas who wish him harm, and that he will not\n\nbe safe from this harm anywhere in Guatemala since it is a small\n\ncountry.    Although he testified before the IJ that he has \"heard\n\nthings\" from his family to substantiate this fear, he was unable to\n\nprovide specific evidence to support this contention and conceded\n\nthat no one in Guatemala is looking for him in particular.                While\n\npetitioner claims the primary reason he wishes to remain in the\n\nUnited States is to avoid the danger he believes awaits him in\n\nGuatemala, he also testified that he wants to remain in this\n\ncountry in order to earn enough money to support his family.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          Petitioner's wife and children still reside in Guatemala.\n\nHe also has a father and siblings living there.                   According to\n\npetitioner, two of his brothers previously had some unspecified\n\nproblems because of their participation in the reserves, but solved\n\nthose problems later.        Petitioner also testified that two of his\n\ncousins were assassinated by the guerrillas, one in 1987 and the\n\nother in 1992.       Otherwise, the rest of his relatives have remained\n\nin Guatemala without incident.\n\n                                II.    Analysis\n\n          In order to be eligible for asylum, \"the burden of proof\n\nis on the applicant . . . to establish that he or she is a refugee\n\nas   defined    in    section   101(a)(42)     of     the    [Immigration     and\n\nNationality] Act.\"3         8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).           \"The applicant may\n\nqualify as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past\n\npersecution or because he or she has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\"    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).       The BIA's determination that\n\npetitioner     was    not   eligible   for   asylum    \"must    be   upheld    if\n\n'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.'\" INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S.\n\n\n3\n   The relevant part reads: \"The term 'refugee' means (A) any\nperson who is outside any country of such person's nationality or,\nin the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any\ncountry in which such person last habitually resided, and who is\nunable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to\navail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because\nof persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\ngroup, or political opinion. . .\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42).\n\n                                       -5-\n\f478, 481 (1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)); see also Yatskin\n\nv. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"we review a denial of a\n\npetition   for   asylum   by   the   BIA   under    a   substantial   evidence\n\nstandard\"). We review findings of fact deferentially, and thus may\n\nreverse such a finding only if \"any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.\"            8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\nBecause the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion, we\n\nreview the decision issued by the IJ.          See Albathani v. INS, 318\n\nF.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nA.   Past Persecution\n\n           \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must\n\nrise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).            Petitioner must\n\nalso establish \"through direct or circumstantial evidence, that his\n\nalleged persecutors were motivated by one of the statutorily\n\nenumerated grounds.\"4      Guzmán v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (citing Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. at 483).\n\n           Petitioner claims that he suffered past persecution when\n\nguerrillas cut him on his hand, harm which he characterizes as\n\n\"light.\"   He also claims that the emotional harm he suffered as a\n\nresult of face-to-face interactions with aggressive guerrillas\n\nestablishes past persecution.          While we acknowledge that these\n\n\n\n4\n   Race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\ngroup, or political opinion. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fexperiences may have been unpleasant, they do not fulfill the\n\nstatutory requirement of past persecution on account of political\n\nopinion.   Even assuming, arguendo, that the claimed physical and\n\nemotional harm was suffered on account of petitioner's political\n\nopinion, his harm must have been substantially more severe than a\n\nlight cut on his hand and some frightening confrontations in order\n\nto establish past persecution.   See Guzmán v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15-\n\n16 (1st Cir. 2003) (assuming petitioner was targeted by guerrillas\n\nfor statutorily protected reasons, \"one-time kidnaping and beating\n\nfalls well short of establishing 'past persecution'\").      In Guzmán,\n\nwe determined that the injuries the petitioner incurred from being\n\nbeaten by guerrillas were \"superficial.\"       Id. at 15.    Since we\n\ncannot fairly characterize petitioner's injuries in this case as\n\nanything more than superficial, this evidence does not compel us to\n\nreverse the BIA's decision.\n\nB.   Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n           Since petitioner cannot establish past persecution, he is\n\nnot entitled to the statutory presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution as provided in 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).         He\n\ntherefore must establish this well-founded fear by proving both a\n\nsubjective and objective component.     Álvarez-Flores v. INS, 909\n\nF.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1990).    Subjectively, the fear he asserts must\n\nbe genuine.   Id.   Objectively, petitioner must show \"'by credible,\n\ndirect, and specific evidence . . . facts that would support a\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\freasonable    fear    that   the   petitioner   faces   persecution.'\"     Id.\n\n(quoting Díaz-Escobar v. INS, 782 F.2d 1488, 1492 (9th Cir. 1986)).\n\nIn general, \"the BIA requires that an applicant show that a\n\nreasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution.\"\n\nId. at 3 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The IJ, while\n\naccepting the petitioner's testimony, found petitioner had not\n\nestablished an objective basis for his claim.              This finding is\n\nwholly consistent with the required showing of \"credible, direct,\n\nand specific\" facts to support a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\n\n             First, the IJ found that petitioner's testimony that he\n\ncannot live anywhere in Guatemala without being recognized for his\n\nprior military services, completed over thirteen years ago, is not\n\ncredible.    In this regard, the IJ noted that petitioner's wife and\n\nchildren have lived without incident in a different community in\n\nGuatemala than the one in which petitioner grew up.              See Aguilar-\n\nSolís v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"the\n\nfact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the\n\nalien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution\n\nawaits his return\"); see also Guzmán, 327 F.3d at 16 (finding that\n\nthe   fact   that    other   relatives   of   the   petitioner    have   lived\n\nundisturbed in Guatemala for more than a decade supports the\n\nconclusion that Guzmán failed to establish eligibility for asylum).\n\nFurthermore, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(3)(i) requires that unless the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fpersecution is by a government or is government-sponsored, \"the\n\napplicant shall bear the burden of establishing that it would not\n\nbe reasonable for him to relocate [within the country].\"                             In\n\npetitioner's case, the persecution he fears is from individuals who\n\nwere once associated with a guerrilla insurgency, but who he\n\nacknowledges are now common criminals.                 Since these ex-guerrillas\n\nare not in any way sponsored by the Guatemalan government, it is\n\npetitioner's burden to establish that it would be unreasonable for\n\nhim to relocate to a different part of the country.                          The only\n\nevidence petitioner has offered for this point is that these ex-\n\nguerrillas roam throughout the small country of Guatemala, from\n\nwhich he concludes that they will inevitably meet and recognize\n\nhim, and seek revenge upon him.                      We agree with the IJ that\n\npetitioner's alleged fear of being recognized lacks credibility.\n\nThis evidence certainly does not compel a finding that petitioner's\n\nfear of being recognized and persecuted is well-founded.\n\n            Second, the IJ found that petitioner had not suggested\n\nthat   anyone     in    particular      may     be   seeking   to   pursue   him    for\n\nretaliatory purposes.            Indeed, petitioner concedes that no one in\n\nGuatemala    is        looking    for     him    specifically.          Accordingly,\n\npetitioner's      evidence        lacks    specificity.         See    Velásquez    v.\n\nAshcroft, 342 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting lack of specific\n\nevidence    where       petitioners       failed     to   present     evidence     that\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fguerrillas sought retribution against any of the remaining family\n\nmembers).\n\n            Finally, the IJ noted that although the incident in which\n\na member of petitioner's reserve group incapacitated a man occurred\n\nin 1989, petitioner did not leave Guatemala until two years later.\n\nConsequently, the IJ determined that petitioner had not been at\n\nsignificant risk of retaliation during those two years.           We have\n\npreviously found that remaining undisturbed in a country of claimed\n\npersecution for as little as six months suggests the absence of any\n\nongoing threat of persecution.       See Novoa-Umania v. INS, 896 F.2d\n\n1 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding that BIA might conclude, based on\n\napplicant's stay for more than six months in San Salvador without\n\nincident, that there was no ongoing threat of persecution); see\n\nalso Rodríguez-Rivera v. INS, 848 F.2d 998, 1006 (9th Cir. 1988)\n\n(finding     it   \"significant\"   that    applicant   continued   to   live\n\nundisturbed for three months after threat).           Petitioner in this\n\ncase remained in Guatemala for two years after an event for which\n\nhe claims to fear retaliation.      We believe that the fact that there\n\nwere no incidents of persecution during those two years undercuts\n\npetitioner's claim that danger awaits him in Guatemala. Especially\n\nin light of the civil war's end and the passage of more than\n\nthirteen years, it seems unlikely that petitioner would face\n\npersecution on account of political opinion upon returning to\n\nGuatemala.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f            Since petitioner does not meet the statutory requirements\n\nfor asylum eligibility, the IJ had no discretion to grant asylum.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 208.14 (\"an immigration judge may grant or deny\n\nasylum in the exercise of discretion to an applicant who qualifies\n\nas a refugee\") (emphasis added).       Accordingly, we find that the IJ\n\nhad substantial evidence for denying petitioner's request for\n\nasylum, and we cannot say that petitioner's evidence compels a\n\ncontrary conclusion.\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n            For   the   reasons    stated   above,   the   BIA's   order   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

The reserves were operated by the Guatemalan government,\n\nbut separate from the Civil Patrol and the Guatemalan Army.                 One\n\nnight a week, petitioner patrolled the highways, looking for\n\nsuspicious activity and \"register[ing]\" passers-by to see if they\n\nwere \"carrying something.\"          Sometimes his duties required him to\n\ndetain      people.      Throughout   his   service     with   the   reserves,\n\npetitioner encountered members of guerrilla forces, some of whom\n\nwere aggressive.         At one point, petitioner suffered \"light harm\"\n\nwhen a guerrilla cut him on the hand.        He also testified before the\n\nIJ that in 1989, a member of his reserve group shot a man in the\n\nleg, incapacitating him. Although petitioner \"felt bad\" about this\n\nevent, no subsequent interactions resulted from the incident.               He\n\nwas never captured by guerrillas, but he was approached to join\n\nthem on multiple occasions in 1988.          To the best of petitioner's\n\nknowledge, the guerrillas sought him out because they saw him as a\n\nhealthy young man who could replenish their ranks.                   Petitioner\n\ntestified that he was never politically involved in Guatemala, and\n\nhas   not    had   any   problems   with,   or   fear   of,    the   Guatemalan\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n\nof his requests for withholding of removal and relief under the\nConvention Against Torture. Petitioner has therefore waived any\nchallenge to these issues. See Qin v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200904\"><a href=\"/opinion/200904/qin-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            Although peace accords between the guerrillas and the\n\nGuatemalan government were signed in 1996, petitioner contends that\n\nthe \"delinquency continues.\"        Carrying out these delinquent acts,\n\npetitioner alleges, are ex-guerrillas, whom petitioner agrees may\n\nnow be characterized as common criminals.                He fears them for\n\nseveral reasons.      First, he fears retaliation by those whom he\n\ndetained during his service.       Second, he fears retaliation for not\n\nhaving joined the guerrilla forces after repeatedly being asked to\n\ndo so.     Third, he fears that the ex-guerrillas, who may perceive\n\nhim as \"well-to-do\" since he has lived in the United States for so\n\nlong, will make him the target of their crimes in an attempt to\n\nobtain   some   of   the   money   he    has   earned   while   working   here.\n\nPetitioner fears that, even after thirteen years, he will be\n\nrecognized by ex-guerrillas who wish him harm, and that he will not\n\nbe safe from this harm anywhere in Guatemala since it is a small\n\ncountry.    Although he testified before the IJ that he has \"heard\n\nthings\" from his family to substantiate this fear, he was unable to\n\nprovide specific evidence to support this contention and conceded\n\nthat no one in Guatemala is looking for him in particular.                While\n\npetitioner claims the primary reason he wishes to remain in the\n\nUnited States is to avoid the danger he believes awaits him in\n\nGuatemala, he also testified that he wants to remain in this\n\ncountry in order to earn enough money to support his family.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f          Petitioner's wife and children still reside in Guatemala.\n\nHe also has a father and siblings living there.                   According to\n\npetitioner, two of his brothers previously had some unspecified\n\nproblems because of their participation in the reserves, but solved\n\nthose problems later.        Petitioner also testified that two of his\n\ncousins were assassinated by the guerrillas, one in 1987 and the\n\nother in 1992.       Otherwise, the rest of his relatives have remained\n\nin Guatemala without incident.\n\n                                II.

The BIA's determination that\n\npetitioner     was    not   eligible   for   asylum    \"must    be   upheld    if\n\n'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.'\" INS v.

Even assuming, arguendo, that the claimed physical and\n\nemotional harm was suffered on account of petitioner's political\n\nopinion, his harm must have been substantially more severe than a\n\nlight cut on his hand and some frightening confrontations in order\n\nto establish past persecution.   See Guzmán v.

In Guzmán,\n\nwe determined that the injuries the petitioner incurred from being\n\nbeaten by guerrillas were \"superficial.\"       Id. at 15.    Since we\n\ncannot fairly characterize petitioner's injuries in this case as\n\nanything more than superficial, this evidence does not compel us to\n\nreverse the BIA's decision.\n\nB.   Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n           Since petitioner cannot establish past persecution, he is\n\nnot entitled to the statutory presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution as provided in 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).         He\n\ntherefore must establish this well-founded fear by proving both a\n\nsubjective and objective component.     Álvarez-Flores v.

Subjectively, the fear he asserts must\n\nbe genuine.   Id.   Objectively, petitioner must show \"'by credible,\n\ndirect, and specific evidence . . . facts that would support a\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\freasonable    fear    that   the   petitioner   faces   persecution.'\"     Id.\n\n(quoting Díaz-Escobar v.

The IJ, while\n\naccepting the petitioner's testimony, found petitioner had not\n\nestablished an objective basis for his claim.              This finding is\n\nwholly consistent with the required showing of \"credible, direct,\n\nand specific\" facts to support a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\n\n             First, the IJ found that petitioner's testimony that he\n\ncannot live anywhere in Guatemala without being recognized for his\n\nprior military services, completed over thirteen years ago, is not\n\ncredible.    In this regard, the IJ noted that petitioner's wife and\n\nchildren have lived without incident in a different community in\n\nGuatemala than the one in which petitioner grew up.              See Aguilar-\n\nSolís v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"the\n\nfact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the\n\nalien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution\n\nawaits his return\"); see also Guzmán, 327 F.3d at 16 (finding that\n\nthe   fact   that    other   relatives   of   the   petitioner    have   lived\n\nundisturbed in Guatemala for more than a decade supports the\n\nconclusion that Guzmán failed to establish eligibility for asylum).\n\nFurthermore, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(3)(i) requires that unless the\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fpersecution is by a government or is government-sponsored, \"the\n\napplicant shall bear the burden of establishing that it would not\n\nbe reasonable for him to relocate [within the country].\"                             In\n\npetitioner's case, the persecution he fears is from individuals who\n\nwere once associated with a guerrilla insurgency, but who he\n\nacknowledges are now common criminals.                 Since these ex-guerrillas\n\nare not in any way sponsored by the Guatemalan government, it is\n\npetitioner's burden to establish that it would be unreasonable for\n\nhim to relocate to a different part of the country.                          The only\n\nevidence petitioner has offered for this point is that these ex-\n\nguerrillas roam throughout the small country of Guatemala, from\n\nwhich he concludes that they will inevitably meet and recognize\n\nhim, and seek revenge upon him.                      We agree with the IJ that\n\npetitioner's alleged fear of being recognized lacks credibility.\n\nThis evidence certainly does not compel a finding that petitioner's\n\nfear of being recognized and persecuted is well-founded.\n\n            Second, the IJ found that petitioner had not suggested\n\nthat   anyone     in    particular      may     be   seeking   to   pursue   him    for\n\nretaliatory purposes.            Indeed, petitioner concedes that no one in\n\nGuatemala    is        looking    for     him    specifically.          Accordingly,\n\npetitioner's      evidence        lacks    specificity.

We have\n\npreviously found that remaining undisturbed in a country of claimed\n\npersecution for as little as six months suggests the absence of any\n\nongoing threat of persecution.       See Novoa-Umania v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536515\"><a href=\"/opinion/536515/samuel-novoa-umania-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1990) (finding that BIA might conclude, based on\n\napplicant's stay for more than six months in San Salvador without\n\nincident, that there was no ongoing threat of persecution); see\n\nalso Rodríguez-Rivera v.

Petitioner in this\n\ncase remained in Guatemala for two years after an event for which\n\nhe claims to fear retaliation.      We believe that the fact that there\n\nwere no incidents of persecution during those two years undercuts\n\npetitioner's claim that danger awaits him in Guatemala. Especially\n\nin light of the civil war's end and the passage of more than\n\nthirteen years, it seems unlikely that petitioner would face\n\npersecution on account of political opinion upon returning to\n\nGuatemala.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f            Since petitioner does not meet the statutory requirements\n\nfor asylum eligibility, the IJ had no discretion to grant asylum.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 208.14 (\"an immigration judge may grant or deny\n\nasylum in the exercise of discretion to an applicant who qualifies\n\nas a refugee\") (emphasis added).       Accordingly, we find that the IJ\n\nhad substantial evidence for denying petitioner's request for\n\nasylum, and we cannot say that petitioner's evidence compels a\n\ncontrary conclusion.\n\n                            III.
