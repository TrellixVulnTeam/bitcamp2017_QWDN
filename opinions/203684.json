One substantive issue presented in that petition\nwarrants elaboration.      QLT highlights an objection to the\nconfidential information theory of unjust enrichment raised in its\nbrief   and   addressed   implicitly   in   our   prior   decision.\nSpecifically, QLT argues that the voluminous evidence of its unfair\n\n1\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fbehavior and repeated promises of compensation in exchange for\nMEEI's confidential information, introduced at trial and recited in\nour opinion, cannot support the conclusion that QLT profited from\nthe use of MEEI's confidential information. Absent such a showing,\nQLT argues that the general principle that those who chose to make\ntheir work public must rely exclusively on patent law for\nprotection of their work, Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Boats,\nInc., 489 U.S. 141, 149 (1989), requires judgment in favor of QLT\nwith respect to this theory. In making this argument, QLT concedes\n-- as it must -- that it is liable in unjust enrichment for any\ninformation it obtained and profited from as a result of its\nconfidential relationship with MEEI and its researchers. Univ. of\nColo. Found., Inc., v. Am. Cyanamid, Co., 342 F.3d 1298, 1306-07\n(Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Bonito Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. at 155\n(citing Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470 (1974));\nRusso v. Ballrad Medical Products, 550 F.3d 1004 (10th Cir. 2008).\nThus, QLT has done nothing more than pour its old sufficiency of\nthe evidence challenge into a new bottle.\n     Despite this emphasis on preemption, QLT's argument remains\nunavailing.     There was evidence that QLT initiated its\ncommunications with CIBA with a confidential abstract that was\nsubmitted for publication but not yet published. There was further\nevidence that QLT was in difficult financial straights and\ntherefore was eagerly seeking a partner, and that QLT was competing\nagainst CIBA's internally-developed competitor to BPD.           In\naddition, there was evidence that QLT needed Dr. Miller's assent to\ndisclose all of her research results to CIBA Vision, some of which\nwere published in March 1994, some of which were disclosed at a\nsubsequent presentation, and some of which were never disclosed.\nThe jury heard further evidence that both QLT and CIBA Vision were\naware of Dr. Miller's publication and scheduled presentation, but\nthat CIBA nevertheless felt expeditious access to Dr. Miller and\nall of her research results was \"essential\" to evaluating BPD.\nIndeed, even after Dr. Miller's public disclosures of portions of\nher work, CIBA continued to press for access to all of Dr. Miller's\nas-yet undisclosed work.   Finally, the jury heard evidence of Dr.\nMiller's concerns that she and MEEI be compensated fairly for her\nresearch and QLT's repeated promises to pay such compensation in\nexchange for Dr. Miller's personal involvement and her permission\nexpeditiously to disclose her research results.2         From this\nevidence, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that QLT unfairly\n\n\n2\n  QLT's argument that information disclosed subsequent to the\npublication and conference was valueless is a difficult one to\nmake, in view of the fact that QLT made repeated offers of\ncompensation to obtain such information. Although those promises\nare not enforceable, the very fact that the promises were made is\ndemonstrative of the value that QLT placed on receiving Dr.\nMiller's cooperation in disclosing this additional information.\n\fused MEEI's confidential information at MEEI's expense and that\nQLT's use of MEEI's confidential information was a substantial\ncausal factor in the QLT-CIBA partnership.\n     Neither Bonito Boats, nor the other precedents on which QLT\nrelies preclude recovery once such a conclusion is established.\nQLT's liability stems from its exploitation of information that it\nobtained in confidence, pursuant to a confidential disclosure\nagreement, and received permission to disclose through offers of\ncompensation -- not from published articles or presentations at\nophthalmology conferences. Thus, QLT's liability flows from its\nless than savory business practices rather than its reliance on\npublic domain sources of information. This is not the stuff of\npreemption. See Kewanee Oil Co., 416 U.S. at 480-81 (declining to\nfind Ohio trade secrets statute preempted because, inter alia,\n\"[t]he necessity of good faith and honest, fair dealing is the very\nlife and spirit of the commercial world\") (internal quotation\nomitted); see also Bonito Boats Inc., 489 U.S. at 155-56\n(reaffirming authority of states to regulate use of intellectual\nproperty not inconsistent with federal law); Confold Pacific, Inc.\nv. Polaris Industries, Inc., 433 F.3d 952, 956, 959-960 (7th Cir.\n2006) (finding no unjust enrichment based on misuse of confidential\ninformation where Wisconsin law did not permit such a cause of\naction, and plaintiff failed to plead unfair competition or secret\nmisappropriation under Wisconsin law); Waner v. Ford Motor Co., 331\nF.3d 851, 856 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (finding dismissal of unjust\nenrichment claim appropriate where information was not trade secret\nand defendant was under no obligation to maintain confidentiality).\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has suggested that states should continue\nto regulate just these sorts of less-than-upright business\npractices, even if they incidently involve intellectual property\nand information that may be subject to federal patent laws.3 See\nBonito Boats, 489 U.S. at 156 (citing Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil\nCo., 440 U.S. 257, 262 (1979)).\n     Accordingly, with this clarification of our decision, QLT's\n\n\n3\n  In order to find preemption, the Supreme Court evaluates a state\nlaw on three dimensions: (1) whether it hinders the federal\nobjective of providing an incentive to invent, (2) whether it\ninhibits full disclosure of inventions, and (3) whether it removes\nfrom the public domain that which the states lack the authority to\nremove. Kewannee Oil Co., 416 U.S. at 480-82; 6 Donald S. Chisum,\nChisum on Patents, ยง 19.03[6][l], at 19-416 (2007).      Where, as\nhere, the inventors eventually sought protection of patent law, QLT\nand CIBA were free to exploit any of Dr. Miller's published\nresearch after it became freely available, if they so chose, and\nDr. Miller's research was eventually published, the concerns that\nmight lead the Supreme Court to find preemption are not\nsufficiently implicated to preempt the Massachusetts unjust\nenrichment cause of action, as it applies to this case.\n\fpetition for rehearing is denied.\n\n                              By the Court:\n\n                              /s/ Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\ncc: Hon.
