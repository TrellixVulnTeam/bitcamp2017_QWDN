The Governor of Massachusetts and\n\nthe state Department of Mental Retardation (\"DMR\") appeal from an\n\norder of a federal district court which both reopens a 1993 consent\n\ndecree and then requires them to take certain steps as to the\n\nresidents of the Fernald Development Center.       Ricci v. Okin (Ricci\n\nIV), 499 F. Supp. 2d 89 (D. Mass. 2007).      Appellants, whom we shall\n\ncall the Commonwealth, deny that the court had any authority to\n\nreopen the consent decree or otherwise issue any orders.\n\n          The Commonwealth characterizes the order as essentially\n\nprohibiting it from relocating residents as it attempts to close\n\nthe Fernald Development Center. The Fernald Center, some 160 years\n\nold, has been the residence of over 180 mentally retarded residents\n\ncommitted to the care of the Commonwealth.            The Commonwealth\n\nannounced, in 2003, its intention to move these residents to one of\n\nthe five other residential facilities or to a community based\n\nsetting, whichever comports best with each resident's individual\n\nservice plan (\"ISP\").      The Commonwealth has committed itself to\n\ntransferring   residents   only   if   the   Superintendent   at   Fernald\n\n\"certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal\n\nor better services to meet their needs in the new location.\"        Ricci\n\nv. Okin (Ricci III), 823 F. Supp. 984, 987 (D. Mass. 1993).           The\n\nCommonwealth did transfer, in fact, some 49 Fernald residents\n\nbefore February 8, 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f             The federal district court, which has conscientiously and\n\nwith great care presided over institutional reform litigation\n\nconcerning     these    mentally    retarded     persons     since     1972,     see\n\ngenerally Ricci v. Okin (Ricci I), 537 F. Supp. 817, 819 (1982),\n\nclosed the underlying case in 1993 pursuant to a consent decree\n\nwhose    terms     it   adopted    into    a   court     order   known    as     the\n\nDisengagement Order, see Ricci III, 823 F. Supp. at 986-89.\n\n             Nonetheless, in 2006, the court enjoined the Commonwealth\n\nfrom transferring any more residents on the motion of a class of\n\nFernald residents alleging violation of the decree. Ricci v. Okin,\n\nNos. 72-0469-T, etc. (D. Mass. Feb. 8, 2006) (order freezing\n\nresident transfers and appointing court monitor).                The court found\n\nthat    it   had   authority   under     the   1993    Disengagement     Order    to\n\ninvestigate whether, as the plaintiffs alleged, the Commonwealth\n\nwas violating the Disengagement Order.                  The court appointed a\n\nmonitor, the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, to investigate and\n\nprepare a report.       The court asked the monitor's report to address\n\n\"whether the past and prospective transfer processes employed by\n\nthe Department of Mental Retardation comply with federal law, state\n\nregulations, as well as the orders of this court.\"                       Id.     The\n\ndistrict     court's    authority   to    investigate     the    allegations      of\n\nviolation is not at issue.\n\n             After receiving the report, the court, in an order dated\n\nAugust 14, 2007, found that the conditions for reopening the case\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcontained in the Disengagement Order had been met.               It also issued\n\na further remedial order, the specific terms of which we describe\n\nlater.       Ricci IV, 499 F. Supp. 2d at 92.             Those orders are at\n\nissue.\n\n               The Commonwealth's appeal is from both components of the\n\nAugust 14, 2007 order.            The appeal is supported by a number of\n\namici who are of the view that deinstitutionalization is in the\n\nbest       interests   of   the   Fernald   residents.1     In   addition,   the\n\nMassachusetts Association of Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a\n\nplaintiff-appellant urging reversal.             The Disability Law Center\n\nappeared as an intervenor-appellant also urging reversal.\n\n               On the other side, the plaintiffs' arguments to uphold\n\nthe district court's decision are supported by other amici.2                  In\n\naddition, the Wrentham Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc.\n\nappeared as a plaintiff and appellee on behalf of a class composed\n\n\n       1\n          Amici in support of the Commonwealth are:       National\nAssociation of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities\nServices; Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers of\nMassachusetts; Adlib, Inc.; The Arc of the United States; Boston\nCenter for Independent Living; Independent Living Center of the\nNorth Shore and Cape Ann, Inc.; Massachusetts Advocates Standing\nStrong; Massachusetts Council of Human Service Providers, Inc.;\nMassachusetts Families Organizing for Change; MetroWest Center for\nIndependent Living, Inc.; National Disability Rights Network;\nNortheast   Independent   Living   Program;    Service   Employees\nInternational Union; Local 509 of the Service Employees\nInternational Union; Stavros Center for Independent Living; and\nUnited Cerebral Palsy.\n       2\n          Amici in support of the plaintiffs are: Massachusetts\nCoalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc.; and\nVoice of the Retarded, Inc.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fof residents at the Commonwealth's Wrentham Development Center,\n\nstating that in its view, the issues involved in this case affected\n\nresidents in other state institutions for the mentally retarded\n\nsuch as Wrentham.\n\n           We review first whether the district court had authority\n\nto   reopen    this   case   because    the   Commonwealth   violated   the\n\nDisengagement Order or the residents' constitutional rights and\n\nwhether the court had authority to reopen on some other basis.\n\nBecause we conclude there was no basis for the district court to\n\nreopen the case or otherwise assert jurisdiction, we do not reach\n\nthe issues relating to the remedial order. We reverse the district\n\ncourt, vacate its order, and order dismissal of these proceedings\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           We set forth the factual background for this suit,\n\nstarting with the events which precipitated these proceedings.\n\nA.         Actions By the Commonwealth Which Led to This Action\n\n           In three budgetary acts from 2004-2007, the Massachusetts\n\nlegislature directed DMR to take appropriate steps to consolidate\n\nor close its six Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally\n\nRetarded   (\"ICFs\"),    including      Fernald.    Several   reasons    were\n\narticulated.    The legislation stated one purpose of the directive\n\nwas to promote compliance with a Supreme Court decision, Olmstead\n\nv. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).          That decision, in\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fturn, emphasized the congressional intent in Title II of the\n\nAmericans     with   Disabilities      Act   of    1991     (\"ADA\")    to     avoid\n\ndiscrimination against mentally disabled persons by promoting their\n\nplacement into community settings.           Another stated purpose was to\n\nfurther the Commonwealth's own established policy of reducing its\n\ninstitutional capacity and of providing services to patients in\n\nless restrictive settings.           This policy decision was grounded in\n\nevidence of prior successful transitions of a number of mentally\n\nretarded residents from residential settings, from the past closing\n\nof other ICFs. Further, the Commonwealth was cognizant of national\n\ntrends toward deinstitutionalization and the need for certainty in\n\nplanning matters such as personnel placement.                 The legislature\n\nrequired DMR to reduce capacity at these ICFs, provided that equal\n\nor better services for residents could be furnished in community\n\nsettings.\n\n             Another consideration for the Commonwealth was how to use\n\nits available resources for the care of the mentally retarded. DMR\n\nhad   received    estimates     in    2001   for   the    amount      of    capital\n\nexpenditures needed to maintain each ICF.                 As of 2001, Fernald\n\nneeded   $14.3   million   in    capital     expenditures      to     repair    its\n\ninfrastructure and $41.2 million to achieve full compliance with\n\nthe   ADA.     The   Fernald    facility     was   ranked    first     among    the\n\nCommonwealth's ICFs in needed capital costs.              Indeed, the average\n\ndaily cost of services at Fernald as of FY 2007 was over $700 per\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fperson a day, or $259,000 per person annually.3                 By contrast the\n\ncosts at the other ICFs ranged from $433 to $590 per day.                        The\n\nFernald per-resident cost was also more than 2.5 times the average\n\nannual per-person cost of residential community-based services. In\n\n2007, these were at $280 per day or $102,103 annually per patient,\n\nincluding day programs and transportation services.\n\n           As of May 2007, there were 186 Fernald residents living\n\nin a facility that once housed nearly 2,000 individuals.                         The\n\nremaining residents included 131 in the profound range of mental\n\nretardation, 40 in the severe range, 12 in the moderate range, and\n\n3 in the mild range.        Fernald Center residents       ranged in age from\n\n36 to 95 years old, with an average age of 57.                  Some 38 Fernald\n\nCenter residents were aged 63 or older.\n\n           In   2003,    as    said,      the    Commonwealth    announced       its\n\nintention to close Fernald by transferring its residents to equal\n\nor better care in its other five ICFs or into community based\n\nsettings, including group homes.4           The Commonwealth planned to keep\n\nopen at the Fernald campus a 24-person residential unit and a\n\nskilled nursing center which can serve 29 individuals.                 It began\n\nits   program   in   2003     and   has    successfully   transferred       49    of\n\napproximately    238    residents.          Of   these,   35    residents    were\n\n\n      3\n          These figures in part reflect the reduced population at\nFernald due to the earlier transfers of residents.\n      4\n          This was a general policy announcement, which was not\naccompanied by a formal timetable to close Fernald.\n\n                                          -8-\n\ftransferred to other ICFs and 14 were transferred to community\n\nresidences.\n\n           The efforts of the Commonwealth to make these transfers\n\nwere brought to a halt in February 2006 when, as described above,\n\nthe federal district court, acting at the behest of a purported\n\nclass of the remaining 189 Fernald residents, enjoined the process\n\npending further investigation.\n\nB.         The History of the Ricci Class Action\n\n           In 1972, residents of the Belchertown State School, a\n\nstate institution for the mentally retarded, filed a class action\n\nagainst state officials alleging that conditions there violated\n\ntheir constitutional and statutory rights.      See Ricci I, 537 F.\n\nSupp. at 819; see also Ricci III, 823 F. Supp. at 985-86.    A class\n\naction challenge to conditions at Fernald was filed on July 23,\n\n1974.   Complaint, McEvoy v. Goldmark, No. C.A. 74-2768-T (D. Mass.\n\nJuly 23, 1974).   Suits were also filed on behalf of residents of\n\nother state institutions. See Ricci I, 537 F. Supp. at 819.      The\n\nactions were consolidated before Judge Tauro of the U.S. District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.\n\n           After the suits were filed, the court took day-long views\n\nof conditions at the facilities.       Ricci I, 537 F. Supp. at 820.\n\nThe court determined that the Commonwealth was not providing the\n\nconstitutionally required minimum level of care.    The Commonwealth\n\ndefendants chose not to dispute this and instead \"agreed to work\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fwith the plaintiffs and the court to fashion comprehensive remedial\n\nprograms    that   would    be   memorialized        in    the   form       of   consent\n\ndecrees.\"    Id.     The parties entered into separate interim consent\n\ndecrees, one for each institution, in 1977, and a consent decree\n\ngoverning personnel in 1978. Id. at 820-21.\n\n            The district court actively oversaw the implementation of\n\nthe consent decrees for almost ten years.                 See generally Ricci v.\n\nOkin, 978 F.2d 764, 764 (1st Cir. 1992).                  On October 9, 1986, the\n\ncourt entered an order which set out a list of specific tasks for\n\nthe   Commonwealth     to   accomplish        and    represented        a    \"step   of\n\ndisengagement\" for the court.           Id.         The order contemplated the\n\ncourt's final disengagement after three years, a term that the\n\nparties extended by agreement.          Id. at 764-65.\n\n            The class action effectively ended in 1993 when the\n\nparties entered into a final consent decree, which the district\n\ncourt adopted in a final Disengagement Order.\n\nC.          The Disengagement Order\n\n            On May 25, 1993, the district court signed an order\n\n\"closing the federal court's oversight of the[] [consolidated]\n\ncases.\"    Ricci III, 823 F. Supp. at 985.            The Disengagement Order,\n\nwhich supplanted and replaced all prior consent decrees and court\n\norders,    adopted    the   parties'    final       consent      decree.         Several\n\nprovisions of the Disengagement Order are important for purposes of\n\nthese appeals.\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f             First, the Disengagement Order terminated the court's\n\njurisdiction over the cases.            The cases could be reopened and\n\njurisdiction could be asserted only if certain explicit conditions\n\nwere met.     The Order allowed \"action[s] to enforce the rights of\n\nthe plaintiff classes\" only when they were brought \"pursuant to the\n\nterms of paragraph 7\" of the Order.             Id. at 986 (Disengagement\n\nOrder ¶ 1).\n\n             Paragraph 7, in turn, allowed class members to seek\n\nenforcement of the Disengagement Order if one or more of three\n\nconditions had been met.       Plaintiffs were required to show that 1)\n\n\"defendants substantially fail[ed] to provide a state ISP process\n\nin compliance with [the] Order\"; 2) defendants engaged in \"a\n\nsystemic failure to provide services to class members as described\n\nin [the] Order\"; or 3) defendants engaged in \"a systemic failure to\n\nprovide     ISP   services   required   by    [the]   Order.\"      Id.   at   988\n\n(Disengagement Order ¶ 7).         The Order did not, however, allow\n\nplaintiffs to reopen \"based solely on facts known by them as of the\n\ndate   of   [the]    Order.\"    Id.      It   also    explicitly    prohibited\n\nplaintiffs from enforcing the Commonwealth's state law obligations\n\nin a federal court action.\n\n             Second, the Disengagement Order outlined the obligations\n\nDMR owes to class members.         Under the Disengagement Order, the\n\nCommonwealth may not transfer a class member from a state school to\n\na community residence \"until and unless the Superintendent of the\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ftransferring school . . . certifies that the individual to be\n\ntransferred will receive equal or better services to meet their\n\nneeds in the new location, and that all ISP-recommended services\n\nfor the individual's current needs . . . are available at the new\n\nlocation.\"   Id. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 4).        This commits the\n\ndecision to transfer a resident of Fernald to the Superintendent of\n\nFernald, who makes the certification.\n\n           Review of that certification is not in the federal court,\n\nbut rather through state administrative procedures. See generally\n\n104 Mass. Code Regs. 29.15.         Under the applicable regulations, if\n\nan individual or guardian objects to the transfer, he or she may\n\nfile an appeal within 30 days of receipt of the ISP.                DMR must\n\nattempt to resolve the matter through an informal conference with\n\nthe client and his or her legally authorized representative.              The\n\nresident may then petition for a hearing.           The individual has the\n\nright to be represented at the hearing, to present evidence and\n\ncall witnesses, and to examine DMR's records.            Under state law,\n\n\"[t]he hearing officer shall determine which placement meets the\n\nbest   interest   of   the   ward    giving   due   consideration    to   the\n\nobjections to the placement made by the relative or permanent\n\nguardian.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 123B, § 3.          The objecting party\n\nmay then seek judicial review of the hearing officer's decision\n\nthrough appeal to superior court.        See Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 30A, §\n\n14.    There is no claim in this case that the Superintendent has\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\ffailed to make such certifications for prior transfers from Fernald\n\nor will fail to do so for future transfers.\n\n              Third, the Disengagement Order details the Commonwealth's\n\nobligations with regard to the ISP process.                 An ISP details each\n\nresident's \"capabilities and needs for services\" such as medical or\n\npsychological      care.       Ricci    III,     823   F.

ISPs are drafted after individual meetings between\n\nevaluating professionals and clients and their guardians.                 See 104\n\nMass. Code Regs. 29.06(2)(b). The Disengagement Order required DMR\n\nto   comply    with   state   regulations      governing     ISP   planning   and\n\nmandated that any changes to the Commonwealth's ISP regulations\n\ncontinue to \"guarantee that each class member be provided with the\n\nleast    restrictive,         most     normal,    appropriate        residential\n\nenvironment.\"      Ricci III, 823 F.

The Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc.\n\nappeared as a class representative for the Wrentham and Dever\n\nplaintiff classes, who had not been included in the Ricci class\n\nmembers' motion to reopen but had separately alleged that DMR was\n\nnot in substantial compliance with the Disengagement Order.                   It\n\nultimately filed a notice of appeal from the district court's\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fAugust 17, 2007 order.    As a result, we have two appeals before us\n\nfrom the same district court order.       The Ricci class members based\n\ntheir 2004 motion to reopen on the Commonwealth's alleged violation\n\nof the Disengagement Order.     Specifically, they claimed that the\n\nCommonwealth had \"substantially failed to provide a state ISP\n\nprocess in compliance with the Order,\" had engaged in \"a systemic\n\nfailure to provide services to class members as described in the\n\nOrder,\" and were \"not in substantial compliance with the Order with\n\nregard to systemic issues.\"     Motion to Reopen and Restore Case to\n\nActive Docket and Enforce the Final Order of May 12, 1993, at 1,\n\nRicci IV, 499 F. Supp. 2d 89 (D. Mass. 2007) (Nos. 72-0469-T,\n\netc.).5    As noted, the court appointed         a special monitor to\n\ninvestigate the allegations raised in the plaintiffs' motion and\n\ntheir reports to the court.\n\nE.         The Monitor's Report\n\n           The court monitor completed a 13-month investigation into\n\nthe transfers from Fernald between February 26, 2003 and February\n\n8, 2006.    The monitor reviewed all of DMR's records for the\n\ntransferred individuals and interviewed most of the individuals or\n\ntheir guardians.     The monitor also visited the individuals' new\n\nplacements as well as all of DMR's ICFs and many of the locations\n\nfor   community    placement.     In     addition,   the   monitor   hired\n\n\n      5\n          Plaintiff Wrentham Association filed a similar motion on\nFebruary 7, 2006. The motion contained similar allegations and was\npremised on similar grounds.\n\n                                  -14-\n\findependent medical professionals to assess each individual whose\n\ntransfer was planned, in order to review whether these individuals\n\nwould receive \"equal or better\" services in the new location.\n\n           The monitor reviewed allegations that DMR had violated\n\nthe Disengagement Order's requirement that it \"certify[] that\n\nindividuals to be transferred will receive equal or better services\n\nat their new residences\" and \"certify[] that ISP recommended\n\nservices for the individual's current needs are available at the\n\nnew   location.\"    The   monitor's   report     concluded     that   DMR   had\n\ncomplied with both obligations.\n\n           The report also found DMR to be in compliance with its\n\nprocedural obligations under state law, such as the requirement it\n\nprovide   notice   to   guardians   forty-five    days    in   advance   of   a\n\ntransfer and the requirement that it ensure guardians knew they had\n\na right to visit and examine the proposed homes.           The report also\n\nfound no violations by DMR of federal regulations, such as 42\n\nC.F.R. § 483.12, which governs transfer standards for skilled\n\nnursing facilities.       Finally, the monitor found no violation of\n\nstate regulations governing informed consent.            See 115 Mass. Code\n\nRegs. 5.08(1)(a).\n\n           In addition, the monitor examined conditions at the\n\nCommonwealth's other ICF facilities, to which Fernald residents\n\ncould be transferred.     The monitor concluded that \"[e]ach facility\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fcurrently ha[d] the minimum services, staffing and amenities to\n\nprovide equal or better services.\"\n\n             The    monitor's    report   also     inquired    into   guardians'\n\nassessments of their satisfaction with the resulting placement and\n\ntheir participation in the transfer decision. The monitor reported\n\nthe   results      of   a   survey   distributed   to   guardians     of    the   49\n\ntransferees.       Guardians were asked to rate their satisfaction with\n\ntheir wards' placements on a scale of one to five, with one being\n\nthe   most    favorable.         The    results    showed     78%   rated    their\n\nsatisfaction as a \"1,\" 14% rated their satisfaction a \"2,\" 1% rated\n\ntheir satisfaction a \"4,\" and another 1% rated their satisfaction\n\na \"5.\"\n\n             Thus, the monitor's report concluded that the DMR had\n\ncomplied with the Disengagement Order and state and federal law in\n\neffectuating past transfers of residents from Fernald.\n\n             As to future transfers, the report offered the monitor's\n\nopinion that:\n\n                    As   a   result   of   a   year   long\n             investigation, our office has concluded that\n             some of the residents at Fernald could suffer\n             an adverse impact, either emotionally and/or\n             physically, if they were forced to transfer\n             from Fernald to another ICF/MR or to a\n             community residence.\n                    . . . Fernald residents should be\n             allowed to remain at the Fernald facility,\n             since for some, many or most, any other place\n             would not meet an \"equal or better\" outcome.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fReport of Court Monitor Michael J. Sullivan at 27, Ricci IV, 499 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 89 (D. Mass. 2007) (No. 72-0469-T) [hereinafter \"Monitor's\n\nReport\"].    The monitor stated his opinion that \"residents should\n\ncontinue to have the opportunity and option to move from Fernald to\n\nother   ICFs,     or   to   a   community       residence,   provided     that    the\n\nCertification Process is enforced\" but that \"Fernald residents\n\nshould be allowed to remain at the Fernald facility.\"                The monitor\n\nalso suggested that Fernald could be changed by reducing the\n\nfacility's      acreage,        building     new     residential    units,       and\n\nconsolidating residences.\n\nF.          The District Court's August 14, 2007 Order\n\n            The    district      court     reviewed    the   monitor's      report,\n\naffirmed    the    monitor's      finding    that    there   had   been    no    past\n\nviolation of the Disengagement Order, and agreed that \"[f]or some\n\nFernald residents, a transfer 'could have devastating effects that\n\nunravel years of positive, non-abusive behavior.'\"                 Ricci IV, 499\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 91 (quoting Monitor's Report at 24).                       The court\n\nconcluded that \"the Commonwealth's stated global policy judgment\n\nthat Fernald should be closed ha[d] damaged the Commonwealth's\n\nability to adequately assess the needs of the Fernald residents on\n\nan individual, as opposed to a wholesale basis.\"                   Id. (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n            On this basis, the court held that a necessary condition\n\nfor federal court intervention -- that the Commonwealth had engaged\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fin a \"'systemic failure' to provide a compliant ISP process\" -- had\n\nbeen met.    Id. at 91.    The court issued a mandatory injunction to\n\nremedy this failure:\n\n            Any further communication from Defendant\n            Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of\n            Mental Retardation to Fernald residents and\n            their guardians which solicits choices for\n            further residential placement shall include\n            Fernald among the options which residents and\n            guardians may rank when expressing their\n            preferences.\n\nId. at 92.      The court administratively closed the case and the\n\nCommonwealth appealed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            The Commonwealth argues that there was no basis on which\n\nthe court could assert jurisdiction over the matter and asks that\n\nthe action be dismissed.6\n\n            The Commonwealth argues that there are three bases on\n\nwhich the court might have authority to reopen, but says none is\n\npresent here. Those bases are \"the defendants' failure to abide by\n\nthe terms of the [Disengagement Order]; an ongoing violation of the\n\nConstitution;    or   a   significant   change   in   either   the   factual\n\ncircumstances or the law.\"      The first basis arises from the terms\n\n\n     6\n          Even if the district court did have authority, the\nCommonwealth argues, the August 2007 order was improper because:\n(1) it exceeded the bounds of the 1993 Disengagement Order; (2) it\nimproperly issued a mandatory injunction when neither federal law\nnor the Disengagement Order had been violated; and (3) it\neffectively mandated that the Commonwealth keep Fernald open\nindefinitely, which is beyond the power of a federal court. We do\nnot reach those arguments.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fof the Disengagement Order itself.       See Ricci III, 823 F. Supp. at\n\n988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7).     The second condition requires that\n\nthere be a finding of a violation of a federal constitutional\n\nprovision, thus providing a basis to issue a decree, but the decree\n\n\"must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation,\"\n\nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 281-82 (1977); see also Lovell\n\nv. Brennan, 728 F.2d 560, 564 (1st Cir. 1984) (noting that a court\n\nmay exercise continuing jurisdiction in a case if it finds a\n\nconstitutional violation or the likelihood of a constitutional\n\nviolation in the near future).         The third and final condition\n\nrepresents the \"traditional power of a court of equity to modify\n\nits decree in light of changed circumstances,\" Frew ex rel. Frew v.\n\nHawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 441 (2004), subject to the strict limits the\n\nSupreme Court has imposed for finding such modifications.7\n\n          The district court based its authority to issue the order\n\non the first condition: a purported violation under the terms of\n\nparagraph 7 of the Disengagement Order. Plaintiffs urge affirmance\n\non that ground but argue the order is supportable on the other two.\n\n          We   conclude   that   the   district   court   does   not   have\n\nauthority to reopen the case on any permissible basis. We explain.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          The plaintiffs argue that the court's conclusion that it\nhad authority to reopen can also be justified as an exercise of its\n\"ancillary jurisdiction\" or \"inherent jurisdiction.\" We discuss\nthis argument later.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fA.        Whether the Consent Decree Provided Authority to Reopen\n          the Case\n\n          The Disengagement Order allows class members to seek\n\nenforcement of the defendants' obligations in federal court \"[i]f\n\nthe defendants substantially fail to provide a state ISP process\"\n\nas detailed in the Disengagement Order or \"if there is a systemic\n\nfailure to provide services to class members.\"             Ricci III, 823 F.\n\nSupp. at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7).             The district court held\n\nthat the Commonwealth's administration of the ISP process under its\n\nglobal closure policy \"amount[ed] to a 'systemic failure' to\n\nprovide a compliant ISP process\" within the meaning of the 1993\n\nconsent decree.    Ricci IV, 499 F. Supp. 2d at 91.\n\n          The     terms   of   the   consent      decree   embodied   in   the\n\nDisengagement Order, like any contract construction issue, present\n\nan issue of law that we review de novo.           See generally F.A.C., Inc.\n\nv. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de P.R., 449 F.3d 185, 192 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).   Our view of the proper construction is different from\n\nthe district court's.\n\n          Several     provisions     of     the   Disengagement   Order    are\n\nimportant.    First, the Order plainly contemplated that DMR, in its\n\ndiscretion, would be able to close institutions.8            Ricci III, 823\n\n\n     8\n          In 1993, years before it issued the August 2007 order,\nthe district court recognized the Disengagement Order did not\nprohibit the closing of any facility. Ricci III, 823 F. Supp. at\n987 (\"[N]othing in this Order is intended to detract from or limit\nthe discretion of the defendants in . . . allocating its resources\nto ensure equitable treatment of its citizens.\").         It also\n\n                                     -20-\n\fF. Supp. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 5).      Second, the Order does\n\nnot permit state law, including the ISP regulations or review of\n\nthe Superintendent's certification decision, to become enforceable\n\nin the federal court.    Id. at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7(b)).\n\nThus, the Disengagement Order preserved to DMR the discretion to\n\n\"allocat[e] its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its\n\ncitizens   without   federal   court    interference.\"   Id.   at   987\n\n(Disengagement Order ¶ 5).\n\n           The defendants' practices under the Disengagement Order,\n\nas the monitor found, were consistent with the terms of the Order.\n\nIn fact, DMR had earlier closed two residential facilities, the\n\nDever School in 1992 and the Belchertown School in 2002.            The\n\nparties had agreed to the consent decree against the background of\n\na 1991 policy announcement by then-Governor William Weld that\n\nseveral DMR facilities would be consolidated and that the Dever\n\nSchool would be closed within three years. See generally Ricci II,\n\n781 F. Supp. at 827 & n.3.      So long as equal or better services\n\nremain available for each resident elsewhere, the closing of one\n\nresidential facility such as Fernald cannot itself constitute a\n\nviolation of the Disengagement Order.\n\n\n\nacknowledged in 1992 that DMR could close any facility. See Ricci\nv. Okin (Ricci II), 781 F. Supp. 826, 827-28 (D. Mass. 1992) (\"The\ncourt is not opposed to the eventual closing of Dever or any other\n[pre-1993] Consent Decree facility.\"); see also Ricci IV, 499 F.\nSupp. 2d at 92 n.17 (\"The court maintains [the position articulated\nin 1992].\").\n\n                                 -21-\n\f           There   is    also    no     basis   for   a   conclusion    that    the\n\nCommonwealth has failed to meet the conditions it agreed to meet as\n\nto how it goes about providing care to class members.                  Centrally,\n\nthe Commonwealth is required to undertake an ISP process that\n\noutlines the services each individual class member needs.                       See\n\ngenerally Ricci III, 823 F. Supp. at 986-87 (Disengagement Order ¶\n\n2).   Again, the record contains no evidence that DMR failed to\n\ndischarge its ISP duties for any Fernald resident between 2003,\n\nwhen the policy was announced, and 2007.                  To the contrary, the\n\nmonitor found that DMR had complied with its obligations in that\n\nperiod.\n\n           The    district      court    nevertheless      concluded    that   the\n\nCommonwealth's operation of the ISP process against the background\n\nof its policy decision to close Fernald constituted a systemic\n\nfailure.   The court reasoned that in announcing its intention to\n\nclose Fernald, the Commonwealth \"eviscerate[d] [the] opportunity\n\nfor fully informed individualized oversight,\" \"dismiss[ed] the\n\nbenefit of hearing the voices and wishes of those most directly\n\nimpacted,\" and \"deprive[d] the DMR itself of valuable information,\n\nthereby undermining the efficacy of the ISP process.\"                  Ricci IV,\n\n499 F. Supp. 2d at 91.       Given that the monitor found and the court\n\naccepted   that    the   transfer       of     49   patients   after    the    2003\n\nannouncement fully complied with the Disengagement Order, it cannot\n\nfollow that the fact of the announcement caused a systemic failure.\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fIndeed, the 2003 announcement was not the first but one of several\n\nannouncements made of a closing or phase-down of a DMR institution\n\nover a 15-year period.     The pre-2003 announcements did not cause\n\nthere to be systemic failures or damage the plaintiffs' ability\n\nadequately to participate in the ISP process, nor did the 2003\n\nannouncement.   The monitor found there had been full compliance\n\nwith the consent decree as to these earlier closings of facilities.\n\n          Further, the Disengagement Order requires the defendants\n\nto follow an ISP process but does not predetermine the placement\n\nwhich will result at the end of the ISP process.      The Disengagement\n\nOrder, by its terms, does not guarantee any class member any\n\nparticular   residential   placement,   nor   does   it   guarantee   that\n\nFernald be maintained open so long as any particular resident\n\nprefers to remain there.\n\n          This, in turn, has several consequences. The removal of\n\none of several available residential facilities which have been\n\nfound to comply fully with the Disengagement Order cannot itself\n\nresult in there being a violation of the ISP process.       Further, the\n\nvery nature of the ISP process itself contradicts the district\n\ncourt's conclusion.   As the Commonwealth notes, the ISP process\n\nfocuses only on the services a resident is to receive; the ISP\n\nprocess does not specify where those services are to be delivered.\n\nSee generally 115 Mass. Code Regs. 6.20-6.25; cf. Ricci II, 781 F.\n\nSupp. at 827 n.4 (noting, in discussing ISP process for Dever\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fresidents, that \"[r]ecommendation[s] as to residential and program\n\nplacement are based on evaluation of the actual needs of the\n\nresident or client rather than on what facilities and programs are\n\ncurrently available\").\n\n          The Commonwealth also argues that its closing of Fernald\n\ncould have no effect on the ISP process in the future because the\n\nCommonwealth and the class members entered into a stipulation,\n\nfiled with the court on December 29, 2004, that included an\n\nagreement that:\n\n          The Department, its representatives, and\n          employees   shall   not   discuss  alternative\n          placement . . . for individuals at Fernald\n          during the team meeting convened to develop\n          the individual's annual ISP. The annual ISP\n          meeting shall be limited to the identification\n          and recording of the individual's current\n          needs and supports.     The description of an\n          individual's needs and supports as defined in\n          the ISP shall be independent of any discussion\n          regarding where the individual currently lives\n          or what level or type of staffing exists\n          there, and shall be based solely upon\n          professional and direct care assessments done\n          by persons in their assigned roles.\n\nStipulation at 1, Ricci IV, 499 F. Supp. 2d 89 (D. Mass. 2007)\n\n(Nos. 72-0469-T, etc.) (citations omitted).     As the Commonwealth\n\npoints out, the stipulation creates even further distance between\n\ndiscussions of placement and the ISP process.\n\n          Further, the district court's injunction did not rest on\n\nthe likelihood that the remaining Fernald residents systemically\n\nwould be transferred into a location that was not \"equal to or\n\n\n                              -24-\n\fbetter\" than Fernald.     There is no basis in the record for such a\n\nconclusion.      The   monitor   found    that   the   other   residential\n\nfacilities were at least equal to Fernald.             Rather, the court\n\nconcluded that the systemic failure consisted of \"[a]dministering\n\n[the ISP] process under the global declaration that Fernald will be\n\nclosed.\"   Ricci IV, 499 F. Supp. 2d at 91.      Under the Disengagement\n\nOrder, the question of whether a transfer will result in an equal\n\nor better placement is separate from the question whether the\n\nCommonwealth has correctly implemented the ISP process.                  The\n\nsection of the Disengagement Order which deals with transfers\n\nstates:\n\n                   Defendants shall not approve a transfer\n            of any class member out of a state school into\n            the community, or from one community residence\n            to another such residence, until and unless\n            the Superintendent of the transferring school\n            (or the Regional Director of the pertinent\n            community   region)    certifies    that   the\n            individual to be transferred will receive\n            equal or better services to meet their needs\n            in   the   new   location,    and   that   all\n            ISP-recommended services for the individual's\n            current needs as identified in the ISP are\n            available at the new location.\n\nRicci III, 823 F. Supp. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 4) (emphasis\n\nadded).    Under the language of the Disengagement Order, a resident\n\nmay not be transferred to a new location until the Superintendent\n\ncertifies that the location can satisfactorily provide all ISP-\n\nrecommended   services.     This   individualized      process,   that   the\n\nCommonwealth has followed, cannot constitute a \"'systemic failure'\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fto provide a compliant ISP process.\"          The legal premise for the\n\ncourt's conclusion was in error.\n\n             The plaintiff class members have expressed their concerns\n\nthat the outcome of the ISP process for the remaining Fernald\n\nresidents will not result in their receiving equal or better\n\nservices.9    That determination, by its nature, must be made on an\n\nindividual basis.     The Disengagement Order and state regulations\n\nprovide a procedure and a place where individual disputes about\n\nadequacy of the services resulting from the ISP process may be\n\nheard.    See generally 104 Mass. Code Regs. 29.15.            Again, the\n\nDisengagement Order commits these disputes to resolution in a state\n\nforum and under state law and thus provides no basis for federal\n\ncourt intervention.      A resident who is the subject of the ISP\n\nprocess may request a conference and an adjudicatory hearing, which\n\nincludes procedural safeguards and the right to judicial review in\n\nthe state Superior Court.\n\n             If in an individual case there is a failure to provide\n\nthrough   the   ISP   process   \"an    individualized   and   personalized\n\nanalysis of each resident,\" a concern expressed by the district\n\ncourt, then the remedy is provided by state regulations, which\n\ninform the ISP process.     See generally 115 Mass. Code Regs. 6.25.\n\n\n\n     9\n          Plaintiff Wrentham Association argues that the record\nshows there was intimidation of residents. Neither the district\ncourt nor the monitor found any intimidation during the relevant\nperiod and the record does not sustain the accusation.\n\n                                      -26-\n\fThis concern then, does not satisfy the conditions for reopening\n\nthe decree or warrant federal intervention in state proceedings.\n\n              The conditions precedent set forth in the Disengagement\n\nOrder for the court to reopen the case have not been met and the\n\ncourt erred in concluding otherwise.\n\nB.            Whether There   Was   Authority   Under    the      Modification\n              Doctrine\n\n              In reopening the consent decree, the district court did\n\nnot rely on the doctrine that in limited circumstances, consent\n\ndecrees in institutional reform cases may be modified.               In fact,\n\nthis theory was not advanced before the district court. Several of\n\nthe briefs advance this modification rationale as an alternative\n\nrationale which they argue would support the court's reopening of\n\nthe decree.      Given the significance of this case, we address the\n\nquestion.     We hold that the plaintiffs have not met and cannot meet\n\ntheir burden to establish that modification is warranted and that\n\nthe court thus lacked jurisdiction to modify the consent decree.\n\n              In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367\n\n(1992), the Supreme Court set forth the standards that apply when\n\n\"a party seeks modification of a term of a consent decree that\n\narguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right.\"\n\nId. at 383 n.7.     The district court can modify the decree only on\n\na showing of a significant change in circumstances.               Id. at 383.\n\nThe   party    seeking   modification   has   the   burden   of    showing   \"a\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fsignificant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" Id. at\n\n384.\n\n            There is no justification in the modification rationale\n\nunder Rufo to reopen the consent decree.10        There has been no\n\nsignificant change in factual circumstances.     The parties, and the\n\nDisengagement Order, recognized that the Commonwealth might choose\n\nto close any of the residential facilities, including Fernald.\n\nThere has also been no significant change in law which would\n\nwarrant reopening the decree.      Indeed, the law has moved in a\n\ndirection   disfavoring   institutionalization   of   residents.   The\n\nCommonwealth cites Olmstead as recognizing that federal law now\n\nfavors community placement of institutionalized individuals.11      In\n\naddition, the Commonwealth notes that law of neighboring states,\n\nincluding Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, has moved away\n\nfrom institutionalization completely.\n\n\n\n       10\n          We do not need to reach the preliminary question of\nwhether the modification doctrine can apply at all when the parties\nhave in a consent decree defined the conditions for reopening.\n       11\n          Amici, Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates\nfor the Retarded, Inc. and Voice of the Retarded, Inc., filed a\nbrief in this court in support of appellees that argues to the\ncontrary that the core holding of Olmstead does not endorse\ndeinstitutionalization but requires an individualized assessment\nthat considers \"the views of treatment professionals; the views of\nthe affected individual; and state resources.\"         Amici, the\nAssociation   of    Developmental   Disabilities   Providers    of\nMassachusetts and others, filed a brief in support of appellants.\nThey argue that there has been a paradigm shift throughout the\nnation in favor of deinstitutionalization.\n     We note but have no need to address these different views.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fC.         Whether There Was Authority                  to     Reopnen    Due to\n           Constitutional Violations\n\n           The plaintiffs argue that there is a separate basis to be\n\nfound in the Constitution, which would support the district court's\n\nassertion of jurisdiction.        They argue that there has and will be\n\na violation of the residents' due process rights.                 The district\n\ncourt wisely did not rely on this ground.           There is no basis in the\n\nrecord for this assertion.        The record is to the contrary\n\n           The plaintiffs allege that \"a process that would permit\n\nthe transfer of residents from Fernald without [allowing them]\n\nmeaningful participation\" violates principles of due process.                 But\n\nthe record does not show that there has been a \"lack of meaningful\n\nparticipation.\"      The record provides no basis to infer, much less\n\nto    demonstrate,     that    there    will   be   a   lack    of   meaningful\n\nparticipation. The monitor made no findings that DMR had prevented\n\nresidents or guardians involved in transfers between 2003 and 2006\n\nfrom participating meaningfully in discussions of their transfer.\n\nThe   findings   are    that    there    was   full     compliance    with   the\n\nCommonwealth's obligations.\n\nD.         Whether Other Grounds Provided Authority to Reopen\n\n           This leaves only the attempt of the plaintiff class to\n\nrecharacterize the district court's assertion of jurisdiction as an\n\nexercise    of   \"ancillary      jurisdiction.\"          Plaintiff       Wrentham\n\nAssociation makes a related argument that a court has \"inherent\n\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fauthority\" to enforce its own orders.12               Neither doctrine applies\n\nhere.\n\n                \"Ancillary jurisdiction\" is a term with a specialized\n\nmeaning, and the term has no application here.                 Nor does the court\n\nhave \"inherent authority\" to revisit its Disengagement Order.                     In\n\nKokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375\n\n(1994), the Court explained that ancillary jurisdiction can be used\n\nfor two limited purposes: \"(1) to permit disposition by a single\n\ncourt     of    claims   that   are,   in   varying     respects     and    degrees,\n\nfactually interdependent . . . ; and (2) to enable a court to\n\nfunction        successfully,   that    is,    to     manage   its   proceedings,\n\nvindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\"                 Id. at 379-\n\n80 (citations omitted).           In discussing the second purpose, the\n\nCourt noted that a district court may possess \"inherent authority\"\n\nto address violations of an order where it retains jurisdiction in\n\na separate provision, but only when the order itself is violated.\n\nSee id. at 380-81.         The Court found that neither power justified\n\nfederal        court   jurisdiction    to   revisit    a   settlement      agreement\n\nbetween two parties where the court order did not contain a\n\nprovision retaining jurisdiction.              Kokkonen thus stands for the\n\n\n\n     12\n          The Wrentham Association argues that, in addition to its\ninherent authority, the district court explicitly retained\njurisdiction here. Any jurisdiction retained in the Disengagement\nOrder, however, could be activated only after certain conditions\nprecedent, such as a showing of a systemic failure of the ISP\nprocess, were met.\n\n                                        -30-\n\fproposition \"that district courts enjoy no free-ranging 'ancillary'\n\njurisdiction   to    enforce   consent      decrees,     but     are   instead\n\nconstrained by the terms of the decree and related order.\" Pigford\n\nv. Veneman, 292 F.3d 918, 924 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Kokkonen,\n\n511 U.S. at 381). The district court's ancillary jurisdiction thus\n\ndid not provide authority to reopen the Disengagement Order absent\n\na   showing,   not   sustainable    here,    that      the     terms   of   the\n\nDisengagement Order itself had been violated.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          The issue this court decides concerns the limits on the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts.       We do not decide the issue of\n\nwhat path best serves the interests of the residents of Fernald and\n\nthe other parties who have a stake in this matter.             People of good\n\nfaith can and do passionately differ about the Commonwealth's\n\nintention to close the Fernald Center.           We hold only that the\n\ndistrict court lacked authority to reopen the consent decree in\n\nthis case and that it lacked jurisdiction on that or any other\n\nbasis to reopen and to enter the orders it did.\n\n          We reverse and direct entry of judgment dismissing with\n\nprejudice the claims plaintiffs have brought in this action.                In\n\ndoing so, we also recognize the able stewardship exercised by the\n\ndistrict court over the years, which led to the improvement of\n\nconditions for the Fernald residents and to the landmark 1993\n\nconsent decree.\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                    -32-\n\f",

Okin</i> (<i>Ricci IV</i>), 499 F.Supp.2d 89 (D.Mass.2007). Appellants, whom we shall call the Commonwealth, deny that the court had any authority to reopen the consent decree or otherwise issue any orders.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth characterizes the order as essentially prohibiting it from relocating residents as it attempts to close the Fernald Developmental Center. The Fernald Center, some 160 years old, has been the residence of over 180 mentally retarded residents committed to the care of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth announced, in 2003, its intention to move these residents to one of the five other residential facilities or to a community based setting, whichever comports best with each resident's individual service plan (\"ISP\"). The Commonwealth has committed itself to transferring residents only if the Superintendent at Fernald \"certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location.\" <i>Ricci v. Okin</i> (<i>Ricci III</i>), 823 F.Supp. 984, 987 (D.Mass.1993). The Commonwealth did transfer, in fact, some 49 Fernald residents before February 8, 2006.</p>\n<p>The federal district court, which has conscientiously and with great care presided over institutional reform litigation concerning these mentally retarded persons since 1972, <i>see generally </i><i>Ricci v. Okin</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> (<i>Ricci I</i>), 537 F.Supp. 817, 819 (1982), closed the underlying case in 1993 pursuant to a consent decree whose terms it adopted into a court order known as the Disengagement Order, <i>see </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 986-89.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in 2006, the court enjoined the Commonwealth from transferring any more residents on the motion of a class of Fernald residents alleging violation of the decree. <i>Ricci v. Okin,</i> Nos. 72-0469-T, etc. (D.Mass. Feb. 8, 2006) (order freezing resident transfers and appointing court monitor). The court found that it had authority under the 1993 Disengagement Order to investigate whether, as the plaintiffs alleged, the Commonwealth was violating the Disengagement Order. The court appointed a monitor, the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, to investigate and prepare a report. The court asked the monitor's report to address \"whether the past and prospective transfer processes employed by the Department of Mental Retardation comply with federal law, state regulations, as well as the orders of this court.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court's authority to investigate the allegations of violation is not at issue.</p>\n<p>After receiving the report, the court, in an order dated August 14, 2007, found that the conditions for reopening the case contained in the Disengagement Order had been met. It also issued a further remedial order, the specific terms of which we describe later. <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 92. Those orders are at issue.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's appeal is from both components of the August 14, 2007 order. The appeal is supported by a number of amici who are of the view that deinstitutionalization is in the best interests of the Fernald residents.<sup>[1]</sup> In addition, the Massachusetts Association of Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a plaintiff-appellant urging reversal. The Disability Law Center appeared as an intervenor-appellant also urging reversal.</p>\n<p>On the other side, the plaintiffs' arguments to uphold the district court's decision are supported by other amici.<sup>[2]</sup> In addition, the Wrentham Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a plaintiff and appellee on behalf of a class composed of residents at the Commonwealth's Wrentham Developmental Center, stating that in its view, the issues involved in this case affected residents in other state institutions for the mentally retarded such as Wrentham.</p>\n<p>We review first whether the district court had authority to reopen this case because the Commonwealth violated the Disengagement Order or the residents' constitutional rights and whether the court had authority to reopen on some other basis. Because we conclude there was no basis for the district court to reopen the case or otherwise assert jurisdiction, we do not reach the issues relating to the remedial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> order. We reverse the district court, vacate its order, and order dismissal of these proceedings for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We set forth the factual background for this suit, starting with the events which precipitated these proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Actions By the Commonwealth Which Led to This Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In three budgetary acts from 2004-2007, the Massachusetts legislature directed DMR to take appropriate steps to consolidate or close its six Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (\"ICFs\"), including Fernald. Several reasons were articulated. The legislation stated one purpose of the directive was to promote compliance with a Supreme Court decision, <i>Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring,</i> 527 U.S. 581, 119 S.Ct. 2176, 144 L.Ed.2d 540 (1999). That decision, in turn, emphasized the congressional intent in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") to avoid discrimination against mentally disabled persons by promoting their placement into community settings. Another stated purpose was to further the Commonwealth's own established policy of reducing its institutional capacity and of providing services to patients in less restrictive settings. This policy decision was grounded in evidence of prior successful transitions of a number of mentally retarded residents from residential settings, from the past closing of other ICFs. Further, the Commonwealth was cognizant of national trends toward deinstitutionalization and the need for certainty in planning matters such as personnel placement. The legislature required DMR to reduce capacity at these ICFs, provided that equal or better services for residents could be furnished in community settings.</p>\n<p>Another consideration for the Commonwealth was how to use its available resources for the care of the mentally retarded. DMR had received estimates in 2001 for the amount of capital expenditures needed to maintain each ICF. As of 2001, Fernald needed $14.3 million in capital expenditures to repair its infrastructure and $41.2 million to achieve full compliance with the ADA. The Fernald facility was ranked first among the Commonwealth's ICFs in needed capital costs. Indeed, the average daily cost of services at Fernald as of FY 2007 was over $700 per person a day, or $259,000 per person annually.<sup>[3]</sup> By contrast the costs at the other ICFs ranged from $433 to $590 per day. The Fernald per-resident cost was also more than 2.5 times the average annual per-person cost of residential community-based services. In 2007, these were at $280 per day or $102,103 annually per patient, including day programs and transportation services.</p>\n<p>As of May 2007, there were 186 Fernald residents living in a facility that once housed nearly 2,000 individuals. The remaining residents included 131 in the profound range of mental retardation, 40 in the severe range, 12 in the moderate range, and 3 in the mild range. Fernald Center residents ranged in age from 36 to 95 years old, with an average age of 57. Some 38 Fernald Center residents were aged 63 or older.</p>\n<p>In 2003, as said, the Commonwealth announced its intention to close Fernald by transferring its residents to equal or better care in its other five ICFs or into community based settings, including group <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> homes.<sup>[4]</sup> The Commonwealth planned to keep open at the Fernald campus a 24-person residential unit and a skilled nursing center which can serve 29 individuals. It began its program in 2003 and has successfully transferred 49 of approximately 238 residents. Of these, 35 residents were transferred to other ICFs and 14 were transferred to community residences.</p>\n<p>The efforts of the Commonwealth to make these transfers were brought to a halt in February 2006 when, as described above, the federal district court, acting at the behest of a purported class of the remaining 189 Fernald residents, enjoined the process pending further investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The History of the Ricci Class Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1972, residents of the Belchertown State School, a state institution for the mentally retarded, filed a class action against state officials alleging that conditions there violated their constitutional and statutory rights. <i>See </i><i>Ricci I,</i> 537 F.Supp. at 819; <i>see also </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 985-86. A class action challenge to conditions at Fernald was filed on July 23, 1974. Complaint, <i>McEvoy v. Goldmark,</i> No. C.A. 74-2768-T (D.Mass. July 23, 1974). Suits were also filed on behalf of residents of other state institutions. <i>See </i><i>Ricci I,</i> 537 F.Supp. at 819. The actions were consolidated before Judge Tauro of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>After the suits were filed, the court took day-long views of conditions at the facilities. <i>Ricci I,</i> 537 F.Supp. at 820. The court determined that the Commonwealth was not providing the constitutionally required minimum level of care. The Commonwealth defendants chose not to dispute this and instead \"agreed to work with the plaintiffs and the court to fashion comprehensive remedial programs that would be memorialized in the form of consent decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> The parties entered into separate interim consent decrees, one for each institution, in 1977, and a consent decree governing personnel in 1978. <i>Id.</i> at 820-21.</p>\n<p>The district court actively oversaw the implementation of the consent decrees for almost ten years. <i>See generally </i><i>Ricci v. Okin,</i> 978 F.2d 764, 764 (1st Cir.1992). On October 9, 1986, the court entered an order which set out a list of specific tasks for the Commonwealth to accomplish and represented a \"step of disengagement\" for the court. <i>Id.</i> The order contemplated the court's final disengagement after three years, a term that the parties extended by agreement. <i>Id.</i> at 764-65.</p>\n<p>The class action effectively ended in 1993 when the parties entered into a final consent decree, which the district court adopted in a final Disengagement Order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Disengagement Order</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On May 25, 1993, the district court signed an order \"closing the federal court's oversight of the[ ] [consolidated] cases.\" <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 985. The Disengagement Order, which supplanted and replaced all prior consent decrees and court orders, adopted the parties' final consent decree. Several provisions of the Disengagement Order are important for purposes of these appeals.</p>\n<p>First, the Disengagement Order terminated the court's jurisdiction over the cases. The cases could be reopened and jurisdiction could be asserted only if certain explicit conditions were met. The Order allowed \"action[s] to enforce the rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> of the plaintiff classes\" only when they were brought \"pursuant to the terms of paragraph 7\" of the Order. <i>Id.</i> at 986 (Disengagement Order ¶ 1).</p>\n<p>Paragraph 7, in turn, allowed class members to seek enforcement of the Disengagement Order if one or more of three conditions had been met. Plaintiffs were required to show that 1) \"defendants substantially fail[ed] to provide a state ISP process in compliance with [the] Order\"; 2) defendants engaged in \"a systemic failure to provide services to class members as described in [the] Order\"; or 3) defendants engaged in \"a systemic failure to provide ISP services required by [the] Order.\" <i>Id.</i> at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7). The Order did not, however, allow plaintiffs to reopen \"based solely on facts known by them as of the date of [the] Order.\" <i>Id.</i> It also explicitly prohibited plaintiffs from enforcing the Commonwealth's state law obligations in a federal court action.</p>\n<p>Second, the Disengagement Order outlined the obligations DMR owes to class members. Under the Disengagement Order, the Commonwealth may not transfer a class member from a state school to a community residence \"until and unless the Superintendent of the transferring school. . . certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location, and that all ISP-recommended services for the individual's current needs. . . are available at the new location.\" <i>Id.</i> at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 4). This commits the decision to transfer a resident of Fernald to the Superintendent of Fernald, who makes the certification.</p>\n<p>Review of that certification is not in the federal court, but rather through state administrative procedures. <i>See generally</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.15. Under the applicable regulations, if an individual or guardian objects to the transfer, he or she may file an appeal within 30 days of receipt of the ISP. DMR must attempt to resolve the matter through an informal conference with the client and his or her legally authorized representative. The resident may then petition for a hearing. The individual has the right to be represented at the hearing, to present evidence and call witnesses, and to examine DMR's records. Under state law, \"[t]he hearing officer shall determine which placement meets the best interest of the ward giving due consideration to the objections to the placement made by the relative or permanent guardian.\" Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 123B, § 3. The objecting party may then seek judicial review of the hearing officer's decision through appeal to superior court. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 30A, § 14. There is no claim in this case that the Superintendent has failed to make such certifications for prior transfers from Fernald or will fail to do so for future transfers.</p>\n<p>Third, the Disengagement Order details the Commonwealth's obligations with regard to the ISP process. An ISP details each resident's \"capabilities and needs for services\" such as medical or psychological care. <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 986-87 (Disengagement Order ¶ 2(a)); <i>see generally</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.06(2). ISPs are drafted after individual meetings between evaluating professionals and clients and their guardians. <i>See</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.06(2)(b). The Disengagement Order required DMR to comply with state regulations governing ISP planning and mandated that any changes to the Commonwealth's ISP regulations continue to \"guarantee that each class member be provided with the least restrictive, most normal, appropriate residential environment.\" <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 n. 2; <i>see also</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.06(2)(a)(2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> D. <i>The Motions to Reopen</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Ricci class members filed a motion to reopen the case in 2004. The Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a class representative for the Wrentham and Dever plaintiff classes, who had not been included in the Ricci class members' motion to reopen but had separately alleged that DMR was not in substantial compliance with the Disengagement Order. It ultimately filed a notice of appeal from the district court's August 14, 2007 order. As a result, we have two appeals before us from the same district court order. The Ricci class members based their 2004 motion to reopen on the Commonwealth's alleged violation of the Disengagement Order. Specifically, they claimed that the Commonwealth had \"substantially failed to provide a state ISP process in compliance with the Order,\" had engaged in \"a systemic failure to provide services to class members as described in the Order,\" and were \"not in substantial compliance with the Order with regard to systemic issues.\" Motion to Reopen and Restore Case to Active Docket and Enforce the Final Order of May 12, 1993, at 1, <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d 89 (D.Mass. 2007) (Nos.72-0469-T, etc.).<sup>[5]</sup> As noted, the court appointed a special monitor to investigate the allegations raised in the plaintiffs' motion and their reports to the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>The Monitor's Report</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The court monitor completed a 13-month investigation into the transfers from Fernald between February 26, 2003 and February 8, 2006. The monitor reviewed all of DMR's records for the transferred individuals and interviewed most of the individuals or their guardians. The monitor also visited the individuals' new placements as well as all of DMR's ICFs and many of the locations for community placement. In addition, the monitor hired independent medical professionals to assess each individual whose transfer was planned, in order to review whether these individuals would receive \"equal or better\" services in the new location.</p>\n<p>The monitor reviewed allegations that DMR had violated the Disengagement Order's requirement that it \"certify[ ] that individuals to be transferred will receive equal or better services at their new residences\" and \"certify[ ] that ISP recommended services for the individual's current needs are available at the new location.\" The monitor's report concluded that DMR had complied with both obligations.</p>\n<p>The report also found DMR to be in compliance with its procedural obligations under state law, such as the requirement it provide notice to guardians forty-five days in advance of a transfer and the requirement that it ensure guardians knew they had a right to visit and examine the proposed homes. The report also found no violations by DMR of federal regulations, such as 42 C.F.R. § 483.12, which governs transfer standards for skilled nursing facilities. Finally, the monitor found no violation of state regulations governing informed consent. <i>See</i> 115 Mass.Code Regs. 5.08(1)(a).</p>\n<p>In addition, the monitor examined conditions at the Commonwealth's other ICF facilities, to which Fernald residents could be transferred. The monitor concluded that \"[e]ach facility currently ha[d] the minimum services, staffing and amenities to provide equal or better services.\"</p>\n<p>The monitor's report also inquired into guardians' assessments of their satisfaction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> with the resulting placement and their participation in the transfer decision. The monitor reported the results of a survey distributed to guardians of the 49 transferees. Guardians were asked to rate their satisfaction with their wards' placements on a scale of one to five, with one being the most favorable. The results showed 78% rated their satisfaction as a \"1,\" 14% rated their satisfaction a \"2,\" 1% rated their satisfaction a \"4,\" and another 1% rated their satisfaction a \"5.\"</p>\n<p>Thus, the monitor's report concluded that the DMR had complied with the Disengagement Order and state and federal law in effectuating past transfers of residents from Fernald.</p>\n<p>As to future transfers, the report offered the monitor's opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote>As a result of a year long investigation, our office has concluded that some of the residents at Fernald could suffer an adverse impact, either emotionally and/or physically, if they were forced to transfer from Fernald to another ICF/MR or to a community residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . Fernald residents should be allowed to remain at the Fernald facility, since for some, many or most, any other place would not meet an \"equal or better\" outcome.</blockquote>\n<p>Report of Court Monitor Michael J. Sullivan at 27, <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d 89 (D.Mass.2007) (No. 72-0469-T) [hereinafter \"Monitor's Report\"]. The monitor stated his opinion that \"residents should continue to have the opportunity and option to move from Fernald to other ICFs, or to a community residence, provided that the Certification Process is enforced\" but that \"Fernald residents should be allowed to remain at the Fernald facility.\" The monitor also suggested that Fernald could be changed by reducing the facility's acreage, building new residential units, and consolidating residences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>The District Court's August 14, 2007 Order</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court reviewed the monitor's report, affirmed the monitor's finding that there had been no past violation of the Disengagement Order, and agreed that \"[f]or some Fernald residents, a transfer `could have devastating effects that unravel years of positive, non-abusive behavior.'\" <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91 (quoting Monitor's Report at 24). The court concluded that \"the Commonwealth's stated global policy judgment that Fernald should be closed ha[d] damaged the Commonwealth's ability to adequately assess the needs of the Fernald residents on an individual, as opposed to a wholesale basis.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>On this basis, the court held that a necessary condition for federal court interventionthat the Commonwealth had engaged in a \"`systemic failure' to provide a compliant ISP process\"had been met. <i>Id.</i> at 91. The court issued a mandatory injunction to remedy this failure:</p>\n<blockquote>Any further communication from Defendant Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation to Fernald residents and their guardians which solicits choices for further residential placement shall include Fernald among the options which residents and guardians may rank when expressing their preferences.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 92. The court administratively closed the case and the Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that there was no basis on which the court could assert jurisdiction over the matter and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> asks that the action be dismissed.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that there are three bases on which the court might have authority to reopen, but says none is present here. Those bases are \"the defendants' failure to abide by the terms of the [Disengagement Order]; an ongoing violation of the Constitution; or a significant change in either the factual circumstances or the law.\" The first basis arises from the terms of the Disengagement Order itself. <i>See </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7). The second condition requires that there be a finding of a violation of a federal constitutional provision, thus providing a basis to issue a decree, but the decree \"must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation.\" <i>Milliken v. Bradley,</i> 433 U.S. 267, 281-82, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977); <i>see also </i><i>Lovell v. Brennan,</i> 728 F.2d 560, 564 (1st Cir.1984) (noting that a court may exercise continuing jurisdiction in a case if it finds a constitutional violation or the likelihood of a constitutional violation in the near future). The third and final condition represents the \"traditional power of a court of equity to modify its decree in light of changed circumstances,\" <i>Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins,</i> 540 U.S. 431, 441, 124 S.Ct. 899, 157 L.Ed.2d 855 (2004), subject to the strict limits the Supreme Court has imposed for finding such modifications.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court based its authority to issue the order on the first condition: a purported violation under the terms of Paragraph 7 of the Disengagement Order. Plaintiffs urge affirmance on that ground but argue the order is supportable on the other two.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court does not have authority to reopen the case on any permissible basis. We explain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Whether the Consent Decree Provided Authority to Reopen the Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Disengagement Order allows class members to seek enforcement of the defendants' obligations in federal court \"[i]f the defendants substantially fail to provide a state ISP process\" as detailed in the Disengagement Order or \"if there is a systemic failure to provide services to class members.\" <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7). The district court held that the Commonwealth's administration of the ISP process under its global closure policy \"amount[ed] to a `systemic failure' to provide a compliant ISP process\" within the meaning of the 1993 consent decree. <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91.</p>\n<p>The terms of the consent decree embodied in the Disengagement Order, like any contract construction issue, present an issue of law that we review de novo. <i>See generally </i><i>F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de P.R.,</i> 449 F.3d 185, 192 (1st Cir.2006). Our view of the proper construction is different from the district court's.</p>\n<p>Several provisions of the Disengagement Order are important. First, the Order plainly contemplated that DMR, in its discretion, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> would be able to close institutions.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 5). Second, the Order does not permit state law, including the ISP regulations or review of the Superintendent's certification decision, to become enforceable in the federal court. <i>Id.</i> at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7(b)). Thus, the Disengagement Order preserved to DMR the discretion to \"allocat[e] its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its citizens without federal court interference.\" <i>Id.</i> at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 5).</p>\n<p>The defendants' practices under the Disengagement Order, as the monitor found, were consistent with the terms of the Order. In fact, DMR had earlier closed two residential facilities, the Dever School in 1992 and the Belchertown School in 2002. The parties had agreed to the consent decree against the background of a 1991 policy announcement by then-Governor William Weld that several DMR facilities would be consolidated and that the Dever School would be closed within three years. <i>See generally </i><i>Ricci II,</i> 781 F.Supp. at 827 &amp; n. 3. So long as equal or better services remain available for each resident elsewhere, the closing of one residential facility such as Fernald cannot itself constitute a violation of the Disengagement Order.</p>\n<p>There is also no basis for a conclusion that the Commonwealth has failed to meet the conditions it agreed to meet as to how it goes about providing care to class members. Centrally, the Commonwealth is required to undertake an ISP process that outlines the services each individual class member needs. <i>See generally </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 986-87 (Disengagement Order ¶ 2). Again, the record contains no evidence that DMR failed to discharge its ISP duties for any Fernald resident between 2003, when the policy was announced, and 2007. To the contrary, the monitor found that DMR had complied with its obligations in that period.</p>\n<p>The district court nevertheless concluded that the Commonwealth's operation of the ISP process against the background of its policy decision to close Fernald constituted a systemic failure. The court reasoned that in announcing its intention to close Fernald, the Commonwealth \"eviscerate[d][the] opportunity for fully informed individualized oversight,\" \"dismiss[ed] the benefit of hearing the voices and wishes of those most directly impacted,\" and \"deprive[d] the DMR itself of valuable information, thereby undermining the efficacy of the ISP process.\" <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91. Given that the monitor found and the court accepted that the transfer of 49 patients after the 2003 announcement fully complied with the Disengagement Order, it cannot follow that the fact of the announcement caused a systemic failure. Indeed, the 2003 announcement was not the first but one of several announcements made of a closing or phase-down of a DMR institution over a 15-year period. The pre-2003 announcements did not cause there to be systemic failures or damage the plaintiffs' ability adequately to participate in the ISP process, nor did the 2003 announcement. The monitor found there had been full compliance with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> consent decree as to these earlier closings of facilities.</p>\n<p>Further, the Disengagement Order requires the defendants to follow an ISP process but does not predetermine the placement which will result at the end of the ISP process. The Disengagement Order, by its terms, does not guarantee any class member any particular residential placement, nor does it guarantee that Fernald be maintained open so long as any particular resident prefers to remain there.</p>\n<p>This, in turn, has several consequences. The removal of one of several available residential facilities which have been found to comply fully with the Disengagement Order cannot itself result in there being a violation of the ISP process. Further, the very nature of the ISP process itself contradicts the district court's conclusion. As the Commonwealth notes, the ISP process focuses only on the services a resident is to receive; the ISP process does not specify where those services are to be delivered. <i>See generally</i> 115 Mass.Code Regs. 6.20-6.25; <i>cf. </i><i>Ricci II,</i> 781 F.Supp. at 827 n. 4 (noting, in discussing ISP process for Dever residents, that \"[r]ecommendation[s] as to residential and program placement are based on evaluation of the actual needs of the resident or client rather than on what facilities and programs are currently available\").</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth also argues that its closing of Fernald could have no effect on the ISP process in the future because the Commonwealth and the class members entered into a stipulation, filed with the court on December 29, 2004, that included an agreement that:</p>\n<blockquote>The Department, its representatives, and employees shall not discuss alternative placement . . . for individuals at Fernald during the team meeting convened to develop the individual's annual ISP. The annual ISP meeting shall be limited to the identification and recording of the individual's current needs and supports. The description of an individual's needs and supports as defined in the ISP shall be independent of any discussion regarding where the individual currently lives or what level or type of staffing exists there, and shall be based solely upon professional and direct care assessments done by persons in their assigned roles.</blockquote>\n<p>Stipulation at 1, <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d 89 (D.Mass.2007) (Nos.72-0469-T, etc.) (citations omitted). As the Commonwealth points out, the stipulation creates even further distance between discussions of placement and the ISP process.</p>\n<p>Further, the district court's injunction did not rest on the likelihood that the remaining Fernald residents systemically would be transferred into a location that was not \"equal to or better\" than Fernald. There is no basis in the record for such a conclusion. The monitor found that the other residential facilities were at least equal to Fernald. Rather, the court concluded that the systemic failure consisted of \"[a]dministering [the ISP] process under the global declaration that Fernald will be closed.\" <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91. Under the Disengagement Order, the question of whether a transfer will result in an equal or better placement is separate from the question whether the Commonwealth has correctly implemented the ISP process. The section of the Disengagement Order which deals with transfers states:</p>\n<blockquote>Defendants shall not approve a transfer of any class member out of a state school into the community, or from one community residence to another such residence, until and unless the Superintendent of the transferring school (or the Regional Director of the pertinent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> community region) certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location, <i>and that all ISP-recommended services for the individual's current needs as identified in the ISP are available at the new location.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 4) (emphasis added). Under the language of the Disengagement Order, a resident may not be transferred to a new location until the Superintendent certifies that the location can satisfactorily provide all ISP-recommended services. This <i>individualized</i> process, that the Commonwealth has followed, cannot constitute a \"`<i>systemic</i> failure' to provide a compliant ISP process.\" The legal premise for the court's conclusion was in error.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff class members have expressed their concerns that the outcome of the ISP process for the remaining Fernald residents will not result in their receiving equal or better services.<sup>[9]</sup> That determination, by its nature, must be made on an individual basis. The Disengagement Order and state regulations provide a procedure and a place where individual disputes about adequacy of the services resulting from the ISP process may be heard. <i>See generally</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.15. Again, the Disengagement Order commits these disputes to resolution in a state forum and under state law and thus provides no basis for federal court intervention. A resident who is the subject of the ISP process may request a conference and an adjudicatory hearing, which includes procedural safeguards and the right to judicial review in the state Superior Court.</p>\n<p>If in an individual case there is a failure to provide through the ISP process \"an individualized and personalized analysis of each resident,\" a concern expressed by the district court, then the remedy is provided by state regulations, which inform the ISP process. <i>See generally</i> 115 Mass.Code Regs. 6.25. This concern then, does not satisfy the conditions for reopening the decree or warrant federal intervention in state proceedings.</p>\n<p>The conditions precedent set forth in the Disengagement Order for the court to reopen the case have not been met and the court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Whether There Was Authority Under the Modification Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In reopening the consent decree, the district court did not rely on the doctrine that in limited circumstances, consent decrees in institutional reform cases may be modified. In fact, this theory was not advanced before the district court. Several of the briefs advance this modification rationale as an alternative rationale which they argue would support the court's reopening of the decree. Given the significance of this case, we address the question. We hold that the plaintiffs have not met and cannot meet their burden to establish that modification is warranted and that the court thus lacked jurisdiction to modify the consent decree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,</i> 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992), the Supreme Court set forth the standards that apply when \"a party seeks modification of a term of a consent decree that arguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right.\" <i>Id.</i> at 383 n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 748. The district court can modify the decree only on a showing of a significant change in circumstances. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> <i>Id.</i> at 383, 112 S.Ct. 748. The party seeking modification has the burden of showing \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 384.</p>\n<p>There is no justification in the modification rationale under <i>Rufo</i> to reopen the consent decree.<sup>[10]</sup> There has been no significant change in factual circumstances. The parties, and the Disengagement Order, recognized that the Commonwealth might choose to close any of the residential facilities, including Fernald. There has also been no significant change in law which would warrant reopening the decree. Indeed, the law has moved in a direction disfavoring institutionalization of residents. The Commonwealth cites <i>Olmstead</i> as recognizing that federal law now favors community placement of institutionalized individuals.<sup>[11]</sup> In addition, the Commonwealth notes that the law of neighboring states, including Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, has moved away from institutionalization completely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Whether There Was Authority to Reopen Due to Constitutional Violations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that there is a separate basis to be found in the Constitution, which would support the district court's assertion of jurisdiction. They argue that there has and will be a violation of the residents' due process rights. The district court wisely did not rely on this ground. There is no basis in the record for this assertion. The record is to the contrary</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs allege that \"a process that would permit the transfer of residents from Fernald without [allowing them] meaningful participation\" violates principles of due process. But the record does not show that there has been a \"lack of meaningful participation.\" The record provides no basis to infer, much less to demonstrate, that there will be a lack of meaningful participation. The monitor made no findings that DMR had prevented residents or guardians involved in transfers between 2003 and 2006 from participating meaningfully in discussions of their transfer. The findings are that there was full compliance with the Commonwealth's obligations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Whether Other Grounds Provided Authority to Reopen</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This leaves only the attempt of the plaintiff class to recharacterize the district court's assertion of jurisdiction as an exercise of \"ancillary jurisdiction.\" Plaintiff Wrentham Association makes a related argument that a court has \"inherent authority\" to enforce its own orders.<sup>[12]</sup> Neither doctrine applies here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> \"Ancillary jurisdiction\" is a term with a specialized meaning, and the term has no application here. Nor does the court have \"inherent authority\" to revisit its Disengagement Order. In <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994), the Court explained that ancillary jurisdiction can be used for two limited purposes: \"(1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interdependent. . .; and (2) to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 379-80, 114 S.Ct. 1673 (citations omitted). In discussing the second purpose, the Court noted that a district court may possess \"inherent authority\" to address violations of an order where it retains jurisdiction in a separate provision, but only when the order itself is violated. <i>See id.</i> at 380-81, 114 S.Ct. 1673. The Court found that neither power justified federal court jurisdiction to revisit a settlement agreement between two parties where the court order did not contain a provision retaining jurisdiction. <i>Kokkonen</i> thus stands for the proposition \"that district courts enjoy no free-ranging `ancillary' jurisdiction to enforce consent decrees, but are instead constrained by the terms of the decree and related order.\" <i>Pigford v. Veneman,</i> 292 F.3d 918, 924 (D.C.Cir.2002) (citing <i>Kokkonen,</i> 511 U.S. at 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673). The district court's ancillary jurisdiction thus did not provide authority to reopen the Disengagement Order absent a showing, not sustainable here, that the terms of the Disengagement Order itself had been violated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The issue this court decides concerns the limits on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. We do not decide the issue of what path best serves the interests of the residents of Fernald and the other parties who have a stake in this matter. People of good faith can and do passionately differ about the Commonwealth's intention to close the Fernald Center. We hold only that the district court lacked authority to reopen the consent decree in this case and that it lacked jurisdiction on that or any other basis to reopen and to enter the orders it did.</p>\n<p>We <i>reverse</i> and direct entry of judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims plaintiffs have brought in this action. In doing so, we also recognize the able stewardship exercised by the district court over the years, which led to the improvement of conditions for the Fernald residents and to the landmark 1993 consent decree.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Amici in support of the Commonwealth are: National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services; Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers of Massachusetts; Adlib, Inc.; The Arc of the United States; Boston Center for Independent Living; Independent Living Center of the North Shore and Cape Ann, Inc.; Massachusetts Advocates Standing Strong; Massachusetts Council of Human Service Providers, Inc.; Massachusetts Families Organizing for Change; MetroWest Center for Independent Living, Inc.; National Disability Rights Network; Northeast Independent Living Program; Service Employees International Union; Local 509 of the Service Employees International Union; Stavros Center for Independent Living; and United Cerebral Palsy.</p>\n<p>[2]  Amici in support of the plaintiffs are: Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc.; and Voice of the Retarded, Inc.</p>\n<p>[3]  These figures in part reflect the reduced population at Fernald due to the earlier transfers of residents.</p>\n<p>[4]  This was a general policy announcement, which was not accompanied by a formal timetable to close Fernald.</p>\n<p>[5]  Plaintiff Wrentham Association filed a similar motion on February 7, 2006. The motion contained similar allegations and was premised on similar grounds.</p>\n<p>[6]  Even if the district court did have authority, the Commonwealth argues, the August 2007 order was improper because: (1) it exceeded the bounds of the 1993 Disengagement Order; (2) it improperly issued a mandatory injunction when neither federal law nor the Disengagement Order had been violated; and (3) it effectively mandated that the Commonwealth keep Fernald open indefinitely, which is beyond the power of a federal court. We do not reach those arguments.</p>\n<p>[7]  The plaintiffs argue that the court's conclusion that it had authority to reopen can also be justified as an exercise of its \"ancillary jurisdiction\" or \"inherent jurisdiction.\" We discuss this argument later.</p>\n<p>[8]  In 1993, years before it issued the August 2007 order, the district court recognized the Disengagement Order did not prohibit the closing of any facility. <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 (\"[N]othing in this Order is intended to detract from or limit the discretion of the defendants in . . . allocating its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its citizens.\"). It also acknowledged in 1992 that DMR could close any facility. <i>See </i><i>Ricci v. Okin</i> (<i>Ricci II</i>), 781 F.Supp. 826, 827-28 (D.Mass.1992) (\"The court is not opposed to the eventual closing of Dever or any other [pre-1993] Consent Decree facility.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 92 n. 17 (\"The court maintains [the position articulated in 1992].\").</p>\n<p>[9]  Plaintiff Wrentham Association argues that the record shows there was intimidation of residents. Neither the district court nor the monitor found any intimidation during the relevant period and the record does not sustain the accusation.</p>\n<p>[10]  We do not need to reach the preliminary question of whether the modification doctrine can apply at all when the parties have in a consent decree defined the conditions for reopening.</p>\n<p>[11]  Amici, Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc. and Voice of the Retarded, Inc., filed a brief in this court in support of appellees that argues to the contrary that the core holding of <i>Olmstead</i> does not endorse deinstitutionalization but requires an individualized assessment that considers \"the views of treatment professionals; the views of the affected individual; and state resources.\" Amici, the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers of Massachusetts and others, filed a brief in support of appellants. They argue that there has been a paradigm shift throughout the nation in favor of deinstitutionalization.\n</p>\n<p>We note but have no need to address these different views.</p>\n<p>[12]  The Wrentham Association argues that, in addition to its inherent authority, the district court explicitly retained jurisdiction here. Any jurisdiction retained in the Disengagement Order, however, could be activated only after certain conditions precedent, such as a showing of a systemic failure of the ISP process, were met.</p>\n\n</div>",

Okin</i> (<i>Ricci IV</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871404/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2007). Appellants, whom we shall call the Commonwealth, deny that the court had any authority to reopen the consent decree or otherwise issue any orders.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth characterizes the order as essentially prohibiting it from relocating residents as it attempts to close the Fernald Developmental Center. The Fernald Center, some 160 years old, has been the residence of over 180 mentally retarded residents committed to the care of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth announced, in 2003, its intention to move these residents to one of the five other residential facilities or to a community based setting, whichever comports best with each resident's individual service plan (\"ISP\"). The Commonwealth has committed itself to transferring residents only if the Superintendent at Fernald \"certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location.\" <i>Ricci v. Okin</i> (<i>Ricci III</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248319\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248319/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 987 (D.Mass.1993). The Commonwealth did transfer, in fact, some 49 Fernald residents before February 8, 2006.</p>\n<p>The federal district court, which has conscientiously and with great care presided over institutional reform litigation concerning these mentally retarded persons since 1972, <i>see generally </i><i>Ricci v. Okin</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> (<i>Ricci I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2348127\"><a href=\"/opinion/2348127/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 819 (1982), closed the underlying case in 1993 pursuant to a consent decree whose terms it adopted into a court order known as the Disengagement Order, <i>see </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 986-89.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in 2006, the court enjoined the Commonwealth from transferring any more residents on the motion of a class of Fernald residents alleging violation of the decree. <i>Ricci v. Okin,</i> Nos. 72-0469-T, etc. (D.Mass. Feb. 8, 2006) (order freezing resident transfers and appointing court monitor). The court found that it had authority under the 1993 Disengagement Order to investigate whether, as the plaintiffs alleged, the Commonwealth was violating the Disengagement Order. The court appointed a monitor, the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, to investigate and prepare a report. The court asked the monitor's report to address \"whether the past and prospective transfer processes employed by the Department of Mental Retardation comply with federal law, state regulations, as well as the orders of this court.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court's authority to investigate the allegations of violation is not at issue.</p>\n<p>After receiving the report, the court, in an order dated August 14, 2007, found that the conditions for reopening the case contained in the Disengagement Order had been met. It also issued a further remedial order, the specific terms of which we describe later. <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 92. Those orders are at issue.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth's appeal is from both components of the August 14, 2007 order. The appeal is supported by a number of amici who are of the view that deinstitutionalization is in the best interests of the Fernald residents.<sup>[1]</sup> In addition, the Massachusetts Association of Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a plaintiff-appellant urging reversal. The Disability Law Center appeared as an intervenor-appellant also urging reversal.</p>\n<p>On the other side, the plaintiffs' arguments to uphold the district court's decision are supported by other amici.<sup>[2]</sup> In addition, the Wrentham Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a plaintiff and appellee on behalf of a class composed of residents at the Commonwealth's Wrentham Developmental Center, stating that in its view, the issues involved in this case affected residents in other state institutions for the mentally retarded such as Wrentham.</p>\n<p>We review first whether the district court had authority to reopen this case because the Commonwealth violated the Disengagement Order or the residents' constitutional rights and whether the court had authority to reopen on some other basis. Because we conclude there was no basis for the district court to reopen the case or otherwise assert jurisdiction, we do not reach the issues relating to the remedial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> order. We reverse the district court, vacate its order, and order dismissal of these proceedings for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We set forth the factual background for this suit, starting with the events which precipitated these proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Actions By the Commonwealth Which Led to This Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In three budgetary acts from 2004-2007, the Massachusetts legislature directed DMR to take appropriate steps to consolidate or close its six Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (\"ICFs\"), including Fernald. Several reasons were articulated. The legislation stated one purpose of the directive was to promote compliance with a Supreme Court decision, <i>Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2176</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span> (1999). That decision, in turn, emphasized the congressional intent in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") to avoid discrimination against mentally disabled persons by promoting their placement into community settings. Another stated purpose was to further the Commonwealth's own established policy of reducing its institutional capacity and of providing services to patients in less restrictive settings. This policy decision was grounded in evidence of prior successful transitions of a number of mentally retarded residents from residential settings, from the past closing of other ICFs. Further, the Commonwealth was cognizant of national trends toward deinstitutionalization and the need for certainty in planning matters such as personnel placement. The legislature required DMR to reduce capacity at these ICFs, provided that equal or better services for residents could be furnished in community settings.</p>\n<p>Another consideration for the Commonwealth was how to use its available resources for the care of the mentally retarded. DMR had received estimates in 2001 for the amount of capital expenditures needed to maintain each ICF. As of 2001, Fernald needed $14.3 million in capital expenditures to repair its infrastructure and $41.2 million to achieve full compliance with the ADA. The Fernald facility was ranked first among the Commonwealth's ICFs in needed capital costs. Indeed, the average daily cost of services at Fernald as of FY 2007 was over $700 per person a day, or $259,000 per person annually.<sup>[3]</sup> By contrast the costs at the other ICFs ranged from $433 to $590 per day. The Fernald per-resident cost was also more than 2.5 times the average annual per-person cost of residential community-based services. In 2007, these were at $280 per day or $102,103 annually per patient, including day programs and transportation services.</p>\n<p>As of May 2007, there were 186 Fernald residents living in a facility that once housed nearly 2,000 individuals. The remaining residents included 131 in the profound range of mental retardation, 40 in the severe range, 12 in the moderate range, and 3 in the mild range. Fernald Center residents ranged in age from 36 to 95 years old, with an average age of 57. Some 38 Fernald Center residents were aged 63 or older.</p>\n<p>In 2003, as said, the Commonwealth announced its intention to close Fernald by transferring its residents to equal or better care in its other five ICFs or into community based settings, including group <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> homes.<sup>[4]</sup> The Commonwealth planned to keep open at the Fernald campus a 24-person residential unit and a skilled nursing center which can serve 29 individuals. It began its program in 2003 and has successfully transferred 49 of approximately 238 residents. Of these, 35 residents were transferred to other ICFs and 14 were transferred to community residences.</p>\n<p>The efforts of the Commonwealth to make these transfers were brought to a halt in February 2006 when, as described above, the federal district court, acting at the behest of a purported class of the remaining 189 Fernald residents, enjoined the process pending further investigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The History of the Ricci Class Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In 1972, residents of the Belchertown State School, a state institution for the mentally retarded, filed a class action against state officials alleging that conditions there violated their constitutional and statutory rights. <i>See </i><i>Ricci I,</i> 537 F.Supp. at 819; <i>see also </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 985-86. A class action challenge to conditions at Fernald was filed on July 23, 1974. Complaint, <i>McEvoy v. Goldmark,</i> No. C.A. 74-2768-T (D.Mass. July 23, 1974). Suits were also filed on behalf of residents of other state institutions. <i>See </i><i>Ricci I,</i> 537 F.Supp. at 819. The actions were consolidated before Judge Tauro of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>After the suits were filed, the court took day-long views of conditions at the facilities. <i>Ricci I,</i> 537 F.Supp. at 820. The court determined that the Commonwealth was not providing the constitutionally required minimum level of care. The Commonwealth defendants chose not to dispute this and instead \"agreed to work with the plaintiffs and the court to fashion comprehensive remedial programs that would be memorialized in the form of consent decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> The parties entered into separate interim consent decrees, one for each institution, in 1977, and a consent decree governing personnel in 1978. <i>Id.</i> at 820-21.</p>\n<p>The district court actively oversaw the implementation of the consent decrees for almost ten years. <i>See generally </i><i>Ricci v. Okin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593907\"><a href=\"/opinion/593907/robert-simpson-ricci-v-robert-l-okin-md-william-f-weld-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, 764 (1st Cir.1992). On October 9, 1986, the court entered an order which set out a list of specific tasks for the Commonwealth to accomplish and represented a \"step of disengagement\" for the court. <i>Id.</i> The order contemplated the court's final disengagement after three years, a term that the parties extended by agreement. <i>Id.</i> at 764-65.</p>\n<p>The class action effectively ended in 1993 when the parties entered into a final consent decree, which the district court adopted in a final Disengagement Order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Disengagement Order</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On May 25, 1993, the district court signed an order \"closing the federal court's oversight of the[ ] [consolidated] cases.\" <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 985. The Disengagement Order, which supplanted and replaced all prior consent decrees and court orders, adopted the parties' final consent decree. Several provisions of the Disengagement Order are important for purposes of these appeals.</p>\n<p>First, the Disengagement Order terminated the court's jurisdiction over the cases. The cases could be reopened and jurisdiction could be asserted only if certain explicit conditions were met. The Order allowed \"action[s] to enforce the rights <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> of the plaintiff classes\" only when they were brought \"pursuant to the terms of paragraph 7\" of the Order. <i>Id.</i> at 986 (Disengagement Order ¶ 1).</p>\n<p>Paragraph 7, in turn, allowed class members to seek enforcement of the Disengagement Order if one or more of three conditions had been met. Plaintiffs were required to show that 1) \"defendants substantially fail[ed] to provide a state ISP process in compliance with [the] Order\"; 2) defendants engaged in \"a systemic failure to provide services to class members as described in [the] Order\"; or 3) defendants engaged in \"a systemic failure to provide ISP services required by [the] Order.\" <i>Id.</i> at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7). The Order did not, however, allow plaintiffs to reopen \"based solely on facts known by them as of the date of [the] Order.\" <i>Id.</i> It also explicitly prohibited plaintiffs from enforcing the Commonwealth's state law obligations in a federal court action.</p>\n<p>Second, the Disengagement Order outlined the obligations DMR owes to class members. Under the Disengagement Order, the Commonwealth may not transfer a class member from a state school to a community residence \"until and unless the Superintendent of the transferring school. . . certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location, and that all ISP-recommended services for the individual's current needs. . . are available at the new location.\" <i>Id.</i> at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 4). This commits the decision to transfer a resident of Fernald to the Superintendent of Fernald, who makes the certification.</p>\n<p>Review of that certification is not in the federal court, but rather through state administrative procedures. <i>See generally</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.15. Under the applicable regulations, if an individual or guardian objects to the transfer, he or she may file an appeal within 30 days of receipt of the ISP. DMR must attempt to resolve the matter through an informal conference with the client and his or her legally authorized representative. The resident may then petition for a hearing. The individual has the right to be represented at the hearing, to present evidence and call witnesses, and to examine DMR's records. Under state law, \"[t]he hearing officer shall determine which placement meets the best interest of the ward giving due consideration to the objections to the placement made by the relative or permanent guardian.\" Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 123B, § 3. The objecting party may then seek judicial review of the hearing officer's decision through appeal to superior court. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 30A, § 14. There is no claim in this case that the Superintendent has failed to make such certifications for prior transfers from Fernald or will fail to do so for future transfers.</p>\n<p>Third, the Disengagement Order details the Commonwealth's obligations with regard to the ISP process. An ISP details each resident's \"capabilities and needs for services\" such as medical or psychological care. <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 986-87 (Disengagement Order ¶ 2(a)); <i>see generally</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.06(2). ISPs are drafted after individual meetings between evaluating professionals and clients and their guardians. <i>See</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.06(2)(b). The Disengagement Order required DMR to comply with state regulations governing ISP planning and mandated that any changes to the Commonwealth's ISP regulations continue to \"guarantee that each class member be provided with the least restrictive, most normal, appropriate residential environment.\" <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 n. 2; <i>see also</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.06(2)(a)(2).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> D. <i>The Motions to Reopen</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Ricci class members filed a motion to reopen the case in 2004. The Massachusetts Association for Retarded Citizens, Inc. appeared as a class representative for the Wrentham and Dever plaintiff classes, who had not been included in the Ricci class members' motion to reopen but had separately alleged that DMR was not in substantial compliance with the Disengagement Order. It ultimately filed a notice of appeal from the district court's August 14, 2007 order. As a result, we have two appeals before us from the same district court order. The Ricci class members based their 2004 motion to reopen on the Commonwealth's alleged violation of the Disengagement Order. Specifically, they claimed that the Commonwealth had \"substantially failed to provide a state ISP process in compliance with the Order,\" had engaged in \"a systemic failure to provide services to class members as described in the Order,\" and were \"not in substantial compliance with the Order with regard to systemic issues.\" Motion to Reopen and Restore Case to Active Docket and Enforce the Final Order of May 12, 1993, at 1, <i>Ricci IV,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871404/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (D.Mass. 2007) (Nos.72-0469-T, etc.).<sup>[5]</sup> As noted, the court appointed a special monitor to investigate the allegations raised in the plaintiffs' motion and their reports to the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>The Monitor's Report</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The court monitor completed a 13-month investigation into the transfers from Fernald between February 26, 2003 and February 8, 2006. The monitor reviewed all of DMR's records for the transferred individuals and interviewed most of the individuals or their guardians. The monitor also visited the individuals' new placements as well as all of DMR's ICFs and many of the locations for community placement. In addition, the monitor hired independent medical professionals to assess each individual whose transfer was planned, in order to review whether these individuals would receive \"equal or better\" services in the new location.</p>\n<p>The monitor reviewed allegations that DMR had violated the Disengagement Order's requirement that it \"certify[ ] that individuals to be transferred will receive equal or better services at their new residences\" and \"certify[ ] that ISP recommended services for the individual's current needs are available at the new location.\" The monitor's report concluded that DMR had complied with both obligations.</p>\n<p>The report also found DMR to be in compliance with its procedural obligations under state law, such as the requirement it provide notice to guardians forty-five days in advance of a transfer and the requirement that it ensure guardians knew they had a right to visit and examine the proposed homes. The report also found no violations by DMR of federal regulations, such as 42 C.F.R. § 483.12, which governs transfer standards for skilled nursing facilities. Finally, the monitor found no violation of state regulations governing informed consent. <i>See</i> 115 Mass.Code Regs. 5.08(1)(a).</p>\n<p>In addition, the monitor examined conditions at the Commonwealth's other ICF facilities, to which Fernald residents could be transferred. The monitor concluded that \"[e]ach facility currently ha[d] the minimum services, staffing and amenities to provide equal or better services.\"</p>\n<p>The monitor's report also inquired into guardians' assessments of their satisfaction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> with the resulting placement and their participation in the transfer decision. The monitor reported the results of a survey distributed to guardians of the 49 transferees. Guardians were asked to rate their satisfaction with their wards' placements on a scale of one to five, with one being the most favorable. The results showed 78% rated their satisfaction as a \"1,\" 14% rated their satisfaction a \"2,\" 1% rated their satisfaction a \"4,\" and another 1% rated their satisfaction a \"5.\"</p>\n<p>Thus, the monitor's report concluded that the DMR had complied with the Disengagement Order and state and federal law in effectuating past transfers of residents from Fernald.</p>\n<p>As to future transfers, the report offered the monitor's opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote>As a result of a year long investigation, our office has concluded that some of the residents at Fernald could suffer an adverse impact, either emotionally and/or physically, if they were forced to transfer from Fernald to another ICF/MR or to a community residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . Fernald residents should be allowed to remain at the Fernald facility, since for some, many or most, any other place would not meet an \"equal or better\" outcome.</blockquote>\n<p>Report of Court Monitor Michael J. Sullivan at 27, <i>Ricci IV,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871404/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2007) (No. 72-0469-T) [hereinafter \"Monitor's Report\"]. The monitor stated his opinion that \"residents should continue to have the opportunity and option to move from Fernald to other ICFs, or to a community residence, provided that the Certification Process is enforced\" but that \"Fernald residents should be allowed to remain at the Fernald facility.\" The monitor also suggested that Fernald could be changed by reducing the facility's acreage, building new residential units, and consolidating residences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>The District Court's August 14, 2007 Order</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court reviewed the monitor's report, affirmed the monitor's finding that there had been no past violation of the Disengagement Order, and agreed that \"[f]or some Fernald residents, a transfer `could have devastating effects that unravel years of positive, non-abusive behavior.'\" <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91 (quoting Monitor's Report at 24). The court concluded that \"the Commonwealth's stated global policy judgment that Fernald should be closed ha[d] damaged the Commonwealth's ability to adequately assess the needs of the Fernald residents on an individual, as opposed to a wholesale basis.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>On this basis, the court held that a necessary condition for federal court interventionthat the Commonwealth had engaged in a \"`systemic failure' to provide a compliant ISP process\"had been met. <i>Id.</i> at 91. The court issued a mandatory injunction to remedy this failure:</p>\n<blockquote>Any further communication from Defendant Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation to Fernald residents and their guardians which solicits choices for further residential placement shall include Fernald among the options which residents and guardians may rank when expressing their preferences.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 92. The court administratively closed the case and the Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that there was no basis on which the court could assert jurisdiction over the matter and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> asks that the action be dismissed.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Commonwealth argues that there are three bases on which the court might have authority to reopen, but says none is present here. Those bases are \"the defendants' failure to abide by the terms of the [Disengagement Order]; an ongoing violation of the Constitution; or a significant change in either the factual circumstances or the law.\" The first basis arises from the terms of the Disengagement Order itself. <i>See </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7). The second condition requires that there be a finding of a violation of a federal constitutional provision, thus providing a basis to issue a decree, but the decree \"must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation.\" <i>Milliken v.

Plaintiffs urge affirmance on that ground but argue the order is supportable on the other two.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court does not have authority to reopen the case on any permissible basis. We explain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Whether the Consent Decree Provided Authority to Reopen the Case</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Disengagement Order allows class members to seek enforcement of the defendants' obligations in federal court \"[i]f the defendants substantially fail to provide a state ISP process\" as detailed in the Disengagement Order or \"if there is a systemic failure to provide services to class members.\" <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7). The district court held that the Commonwealth's administration of the ISP process under its global closure policy \"amount[ed] to a `systemic failure' to provide a compliant ISP process\" within the meaning of the 1993 consent decree. <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91.</p>\n<p>The terms of the consent decree embodied in the Disengagement Order, like any contract construction issue, present an issue of law that we review de novo. <i>See generally </i><i>F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794465\"><a href=\"/opinion/794465/fac-inc-dba-financial-advisors-and-consultants-inc-fac-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 192 (1st Cir.2006). Our view of the proper construction is different from the district court's.</p>\n<p>Several provisions of the Disengagement Order are important. First, the Order plainly contemplated that DMR, in its discretion, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> would be able to close institutions.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 5). Second, the Order does not permit state law, including the ISP regulations or review of the Superintendent's certification decision, to become enforceable in the federal court. <i>Id.</i> at 988 (Disengagement Order ¶ 7(b)). Thus, the Disengagement Order preserved to DMR the discretion to \"allocat[e] its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its citizens without federal court interference.\" <i>Id.</i> at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 5).</p>\n<p>The defendants' practices under the Disengagement Order, as the monitor found, were consistent with the terms of the Order. In fact, DMR had earlier closed two residential facilities, the Dever School in 1992 and the Belchertown School in 2002. The parties had agreed to the consent decree against the background of a 1991 policy announcement by then-Governor William Weld that several DMR facilities would be consolidated and that the Dever School would be closed within three years. <i>See generally </i><i>Ricci II,</i> 781 F.Supp. at 827 &amp; n. 3. So long as equal or better services remain available for each resident elsewhere, the closing of one residential facility such as Fernald cannot itself constitute a violation of the Disengagement Order.</p>\n<p>There is also no basis for a conclusion that the Commonwealth has failed to meet the conditions it agreed to meet as to how it goes about providing care to class members. Centrally, the Commonwealth is required to undertake an ISP process that outlines the services each individual class member needs. <i>See generally </i><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 986-87 (Disengagement Order ¶ 2). Again, the record contains no evidence that DMR failed to discharge its ISP duties for any Fernald resident between 2003, when the policy was announced, and 2007. To the contrary, the monitor found that DMR had complied with its obligations in that period.</p>\n<p>The district court nevertheless concluded that the Commonwealth's operation of the ISP process against the background of its policy decision to close Fernald constituted a systemic failure. The court reasoned that in announcing its intention to close Fernald, the Commonwealth \"eviscerate[d][the] opportunity for fully informed individualized oversight,\" \"dismiss[ed] the benefit of hearing the voices and wishes of those most directly impacted,\" and \"deprive[d] the DMR itself of valuable information, thereby undermining the efficacy of the ISP process.\" <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91. Given that the monitor found and the court accepted that the transfer of 49 patients after the 2003 announcement fully complied with the Disengagement Order, it cannot follow that the fact of the announcement caused a systemic failure. Indeed, the 2003 announcement was not the first but one of several announcements made of a closing or phase-down of a DMR institution over a 15-year period. The pre-2003 announcements did not cause there to be systemic failures or damage the plaintiffs' ability adequately to participate in the ISP process, nor did the 2003 announcement. The monitor found there had been full compliance with the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> consent decree as to these earlier closings of facilities.</p>\n<p>Further, the Disengagement Order requires the defendants to follow an ISP process but does not predetermine the placement which will result at the end of the ISP process. The Disengagement Order, by its terms, does not guarantee any class member any particular residential placement, nor does it guarantee that Fernald be maintained open so long as any particular resident prefers to remain there.</p>\n<p>This, in turn, has several consequences. The removal of one of several available residential facilities which have been found to comply fully with the Disengagement Order cannot itself result in there being a violation of the ISP process. Further, the very nature of the ISP process itself contradicts the district court's conclusion. As the Commonwealth notes, the ISP process focuses only on the services a resident is to receive; the ISP process does not specify where those services are to be delivered. <i>See generally</i> 115 Mass.Code Regs. 6.20-6.25; <i>cf. </i><i>Ricci II,</i> 781 F.Supp. at 827 n. 4 (noting, in discussing ISP process for Dever residents, that \"[r]ecommendation[s] as to residential and program placement are based on evaluation of the actual needs of the resident or client rather than on what facilities and programs are currently available\").</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth also argues that its closing of Fernald could have no effect on the ISP process in the future because the Commonwealth and the class members entered into a stipulation, filed with the court on December 29, 2004, that included an agreement that:</p>\n<blockquote>The Department, its representatives, and employees shall not discuss alternative placement . . . for individuals at Fernald during the team meeting convened to develop the individual's annual ISP. The annual ISP meeting shall be limited to the identification and recording of the individual's current needs and supports. The description of an individual's needs and supports as defined in the ISP shall be independent of any discussion regarding where the individual currently lives or what level or type of staffing exists there, and shall be based solely upon professional and direct care assessments done by persons in their assigned roles.</blockquote>\n<p>Stipulation at 1, <i>Ricci IV,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1871404\"><a href=\"/opinion/1871404/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2007) (Nos.72-0469-T, etc.) (citations omitted). As the Commonwealth points out, the stipulation creates even further distance between discussions of placement and the ISP process.</p>\n<p>Further, the district court's injunction did not rest on the likelihood that the remaining Fernald residents systemically would be transferred into a location that was not \"equal to or better\" than Fernald. There is no basis in the record for such a conclusion. The monitor found that the other residential facilities were at least equal to Fernald. Rather, the court concluded that the systemic failure consisted of \"[a]dministering [the ISP] process under the global declaration that Fernald will be closed.\" <i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 91. Under the Disengagement Order, the question of whether a transfer will result in an equal or better placement is separate from the question whether the Commonwealth has correctly implemented the ISP process. The section of the Disengagement Order which deals with transfers states:</p>\n<blockquote>Defendants shall not approve a transfer of any class member out of a state school into the community, or from one community residence to another such residence, until and unless the Superintendent of the transferring school (or the Regional Director of the pertinent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> community region) certifies that the individual to be transferred will receive equal or better services to meet their needs in the new location, <i>and that all ISP-recommended services for the individual's current needs as identified in the ISP are available at the new location.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 (Disengagement Order ¶ 4) (emphasis added). Under the language of the Disengagement Order, a resident may not be transferred to a new location until the Superintendent certifies that the location can satisfactorily provide all ISP-recommended services. This <i>individualized</i> process, that the Commonwealth has followed, cannot constitute a \"`<i>systemic</i> failure' to provide a compliant ISP process.\" The legal premise for the court's conclusion was in error.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff class members have expressed their concerns that the outcome of the ISP process for the remaining Fernald residents will not result in their receiving equal or better services.<sup>[9]</sup> That determination, by its nature, must be made on an individual basis. The Disengagement Order and state regulations provide a procedure and a place where individual disputes about adequacy of the services resulting from the ISP process may be heard. <i>See generally</i> 104 Mass.Code Regs. 29.15. Again, the Disengagement Order commits these disputes to resolution in a state forum and under state law and thus provides no basis for federal court intervention. A resident who is the subject of the ISP process may request a conference and an adjudicatory hearing, which includes procedural safeguards and the right to judicial review in the state Superior Court.</p>\n<p>If in an individual case there is a failure to provide through the ISP process \"an individualized and personalized analysis of each resident,\" a concern expressed by the district court, then the remedy is provided by state regulations, which inform the ISP process. <i>See generally</i> 115 Mass.Code Regs. 6.25. This concern then, does not satisfy the conditions for reopening the decree or warrant federal intervention in state proceedings.</p>\n<p>The conditions precedent set forth in the Disengagement Order for the court to reopen the case have not been met and the court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Whether There Was Authority Under the Modification Doctrine</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In reopening the consent decree, the district court did not rely on the doctrine that in limited circumstances, consent decrees in institutional reform cases may be modified. In fact, this theory was not advanced before the district court. Several of the briefs advance this modification rationale as an alternative rationale which they argue would support the court's reopening of the decree. Given the significance of this case, we address the question. We hold that the plaintiffs have not met and cannot meet their burden to establish that modification is warranted and that the court thus lacked jurisdiction to modify the consent decree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span> (1992), the Supreme Court set forth the standards that apply when \"a party seeks modification of a term of a consent decree that arguably relates to the vindication of a constitutional right.\" <i>Id.</i> at 383 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>. The district court can modify the decree only on a showing of a significant change in circumstances. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> <i>Id.</i> at 383, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>. The party seeking modification has the burden of showing \"a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 384.</p>\n<p>There is no justification in the modification rationale under <i>Rufo</i> to reopen the consent decree.<sup>[10]</sup> There has been no significant change in factual circumstances. The parties, and the Disengagement Order, recognized that the Commonwealth might choose to close any of the residential facilities, including Fernald. There has also been no significant change in law which would warrant reopening the decree. Indeed, the law has moved in a direction disfavoring institutionalization of residents. The Commonwealth cites <i>Olmstead</i> as recognizing that federal law now favors community placement of institutionalized individuals.<sup>[11]</sup> In addition, the Commonwealth notes that the law of neighboring states, including Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, has moved away from institutionalization completely.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Whether There Was Authority to Reopen Due to Constitutional Violations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that there is a separate basis to be found in the Constitution, which would support the district court's assertion of jurisdiction. They argue that there has and will be a violation of the residents' due process rights. The district court wisely did not rely on this ground. There is no basis in the record for this assertion. The record is to the contrary</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs allege that \"a process that would permit the transfer of residents from Fernald without [allowing them] meaningful participation\" violates principles of due process. But the record does not show that there has been a \"lack of meaningful participation.\" The record provides no basis to infer, much less to demonstrate, that there will be a lack of meaningful participation. The monitor made no findings that DMR had prevented residents or guardians involved in transfers between 2003 and 2006 from participating meaningfully in discussions of their transfer. The findings are that there was full compliance with the Commonwealth's obligations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Whether Other Grounds Provided Authority to Reopen</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This leaves only the attempt of the plaintiff class to recharacterize the district court's assertion of jurisdiction as an exercise of \"ancillary jurisdiction.\" Plaintiff Wrentham Association makes a related argument that a court has \"inherent authority\" to enforce its own orders.<sup>[12]</sup> Neither doctrine applies here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> \"Ancillary jurisdiction\" is a term with a specialized meaning, and the term has no application here. Nor does the court have \"inherent authority\" to revisit its Disengagement Order. In <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span> (1994), the Court explained that ancillary jurisdiction can be used for two limited purposes: \"(1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interdependent. . .; and (2) to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 379-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span> (citations omitted). In discussing the second purpose, the Court noted that a district court may possess \"inherent authority\" to address violations of an order where it retains jurisdiction in a separate provision, but only when the order itself is violated. <i>See id.</i> at 380-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>. The Court found that neither power justified federal court jurisdiction to revisit a settlement agreement between two parties where the court order did not contain a provision retaining jurisdiction. <i>Kokkonen</i> thus stands for the proposition \"that district courts enjoy no free-ranging `ancillary' jurisdiction to enforce consent decrees, but are instead constrained by the terms of the decree and related order.\" <i>Pigford v. Veneman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></span>, 924 (D.C.Cir.2002) (citing <i>Kokkonen,</i> 511 U.S. at 381, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117845\"><a href=\"/opinion/117845/kokkonen-v-guardian-life-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>). The district court's ancillary jurisdiction thus did not provide authority to reopen the Disengagement Order absent a showing, not sustainable here, that the terms of the Disengagement Order itself had been violated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The issue this court decides concerns the limits on the jurisdiction of the federal courts. We do not decide the issue of what path best serves the interests of the residents of Fernald and the other parties who have a stake in this matter. People of good faith can and do passionately differ about the Commonwealth's intention to close the Fernald Center. We hold only that the district court lacked authority to reopen the consent decree in this case and that it lacked jurisdiction on that or any other basis to reopen and to enter the orders it did.</p>\n<p>We <i>reverse</i> and direct entry of judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims plaintiffs have brought in this action. In doing so, we also recognize the able stewardship exercised by the district court over the years, which led to the improvement of conditions for the Fernald residents and to the landmark 1993 consent decree.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Amici in support of the Commonwealth are: National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services; Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers of Massachusetts; Adlib, Inc.; The Arc of the United States; Boston Center for Independent Living; Independent Living Center of the North Shore and Cape Ann, Inc.; Massachusetts Advocates Standing Strong; Massachusetts Council of Human Service Providers, Inc.; Massachusetts Families Organizing for Change; MetroWest Center for Independent Living, Inc.; National Disability Rights Network; Northeast Independent Living Program; Service Employees International Union; Local 509 of the Service Employees International Union; Stavros Center for Independent Living; and United Cerebral Palsy.</p>\n<p>[2]  Amici in support of the plaintiffs are: Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc.; and Voice of the Retarded, Inc.</p>\n<p>[3]  These figures in part reflect the reduced population at Fernald due to the earlier transfers of residents.</p>\n<p>[4]  This was a general policy announcement, which was not accompanied by a formal timetable to close Fernald.</p>\n<p>[5]  Plaintiff Wrentham Association filed a similar motion on February 7, 2006. The motion contained similar allegations and was premised on similar grounds.</p>\n<p>[6]  Even if the district court did have authority, the Commonwealth argues, the August 2007 order was improper because: (1) it exceeded the bounds of the 1993 Disengagement Order; (2) it improperly issued a mandatory injunction when neither federal law nor the Disengagement Order had been violated; and (3) it effectively mandated that the Commonwealth keep Fernald open indefinitely, which is beyond the power of a federal court. We do not reach those arguments.</p>\n<p>[7]  The plaintiffs argue that the court's conclusion that it had authority to reopen can also be justified as an exercise of its \"ancillary jurisdiction\" or \"inherent jurisdiction.\" We discuss this argument later.</p>\n<p>[8]  In 1993, years before it issued the August 2007 order, the district court recognized the Disengagement Order did not prohibit the closing of any facility. <i>Ricci III,</i> 823 F.Supp. at 987 (\"[N]othing in this Order is intended to detract from or limit the discretion of the defendants in . . . allocating its resources to ensure equitable treatment of its citizens.\"). It also acknowledged in 1992 that DMR could close any facility. <i>See </i><i>Ricci v. Okin</i> (<i>Ricci II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411469\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411469/ricci-v-okin/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 827-28 (D.Mass.1992) (\"The court is not opposed to the eventual closing of Dever or any other [pre-1993] Consent Decree facility.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Ricci IV,</i> 499 F.Supp.2d at 92 n. 17 (\"The court maintains [the position articulated in 1992].\").</p>\n<p>[9]  Plaintiff Wrentham Association argues that the record shows there was intimidation of residents. Neither the district court nor the monitor found any intimidation during the relevant period and the record does not sustain the accusation.</p>\n<p>[10]  We do not need to reach the preliminary question of whether the modification doctrine can apply at all when the parties have in a consent decree defined the conditions for reopening.</p>\n<p>[11]  Amici, Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc. and Voice of the Retarded, Inc., filed a brief in this court in support of appellees that argues to the contrary that the core holding of <i>Olmstead</i> does not endorse deinstitutionalization but requires an individualized assessment that considers \"the views of treatment professionals; the views of the affected individual; and state resources.\" Amici, the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers of Massachusetts and others, filed a brief in support of appellants. They argue that there has been a paradigm shift throughout the nation in favor of deinstitutionalization.\n</p>\n<p>We note but have no need to address these different views.</p>\n<p>[12]  The Wrentham Association argues that, in addition to its inherent authority, the district court explicitly retained jurisdiction here. Any jurisdiction retained in the Disengagement Order, however, could be activated only after certain conditions precedent, such as a showing of a systemic failure of the ISP process, were met.</p>\n\n</div>",
