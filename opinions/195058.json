Longman and Roche, Carens &amp; DeGiacomo on brief for\n                                                  \nappellee.\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.   Appellant David Wayfield alleges  that the\n               \n\nTown  of  Tisbury,  in  conjunction   with  numerous  private\n\nparties,  deprived  him  of  his  constitutional   rights  in\n\nviolation  of 42 U.S.C.   1983.  After the defendants filed a\n\nmotion to  dismiss the  entire complaint,  Wayfield moved  to\n\namend his original complaint.   This motion was denied by the\n\ndistrict court on the ground that the amended complaint would\n\nalso be subject to dismissal.  Wayfield appeals the dismissal\n\nof his  civil rights action.   With one exception,  we affirm\n\nthe dismissal of Wayfield's claims.\n\n     In  dismissing  Wayfield's  civil  rights  claims,   the\n\ndistrict court  seems to  rely in part  on the  doctrine that\n\ncivil  rights  complaints  must   be  pled  with   heightened\n\nparticularity.   See Dartmouth  Review v.  Dartmouth College,\n                                                            \n\n889  F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).  However, the Supreme Court\n\nhas  recently cautioned that  civil rights  claims are  to be\n\nsubject only  to normal standards of pleading.  Leatherman v.\n                                                          \n\nTarrant County  Narcotics Intelligence  &amp; Coordination  Unit,\n                                                            \n\n113 S.Ct.  1160,  1163  (1993).    The  proper  standard  for\n\nassessing  the  adequacy  of the  instant  complaint  then is\n\nwhether, accepting  the factual allegations in  the complaint\n\nas  true,  and  construing  these facts  in  the  light  most\n\nfavorable  to the  plaintiff, the  pleading  shows any  facts\n\nwhich  could entitle plaintiff to  relief.  See, e.g., Gooley\n                                                             \n\nv.   Mobil  Oil Corp.,  851 F.2d  513, 514  (1st Cir.  1988).\n                    \n\n                             -2-\n\nMoreover, as a pro se plaintiff, Wayfield is entitled to have\n                     \n\nhis  complaint \"liberally construed.\"  Estelle v. Gamble, 429\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 97, 106 (1976).\n\n     Even  under   this  more  generous   standard,  most  of\n\nWayfield's causes of action are subject to dismissal  for the\n\nreasons stated in the district court opinion, dated March 29,\n\n1993.  However, we find that the amended complaint, liberally\n\nconstrued, does state a  cause of action under section  1983.\n\nWe  therefore  reverse   the  district   court's  denial   of\n\nWayfield's  motion  to  amend his  complaint  and  vacate the\n\ndismissal order in part.\n\n     According  to  his amended  complaint,  on December  14,\n\n1990,  Wayfield went  to the  Vineyard  Haven Public  Library\n\nwhere  he spoke with the Library Director, defendant Marjorie\n\nConvery,  and  attempted  to persuade  her  to  stock several\n\n\"revisionist\" books  and periodicals.   Ms.  Convery did  not\n\nrespond and  \"seemed very angry  but controlled.\"   Within an\n\nhour, Wayfield was falsely accused by Ms. Convery of stealing\n\na menorah from  the library.  When he refused  her request to\n\nopen   his  shoulder  bag   to  be  searched,   Wayfield  was\n\n\"assaulted\" by Convery.   On December 18, Wayfield received a\n\ncertified  letter from  Convery informing  him  that \"[a]s  a\n\nresult of the disruptive incident that occurred on Saturday .\n\n. . your presence on the property  or in the building will no\n\nlonger  be permitted.\"   On December 20,  he received another\n\n                             -3-\n\nletter  dated December 19,  1990, from the  Board of Trustees\n\nfor the Vineyard  Haven Public Library, announcing  that, due\n\nto the \"disruptive incident,\" he was banned from the  library\n\nuntil April 2, 1991.   After Wayfield returned to the library\n\nin January  1991,  he  was  charged with  trespassing.    The\n\ncharges  were eventually  dropped.   Wayfield  admits to  the\n\nexistence of a disturbance but alleges that he was the victim\n\nof an  illegal assault by  Convery.  He further  alleges that\n\nthe ban  imposed upon him was due  not to any disturbance but\n\nwas in retaliation for his political views.\n\n     To state a  cause of action  under 42  U.S.C.   1983,  a\n\nplaintiff   must  allege   sufficient  facts  to   support  a\n\ndetermination  \"(i) that the  conduct complained of  has been\n\ncommitted under  color  of  state  law, and  (ii)  that  [the\n\nalleged] conduct  worked a  denial of  rights secured by  the\n\nConstitution or  laws  of the  United States.\"   Chongris  v.\n                                                         \n\nBoard of Appeals,  811 F.2d 36, 40 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,\n                                                            \n\n483  U.S. 1021 (1987). Liberally construing the complaint and\n\naccepting its allegations as true, we find that the complaint\n\nstates a  cause of action under 42  U.S.C.   1983 against Ms.\n\nConvery.  First,  as evidenced by her letter  of December 18,\n\n1990,  banning   Wayfield  from  the  library,   Ms.  Convery\n\npurported to act  under the color of state  law.  Second, the\n\nbanning  of Wayfield  because of  his  political views  would\n\nappear to be  a violation of his constitutional  rights.  Cf.\n                                                            \n\n                             -4-\n\nNestor Colon Medina  &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v.

And it may not invoke regulations as to\n\n     use--whether  they  are  ad  hoc  or  general--as a\n                                     \n\n     pretext  for  pursuing  those  engaged  in  lawful,\n\n     constitutionally   protected   exercise   of  their\n\n     fundamental rights.\n\nBrown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 142-43 (1966). \n                  \n\n     To be  sure,  the allegations  that the  assault by  Ms.\n\nConvery and her banning  him from the library were  motivated\n\nby animus  toward Wayfield's political  views are conclusory.\n\nSuch  conclusory   allegations  become  facts   for  pleading\n\npurposes \"only when such conclusions are logically compelled,\n\nor at least supported, by the stated facts, that is, when the\n\nsuggested  inference rises to what experience indicates is an\n\nacceptable  level  of  probability.\"    Dartmouth  Review  v.\n                                                         \n\nDartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).  \n                 \n\n                             -5-\n\n     The   complaint   does   allege  facts   which,   albeit\n\ncircumstantial, support the  conclusion that  the banning  by\n\nthe Director  was politically motivated.  Since  the state of\n\nmind of an actor  often \"must be inferred from  the things [a\n\nparty] says  or does[,]\"   Anthony v. Sundlun, 952  F.2d 603,\n                                             \n\n605  (1st  Cir.  1991),  circumstantial  evidence  alone  can\n\nsupport a conclusion of discriminatory intent.  Id. \n                                                  \n\n     First, Wayfield  alleges that on the day of the incident\n\nwhich led to  the banning he discussed with  the Director his\n\npolitical views.   Not only was she thus aware of those views\n\nbut   Wayfield  alleges  that  she  \"seemed  very  angry  but\n\ncontrolled.\"   He then alleges  that \"within an hour\"  he was\n\naccused falsely of stealing a  menorah and was \"assaulted\" by\n\nthe Director.  From these facts, it is possible to infer that\n\nthe accusation  of stealing was  a pretext and that  the real\n\nreason  for the \"assault\"  and the Director's  letter banning\n\nWayfield was animus towards Wayfield's political views.  \n\n     We also find that, although the  question is very close,\n\nthe complaint alleges  a cause of action against  the Town of\n\nTisbury  as  well.   According  to  the  complaint, liberally\n\nconstrued,  the Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Vineyard  Haven\n\nLibrary banned Wayfield from the library between December 19,\n\n1990,  and April  2,  1991 because  of  his political  views.\n\nWhile  the  Board  purported  to  act  only  because  of  the\n\n\"disruptive  incident\" which  occurred  between Wayfield  and\n\n                             -6-\n\nConvery,  the complaint alleges that this incident was only a\n\npretext, a  conclusion we  have decided  is supported  by the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint.  We do  not find the possible\n\ninference that the Board, acting  on the basis of information\n\nprovided by  the Director, may  have been aware of,  and even\n\nshared, the  Director's intent,  to be  so speculative as  to\n\nrequire dismissal of  this case without any  further inquiry.\n\nSince  the Board  of  Trustees is  the  body responsible  for\n\nmanaging the library,  see Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 78,    11,  any\n                                        \n\nillegal acts it  may have committed would expose  the town to\n\nliability.  See  Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475  U.S. 469, 483-84\n                                      \n\n(1986) (municipality is liable under section 1983 even for \"a\n\nsingle decision  to take  unlawful action  . .  .

As  to those claims, we vacate the dismissal of the\n\ncomplaint,  reverse the  denial of  the motion  to amend  the\n\ncomplaint,  and  remand  to the  district  court  for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                             -7-\n\n     Affirmed in  part; vacated  in part and  remanded.

However, the Supreme Court has recently cautioned that civil rights claims are to be subject only to normal standards of pleading.   Leatherman v.

The proper standard for assessing the adequacy of the instant complaint then is whether, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and construing these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleading shows any facts which could entitle plaintiff to relief.

According to the complaint, liberally construed, the Board of Trustees of the Vineyard Haven Library banned Wayfield from the library between December 19, 1990, and April 2, 1991 because of his political views.  While the Board purported to act only because of the \"disruptive incident\" which occurred between Wayfield and Convery, the complaint alleges that this incident was only a pretext, a conclusion we have decided is supported by the facts alleged in the complaint.

Since the Board of Trustees is the body responsible for managing the library, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 78, Sec. 11, any illegal acts it may have committed would expose the town to liability.

Sec. 1983.  After the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the entire complaint, Wayfield moved to amend his original complaint.  This motion was denied by the district court on the ground that the amended complaint would also be subject to dismissal.  Wayfield appeals the dismissal of his civil rights action.  With one exception, we affirm the dismissal of Wayfield's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing Wayfield's civil rights claims, the district court seems to rely in part on the doctrine that civil rights complaints must be pled with heightened particularity.   See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).  However, the Supreme Court has recently cautioned that civil rights claims are to be subject only to normal standards of pleading.   Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1163 (1993).  The proper standard for assessing the adequacy of the instant complaint then is whether, accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and construing these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the pleading shows any facts which could entitle plaintiff to relief.   See, e.g., Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir. 1988).  Moreover, as a pro se plaintiff, Wayfield is entitled to have his complaint \"liberally construed.\"   Estelle v. Gamble, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 106 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even under this more generous standard, most of Wayfield's causes of action are subject to dismissal for the reasons stated in the district court opinion, dated March 29, 1993.  However, we find that the amended complaint, liberally construed, does state a cause of action under section 1983.  We therefore reverse the district court's denial of Wayfield's motion to amend his complaint and vacate the dismissal order in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to his amended complaint, on December 14, 1990, Wayfield went to the Vineyard Haven Public Library where he spoke with the Library Director, defendant Marjorie Convery, and attempted to persuade her to stock several \"revisionist\" books and periodicals.  Ms. Convery did not respond and \"seemed very angry but controlled.\"  Within an hour, Wayfield was falsely accused by Ms. Convery of stealing a menorah from the library.  When he refused her request to open his shoulder bag to be searched, Wayfield was \"assaulted\" by Convery.  On December 18, Wayfield received a certified letter from Convery informing him that \"[a]s a result of the disruptive incident that occurred on Saturday ... your presence on the property or in the building will no longer be permitted.\"  On December 20, he received another letter dated December 19, 1990, from the Board of Trustees for the Vineyard Haven Public Library, announcing that, due to the \"disruptive incident,\" he was banned from the library until April 2, 1991.  After Wayfield returned to the library in January 1991, he was charged with trespassing.  The charges were eventually dropped.  Wayfield admits to the existence of a disturbance but alleges that he was the victim of an illegal assault by Convery.  He further alleges that the ban imposed upon him was due not to any disturbance but was in retaliation for his political views.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support a determination \"(i) that the conduct complained of has been committed under color of state law, and (ii) that [the alleged] conduct worked a denial of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"   Chongris v. Board of Appeals, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482848\"><a href=\"/opinion/482848/james-chongris-and-george-chongris-v-board-of-appeals-of-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1021</span></span> (1987).  Liberally construing the complaint and accepting its allegations as true, we find that the complaint states a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 against Ms. Convery.  First, as evidenced by her letter of December 18, 1990, banning Wayfield from the library, Ms. Convery purported to act under the color of state law.  Second, the banning of Wayfield because of his political views would appear to be a violation of his constitutional rights.   Cf. Nestor Colon Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583574\"><a href=\"/opinion/583574/nestor-colon-medina-sucesores-inc-v-patria-g-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 1992) (denial of land use permit in unjustifiable retaliation for expression of political views constitutes a first amendment violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[While a] State or its instrumentality may, of course, regulate the use of its libraries or other public facilities ... it must do so in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner, equally applicable to all and administered with equality to all....  And it may not invoke regulations as to use-whether they are ad hoc or general-as a pretext for pursuing those engaged in lawful, constitutionally protected exercise of their fundamental rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown v.

Such conclusory allegations become facts for pleading purposes \"only when such conclusions are logically compelled, or at least supported, by the stated facts, that is, when the suggested inference rises to what experience indicates is an acceptable level of probability.\"   Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint does allege facts which, albeit circumstantial, support the conclusion that the banning by the Director was politically motivated.

Sundlun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574884\"><a href=\"/opinion/574884/jane-anthony-v-bruce-g-sundlun/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 605 (1st Cir. 1991), circumstantial evidence alone can support a conclusion of discriminatory intent.
