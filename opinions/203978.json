Plaintiff Maxima D.\n\nMarrero    (“Marrero”)    sued        various    Puerto   Rico    Department    of\n\nEducation   (“Department”)       officials       (collectively        “Defendants”)\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that they retaliated against\n\nher on the basis of her political beliefs in violation of the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments.         The district court granted Defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss, concluding that a forum selection clause in a\n\nprior Settlement Agreement between Marrero and the Department\n\nrequired    that    her   claims       be   litigated     in    the   Puerto   Rico\n\nCommonwealth courts.      Marrero timely appealed.\n\n            We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\n\naffirm.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n            Marrero has worked at the Department for more than twenty\n\nyears, most recently as the Director of the Office of Rules and\n\nRegulations.    She is an active member of the New Progressive Party\n\n(“NPP”).    In the course of her tenure, the Department’s leadership\n\nshifted from NPP members to members of the Popular Democratic Party\n\n(“PDP”).    Marrero contends that Defendants are all members of the\n\nPDP.\n\n            In 2004, Cesar A. Rey Hernandez, then Secretary of the\n\nDepartment,        recommended         Marrero     for      a     promotion     (a\n\n“reclassification” in the Department’s parlance). She alleges that\n\nRey’s staff failed to take any action on the recommendation.\n\n\n                                        - 2 -\n\f               On December 7, 2004, Marrero filed an administrative\n\nappeal before the Public Service Human Resources Appeals Commission\n\n(“Commission”),          alleging    that    the     Department         was   unlawfully\n\nrefusing to promote her.            On March 2, 2005, the Commission issued\n\na resolution approving a binding Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”)\n\nbetween Marrero and the Department.                The Agreement stipulated that\n\nthe Department had discriminated against Marrero, and provided that\n\nit would promote her within fifteen days.                   Marrero, for her part,\n\nagreed to waive all claims against the Department and its officers\n\nthat       could   arise    from   facts    related    to    the    Agreement.         The\n\nAgreement also provides that if any Department officials failed to\n\ncomply with its terms, “it will be deemed an admission of a civil\n\nrights       violation,      and    the    case    will     be    submitted      to    the\n\njurisdiction        of     the   Superior    Court,    San       Juan    Part”   for    an\n\nassessment of damages.\n\n               On January 17, 2007, Marrero sued the Department in the\n\nSuperior Court of San Juan. In her complaint, Marrero alleged that\n\nDepartment officials had breached the Agreement, mistreated and\n\nhumiliated her, and deprived her of the resources necessary to\n\nfulfill the responsibilities of her position.1\n\n               Approximately six months later, Marrero filed the present\n\naction in federal district court.                  Her federal complaint alleges\n\n\n       1\n          According to Defendants, the case was dismissed for lack\nof proper service, and is now pending certiorari review before the\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court.\n\n                                           - 3 -\n\fviolations of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and seeks\n\ndamages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. She contends\n\nthat Department officials refused to promote her, mistreated and\n\nhumiliated her, subjected her to irregular disciplinary actions,\n\nand deprived her of the resources and personnel necessary to\n\nfulfill the duties of her position.   Department officials took all\n\nof the above retaliatory actions, Marrero alleges, because of her\n\nNPP affiliation.\n\n          Defendants filed a series of motions to dismiss, or in\n\nthe alternative, to stay the case.    They contended that: (1) the\n\nAgreement’s forum selection clause required Marrero to litigate her\n\nclaims in the Puerto Rico Commonwealth courts; (2) the statute of\n\nlimitations had run on her political discrimination claims; (3) the\n\ncourt should abstain under the Colorado River abstention doctrine,\n\nsee Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S.\n\n800, 814-16 (1976) (holding that, in limited circumstances, federal\n\ncourts should abstain from deciding a case when there are related\n\nproceedings pending in state court); (4) her claims were barred by\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment; and (5) the complaint failed to state a\n\nclaim on which relief could be granted.    The district court then\n\nordered Marrero to show cause why her complaint should not be\n\ndismissed on the basis of the Agreement’s forum selection clause.\n\nAfter receiving briefing from all parties on the issue, the court\n\n\n\n\n                              - 4 -\n\fgranted Defendants’ motion and dismissed the case with prejudice.\n\nMarrero timely appealed.2\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\n          We review the dismissal of Marrero’s complaint de novo,\n\nassuming the truth of all well-pleaded facts and construing all\n\nreasonable inferences in her favor. Fitzgerald v. Harris, 549 F.3d\n\n46, 52 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          In granting the motion to dismiss, the district court\n\nconcluded that the claims set forth in Marrero’s complaint all\n\n“stem from the [Department’s] alleged refusal to comply with the\n\nSettlement Agreement,” and thus, the Agreement’s forum selection\n\nclause requires that her claims be litigated in local court.3\n\n          A mandatory forum selection clause carries a “strong\n\npresumption of enforceability.” Rivera v. Centro Medico de Turabo,\n\nInc., No. 07-2657, 2009 WL 2343132, at *6 (1st Cir. Jul. 31,\n\n2009).4   Federal courts will enforce such clauses “unless the\n\n     2\n          Marrero    also    filed   an    untimely   motion    for\nreconsideration, which the district court denied. She does not\nappeal the denial of the motion for reconsideration, and thus we do\nnot review it here.\n     3\n          “[W]hen ‘a complaint’s factual allegations are expressly\nlinked to – and admittedly dependent upon – a document (the\nauthenticity of which is not challenged),’ then the court can\nreview it upon a motion to dismiss.” Alternative Energy, Inc. v.\nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17\n(1st Cir. 1998)).\n     4\n          Marrero does not challenge the district court’s\nconclusion that the Agreement’s forum selection clause is\nmandatory, rather than permissive. See Rivera, 2009 WL 2343132, at\n\n                                  - 5 -\n\fresisting party can show ‘that enforcement would be unreasonable\n\nand unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as\n\nfraud or overreaching . . . [or that] enforcement would contravene\n\na strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought,\n\nwhether    declared    by   statute    or   by    judicial     decision.’”      Id.\n\n(quoting M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15\n\n(1972)).\n\n            Marrero     does   not    argue      that   the   Agreement’s     forum\n\nselection clause is invalid, or that its enforcement would be\n\nunreasonable.    The crux of her argument on appeal seems to be that\n\nsome of the instances of political discrimination described in her\n\ncomplaint are factually unrelated to the Department’s alleged\n\nfailure to comply with the Agreement.                These particular acts of\n\ndiscrimination, she contends, go beyond the Department’s refusal to\n\npromote her, and thus are not governed by the Agreement and its\n\nforum selection clause.\n\n            Marrero, however, did not raise this argument before the\n\ndistrict court.       Indeed, despite a clear prompt, her response to\n\nthe   court’s   order    to    show   cause   does      not   mention   the   forum\n\nselection clause at all, much less comment on its scope. Arguments\n\nnot presented to the district court are deemed waived on appeal.\n\nSee Cohen v. Gen. Motors Corp. (In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian\n\n\n*5 (describing the difference between a mandatory and a permissive\nforum selection clause). We thus assume, without deciding, that\nthe district court did not err in deeming the clause mandatory.\n\n\n                                      - 6 -\n\fExp. Antitrust Litig.), 533 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2008) (pointing out\n\nthat “plaintiffs failed to raise this argument before the district\n\ncourt and thus have waived it” (citing Teamsters Local No. 59 v.\n\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992))).\n\n           Because Marrero waived the only argument that she now\n\ntenders in her opening brief on appeal that challenges the basis\n\nfor the decision below, we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.5   Further, because we decide this case on grounds of waiver,\n\nwe take no view as to the correctness of the district court’s\n\ninterpretation or application of the Agreement’s forum selection\n\nclause.\n\n\n           AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          As noted, the district court’s dismissal was “with\nprejudice.” We construe that term as precluding the refiling of\nthis action (or the same claims) in federal court, but not as a bar\nto refiling in the forum specified in the Agreement’s forum\nselection clause.\n\n                                - 7 -\n\f",

The crux of her argument on appeal seems to be that\n\nsome of the instances of political discrimination described in her\n\ncomplaint are factually unrelated to the Department’s alleged\n\nfailure to comply with the Agreement.                These particular acts of\n\ndiscrimination, she contends, go beyond the Department’s refusal to\n\npromote her, and thus are not governed by the Agreement and its\n\nforum selection clause.\n\n            Marrero, however, did not raise this argument before the\n\ndistrict court.       Indeed, despite a clear prompt, her response to\n\nthe   court’s   order    to    show   cause   does      not   mention   the   forum\n\nselection clause at all, much less comment on its scope. Arguments\n\nnot presented to the district court are deemed waived on appeal.\n\nSee Cohen v. Gen. Motors Corp. (In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian\n\n\n*5 (describing the difference between a mandatory and a permissive\nforum selection clause). We thus assume, without deciding, that\nthe district court did not err in deeming the clause mandatory.\n\n\n                                      - 6 -\n\fExp.
