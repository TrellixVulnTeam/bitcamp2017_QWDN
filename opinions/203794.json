The defendant\n\nmakes     two    arguments    concerning      an   enhancement       imposed     for\n\nobstruction of justice: (1) that the district court failed to make\n\nspecific factual findings supporting the enhancement and (2) that\n\nthe enhancement resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity\n\nbetween    him    and   his   co-defendant.        He   also   argues,     in    the\n\nalternative, that the court should have granted his request for a\n\nbelow-guidelines sentence.          For the reasons discussed below, we\n\nfind none of those arguments meritorious and therefore summarily\n\naffirm the defendant's sentence, as requested in the government's\n\nbrief.\n\n            The     presentence        report      (\"PSR\")     recommended        an\n\nobstruction-of-justice         enhancement      based   on     the    defendant's\n\nparticipation      in   aiding   his   co-defendant,     Richard       Dimott,   to\n\nabscond from Dimott's pre-trial home confinement.                    Specifically,\n\nthe revised PSR found as follows:\n\n                   On March 4, 2006, the defendant met\n                   with   his   co-defendant,    Richard\n                   Dimott, who had been arraigned and\n                   ordered    released    to    pretrial\n                   supervision      with     electronic\n                   monitoring. Dimott was residing in\n                   Massachusetts     and    was    being\n                   supervised by the Pretrial Services\n                   Office    in    the    District    of\n                   Massachusetts. . . . During that\n                   meeting,    the    defendant    aided\n                   Dimott's flight from justice by\n                   using snips to remove Dimott's\n                   electronic monitoring transmitter\n                   from around his ankle, buying him a\n                   bus ticket from Boston, MA, to\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                 Rockland, ME, and then driving him\n                 to the bus station. Dimott remained\n                 in     absconder     status      for\n                 approximately seven months, but was\n                 ultimately apprehended and convicted\n                 of Criminal Contempt of Court due to\n                 his conduct.\n\n           At sentencing, the defendant acknowledged having received\n\na copy of the revised presentence report, which included the above\n\nfinding and the related recommendation, and further acknowledged\n\nthat he had had a full and adequate opportunity to discuss the\n\nrevised PSR with his counsel and that he was aware that no written\n\nobjections had been filed.       He further confirmed that there was\n\nnothing in the PSR that was inaccurate.\n\n           In   their   arguments   as    to   the   appropriate    sentence,\n\ncounsel for both parties assumed that the defendant would be\n\nreceiving the recommended two-level enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice.   After hearing those arguments and after hearing from the\n\ndefendant himself, the district court said that it had \"carefully\n\nreviewed the presentence investigation report\" and noted that there\n\nwere \"no disputed issues.\"          The court then proceeded to make\n\nguideline calculations, including the two-level enhancement for\n\nobstruction     of   justice   based     on    the   fact   that   \"Defendant\n\nparticipated in aiding Richard Dimott's flight from justice.\" When\n\nasked whether the defendant had an objection to those calculations,\n\ndefense counsel stated, \"No Your Honor, thank you.\"                Id.    Given\n\nthat   colloquy,     the   defendant's        present   objection    to     the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fobstruction-of-justice enhancement, if not waived entirely, was at\n\nleast forfeited and therefore subject to review only for plain\n\nerror. United States v. Martinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245, 249-50 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n            No    such     error    occurred       here,    plain       or   otherwise.\n\nContrary to the defendant's contention, the court made specific\n\nfindings, both oral and written, that the defendant had aided his\n\nco-defendant      in     absconding     from   pre-trial      confinement,       which\n\nfindings are legally sufficient to warrant an enhancement for\n\nobstruction of justice.            See U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(e))\n\n(including \"escaping or attempting to escape from custody before\n\ntrial\" in \"a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of\n\nconduct to which this adjustment applies\"); id., comment. (n.9)\n\n(providing       that,    \"[u]nder      this   section,           the    defendant    is\n\naccountable for his own conduct and for conduct that he aided or\n\nabetted\").\n\n            The defendant does not claim that those findings were\n\nclearly    erroneous       but   only   that    they       were    not    sufficiently\n\nspecific, particularly with respect to willfulness. In so arguing,\n\nthe defendant relies on United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94-\n\n95 (1993), which held that where the defendant objects to a\n\nsentence enhancement based on the defendant's allegedly perjured\n\ntrial testimony, \"a district court must . . . make independent\n\nfindings    necessary       to   establish     a    willful       impediment     to   or\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fobstruction of justice.\"              Id. at 95.         The Court reached that\n\nconclusion because \"an accused may give inaccurate testimony due to\n\nconfusion, mistake, or faulty memory,' or the jury may find the\n\ndefendant's testimony to be truthful but nevertheless find it\n\ninsufficient to acquit him of the charged offense.                 Id.     Where, as\n\nhere, the obstruction of justice enhancement is not based on\n\nperjury, Dunnigan and its underlying rationale do not apply.\n\nUnited States v. Jimenez Martinez, 83 F.3d 488, 498 n.13 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            The defendant further faults the district court for\n\nrelying on the findings in the PSR, positing that those findings\n\nwere based on unreliable hearsay.                That argument fails as well.\n\n\"[I]n the absence of any objection, a statement in a presentence\n\nreport is sufficient to prove the fact proposed.\" United States v.\n\nPelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 202-03 (1st Cir. 2006).                   Moreover, even\n\nnow, the defendant does not contest the truth of the PSR's findings\n\nor proffer any evidence to the contrary.                 He therefore has failed\n\nto show that any error in adopting those findings affected his\n\nsubstantial rights, a prerequisite to relief under the plain-error\n\nstandard.    United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 39-40\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The defendant next argues that the obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement       resulted     in   an    unwarranted    disparity   between      his\n\nsentence    and    that   of    his      co-defendant,    who   received    no   such\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fenhancement and only a concurrent six-month sentence on a separate\n\ncontempt charge based on his own flight from justice.                            That\n\nargument was made below and implicitly considered but rejected by\n\nthe district court, United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514,\n\n519    (1st   Cir.   2006)    (en    banc),    which,       having   sentenced      both\n\ndefendants, was in the best position to determine whether they were\n\nsimilarly situated.          The court's decision not to vary below the\n\nguideline range on this ground was not unreasonable, particularly\n\ngiven that the co-defendant received a total sentence that was 50\n\nmonths higher than that of the defendant here, and that, despite\n\nhis upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, the defendant\n\nhere    was   also   given     the    benefit     of    a    three-level     downward\n\nadjustment for acceptance of responsibility, which adjustments are\n\nrarely applied together.             See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, comment. (n.4)\n\n(stating      that   the     two    adjustments    may       both    apply   only    in\n\n\"extraordinary cases\").\n\n              Finally, the defendant argues that the district court\n\nshould have imposed a below-guidelines sentence because doing so\n\n\"would have been well within its discretion.\"                   Assuming that this\n\nargument is sufficiently developed to warrant our consideration,\n\nbut see United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990),\n\nit reflects a misunderstanding of the applicable standard of\n\nappellate review.          \"Reasonableness entails a range of potential\n\nsentences, as opposed to a single precise result.\"                    United States\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fv. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir. 2006).                 Accordingly, an\n\nappellant   must   explain    not    why    a   desired   sentence   would   be\n\nreasonable but why the imposed sentence was unreasonable.              United\n\nStates v. Nichols, 464 F.3d 1117, 1124, 1126 (9th Cir. 2006).            That\n\nburden is particularly heavy where, as here, the imposed sentence\n\nfalls within the guideline sentencing range.                 Rita v. United\n\nStates, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2465 (2007).            The defendant here has not\n\nsatisfied that burden.\n\n            Accordingly,     the    defendant's     sentence   is    summarily\n\naffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f",

The defendant\n\nmakes     two    arguments    concerning      an   enhancement       imposed     for\n\nobstruction of justice: (1) that the district court failed to make\n\nspecific factual findings supporting the enhancement and (2) that\n\nthe enhancement resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity\n\nbetween    him    and   his   co-defendant.

Specifically,\n\nthe revised PSR found as follows:\n\n                   On March 4, 2006, the defendant met\n                   with   his   co-defendant,    Richard\n                   Dimott, who had been arraigned and\n                   ordered    released    to    pretrial\n                   supervision      with     electronic\n                   monitoring. Dimott was residing in\n                   Massachusetts     and    was    being\n                   supervised by the Pretrial Services\n                   Office    in    the    District    of\n                   Massachusetts. . . . During that\n                   meeting,    the    defendant    aided\n                   Dimott's flight from justice by\n                   using snips to remove Dimott's\n                   electronic monitoring transmitter\n                   from around his ankle, buying him a\n                   bus ticket from Boston, MA, to\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                 Rockland, ME, and then driving him\n                 to the bus station.

Jimenez Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196722\"><a href=\"/opinion/196722/united-states-v-jimenez-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498 n.13 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            The defendant further faults the district court for\n\nrelying on the findings in the PSR, positing that those findings\n\nwere based on unreliable hearsay.                That argument fails as well.\n\n\"[I]n the absence of any objection, a statement in a presentence\n\nreport is sufficient to prove the fact proposed.\" United States v.\n\nPelletier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796023\"><a href=\"/opinion/796023/united-states-v-joseph-pellether/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202-03 (1st Cir. 2006).                   Moreover, even\n\nnow, the defendant does not contest the truth of the PSR's findings\n\nor proffer any evidence to the contrary.                 He therefore has failed\n\nto show that any error in adopting those findings affected his\n\nsubstantial rights, a prerequisite to relief under the plain-error\n\nstandard.    United States v. Turbides-Leonardo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202495\"><a href=\"/opinion/202495/united-states-v-turbides-leonardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39-40\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The defendant next argues that the obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement       resulted     in   an    unwarranted    disparity   between      his\n\nsentence    and    that   of    his      co-defendant,    who   received    no   such\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fenhancement and only a concurrent six-month sentence on a separate\n\ncontempt charge based on his own flight from justice.                            That\n\nargument was made below and implicitly considered but rejected by\n\nthe district court, United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n519    (1st   Cir.   2006)    (en    banc),    which,       having   sentenced      both\n\ndefendants, was in the best position to determine whether they were\n\nsimilarly situated.          The court's decision not to vary below the\n\nguideline range on this ground was not unreasonable, particularly\n\ngiven that the co-defendant received a total sentence that was 50\n\nmonths higher than that of the defendant here, and that, despite\n\nhis upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, the defendant\n\nhere    was   also   given     the    benefit     of    a    three-level     downward\n\nadjustment for acceptance of responsibility, which adjustments are\n\nrarely applied together.             See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, comment. (n.4)\n\n(stating      that   the     two    adjustments    may       both    apply   only    in\n\n\"extraordinary cases\").\n\n              Finally, the defendant argues that the district court\n\nshould have imposed a below-guidelines sentence because doing so\n\n\"would have been well within its discretion.\"                   Assuming that this\n\nargument is sufficiently developed to warrant our consideration,\n\nbut see United States v.

Accordingly, an\n\nappellant   must   explain    not    why    a   desired   sentence   would   be\n\nreasonable but why the imposed sentence was unreasonable.              United\n\nStates v.
