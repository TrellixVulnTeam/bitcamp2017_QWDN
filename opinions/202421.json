R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 05-2432\n\n                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                             RAHEEM JONES,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                    DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. F. Dennis Saylor, IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen J. Weymouth, on brief for defendant, appellant.\n     Paul G. Casey, Assistant United States Attorney, and Michael\nJ. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          September 19, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam. Raheem Jones, who pled guilty to five counts\n\nof   distributing      cocaine   base,    in    violation      of   21    U.S.C.   §\n\n841(a)(1), challenges his within-guideline sentence on several\n\ngrounds.   His primary set of objections focuses on the district\n\ncourt's finding that the substance involved was \"crack\" cocaine as\n\nopposed to some other form of cocaine base.            In addition, he argues\n\nthat the resulting 108-month sentence was unreasonable because the\n\nsentencing court relied too heavily on the advisory guidelines and\n\nfailed to apply the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),\n\nparticularly     the     \"parsimony\"     principle,      to     his      individual\n\ncircumstances. After careful review of the record, we conclude for\n\nthe reasons detailed below that the district court's factual\n\nfindings   are   amply    supported      by    the   record,    that     the   court\n\nadequately explained its reasons for imposing the sentence, and\n\nthat the resulting sentence is not unreasonably high under the\n\ncircumstances of this case viewed through the lens of the statutory\n\nfactors.\n\n           Jones's main argument is that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that the substance involved was crack cocaine as opposed to\n\nsome other form of cocaine base. This distinction matters because,\n\nunder the guidelines, a higher base offense level applies to crack\n\nthan to other forms of cocaine, including other forms of cocaine\n\nbase.   See USSG § 2D1.1(c), n. D; United States v. Brown, 450 F.3d\n\n76, 80 (1st Cir. 2006).          Specifically, in this case, the crack\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffinding resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 108 to 135\n\nmonths rather than the range of 18 to 24 months that would apply if\n\nthe substance were some other form of cocaine base.\n\n            \"When the nature of an illicit substance is material at\n\nsentencing, the government has the burden to prove the substance's\n\nidentity by a preponderance of the evidence.\"       United States v.\n\nDwayne Anderson,1 452 F.3d 66, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2006).    That burden\n\nremains unchanged after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005).\"    Paul Anderson, 452 F.3d at 92 n.3.   Jones's argument for\n\na burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is therefore \"a non-\n\nstarter.\"     Id.   \"'Whether a particular substance is crack or\n\ncocaine for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question of\n\nfact to be determined by the [sentencing] court,'\" Dwayne Anderson,\n\n452 F.3d at 83 (quoting United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104,\n\n109 (1st Cir. 1998)), whose fact-finding must be accepted unless it\n\nis clearly erroneous, id.; see also United States v. Robinson, 433\n\nF.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 2005) (concluding that standard of appellate\n\nreview of district court fact-finding is unchanged by Booker).\n\n            Under those standards, the district court's finding that\n\nthe substance at issue here was crack readily survives appellate\n\nreview.     The court based its finding on the affidavits (and\n\nattached laboratory reports and transcripts of grand-jury testimony\n\n\n     1\n      We include the defendant's given name to distinguish this\ncase from United States v. Paul Anderson, 452 F.3d 87 (1st Cir.\n2006), cited below, which appears in the same volume of F.3d.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fand of a tape-recording of one of the transactions) of three highly\n\nexperienced law enforcement officials, including a forensic chemist\n\nand special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration and a\n\nlocal police officer who was a member of a joint federal/local drug\n\ntask force.        Based on that uncontradicted evidence, the court\n\nconcluded that the substance involved in all five transactions was,\n\nin fact, cocaine, based on its off-white and rocklike appearance,\n\nthe terminology used by the parties to the transactions, the price,\n\nand the possible presence of sodium bicarbonate in at least two of\n\nthe samples.      We have repeatedly found that quantum and quality of\n\nevidence to be sufficient, particularly in the absence of any\n\nevidence to the contrary.          See, e.g., Dwayne Anderson, 452 F.3d at\n\n84-85; Brown, 450 F.3d at 80-81; Robinson, 144 F.3d at 109.\n\n               The fact that no evidence of sodium bicarbonate was found\n\nin three of the samples is inconsequential.           As explained by the\n\nforensic chemist, \"evidence of sodium bicarbonate is often not\n\nfound     in    crack    cocaine   because   it   dissipates   through   the\n\nmanufacturing process.\"        Nor are we bothered by the absence of any\n\nevidence as to the price and physical appearance of other forms of\n\ncocaine base.           As we previously recognized, \"crack is . . .\n\nuniquely identified by its 'rock-like' texture and yellowish or\n\noff-white color.\"         Dwayne Anderson, 452 F.3d at 80-81 (emphasis\n\nadded).        Where, as here, adequate proof is presented that a\n\nsubstance is crack cocaine, we have never required the government\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fto rule out other forms of cocaine base.        Accordingly, we discern\n\nno clear error in the district court's determination that the\n\nsubstance at issue in this case was crack.\n\n          Based on that determination, the district court correctly\n\ncalculated Jones's guideline sentencing range to be 108 to 135\n\nmonths and--after expressly considering each of the mitigating\n\nfactors proffered by Jones--adopted the government's recommendation\n\nto sentence him at the low end of that range rather than depart\n\ndownward under the guidelines or impose a non-guidelines sentence\n\nunder Booker.      Specifically, the court found no evidence that\n\nJones's diminished mental capacity (mild mental retardation and\n\npolysubstance disorder) contributed substantially to his commission\n\nof the instant offenses and found his criminal history category to\n\nadequately   reflect   the   seriousness   of    his   criminal   record,\n\nparticularly given the temporal proximity of the instant offense to\n\nhis most recent prior offense and incarceration.          The court also\n\ncommented that drug offenses are not victimless crimes, noting that\n\nJones's own mother died of a drug overdose, leaving him parentless\n\nin his infancy.     The only factor that gave the court pause was\n\nJones's poor upbringing, which the court characterized as \"about as\n\nbad as one could possibly imagine.\"     However, after \"wrest[ling]\"\n\nwith that issue but finding \"very little to be positive about on a\n\ngoing forward basis,\" the court decided \"to follow the guidance of\n\nthe   Sentencing    Guidelines    and   accept     [the    government's]\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\frecommendation to sentence on the low end [of the guidelines\n\nrange].\"   The court addressed Jones's need for rehabilitation,\n\nresulting, in part, from his abusive and neglectful upbringing, by\n\nrecommending that he be placed in a facility with an educational\n\nprogram \"that can help him obtain the education and training that\n\nhe did not receive as a child.\"   The court advised the defendant to\n\ncontinue his education while in prison \"so that when [he] come[s]\n\nout, . . . [he] will be in a happier position then [he was] when\n\n[he] went in.\"\n\n           Jones faults the district court for relying too heavily\n\non the guidelines, but the role played by the guidelines was not\n\nimpermissible here.   See United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\n514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).     Having considered each of the\n\nmitigating factors Jones brought to the court's attention and\n\nhaving explained its reasons for the chosen sentence, the court was\n\nnot further required to explain why a lighter sentence would not be\n\n\"sufficient\" under the prefatory language of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\nUnited States v. Navedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54, 58-59 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.    See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
