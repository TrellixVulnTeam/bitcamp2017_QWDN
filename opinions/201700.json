Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                      Before\n\n                Selya, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and Peter E. Papps,\nFirst Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n     Jonathan R. Saxe, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nappellant.\n\n\n\n                              July 15, 2005\n\f                        Per Curiam.        Gary Foster pleaded guilty to an\n\ninformation charging him with possession of child pornography, see\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B), and was sentenced to 51 months in\n\nprison.     He challenges his sentence on two grounds.                        First, he\n\nargues that the district court's application of a cross reference\n\nin U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2), and further application of a sentence\n\nenhancement in U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(2)(E), constituted impermissible\n\ndouble punishment (or \"double counting\") for the same conduct.\n\nSecond, he contends that his sentence, imposed under a Guidelines\n\nregime      that    the        sentencing          judge   erroneously         (although\n\nunderstandably) regarded as mandatory, constitutes plain error\n\nunder the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 125\n\nS.    Ct.   738    (2005),      and    our     decision    in    United       States   v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005).                       Neither argument\n\nmerits extended discussion.\n\n            The premise of Foster's double counting argument is that\n\nboth the cross reference and the enhancement were triggered by his\n\nemailing to others images of child pornography that he previously\n\nhad received on his computer.                  But Foster's premise is faulty.\n\nApplication of the cross reference was justified not only by the\n\ndistribution       of    the    images    in   question       (which    triggered      the\n\nenhancement in U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(2)(E)); it also was justified by\n\nhis   prior   receipt      of    the     material     \"with    intent    to    traffic.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(c)(2). (Foster acknowledges as much on page 10 of\n\nhis opening brief). And there is no double counting when different\n\n                                             -2-\n\fcomponents or aspects of the relevant criminal conduct trigger\n\ndifferent Guidelines provisions which increase one's base offense\n\nlevel.    See United States v. Johnson, 221 F.3d 83, 99 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (child pornography case); see also United States v. Brown,\n\n169 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Foster's Booker argument falters on the third prong of the\n\nplain error test -- that the error affected his substantial rights.\n\nSee   Antonakopoulos,   399   F.3d       at   75   (requiring   a    “reasonable\n\nprobability” that the district court would sentence more leniently\n\non remand).   Although we are not “overly demanding as to proof of\n\n[such a] probability,” United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), nothing in the record suggests that the district\n\ncourt would give Foster a shorter sentence under the advisory\n\nGuidelines.   The sentencing judge explicitly stated that, while he\n\nthought   that   the    Guidelines        generally     \"underpunished\"      the\n\npossession of child pornography, Foster's 51-month sentence was\n\n\"appropriate\" because of the applicability of several sentence\n\nenhancements.    See United States v. Martins, ___ F.3d ___, 2005 WL\n\n1502939, at *12 (1st Cir. June 27, 2005) (where the sentencing\n\ncourt had stated that the sentence was “just,” there was no\n\nreasonable    probability     of     a    lesser     sentence       on   remand).\n\nConsequently, this is not a situation which calls for resentencing\n\nunder Antonakopoulos.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
