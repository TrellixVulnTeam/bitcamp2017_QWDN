Plaintiff-appellant Hertzl Sinai brought an\n\nemployment discrimination action against Verizon New England, Inc.\n\n(\"VNE\"), and now appeals the district court's award of summary\n\njudgment to VNE.   We affirm.\n\n          Sinai is a Jewish-American citizen, born in 1947, who\n\nimmigrated from Israel and walks with a cane.             Sinai, who has a\n\nbackground in communications systems and sales, has been applying\n\nfor jobs with various telephone companies since 1975.                   After\n\nprevailing in an employment discrimination claim for failure to\n\nhire against New England Telephone and Telegraph Company (\"NET\")\n\nmore than a decade ago, see Sinai v. New Eng. Tel. & Tel. Co., 3\n\nF.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1993)(\"Sinai I\"), Sinai has submitted numerous\n\nemployment applications to NET's successors-in-interest and their\n\nsubsidiaries whenever he saw a job advertised.            None has resulted\n\nin an employment offer.\n\n          In June 1997, Sinai applied for a sales position at a\n\nBell Atlantic Mobile store in the Kingston Mall in Kingston,\n\nMassachusetts. A year passed without a response from Bell Atlantic\n\nMobile.   In June 1998, Sinai returned to the store to renew his\n\napplication and was granted an interview.             During the interview,\n\nthe interviewer allegedly told Sinai that he \"sounded Middle\n\nEastern\" and   asked    him,   \"Are    you   Arab?\"   with   \"an   unpleasant\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fexpression on his face.\"1     Sinai was not given the job and, on July\n\n2, 1998, he filed charges alleging national origin, religion, and\n\nage   discrimination   with   the     Massachusetts    Commission   Against\n\nDiscrimination    (\"MCAD\")    and    the    Equal   Employment   Opportunity\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\").\n\n           Both administrative complaints named \"Bell Atlantic\" as\n\nthe respondent.    At the time, Bell Atlantic Mobile was a wholly\n\nowned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic Corporation,2 but the MCAD charge\n\ndid not specify which corporation Sinai intended to sue.                 The\n\naddress on the MCAD charge, \"8 Harrison Street, Kingston MA,\n\n02364,\" did not resolve the matter because there is no Harrison\n\nStreet in Kingston.3   Although Sinai amended the MCAD charge twice,\n\nonce in December 1998, and again in July 2001, he did not amend the\n\naddress.    To further confuse matters, in June 2000, a merger\n\nbetween GTE Corporation and Bell Atlantic Corporation resulted in\n\na number of name changes:           Bell Atlantic Mobile became Verizon\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      These allegations are remarkably similar to those made in\nSinai's previous, and successful, discrimination action. See Sinai\nI, 3 F.3d at 473.\n      2\n      NET was at the time also a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell\nAtlantic Corporation.\n      3\n      Sinai states that the mistake occurred when the MCAD intake\nofficer preparing the charge confused the address of the Bell\nAtlantic Mobile retail store with Bell Atlantic Corporation's main\noffice in Boston, which is on Harrison Street.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fWireless,4    NET   became       VNE,     and       both    became    wholly       owned\n\nsubsidiaries of Verizon Communications, Inc.                   The merger changed\n\nthe   names    of   these      entities       but    not    their     organizational\n\nstructures;    at   all   points      before    and    after    the    merger,      Bell\n\nAtlantic Mobile (now Verizon Wireless) and VNE were wholly owned\n\nsubsidiaries of a common parent company.5                  On May 29, 2001, almost\n\nthree years after the original filing, the MCAD charge was served\n\non VNE.\n\n             On June 29, 2001, Sinai filed this lawsuit, naming VNE as\n\nthe sole defendant. In addition to the events described above, the\n\ncomplaint sought relief for other incidents, not covered in the\n\nadministrative complaints, in which VNE refused to hire Sinai.\n\nSpecifically, Sinai complained that, between 1999 and 2001, he had\n\nrepeatedly    applied     to    VNE     for    employment      for    which    he    was\n\nqualified, without success, and that a VNE employee had once\n\nfalsely told him there were no job openings.\n\n             Sinai amended his complaint on July 9, 2001, and again on\n\nApril 22, 2002.      The second amended complaint, which followed an\n\norder by the district court to provide a more definite statement,\n\nstated claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2000e et seq.; the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42\n\n\n      4\n      Verizon Wireless is a joint venture consisting                          of    Bell\nAtlantic Mobile, GTE Wireless, and other parties.\n      5\n      After the merger, the parent company previously known as Bell\nAtlantic Corporation was renamed Verizon Communications, Inc.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fU.S.C. ยง 12111, et seq.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 623; and Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 151B.             The\n\nsecond amended complaint also added as defendants Bell Atlantic\n\nMobile,    Verizon   Yellow     Pages,   Verizon   Wireless   Services,   and\n\nVerizon     Communications        (collectively,      the     \"Bell/Verizon\n\ndefendants\").\n\n            On July 8, 2002, VNE moved for summary judgment.               On\n\nNovember   19,   2002,    the   district   court   granted    VNE's   motion,\n\nreasoning that VNE was not the proper defendant to the allegations\n\npresented in the administrative complaints and that the additional\n\nclaims against VNE had not been exhausted administratively.               The\n\ndistrict court also dismissed without prejudice the claims against\n\nthe remaining Bell/Verizon defendants for failure to timely serve\n\nthem with process.       Sinai does not challenge the dismissal of the\n\nBell/Verizon defendants.\n\n            On appeal, Sinai first argues that the district court\n\nimproperly treated Bell Atlantic Mobile/Verizon Wireless (\"Bell\n\nAtlantic Mobile\") and VNE as distinct jural entities.           He contends\n\nthat, under binding First Circuit precedent, Bell Atlantic Mobile\n\nand VNE (and, indeed, all divisions of the telephone company)\n\nshould not be differentiated from one another.           Alternatively, he\n\nasserts that his second amended complaint expressly alleged that\n\nthe various corporations were commonly controlled and/or controlled\n\neach other; that VNE had failed to provide him with discovery\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fpertinent to this allegation; and that the court's award of summary\n\njudgment despite his having brought VNE's recalcitrance to the\n\ncourt's attention was legal error.\n\n            Sinai's \"circuit-precedent\" contention is built entirely\n\nfrom the fact that, in Sinai I, Sinai apparently prevailed against\n\nsister    companies   NET   and   NYNEX    Information   Resources   Company\n\n(\"NIRC\") despite the fact that only NIRC failed to hire him.             In\n\nSinai's view, this litigation fact establishes that he can now\n\nsimilarly prevail against VNE, which has the same corporate parent\n\nas the corporate entity that failed to hire him.          This view of the\n\nlaw is specious; the issue simply did not come up in Sinai I.            The\n\nrelevant and dispositive fact is that there is no record evidence\n\nthat would justify treating VNE and Bell Atlantic Mobile (in either\n\ntheir pre- or post-merger forms) interchangeably or as a unified\n\nentity.\n\n            Sinai's alternative suggestion, that the district court\n\nerred in grounding its ruling on the absence of such evidence\n\nbecause VNE failed to provide him with relevant discovery, fails\n\nbecause Sinai did little more than assert (in his opposition to\n\nVNE's motions for summary judgment and to stay discovery) that VNE\n\nshould have provided him with unspecified documentary evidence\n\nregarding \"the internal workings of Verizon's operating companies.\"\n\nId. at 8.   To forestall a motion for summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat additional discovery is needed, a party must, inter alia, make\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f\"a proffer which, at a bare minimum, articulates a plausible basis\n\nfor   the    [party's]   belief   that   previously   undisclosed   or\n\nundocumented facts exist, that those facts can be secured by\n\nfurther discovery, and that, if obtained, there is some credible\n\nprospect that the new evidence will create a trialworthy issue.\"\n\nMassachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142\n\nF.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir. 1998) (explaining the requirements for relief\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)) (citations omitted).       Sinai made no\n\neffort to comply with this requirement, and the district court\n\nacted well within its discretion, see id., in proceeding to the\n\nmerits of VNE's motion.\n\n            Sinai next contends that the claims against VNE in his\n\nsecond amended complaint were sufficiently related to the claims\n\nset forth in the administrative complaints to not require separate\n\npresentment to an administrative agency.     As a general matter, the\n\nscope of an employment discrimination action is not strictly\n\nlimited to those acts and incidents described in the administrative\n\ncomplaint.    We have previously held that a judicial complaint may\n\n\"encompass discrete acts of retaliation reasonably related and\n\ngrowing out of the discrimination complained of to the agency.\"\n\nClockedile v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 245 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nBut even if we assume arguendo that a discrete, non-retaliatory act\n\nsuch as a failure to hire may be the subject of a lawsuit despite\n\nplaintiff's failure to amend his administrative charge or file a\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fnew charge, Sinai's claims of discrimination against VNE are not\n\nreasonably related to, nor do they grow out of, the claims against\n\nBell Atlantic Mobile described in the administrative complaints.\n\n             Sinai's administrative complaints detailed acts by Bell\n\nAtlantic Mobile, but did not once mention VNE.                  Moreover, Sinai\n\namended the charge in July 2001, but at no point referred to VNE's\n\nalleged discriminatory acts occurring between 1999 and 2001. There\n\nis no reason to believe that the alleged acts of VNE \"grew out of\"\n\nor   were   in    any   way   related    to   the   acts    described      in   the\n\nadministrative complaints, which occurred years earlier at another\n\ncompany.     We therefore agree with the district court that the\n\nclaims against VNE are \"entirely different\" from the claims set\n\nforth in the administrative charges against Bell Atlantic Mobile.\n\n             Sinai's    third   argument      is   that   the   district    court\n\nimproperly held him responsible for the error in the MCAD charge\n\nlisting     the   respondent's    address     as    \"8    Harrison   Street\"     in\n\nKingston.     On the contrary, the district court placed no blame on\n\neither party for the error.             Indeed, the address error had no\n\nbearing on the entry of summary judgment in favor of VNE.                       The\n\nargument thus lacks relevance.\n\n             Finally, Sinai asserts that the district court improperly\n\nruled on VNE's summary judgment motion without a hearing. Although\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) provides that a summary judgment motion\n\n\"shall be served at least ten days before the time fixed for the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fhearing,\" this language does not, of course, require oral argument\n\nin connection with every such motion.       Delgado-Biaggi v. Air\n\nTransp. Local 501, 112 F.3d 565, 567 & n.4 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nParties may be \"heard\" on the basis of the pleadings filed.    Id.\n\nSinai gives us no reason to believe that this matter was unsuitable\n\nfor hearing and resolution on the pleadings.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

None has resulted\n\nin an employment offer.\n\n          In June 1997, Sinai applied for a sales position at a\n\nBell Atlantic Mobile store in the Kingston Mall in Kingston,\n\nMassachusetts. A year passed without a response from Bell Atlantic\n\nMobile.   In June 1998, Sinai returned to the store to renew his\n\napplication and was granted an interview.             During the interview,\n\nthe interviewer allegedly told Sinai that he \"sounded Middle\n\nEastern\" and   asked    him,   \"Are    you   Arab?\"   with   \"an   unpleasant\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fexpression on his face.\"1     Sinai was not given the job and, on July\n\n2, 1998, he filed charges alleging national origin, religion, and\n\nage   discrimination   with   the     Massachusetts    Commission   Against\n\nDiscrimination    (\"MCAD\")    and    the    Equal   Employment   Opportunity\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\").\n\n           Both administrative complaints named \"Bell Atlantic\" as\n\nthe respondent.    At the time, Bell Atlantic Mobile was a wholly\n\nowned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic Corporation,2 but the MCAD charge\n\ndid not specify which corporation Sinai intended to sue.                 The\n\naddress on the MCAD charge, \"8 Harrison Street, Kingston MA,\n\n02364,\" did not resolve the matter because there is no Harrison\n\nStreet in Kingston.3   Although Sinai amended the MCAD charge twice,\n\nonce in December 1998, and again in July 2001, he did not amend the\n\naddress.    To further confuse matters, in June 2000, a merger\n\nbetween GTE Corporation and Bell Atlantic Corporation resulted in\n\na number of name changes:           Bell Atlantic Mobile became Verizon\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      These allegations are remarkably similar to those made in\nSinai's previous, and successful, discrimination action. See Sinai\nI, 3 F.3d at 473.\n      2\n      NET was at the time also a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell\nAtlantic Corporation.\n      3\n      Sinai states that the mistake occurred when the MCAD intake\nofficer preparing the charge confused the address of the Bell\nAtlantic Mobile retail store with Bell Atlantic Corporation's main\noffice in Boston, which is on Harrison Street.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fWireless,4    NET   became       VNE,     and       both    became    wholly       owned\n\nsubsidiaries of Verizon Communications, Inc.                   The merger changed\n\nthe   names    of   these      entities       but    not    their     organizational\n\nstructures;    at   all   points      before    and    after    the    merger,      Bell\n\nAtlantic Mobile (now Verizon Wireless) and VNE were wholly owned\n\nsubsidiaries of a common parent company.5                  On May 29, 2001, almost\n\nthree years after the original filing, the MCAD charge was served\n\non VNE.\n\n             On June 29, 2001, Sinai filed this lawsuit, naming VNE as\n\nthe sole defendant. In addition to the events described above, the\n\ncomplaint sought relief for other incidents, not covered in the\n\nadministrative complaints, in which VNE refused to hire Sinai.\n\nSpecifically, Sinai complained that, between 1999 and 2001, he had\n\nrepeatedly    applied     to    VNE     for    employment      for    which    he    was\n\nqualified, without success, and that a VNE employee had once\n\nfalsely told him there were no job openings.\n\n             Sinai amended his complaint on July 9, 2001, and again on\n\nApril 22, 2002.      The second amended complaint, which followed an\n\norder by the district court to provide a more definite statement,\n\nstated claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2000e et seq.; the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42\n\n\n      4\n      Verizon Wireless is a joint venture consisting                          of    Bell\nAtlantic Mobile, GTE Wireless, and other parties.\n      5\n      After the merger, the parent company previously known as Bell\nAtlantic Corporation was renamed Verizon Communications, Inc.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fU.S.C. ยง 12111, et seq.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 623; and Mass.

The\n\nsecond amended complaint also added as defendants Bell Atlantic\n\nMobile,    Verizon   Yellow     Pages,   Verizon   Wireless   Services,   and\n\nVerizon     Communications        (collectively,      the     \"Bell/Verizon\n\ndefendants\").\n\n            On July 8, 2002, VNE moved for summary judgment.               On\n\nNovember   19,   2002,    the   district   court   granted    VNE's   motion,\n\nreasoning that VNE was not the proper defendant to the allegations\n\npresented in the administrative complaints and that the additional\n\nclaims against VNE had not been exhausted administratively.               The\n\ndistrict court also dismissed without prejudice the claims against\n\nthe remaining Bell/Verizon defendants for failure to timely serve\n\nthem with process.       Sinai does not challenge the dismissal of the\n\nBell/Verizon defendants.\n\n            On appeal, Sinai first argues that the district court\n\nimproperly treated Bell Atlantic Mobile/Verizon Wireless (\"Bell\n\nAtlantic Mobile\") and VNE as distinct jural entities.           He contends\n\nthat, under binding First Circuit precedent, Bell Atlantic Mobile\n\nand VNE (and, indeed, all divisions of the telephone company)\n\nshould not be differentiated from one another.           Alternatively, he\n\nasserts that his second amended complaint expressly alleged that\n\nthe various corporations were commonly controlled and/or controlled\n\neach other; that VNE had failed to provide him with discovery\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fpertinent to this allegation; and that the court's award of summary\n\njudgment despite his having brought VNE's recalcitrance to the\n\ncourt's attention was legal error.\n\n            Sinai's \"circuit-precedent\" contention is built entirely\n\nfrom the fact that, in Sinai I, Sinai apparently prevailed against\n\nsister    companies   NET   and   NYNEX    Information   Resources   Company\n\n(\"NIRC\") despite the fact that only NIRC failed to hire him.             In\n\nSinai's view, this litigation fact establishes that he can now\n\nsimilarly prevail against VNE, which has the same corporate parent\n\nas the corporate entity that failed to hire him.          This view of the\n\nlaw is specious; the issue simply did not come up in Sinai I.            The\n\nrelevant and dispositive fact is that there is no record evidence\n\nthat would justify treating VNE and Bell Atlantic Mobile (in either\n\ntheir pre- or post-merger forms) interchangeably or as a unified\n\nentity.\n\n            Sinai's alternative suggestion, that the district court\n\nerred in grounding its ruling on the absence of such evidence\n\nbecause VNE failed to provide him with relevant discovery, fails\n\nbecause Sinai did little more than assert (in his opposition to\n\nVNE's motions for summary judgment and to stay discovery) that VNE\n\nshould have provided him with unspecified documentary evidence\n\nregarding \"the internal workings of Verizon's operating companies.\"\n\nId. at 8.   To forestall a motion for summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat additional discovery is needed, a party must, inter alia, make\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f\"a proffer which, at a bare minimum, articulates a plausible basis\n\nfor   the    [party's]   belief   that   previously   undisclosed   or\n\nundocumented facts exist, that those facts can be secured by\n\nfurther discovery, and that, if obtained, there is some credible\n\nprospect that the new evidence will create a trialworthy issue.\"\n\nMassachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v.

Sinai made no\n\neffort to comply with this requirement, and the district court\n\nacted well within its discretion, see id., in proceeding to the\n\nmerits of VNE's motion.\n\n            Sinai next contends that the claims against VNE in his\n\nsecond amended complaint were sufficiently related to the claims\n\nset forth in the administrative complaints to not require separate\n\npresentment to an administrative agency.     As a general matter, the\n\nscope of an employment discrimination action is not strictly\n\nlimited to those acts and incidents described in the administrative\n\ncomplaint.    We have previously held that a judicial complaint may\n\n\"encompass discrete acts of retaliation reasonably related and\n\ngrowing out of the discrimination complained of to the agency.\"\n\nClockedile v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199340\"><a href=\"/opinion/199340/clockedile-v-nh-dept-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nBut even if we assume arguendo that a discrete, non-retaliatory act\n\nsuch as a failure to hire may be the subject of a lawsuit despite\n\nplaintiff's failure to amend his administrative charge or file a\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fnew charge, Sinai's claims of discrimination against VNE are not\n\nreasonably related to, nor do they grow out of, the claims against\n\nBell Atlantic Mobile described in the administrative complaints.\n\n             Sinai's administrative complaints detailed acts by Bell\n\nAtlantic Mobile, but did not once mention VNE.                  Moreover, Sinai\n\namended the charge in July 2001, but at no point referred to VNE's\n\nalleged discriminatory acts occurring between 1999 and 2001. There\n\nis no reason to believe that the alleged acts of VNE \"grew out of\"\n\nor   were   in    any   way   related    to   the   acts    described      in   the\n\nadministrative complaints, which occurred years earlier at another\n\ncompany.     We therefore agree with the district court that the\n\nclaims against VNE are \"entirely different\" from the claims set\n\nforth in the administrative charges against Bell Atlantic Mobile.\n\n             Sinai's    third   argument      is   that   the   district    court\n\nimproperly held him responsible for the error in the MCAD charge\n\nlisting     the   respondent's    address     as    \"8    Harrison   Street\"     in\n\nKingston.     On the contrary, the district court placed no blame on\n\neither party for the error.             Indeed, the address error had no\n\nbearing on the entry of summary judgment in favor of VNE.                       The\n\nargument thus lacks relevance.\n\n             Finally, Sinai asserts that the district court improperly\n\nruled on VNE's summary judgment motion without a hearing. Although\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) provides that a summary judgment motion\n\n\"shall be served at least ten days before the time fixed for the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fhearing,\" this language does not, of course, require oral argument\n\nin connection with every such motion.
