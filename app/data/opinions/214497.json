JANOSKO,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. George A. O'Toole, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                   Souter, Associate Justice,*\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Syrie D. Fried for the appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nCarmen M. Ortiz, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 12, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SOUTER, Associate Justice.          While the defendant, Francis\n\nG. Janosko, was incarcerated in Massachusetts at the Plymouth\n\nCounty Correctional Facility in late 2006 and early 2007, he was\n\nallowed to use a computer system provided to inmates for legal\n\nresearch.      Although the equipment was set up to confine access\n\nsolely to legal materials, Janosko managed to circumvent the limits\n\nand, among other havoc, gain entrance for himself and others into\n\nthe Facility’s personnel files, which contained Social Security\n\nnumbers   of   some    1,100   current   and    prior   employees    and   other\n\npersonal information about them.          The ensuing indictment included\n\ncharges of causing damage to a protected computer, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1030(a)(5)(A)(i), thereby causing loss to one or more persons, id.\n\n§ 1030(a)(5)(B)(i), and damage affecting a computer system used in\n\nthe administration of justice, id. § 1030(a)(5)(B)(v).                 Janosko\n\npleaded   guilty      under    an   agreement   that    left   any   amount   of\n\nrestitution to be determined by the court, which awarded the county\n\n$4,309 for the cost of purchasing elements of the system needed to\n\nreplace those damaged by Janosko and retained as evidence, and\n\n$6,600 for the cost of monitoring credit records of the individuals\n\nwho suffered the privacy violations and consequent risk of identity\n\ntheft.\n\n            Janosko objected to the order to reimburse for the credit\n\nenquiries, arguing that they did not proximately result from the\n\nacts of damaging the computer and computer system.             Before us, the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdefendant adds the further objection that the government failed to\n\nshow that the credit checks were made close enough in time to the\n\ndestructive conduct to qualify for restitution.                       We find the\n\nobjections meritless.1\n\n               Janosko is entirely correct that the cost of the credit\n\nmonitoring is not what the statute defining the crimes calls\n\n“damage . . . to a protected computer,” § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i), or\n\n“damage affecting a computer system,” § 1030(a)(5)(B)(v).2                      But\n\nJanosko pleaded guilty not only to causing such “damage” but also\n\nto causing “loss” by his damaging conduct, § 1030(a)(5)(B)(i). The\n\nnear juxtaposition of “loss” to “damage” inflicted on items or\n\nsystems of equipment indicates some broader concept of forbidden\n\neffect and consequent scope of restitution.\n\n               In fact, 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11) defines loss to include\n\n“any       reasonable    cost   to    any    victim,   including   the   cost     of\n\nresponding to an offense” in addition to the cost of damage\n\nassessment, restoration of the damaged system and consequential\n\ndamage like lost revenue.               By thus exemplifying “loss” as an\n\nelement       of   one   of   the    offenses     charged   against    Janosko,    a\n\n\n       1\n      We review orders of restitution for abuse of discretion, but\napply de novo review to legal questions associated with restitution\norders. See United States v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d 286, 293 (1st\nCir. 2008).\n       2\n      The statute has been amended since the period of the offenses\nby the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008, Pub.\nL. No. 110-326, § 204, 122 Stat. 3560, 3561-62. References are to\nthe text before the 2008 changes.\n\n                                            -3-\n\f“reasonable cost . . . of responding” goes hand in hand with the\n\nterms   of    the   restitution     statute.         The     Mandatory    Victims\n\nRestitution Act mandates restitution to the victim (here, without\n\ndispute, at least the county) “in any case . . . [for] expenses\n\nincurred during . . . the investigation or prosecution of the\n\noffense.”     18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(4).         While “expenses” qualifying\n\nfor restitution are not unlimited, like the notion of response\n\nunder § 1030(e)(11), they will pass muster if they would not have\n\nbeen incurred in the absence of the offense, Hughey v. United\n\nStates, 495 U.S. 411, 416-18 (1990); United States v. Cutter, 313\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002), were “not too attenuated” in fact or\n\ntime from the crime, United States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 590\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\n\nAnonymous    Defendant,   629     F.3d   68   (1st    Cir.    2010),     and   were\n\nreasonably foreseeable, United States v. Collins, 209 F.3d, 1, 3-4\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).      The cost of the credit check qualified under\n\nthese criteria as a reasonable expense, cost of response, and thus\n\ncompensable loss.\n\n             It should go without saying that an employer whose\n\npersonnel records have been exposed to potential identity thieves\n\nresponds reasonably when it makes enquiry to see whether its\n\nemployees have been defrauded.             This act of responsibility is\n\nforeseeable to the same degree that indifference to employees’\n\npotential victimization would be reproachable.                  It is true, of\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcourse, that once they were told of the security breach, the\n\nindividual employees and former workers involved in this case could\n\nthemselves have made credit enquiries to uncover any fraud, but\n\nthis in no way diminishes the reasonableness of the Facility's\n\ninvestigation prompted by the risk that its security failure\n\ncreated. And quite aside from decency to its workers, any employer\n\nwould reasonably wish to know the full extent of criminality when\n\nreporting the facts to law enforcement authorities.\n\n          Nor do we see anything helpful to Janosko in his argument\n\nthat the government failed to present evidence that the credit\n\ncheck was reasonably timely, as Vaknin held it must be.   112 F.3d\n\nat 589.   It is quite true that the prosecution ignored this point\n\nwhen the court was considering restitution, but so did Janosko, who\n\napparently never raised an issue of timeliness until filing the\n\nbrief in this Court.     While we will assume the government is\n\ncorrect that the standard of review should consequently be for\n\nplain error only, the standard of review almost certainly makes no\n\ndifference here, for we think that any enquiry into the credit\n\nrecords prior to negotiation of the plea in this case would have\n\nbeen timely for at least one purpose.      Regardless whether the\n\nemployees were “victims” under the statute and thus entitled to\n\nmandatory restitution, see § 3663A(a)(2) (defining “victim” as “a\n\nperson directly and proximately harmed”); United States v. Millot,\n\n433 F.3d 1057, 1061 (8th Cir. 2006) (§ 1030 “does not restrict\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fconsideration of losses to only the person who owns the computer\n\nsystem”), a plea agreement may provide for restitution to anyone\n\nharmed even if not technically a victim, § 3663A(a)(3).         An\n\nemployer-victim contemplating the resolution of a charge like the\n\none here could be expected to press the prosecutor to demand any\n\nterms that would be necessary to make the members of the employer's\n\nworkforce whole, and a credit check even up to the moment of a plea\n\nagreement would therefore be timely.3\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n     When the case was argued, neither lawyer knew when the county\nhad made the credit check.        Subsequently, counsel for the\ngovernment provided the date in a letter to the Court.       Being\noutside the record, the information is not considered here, though\nit does confirm the relevance of our reasoning to the case before\nus.\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

Millot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792881\"><a href=\"/opinion/792881/united-states-v-thomas-s-millot/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span>, 1061 (8th Cir.2006) (§ 1030 \"does not restrict consideration of losses to only the person who owns the computer system\"), a plea agreement may provide for restitution to anyone harmed even if not technically a victim, § 3663A(a)(3). An employer-victim contemplating the resolution of a charge like the one here could be expected to press the prosecutor to demand any terms that would be necessary to make the members of the employer's workforce whole, and a credit check even up to the moment of a plea agreement would therefore be timely.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We review orders of restitution for abuse of discretion, but apply <i>de novo</i> review to legal questions associated with restitution orders. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Innarelli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203270\"><a href=\"/opinion/203270/united-states-v-innarelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 293 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[2]  The statute has been amended since the period of the offenses by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-326, § 204, 122 Stat. 3560, 3561-62. References are to the text before the 2008 changes.</p>\n<p>[3]  When the case was argued, neither lawyer knew when the county had made the credit check. Subsequently, counsel for the government provided the date in a letter to the Court. Being outside the record, the information is not considered here, though it does confirm the relevance of our reasoning to the case before us.</p>\n\n</div>",
