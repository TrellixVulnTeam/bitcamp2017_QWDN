In this appeal, we consider\n\nPlaintiff's claim against the United States under the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act.   The district court found that it did not have subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction because Plaintiff's claim accrued more than two\n\nyears before she filed her administrative complaint and that the\n\ndoctrine of fraudulent concealment did not toll this requirement.\n\nPlaintiff contests these findings of the district court.        We\n\naffirm.\n\n                          I.   Background\n\n          Mary Jane Callahan (\"Plaintiff\"), individually and as\n\nadministratrix of the estate of John B. Callahan (\"Callahan\"), and\n\nmembers of her family filed suit for wrongful death and emotional\n\ndistress arising from the murder of her husband.       The suit is\n\nfounded in a long and sordid history between Boston FBI agents and\n\nthe Winter Hill Gang, an organized crime syndicate in Boston.\n\nDefendants are the United States and individuals who were once\n\nmembers of the FBI, the Winter Hill Gang, or both.    This corrupt\n\nrelationship produced many unfortunate victims, several of whom\n\nhave already sought relief in the federal courts.    See generally\n\nMcIntyre v. United States, 367 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 2004); United\n\nStates v. Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141 (D. Mass. 1999), rev'd in\n\npart, sub nom., United States v. Flemmi, 225 F.3d 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f              This     appeal      concerns     only    Plaintiff's       claim      as\n\nadministratrix of Callahan's estate against the United States. The\n\ndistrict court dismissed all claims by individual plaintiffs for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction for their failure to file an\n\nadministrative claim.           Callahan v. United States, 337 F. Supp. 2d\n\n348, 350 n.1 (D. Mass. 2004).                In an order dated September 28,\n\n2004,   the    district     court     also     dismissed      all    claims    against\n\nindividual defendants for expiration of the statute of limitations\n\nor   want     of     prosecution.       Plaintiff      does    not    appeal     those\n\ndismissals.\n\n              The claim against the United States is through the\n\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), under which the United States\n\nconsents to suits against it in tort.                  28 U.S.C. § 1346(b); 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2671-2680.        One condition of the FTCA is that a plaintiff\n\nmust file an administrative claim within two years of the accrual\n\nof her claim.          Id. § 2401(b).          Below, the government did not\n\ndispute     the      Plaintiff's     jurisdictional      allegations,         and   the\n\ndistrict court accepted Plaintiff's allegations as true.                            Even\n\naccepting     the     Plaintiff's     allegations      as     true,   however,      the\n\ndistrict court found that her claim accrued more than two years\n\nbefore she filed her administrative complaint.                      The court below\n\nthus dismissed the remaining claim for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction.        Callahan, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 370.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            We present a summary of the factual events surrounding\n\nCallahan's murder as alleged by the Plaintiff and supplemented by\n\nuncontested facts from news reports and court documents.                   See\n\nValentín v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 363 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nA.   The Winter Hill Gang and the FBI\n\n            The Winter Hill Gang was the name for the dominant\n\norganized crime syndicate in the Boston area in the 1970s and\n\n1980s.   The Gang's activities included murder, bribery, extortion,\n\nloan   sharking,   and     illegal   gambling.      James   \"Whitey\"   Bulger\n\n(\"Bulger\") and Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi (\"Flemmi\") were two\n\nprominent members of the Gang.\n\n            In 1967, FBI Agent H. Paul Rico (\"Rico\") recruited Flemmi\n\nas an FBI informant.        In 1976, Agent John Connolly (\"Connolly\")\n\nrecruited    Bulger   as   an   informant.       Connolly   and   Bulger   were\n\nchildhood neighbors in South Boston.         Eventually, both Bulger and\n\nFlemmi were promoted to the status of \"Top Echelon\" informant. The\n\nWinter Hill Gang's main rival in crime was the Boston branch of La\n\nCosa Nostra, another organized crime syndicate.             The FBI wanted to\n\nbring down La Cosa Nostra and Bulger and Flemmi were very pleased\n\nto help it do so.\n\n            This convenient relationship eventually took a turn for\n\nthe worse.     While they were informants, Bulger and Flemmi were\n\nresponsible for multiple murders, including those of Roger Wheeler,\n\nBrian Halloran, and Callahan, to be discussed below.                 The FBI,\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fintent on keeping its informants happy, turned a blind eye to their\n\ncrimes   and   failed   to   follow    FBI    guidelines   for   dealing    with\n\ninformants.      For    example,      FBI    agents   interfered    with     the\n\ninvestigation of Bulger and Flemmi for the murder of Callahan by\n\npreventing Oklahoma FBI agents from interviewing them.                The FBI\n\nalso informed Bulger and Flemmi of a \"bugged\" location to prevent\n\nthem from incriminating themselves.           At the same time, Bulger and\n\nFlemmi ingratiated themselves to the FBI by assisting the agents.\n\nFor   example,   when    FBI   Agent    John     Morris    (\"Morris\"),     Agent\n\nConnolly's supervisor, was in Georgia for training and he wanted\n\nhis secretary to fly to meet him for a romantic tryst, Bulger and\n\nFlemmi paid for her plane ticket.            This cozy relationship created\n\na protective shield around Bulger and Flemmi that emboldened them\n\nin their criminal activities -- so much so that at one point Flemmi\n\nstated that the FBI gave Bulger and him free reign to commit any\n\ncrime short of murder.\n\n           Eventually, this cozy relationship between the FBI and\n\nBulger and Flemmi broke down when more reputable law enforcement\n\nagents charged Bulger and Flemmi with numerous crimes.                     Agent\n\nConnolly tipped off Bulger, who, to this day, is in hiding from law\n\nenforcement authorities. Agent Morris was granted immunity for his\n\ntestimony, and he testified against Flemmi.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fB.   Callahan's Death\n\n           Callahan was chief executive officer of a business called\n\nWorld Jai Alai (\"WJA\"), owned by one Roger Wheeler (\"Wheeler\").\n\nWJA operated \"frontons\" where customers could place bets on the\n\noutcome of jai alai matches.   In an unusual coincidence, Callahan\n\nhired Rico, now retired from the FBI and the one who had recruited\n\nFlemmi as an FBI informant, as head of security for WJA.     Around\n\n1981, Callahan learned that individuals were skimming profits from\n\nWJA.   He was concerned and reported his suspicions to Wheeler.1   In\n\nresponse, Wheeler began an audit of WJA.    To prevent Wheeler from\n\ndiscovering their profit skimming, Bulger and Flemmi wanted Wheeler\n\nkilled.   At their direction, John Martorano (\"Martorano\"), another\n\nmember of the Winter Hill Gang, murdered Wheeler in May 1981.\n\n           In January 1982, one Brian Halloran (\"Halloran\") began\n\ncooperating with the FBI while being prosecuted for an unrelated\n\nmurder.   He told the FBI that Bulger, Flemmi, and Callahan had\n\nasked him to murder Wheeler but that he had declined the offer.2\n\n\n1\n    Plaintiff stated rather cryptically in her complaint that\n\"[c]omplaints of this activity fell on deaf ears.\" From this we\npresume that Callahan complained to Wheeler even though other\nsources portray Callahan less innocently.        See Salemme, 91\nF. Supp. 2d at 208-09 (\"Wheeler suspected that Callahan was\nskimming money from World Jai Lai for members of the Winter Hill\nGang, including Halloran, Bulger, and Flemmi.      Thus, he fired\nCallahan . . . and began an audit.\") (internal citations omitted).\n2\n   Plaintiff does not admit that Callahan partook in any illegal\nactivity or had any involvement with the Winter Hill Gang. Agent\nMorris did not believe Halloran's implication of Bulger and Flemmi\nand thought Halloran was lying. We will presume that Halloran was\n\n                                -6-\n\fHalloran also stated that Bulger, Flemmi, Callahan, and Martorano\n\nwere ultimately responsible for Wheeler's murder.     Agent Morris\n\nrelayed this information to Agent Connolly, who in turn informed\n\nBulger and Flemmi.   In May 1982, Bulger and Flemmi had Halloran\n\nkilled to prevent his further cooperation with law enforcement\n\nauthorities.\n\n          In August 1982, Callahan's body was found in the trunk of\n\na car at the Miami airport.   Plaintiff makes two allegations as to\n\na direct connection between the FBI and Callahan's death.3     The\n\nfirst is from Plaintiff's complaint in this suit, and the second is\n\nfrom her administrative complaint.\n\n          The first allegation is that the FBI's investigation of\n\nthe Wheeler murder eventually turned to Callahan.      Around June\n\n1982, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that Callahan was under\n\ninvestigation.   Although it is not clear how Callahan could have\n\nany incriminating information about the Wheeler murder, Bulger and\n\nFlemmi directed Martorano to kill Callahan to prevent him from\n\ncooperating with law enforcement authorities.\n\n          The second allegation is that Callahan told Rico that he\n\nfeared that Wheeler's death was related to Wheeler's knowledge of\n\nthe profit skimming at WJA.   Rico told this to Morris and Connolly\n\n\n\nlying and that Callahan was an upstanding citizen.\n3\n   Both contentions are nothing more than conclusory allegations\nwith no support in the record.\n\n                                -7-\n\fwho in turn told Bulger and Flemmi.             Bulger and Flemmi directed\n\nMartorano   to   kill    Callahan     because    he   knew   of   their   profit\n\nskimming.\n\nC.   News Reports of FBI Misconduct\n\n            As   early   as   March   1996,     Boston   newspapers   reported\n\npossible FBI complicity in the Callahan murder.                   A March 1996\n\narticle reported that Callahan, Bulger, and Flemmi had asked\n\nHalloran to kill Wheeler; Callahan told Halloran that Martorano had\n\nkilled Wheeler with Flemmi's help; investigators were probing\n\nwhether the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders were related;\n\nand \"sources and published reports have long said that Bulger was\n\nan informant for the FBI.\"          Ralph Ranalli, The Jai Alai Murders,\n\nBoston Herald, Mar. 10-11, 1996.         A July 1997 article stated that\n\nthe FBI kept using Bulger and Flemmi as informants even though they\n\nwere suspects in the murders of Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan.\n\nRalph Ranalli, FBI Used Whitey Despite his Ties to Three Murders,\n\nBoston Herald, July 7, 1997. A December 1997 article reported that\n\nfederal court hearings will \"probe whether FBI agents and federal\n\norganized crime prosecutors violated any federal laws or guidelines\n\nin the way they handled informants\" like Bulger and Flemmi, and\n\nthat Florida police investigating the Callahan murder are \"hoping\n\n[the] hearings . . . will lead to a break in the case.\"                   Ralph\n\nRanalli, Police Reopen Mob Murder Probe, Boston Herald, Dec. 15,\n\n1997.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           National    television       broadcasts      reported      similar\n\ninformation.    On    March    15,   1998,   the   broadcast   \"CNN   Impact\"\n\nreported that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI informants and that\n\npossible connections existed between Bulger and Flemmi and the\n\nmurders of Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan.           On May 10, 1998, the\n\ntelevision program \"60 Minutes\" reported that Flemmi stated that\n\nthe FBI gave Bulger and him \"free reign to commit just about any\n\ncrime.\"   The broadcast also referred to the Callahan murder and\n\nstated that the FBI might \"have allowed [Bulger and Flemmi] to get\n\naway with murder.\"\n\nD.   Agent Morris's 1998 Testimony\n\n           Agent Morris testified in April 1998 that the FBI had\n\ninformed Bulger and Flemmi that Halloran was implicating them in\n\nWheeler's murder and that he believed that Bulger and Flemmi may\n\nhave killed Halloran.         Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 209.           Agent\n\nMorris also testified that he informed Bulger and Flemmi of a\n\nlocation bugged by Massachusetts State Police to prevent them from\n\nincriminating themselves.       Id. at 202.    Boston newspapers reported\n\nhis sensational testimony.       See Shelley Murphy, Worst Fears Came\n\nTrue as Informant Lost Race for his Life, Boston Globe, Apr. 23,\n\n1998; Ralph Ranalli, Ex-FBI Honcho: Agent Tipped Mobsters on\n\nStoolie, Boston Herald, Apr. 23, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fE.   Martorano's Plea Agreement\n\n           Long before Martorano agreed to plead guilty to a score\n\nof murders, Boston newspapers reported that Martorano was a suspect\n\nin the Callahan murder and that a possible plea bargain was in the\n\nworks   between    Martorano   and   federal   prosecutors.   See   Ralph\n\nRanalli, Gangster's Mob Testimony Held up by Agency Fighting,\n\nBoston Herald, Nov. 16, 1998; Ralph Ranalli, States Close in on\n\nDeal to Hear Mobster, Boston Herald, Feb. 4, 1999; Andrea Estes &\n\nRalph Ranalli, Reputed Mobster on Verge of Plea-Bargain Deal,\n\nBoston Herald, May 13, 1999.\n\n           On September 9, 1999, portions of Martorano's agreement\n\nto plead guilty to a number of murders, including the Callahan\n\nmurder, were made public.4      Boston newspapers heavily reported the\n\nplea agreement, including that he would plead guilty to the murder\n\nof Callahan.      A September 12 article also reported that Martorano\n\nwould implicate Bulger and Flemmi, even though this portion of the\n\nplea agreement remained sealed.         Andrea Estes, Outraged Hit Man\n\nTurned Rat for Revenge, Boston Herald, Sept. 12, 1999.         The same\n\narticle quoted Mrs. Callahan as trying to forgive Martorano for\n\nkilling Callahan.      Id.   The article also stated that Wheeler had\n\n\"suspected the Winter Hill Gang was skimming profits\" from his\n\ncompany and that \"Martorano believes the FBI told Flemmi and Bulger\n\n\n4\n   The portion that remained sealed listed individuals Martorano\nwould testify against in exchange for his plea.

See also Andrea Estes, Notorious\n\nMobster Strikes Plea bargain with Feds, Boston Herald, Sept. 9,\n\n1999 (reporting that Martorano agreed to plead guilty to the murder\n\nof Callahan and that \"Callahan . . . helped Bulger and Flemmi\n\norchestrate Wheeler's murder and had to be killed to prevent him\n\nfrom squealing\"); Andrea Estes, Murderous Rats Mobster Ties Bulger,\n\nFlemmi to Murders, Boston Herald, Sept. 10, 1999 (\"[Martorano] will\n\n. . . accuse [Bulger and Flemmi] of ordering the murder of John\n\nCallahan . . . .\"); Shelley Murphy, US Attorney Defends Deal with\n\nHit Man, Boston Globe, Sept. 10, 1999 (reporting that Martorano\n\nwould \"plead guilty to the murder of Callahan\").\n\n            On September 30, 1999, Martorano admitted to the murders\n\nof ten persons, not including Wheeler and Callahan, in federal\n\ncourt.   Boston newspapers reported this event and also noted that\n\nMartorano would later plead guilty to the murders of Wheeler and\n\nCallahan.    Andrea Estes, Hitman Cops to Killings in Squeal Deal,\n\nBoston Herald, Oct. 1, 1999.\n\n            On March 20, 2001, Martorano pleaded guilty in Florida\n\nstate court to murdering Callahan.\n\nF.   Judge Wolf's Opinion in United States v. Salemme\n\n            On September 15, 1999, Judge Wolf issued his opinion in\n\nUnited   States   v.   Salemme,   detailing   the   corrupt   relationship\n\nbetween Bulger, Flemmi, and the FBI. Of particular relevance here,\n\nthe opinion contained a section titled \"The Wheeler, Halloran, and\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fCallahan    Murders\"     where       Judge      Wolf    discussed    the    connections\n\nbetween    the   three      murders,       Bulger      and   Flemmi,      and   the     FBI.\n\nSalemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 208-13.                 For example, he noted how FBI\n\nagents    protected     Bulger       and    Flemmi      from   prosecution        for      the\n\nCallahan murder by preventing Oklahoma FBI agents from interviewing\n\nthem.     Id. at 211-13.        In addition, he discussed how Bulger and\n\nFlemmi paid for Agent Morris's secretary to fly to meet Morris for\n\na romantic tryst.           Id. at 210.          Boston newspapers reported the\n\nsensational details the next day.

FBI's Interactions with Plaintiff\n\n            Soon   after       the    murder      of    Callahan,    FBI    agents         met\n\nPlaintiff    and     told    her     that       Callahan's       murder    \"was      not    a\n\nprofessional     hit\"    and    that       he   was     \"probably   killed      by    Cuban\n\ngangsters.\"      Several times between 1982 and 2001, when Martorano\n\npleaded guilty to the murder of Callahan, Plaintiff asked FBI\n\nagents about the murder of Callahan, and FBI agents refused to tell\n\nher anything.\n\n            On August 30, 1999, Plaintiff met with FBI agents at the\n\nagents' request.        The agents told her of a possible plea agreement\n\nwith the man who murdered Callahan, but they refused to state his\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fname.   Plaintiff specifically asked FBI agents \"whether certain\n\nnewspaper accounts involving [Callahan's murder] and John Martarano\n\n[sic] were true,\" and the agents responded that she \"should not\n\nrely on newspaper accounts\" and that \"the reports were inaccurate.\"\n\nH.   Plaintiff's Administrative Complaint\n\n           On   May   14,   2002,   Plaintiff   filed   an   administrative\n\ncomplaint with the FBI on behalf of Callahan's estate claiming\n\n           in April of 2001, one John Martorano admitted\n           to killing Callahan. Claimant then learned\n           that Martorano was hired to kill her husband\n           on behalf of [Bulger and Flemmi]. Bulger and\n           Flemmi learned that the victim had information\n           that they were \"skimming\" profits from World\n           Jai Alai in Miami. Bulger and Flemmi learned\n           this from H. Paul Rico . . . .             The\n           information was passed from Rico to FBI agents\n           Morris and Connolly who in turn alerted Bulger\n           and Flemmi.\n\n                      II.   Accrual under the FTCA\n\n           \"It is 'elementary' that the United States, as sovereign,\n\nis immune from suit unless it has consented to be sued.\"          Skwira v.\n\nUnited States, 344 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing United\n\nStates v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980)). \"Moreover, a waiver\n\nof the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed,\n\nin terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\"            Lane v. Peña,\n\n518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996).           The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)\n\nwaives sovereign immunity by giving consent to suits \"for injury or\n\nloss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the\n\nnegligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fGovernment   while     acting   within    the   scope   of   his   office   or\n\nemployment.\"    28 U.S.C. § 1346(b); 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671-2680.                One\n\ncondition of this waiver is that a claim \"shall be forever barred\n\nunless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency\n\nwithin two years after such claim accrues.\"         Id. § 2401(b).     \"[T]he\n\ngeneral rule under the [FTCA is] that a tort claim accrues at the\n\ntime of the plaintiff's injury.\"          United States v. Kubrick, 444\n\nU.S. 111, 120 (1979).\n\nA.    Discovery Rule\n\n            In Kubrick, the Supreme Court recognized a discovery rule\n\nfor medical malpractice claims under the FTCA.          Id. at 113.     Under\n\nthe discovery rule, the plaintiff's claim accrues when she \"knows\n\nboth the existence and the cause of [her] injury.\"             Id.    We have\n\npreviously considered the Supreme Court's reasoning in Kubrick and\n\napplied the discovery rule to claims under the FTCA involving\n\ntheft, Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 778-79 (1st Cir.\n\n1992), and wrongful death, Skwira, 344 F.3d at 75.                 For claims\n\nother than medical malpractice, we apply a more forgiving rule\n\nbecause \"the identity of the individual(s) responsible for an\n\ninjury may be less evident.\"             Id. at 77.      In such cases, a\n\nplaintiff's claim accrues only when she also knows \"that there is\n\na causal connection between the government and her injury.\" Id. at\n\n78.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f            The \"knowledge\" standard under the discovery rule has two\n\nqualifications.      First, \"something less than definitive knowledge\n\nis required.\"       Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78.           Accrual is triggered by\n\n\"the discovery of sufficient facts about the injury and its cause\n\nto    prompt   a    reasonable   person       to    inquire    and      seek   advice\n\npreliminary    to    deciding    if    there     is   a   basis   for     filing   an\n\nadministrative claim against the government.\"                     Id.     Second, a\n\nplaintiff is charged with knowledge of facts which \"in the exercise\n\nof reasonable diligence [she] should have discovered.\" González v.\n\nUnited States, 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002).                        This is an\n\nobjective standard.       Id.\n\n            Plaintiff filed an administrative claim with the FBI on\n\nMay 14, 2002.       The United States argues that her suit is barred\n\nbecause her claim accrued more than two years before this date.                    We\n\nmust therefore determine (1) what facts relevant to her claim\n\nPlaintiff knew or should have known, and (2) whether Plaintiff had\n\nsufficient facts about the existence of her injury (that Callahan\n\nwas killed), the cause of her injury (that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nCallahan killed), and a causal connection between her injury and\n\nthe   government     to   prompt      her   to     \"inquire    and      seek   advice\n\npreliminary    to    deciding    if    there     is   a   basis   for     filing   an\n\nadministrative claim against the government.\"                 Skwira, 344 F.3d at\n\n78.    Plaintiff clearly knew of her injuries soon after Callahan's\n\ndeath.   Thus, we must determine the facts relevant to showing that\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fBulger   and   Flemmi       had   Callahan     killed    and   showing   that   the\n\ngovernment was causally connected to the murder.\n\n           The dismissal of the complaint in this case was not based\n\non what facts Plaintiff actually knew.                Rather, the district court\n\nconcluded,     in   light    of   a   variety    of    uncontested   facts,     that\n\nPlaintiff should have known of her claim by October 1, 1999.                  Here,\n\nas below, the facts themselves are not at issue.               We determine only\n\nwhether the judge was correct to conclude, as a matter of law, that\n\nthe court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff\n\nobjectively should have known of her claim by October 1, 1999.\n\nWhile review of Rule 12(b)(1) dismissals requires deference to a\n\njudge's factual findings, our review of this case, which involves\n\nonly a question of law, is de novo.               Valentín, 254 F.3d at 363.\n\nSee also Skwira, 344 F.3d at 71-72.\n\n           Plaintiff's complaint describes two possible theories of\n\ncausation.     The first theory is that the FBI created a \"protective\n\nshield\" around Bulger and Flemmi.             This protective shield not only\n\nallowed them to escape prosecution for past crimes but emboldened\n\nthem to commit future crimes.                The second theory, and the one\n\nemphasized on appeal, is that the FBI told Bulger and Flemmi\n\ninformation that prompted them to kill Callahan.                 The information\n\nwas either that the FBI was seeking information from Callahan\n\nregarding the Wheeler murder or that Callahan knew that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi were skimming profits from WJA.\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f             These two theories roughly correspond to the two theories\n\nthis court considered for the two groups of appellants in McIntyre\n\nv. United States.     367 F.3d 38, 53-54, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2004).             For\n\nthe Wheeler appellants (family of the same Wheeler referred to in\n\nthis case), we addressed the claim that the FBI \"provided Bulger\n\nand Flemmi with a 'protective shield' against prosecution and\n\ninvestigation that gave the two criminals the opportunity to commit\n\ncrimes and emboldened them to do so, proximately causing Wheeler's\n\nmurder.\"    Id. at 58.   For the McIntyre appellants, we addressed the\n\nclaim that \"the FBI caused McIntyre's death . . . by leaking his\n\nconfidential informant status to Bulger and Flemmi, in violation of\n\na special duty of non-disclosure owed to him by the government.\"\n\nId.    at   54.    Although   the   two     theories   are    \"fundamentally\n\ndifferent,\" id. at 57, the dispositive issue for the Wheelers and\n\nthe McIntyres was not the theory itself, but when the plaintiffs\n\nknew or should have known of the facts supporting the theory, id.\n\nat 54-55, 59.\n\n             In McIntyre, we specifically reserved the question of\n\nwhether a plaintiff could put forth multiple theories of causation\n\nfor the same tort.       Id. at 54 n.6.      We now hold that although a\n\nplaintiff is free to put forth multiple theories of causation, the\n\nonly   relevant   theory   for   purposes    of   tolling    the   statute   of\n\nlimitations is the first one in time to establish the requisite\n\ncausation.     A plaintiff's claim accrues at the time when she knew\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\for should have known of a causal connection between her injury and\n\nthe government.     Thus, a claim accrues if there is any causal\n\nconnection.   Putting forth a specific theory of causation based on\n\nparticular facts does not help a plaintiff, because only the\n\nearliest theory of causation matters for accrual analysis.5\n\n          In this case, Plaintiff is emphasizing her second theory\n\non appeal, presumably because it will create a later accrual date\n\nthan her first theory.    The second theory, however, cannot change\n\nthe fact that causation could have been known at an earlier date\n\nunder the first theory.    Even if Plaintiff discovered tomorrow a\n\nnew, crucial fact related to causation -- e.g., that Agent Connolly\n\ngave Martorano the gun used to kill Callahan -- Plaintiff could not\n\nchange the fact that she should have known of causation at an\n\nearlier date.     We will thus determine accrual under Plaintiff's\n\nfirst theory.\n\n          We now turn to when Plaintiff's claim accrued. The court\n\nbelow held that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1,\n\n1999, this date being soon after the news reporting of Martorano's\n\nplea agreement and Judge Wolf's Salemme opinion.        On appeal,\n\nPlaintiff contends that her claim could not have accrued until\n\nafter May 14, 2000 and points to the fact that Martorano did not\n\n\n\n5\n   Since the date of accrual determines the power of this court to\nhear the case, we need not accept any of plaintiff's theories and\ncould interpose our own theory consistent with the facts of the\ncase.\n\n                                -18-\n\fformally plead guilty to the murder of Callahan until March 20,\n\n2001. We agree with the court below that Plaintiff's claim accrued\n\nno later than October 1, 1999.\n\n              We   must     address    what     Plaintiff    should   have    known\n\nregarding the cause of Callahan's death and the causal connection\n\nbetween the government and his death.                  We will consider national\n\nand    Boston      news    reporting     because       \"[w]here   events   receive\n\nwidespread publicity, plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge of\n\ntheir occurrence.\"          McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 60 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).       Numerous articles in Boston newspapers, as early\n\nas    1996,   speculated       that    Bulger    and    Flemmi    killed   Wheeler,\n\nHalloran, and Callahan and that the FBI was somehow involved.                   See\n\nsupra Part I.C.           In 1998, two nationwide news broadcasts, \"CNN\n\nImpact\" and \"60 Minutes,\" also speculated that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nkilled Callahan, possibly with the acquiescence of the FBI.                    Id.\n\n              Most importantly, Boston newspapers heavily reported\n\nthree events from federal court proceedings connected with the\n\nCallahan murder.          The first event was FBI Agent Morris's testimony\n\nin April 1998 that the FBI had informed Bulger and Flemmi that\n\nHalloran was implicating them in Wheeler's murder and that he\n\nbelieved that Bulger and Flemmi may have killed Halloran.                     Agent\n\nMorris also testified that he informed Bulger and Flemmi of a\n\nbugged location that they should avoid.                    The Boston Globe and\n\nBoston Herald reported his testimony the next day.                  See supra Part\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fI.D.   While his testimony was not directly connected with the\n\nCallahan murder, the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders were\n\nlong thought to be related.          See supra Part I.C.       For example, a\n\nDecember 1997 article reported that federal court hearings will\n\n\"probe whether FBI agents and federal organized crime prosecutors\n\nviolated any federal laws or guidelines in the way they handled\n\ninformants\"   like    Bulger   and    Flemmi,     and   that   Florida    police\n\ninvestigating the Callahan murder are \"hoping [the] hearings . . .\n\nwill lead to a break in the case.\"            Ralph Ranalli, Police Reopen\n\nMob Murder Probe, Boston Herald, Dec. 15, 1997.\n\n          The second event, made public on September 9, 1999, was\n\nMartorano's agreement to plead guilty to a number of murders,\n\nincluding the murder of Callahan.            In the following days, Boston\n\nnewspapers    published   several      articles    about   Martorano's         plea\n\nagreement and his willingness to implicate Bulger and Flemmi.                   See\n\nsupra Part I.E.      Further, Plaintiff was quoted in a September 12,\n\n1999 article, saying that she was trying to forgive Martorano, the\n\nkiller of her husband.     Andrea Estes, Outraged Hit Man Turned Rat\n\nfor Revenge, Boston Herald, Sept. 12, 1999.                The same article\n\nclearly indicates that Bulger and Flemmi were involved in the\n\nCallahan murder and that Martorano would implicate them.                 Id.\n\n          The third event was the publication of Judge Wolf's\n\nopinion in United States v. Salemme on September 15, 1999.                 As we\n\nhave already noted, his opinion discussed in depth the corrupt\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\frelationship between the FBI, Bulger, and Flemmi.                  That Judge\n\nWolf's opinion contains a section titled \"The Wheeler, Halloran,\n\nand Callahan Murders\" where he discusses the connections between\n\nthe three murders, Bulger and Flemmi, and the FBI is particularly\n\nrelevant.   Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 208-13.        He details specific\n\ninstances of clear misconduct, including attempts by the FBI to\n\nprotect Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution, and attempts by Bulger\n\nand Flemmi to curry favor with the FBI agents.           See supra Part I.F.\n\n            Given    the   extensive   news    reporting    and    the   close\n\nconnection of the events to her husband's death, we find that\n\nPlaintiff should have known the basic facts underlying these three\n\nevents.   Further, the reporting on these three events should have\n\nprompted Plaintiff to obtain certain publicly available documents,\n\nnamely Morris's 1998 testimony, Martorano's plea agreement, and the\n\nSalemme decision.\n\n            The facts that Plaintiff should have known would have\n\n\"prompt[ed]   a     reasonable   person   to   inquire     and    seek   advice\n\npreliminary to deciding if there [was] a basis for filing an\n\nadministrative claim against the government.\"         Skwira, 344 F.3d at\n\n78.   John Martorano's plea agreement and Judge Wolf's opinion\n\neasily provide the requisite knowledge under the discovery rule\n\nthat Bulger and Flemmi were responsible for the murder of Callahan.\n\nMoreover, Agent Morris's testimony and Judge Wolf's opinion easily\n\nprovide the requisite knowledge that the FBI protected Bulger and\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fFlemmi from prosecution and emboldened them to commit crimes,\n\nincluding the murder of Callahan.\n\n            Plaintiff argues that conflicting information reasonably\n\nprevented     her   filing   an   administrative        claim.        First,      she\n\nemphasizes that the FBI would not release the name of Callahan's\n\nkiller as late as April 2000.           Given Martorano's plea agreement,\n\nmade public on September 9, 1999, we find this argument unavailing.\n\nSecond, she contends that the FBI told her that she \"should not\n\nrely on newspaper stories\" and that \"reports were inaccurate.\"\n\nHowever,    such    statements    do   not     specifically      contradict       any\n\nrelevant information and even if they did, Plaintiff could surely\n\nrely   on    publicly    available       court     documents       for     accurate\n\ninformation.        Third,   plaintiff        argues   that   in     the   face    of\n\nconflicting    newspaper     stories,     she    did   not    have    sufficient,\n\nreliable information.        Although she does not cite the newspaper\n\narticles, she claims that as late as 1997 newspapers reported\n\ngovernment denials of a corrupt relationship between the FBI and\n\nBulger and Flemmi.       However, the lack of conflicting stories in\n\n1998 and 1999 and the publicly available court documents allow us\n\nto easily dispose of this argument.            Finally, Plaintiff makes much\n\nof a statement in Judge Wolf's September 15, 1999 opinion:\n\n            As a result of the delayed disclosure of the\n            Halloran documents by the government and of\n            the failure of the adversary system to operate\n            fully and effectively on this issue, questions\n            remain regarding the role, if any, played by\n            Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler, Halloran,\n\n                                       -22-\n\f           and Callahan murders, and the full degree to\n           which the FBI in Boston has, from 1981 until\n           recently, attempted to keep and such role from\n           being discerned and demonstrated.\n\nThis statement, however, hurts Plaintiff more than it helps her.\n\nCertainty is not required for a claim to accrue.                  Rather, Judge\n\nWolf's statement would prompt a reasonable person to further\n\ninvestigate   the   matter      by     seeking   legal   advice    in    order   to\n\ndetermine whether action should be taken against the government.\n\nThis is all that is required for accrual.              Skwira, 344 F.3d at 78.\n\nB.   Fraudulent Concealment\n\n           Like the discovery rule, the doctrine of fraudulent\n\nconcealment is a means available to plaintiffs seeking to toll the\n\nstatute of limitations.         In order for a plaintiff to prevail on a\n\nfraudulent concealment claim, the defendant \"'must have engaged in\n\nfraud or deliberate concealment of material facts relating to his\n\nwrongdoing and the plaintiff must have failed to discover these\n\nfacts within the normal limitations period despite his exercise of\n\ndue diligence.'\"    Torres Ramírez v. Bermúdez García, 898 F.2d 224,\n\n229 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Hernández Jiménez v. Calero Toledo,\n\n604 F.2d 99, 101 (1st Cir. 1979)).                During the course of this\n\nsordid   affair,    the   FBI    almost       surely   engaged    in    fraudulent\n\nconcealment   by    denying      any    FBI    complicity   in    the    criminal\n\nactivities of Bulger and Flemmi.           We need not specifically address\n\nthis, however, because we find that any fraudulent concealment by\n\nthe FBI ended no later than October 1, 1999.\n\n                                        -23-\n\f            Plaintiff claims that the FBI engaged in fraudulent\n\nconcealment when agents refused to tell her who killed Callahan.\n\nAny purported fraudulent concealment of this fact ended when\n\nportions   of   Martorano's   plea   agreement      were    made    public   on\n\nSeptember 9, 1999. The public portion of the plea agreement stated\n\nthat Martorano would plead guilty to the murder of Callahan.             Even\n\nif after this date FBI agents refused to tell Plaintiff who killed\n\nCallahan, this fact was no longer concealed.\n\n            Plaintiff also claims fraudulent concealment as a result\n\nof FBI agents' statements to her that she \"should not rely on\n\nnewspaper stories\" and that \"reports were inaccurate.\"                   Such\n\ngeneral    statements   cannot   rise    to   the   level    of    fraudulent\n\nconcealment because they do not even indicate which newspaper\n\nstories are inaccurate or should not be relied upon.              Further, the\n\nstatements have a non-fraudulent explanation. The FBI agents could\n\nsimply have been evading Plaintiff's questions because they did not\n\nwish to discuss a pending criminal prosecution.\n\n            We have already decided in considering the discovery rule\n\nthat Plaintiff should have known of sufficient facts by October 1,\n\n1999 to prompt a reasonable person to file an administrative claim.\n\nThe reason that Plaintiff should have known of these facts is that\n\nthey were easily discoverable had she diligently (or even not so\n\ndiligently) kept herself informed of the legal proceedings and news\n\nreporting of events closely related to Callahan's murder.               Thus,\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fPlaintiff    had   either   discovered    the   purportedly   concealed\n\ninformation or was not diligent in seeking to obtain it.         Either\n\nway, we find no fraudulent concealment.\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n            Because we find that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later\n\nthan October 1, 1999, which was more than two years before she\n\nfiled her administrative claim, and we find that any fraudulent\n\nconcealment by the government ended before this date, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n\nunder the FTCA.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f",

Callahan (\"Callahan\"), and members of her family filed suit for wrongful death and emotional distress arising from the murder of her husband. The suit is founded in a long and sordid history between Boston FBI agents and the Winter Hill Gang, an organized crime syndicate in Boston. Defendants are the United States and individuals who were once members of the FBI, the Winter Hill Gang, or both. This corrupt relationship produced many unfortunate victims, several of whom have already sought relief in the federal courts. <i>See generally McIntyre v. United States,</i> 367 F.3d 38 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Salemme,</i> 91 F.Supp.2d 141 (D.Mass.1999), <i>rev'd in part, sub nom., United States v.

The district court dismissed all claims by individual plaintiffs for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for their failure to file an administrative claim. <i>Callahan v. United States,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d 348, 350 n. 1 (D.Mass.2004). In an order dated September 28, 2004, the district court also dismissed all claims against individual defendants for expiration of the statute of limitations or want of prosecution. Plaintiff does not appeal those dismissals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim against the United States is through the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), under which the United States consents to suits against it in tort. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b); 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2671-2680. One condition of the FTCA is that a plaintiff must file an administrative claim within two years of the accrual of her claim. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2401(b). Below, the government did not dispute the Plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations, and the district court accepted Plaintiff's allegations as true. Even accepting the Plaintiff's allegations as true, however, the district court found that her claim accrued more than two years before she filed her administrative complaint. The court below thus dismissed the remaining claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Callahan,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d at 370.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present a summary of the factual events surrounding Callahan's murder as alleged by the Plaintiff and supplemented by uncontested facts from news reports and court documents. <i>See Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista,</i> 254 F.3d 358, 363 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Winter Hill Gang and the FBI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Winter Hill Gang was the name for the dominant organized crime syndicate in the Boston area in the 1970s and 1980s. The Gang's activities included murder, bribery, extortion, loan sharking, and illegal gambling. James \"Whitey\" Bulger (\"Bulger\") and Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi (\"Flemmi\") were two prominent members of the Gang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1967, FBI Agent H. Paul Rico (\"Rico\") recruited Flemmi as an FBI informant. In 1976, Agent John Connolly (\"Connolly\") recruited Bulger as an informant. Connolly and Bulger were childhood neighbors in South Boston. Eventually, both Bulger and Flemmi were promoted to the status of \"Top Echelon\" informant. The Winter Hill Gang's main rival in crime was the Boston branch of La Cosa Nostra, another organized crime syndicate. The FBI wanted to bring down La Cosa Nostra and Bulger and Flemmi were very pleased to help it do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This convenient relationship eventually took a turn for the worse. While they were informants, Bulger and Flemmi were responsible for multiple murders, including those of Roger Wheeler, Brian Halloran, and Callahan, to be discussed below. The FBI, intent on keeping its informants happy, turned a blind eye to their crimes and failed to follow FBI guidelines for dealing with informants. For example, FBI agents interfered with the investigation of Bulger and Flemmi for the murder of Callahan by preventing Oklahoma FBI agents from interviewing them. The FBI also informed Bulger and Flemmi of a \"bugged\" location to prevent them from incriminating themselves. At the same time, Bulger and Flemmi ingratiated themselves to the FBI by assisting the agents. For example, when FBI Agent John Morris (\"Morris\"), Agent Connolly's supervisor, was in Georgia for training and he wanted his secretary to fly to meet him for a romantic tryst, Bulger and Flemmi paid for her plane ticket. This cozy relationship created a protective shield around Bulger and Flemmi that emboldened them in their criminal activities &#8212; so much so that at one point Flemmi stated that the FBI gave Bulger and him free reign to commit any crime short of murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, this cozy relationship between the FBI and Bulger and Flemmi broke down when more reputable law enforcement agents charged Bulger and Flemmi with numerous crimes. Agent Connolly tipped off Bulger, who, to this day, is in hiding from law enforcement authorities. Agent Morris was granted immunity for his testimony, and he testified against Flemmi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Callahan's Death</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Callahan was chief executive officer of a business called World Jai Alai (\"WJA\"), owned by one Roger Wheeler (\"Wheeler\"). WJA operated \"frontons\" where customers could place bets on the outcome of jai alai matches. In an unusual coincidence, Callahan hired Rico, now retired from the FBI and the one who had recruited Flemmi as an FBI informant, as head of security for WJA. Around 1981, Callahan learned that individuals were skimming profits from WJA. He was concerned and reported his suspicions to Wheeler.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In response, Wheeler began an audit of WJA. To prevent Wheeler from discovering their profit skimming, Bulger and Flemmi wanted Wheeler killed. At their direction, John Martorano (\"Martorano\"), another member of the Winter Hill Gang, murdered Wheeler in May 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1982, one Brian Halloran (\"Halloran\") began cooperating with the FBI while being prosecuted for an unrelated murder. He told the FBI that Bulger, Flemmi, and Callahan had asked him to murder Wheeler but that he had declined the offer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Halloran also stated that Bulger, Flemmi, Callahan, and Martorano were ultimately responsible for Wheeler's murder. Agent Morris relayed this information to Agent Connolly, who in turn informed Bulger and Flemmi. In May 1982, Bulger and Flemmi had Halloran killed to prevent his further cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1982, Callahan's body was found in the trunk of a car at the Miami airport. Plaintiff makes two allegations as to a direct connection between the FBI and Callahan's death.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The first is from Plaintiff's complaint in this suit, and the second is from her administrative complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first allegation is that the FBI's investigation of the Wheeler murder eventually turned to Callahan. Around June 1982, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that Callahan was under investigation. Although it is not clear how Callahan could have any incriminating information about the Wheeler murder, Bulger and Flemmi directed Martorano to kill Callahan to prevent him from cooperating with law enforcement authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second allegation is that Callahan told Rico that he feared that Wheeler's death was related to Wheeler's knowledge of the profit skimming at WJA. Rico told this to Morris and Connolly who in turn told Bulger and Flemmi. Bulger and Flemmi directed Martorano to kill Callahan because he knew of their profit skimming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. News Reports of FBI Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as March 1996, Boston newspapers reported possible FBI complicity in the Callahan murder. A March 1996 article reported that Callahan, Bulger, and Flemmi had asked Halloran to kill Wheeler; Callahan told Halloran that Martorano had killed Wheeler with Flemmi's help; investigators were probing whether the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders were related; and \"sources and published reports have long said that Bulger was an informant for the FBI.\" Ralph Ranalli, <i>The Jai Alai Murders,</i> Boston Herald, Mar. 10-11, 1996. A July 1997 article stated that the FBI kept using Bulger and Flemmi as informants even though they were suspects in the murders of Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan. Ralph Ranalli, <i>FBI Used Whitey Despite his Ties to Three Murders,</i> Boston Herald, July 7, 1997. A December 1997 article reported that federal court hearings will \"probe whether FBI agents and federal organized crime prosecutors violated any federal laws or guidelines in the way they handled informants\" like Bulger and Flemmi, and that Florida police investigating the Callahan murder are \"hoping [the] hearings . . . will lead to a break in the case.\" Ralph Ranalli, <i>Police Reopen Mob Murder Probe,</i> Boston Herald, Dec. 15, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National television broadcasts reported similar information. On March 15, 1998, the broadcast \"CNN Impact\" reported that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI informants and that possible connections existed between Bulger and Flemmi and the murders of Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan. On May 10, 1998, the television program \"60 Minutes\" reported that Flemmi stated that the FBI gave Bulger and him \"free reign to commit just about any crime.\" The broadcast also referred to the Callahan murder and stated that the FBI might \"have allowed [Bulger and Flemmi] to get away with murder.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

Agent Morris also testified that he informed Bulger and Flemmi of a location bugged by Massachusetts State Police to prevent them from incriminating themselves. <i>Id.</i> at 202.

The same article quoted Mrs. Callahan as trying to forgive Martorano for killing Callahan. <i>Id.</i> The article also stated that Wheeler had \"suspected the Winter Hill Gang was skimming profits\" from his company and that \"Martorano believes the FBI told Flemmi and Bulger about Wheeler's suspicions.\" <i>Id.

FBI's Interactions with Plaintiff</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the murder of Callahan, FBI agents met Plaintiff and told her that Callahan's murder \"was not a professional hit\" and that he was \"probably killed by Cuban gangsters.\" Several times between 1982 and 2001, when Martorano pleaded guilty to the murder of Callahan, Plaintiff asked FBI agents about the murder of Callahan, and FBI agents refused to tell her anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 30, 1999, Plaintiff met with FBI agents at the agents' request. The agents told her of a possible plea agreement with the man who murdered Callahan, but they refused to state his name. Plaintiff specifically asked FBI agents \"whether certain newspaper accounts involving [Callahan's murder] and John Martarano [sic] were true,\" and the agents responded that she \"should not rely on newspaper accounts\" and that \"the reports were inaccurate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H.

Claimant then learned that Martorano was hired to kill her husband on behalf of [Bulger and Flemmi]. Bulger and Flemmi learned that the victim had information that they were \"skimming\" profits from World Jai Alai in Miami. Bulger and Flemmi learned this from H. Paul Rico. . . . The information was passed from Rico to FBI agents Morris and Connolly who in turn alerted Bulger and Flemmi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Accrual under the FTCA</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is `elementary' that the United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit unless it has consented to be sued.\" <i>Skwira v. United States,</i> 344 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>United States v. Mitchell,</i> 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980)). \"Moreover, a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\" <i>Lane v. Pe&#241;a,</i> 518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 (1996). The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives sovereign immunity by giving consent to suits \"for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b); 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2671-2680. One condition of this waiver is that a claim \"shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2401(b). \"[T]he general rule under the [FTCA is] that a tort claim accrues at the time of the plaintiff's injury.\" <i>United States v. Kubrick,</i> 444 U.S. 111, 120, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Discovery Rule</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Kubrick,</i> the Supreme Court recognized a discovery rule for medical malpractice claims under the FTCA. <i>Id.</i> at 113, 100 S.Ct. 352. Under the discovery rule, the plaintiff's claim accrues when she \"knows both the existence and the cause of [her] injury.\" <i>Id.</i> We have previously considered the Supreme Court's reasoning in <i>Kubrick</i> and applied the discovery rule to claims under the FTCA involving theft, <i>Attallah v. United States,</i> 955 F.2d 776, 778-79 (1st Cir.1992), and wrongful death, <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 75. For claims other than medical malpractice, we apply a more forgiving rule because \"the identity of the individual(s) responsible for an injury may be less evident.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77. In such cases, a plaintiff's claim accrues only when she also knows \"that there is a causal connection between the government and her injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"knowledge\" standard under the discovery rule has two qualifications. First, \"something less than definitive knowledge is required.\" <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78. Accrual is triggered by \"the discovery of sufficient facts about the injury and its cause to prompt a reasonable person to inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there is a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.\" <i>Id.</i> Second, a plaintiff is charged with knowledge of facts which \"in the exercise of reasonable diligence [she] should have discovered.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez v. United States,</i> 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir.2002). This is an objective standard. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff filed an administrative claim with the FBI on May 14, 2002. The United States argues that her suit is barred because her claim accrued more than two years before this date. We must therefore determine (1) what facts relevant to her claim Plaintiff knew or should have known, and (2) whether Plaintiff had sufficient facts about the existence of her injury (that Callahan was killed), the cause of her injury (that Bulger and Flemmi had Callahan killed), and a causal connection between her injury and the government to prompt her to \"inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there is a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.\" <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78. Plaintiff clearly knew of her injuries soon after Callahan's death. Thus, we must determine the facts relevant to showing that Bulger and Flemmi had Callahan killed and showing that the government was causally connected to the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of the complaint in this case was not based on what facts Plaintiff actually knew. Rather, the district court concluded, in light of a variety of uncontested facts, that Plaintiff should have known of her claim by October 1, 1999. Here, as below, the facts themselves are not at issue. We determine only whether the judge was correct to conclude, as a matter of law, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff objectively should have known of her claim by October 1, 1999. While review of Rule 12(b)(1) dismissals requires deference to a judge's factual findings, our review of this case, which involves only a question of law, is <i>de novo. Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 363. <i>See also Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's complaint describes two possible theories of causation. The first theory is that the FBI created a \"protective shield\" around Bulger and Flemmi. This protective shield not only allowed them to escape prosecution for past crimes but emboldened them to commit future crimes. The second theory, and the one emphasized on appeal, is that the FBI told Bulger and Flemmi information that prompted them to kill Callahan. The information was either that the FBI was seeking information from Callahan regarding the Wheeler murder or that Callahan knew that Bulger and Flemmi were skimming profits from WJA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two theories roughly correspond to the two theories this court considered for the two groups of appellants in <i>McIntyre v. United States.</i> 367 F.3d 38, 53-54, 57-58 (1st Cir.2004). For the Wheeler appellants (family of the same Wheeler referred to in this case), we addressed the claim that the FBI \"provided Bulger and Flemmi with a `protective shield' against prosecution and investigation that gave the two criminals the opportunity to commit crimes and emboldened them to do so, proximately causing Wheeler's murder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58. For the McIntyre appellants, we addressed the claim that \"the FBI caused McIntyre's death . . . by leaking his confidential informant status to Bulger and Flemmi, in violation of a special duty of non-disclosure owed to him by the government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54. Although the two theories are \"fundamentally different,\" <i>id.</i> at 57, the dispositive issue for the Wheelers and the McIntyres was not the theory itself, but when the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the facts supporting the theory, <i>id.</i> at 54-55, 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>McIntyre,</i> we specifically reserved the question of whether a plaintiff could put forth multiple theories of causation for the same tort. <i>Id.</i> at 54 n. 6. We now hold that although a plaintiff is free to put forth multiple theories of causation, the only relevant theory for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations is the first one in time to establish the requisite causation. A plaintiff's claim accrues at the time when she knew or should have known of a causal connection between her injury and the government. Thus, a claim accrues if there is <i>any</i> causal connection. Putting forth a specific theory of causation based on particular facts does not help a plaintiff, because only the earliest theory of causation matters for accrual analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Plaintiff is emphasizing her second theory on appeal, presumably because it will create a later accrual date than her first theory. The second theory, however, cannot change the fact that causation could have been known at an earlier date under the first theory. Even if Plaintiff discovered tomorrow a new, crucial fact related to causation &#8212; e.g., that Agent Connolly gave Martorano the gun used to kill Callahan &#8212; Plaintiff could not change the fact that she should have known of causation at an earlier date. We will thus determine accrual under Plaintiff's first theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to when Plaintiff's claim accrued. The court below held that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1, 1999, this date being soon after the news reporting of Martorano's plea agreement and Judge Wolf's <i>Salemme</i> opinion. On appeal, Plaintiff contends that her claim could not have accrued until after May 14, 2000 and points to the fact that Martorano did not formally plead guilty to the murder of Callahan until March 20, 2001. We agree with the court below that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must address what Plaintiff should have known regarding the cause of Callahan's death and the causal connection between the government and his death. We will consider national and Boston news reporting because \"[w]here events receive widespread publicity, plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge of their occurrence.\" <i>McIntyre,</i> 367 F.3d at 60 (internal quotation marks omitted). Numerous articles in Boston newspapers, as early as 1996, speculated that Bulger and Flemmi killed Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan and that the FBI was somehow involved. <i>See supra</i> Part I.C. In 1998, two nationwide news broadcasts, \"CNN Impact\" and \"60 Minutes,\" also speculated that Bulger and Flemmi killed Callahan, possibly with the acquiescence of the FBI. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, Boston newspapers heavily reported three events from federal court proceedings connected with the Callahan murder. The first event was FBI Agent Morris's testimony in April 1998 that the FBI had informed Bulger and Flemmi that Halloran was implicating them in Wheeler's murder and that he believed that Bulger and Flemmi may have killed Halloran. Agent Morris also testified that he informed Bulger and Flemmi of a bugged location that they should avoid. The Boston Globe and Boston Herald reported his testimony the next day. <i>See supra</i> Part I.D. While his testimony was not directly connected with the Callahan murder, the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders were long thought to be related. <i>See supra</i> Part I.C. For example, a December 1997 article reported that federal court hearings will \"probe whether FBI agents and federal organized crime prosecutors violated any federal laws or guidelines in the way they handled informants\" like Bulger and Flemmi, and that Florida police investigating the Callahan murder are \"hoping [the] hearings . . . will lead to a break in the case.\" Ralph Ranalli, <i>Police Reopen Mob Murder Probe,</i> Boston Herald, Dec. 15, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second event, made public on September 9, 1999, was Martorano's agreement to plead guilty to a number of murders, including the murder of Callahan. In the following days, Boston newspapers published several articles about Martorano's plea agreement and his willingness to implicate Bulger and Flemmi. <i>See supra</i> Part I.E. Further, Plaintiff was quoted in a September 12, 1999 article, saying that she was trying to forgive Martorano, the killer of her husband. Andrea Estes, <i>Outraged Hit Man Turned Rat for Revenge,</i> Boston Herald, Sept. 12, 1999. The same article clearly indicates that Bulger and Flemmi were involved in the Callahan murder and that Martorano would implicate them. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third event was the publication of Judge Wolf's opinion in <i>United States v. Salemme</i> on September 15, 1999. As we have already noted, his opinion discussed in depth the corrupt relationship between the FBI, Bulger, and Flemmi. That Judge Wolf's opinion contains a section titled \"The Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan Murders\" where he discusses the connections between the three murders, Bulger and Flemmi, and the FBI is particularly relevant. <i>Salemme,</i> 91 F.Supp.2d at 208-13. He details specific instances of clear misconduct, including attempts by the FBI to protect Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution, and attempts by Bulger and Flemmi to curry favor with the FBI agents. <i>See supra</i> Part I.F.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the extensive news reporting and the close connection of the events to her husband's death, we find that Plaintiff should have known the basic facts underlying these three events. Further, the reporting on these three events should have prompted Plaintiff to obtain certain publicly available documents, namely Morris's 1998 testimony, Martorano's plea agreement, and the <i>Salemme</i> decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts that Plaintiff should have known would have \"prompt[ed] a reasonable person to inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there [was] a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.\" <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78. John Martorano's plea agreement and Judge Wolf's opinion easily provide the requisite knowledge under the discovery rule that Bulger and Flemmi were responsible for the murder of Callahan. Moreover, Agent Morris's testimony and Judge Wolf's opinion easily provide the requisite knowledge that the FBI protected Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution and emboldened them to commit crimes, including the murder of Callahan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that conflicting information reasonably prevented her filing an administrative claim. First, she emphasizes that the FBI would not release the name of Callahan's killer as late as April 2000. Given Martorano's plea agreement, made public on September 9, 1999, we find this argument unavailing. Second, she contends that the FBI told her that she \"should not rely on newspaper stories\" and that \"reports were inaccurate.\" However, such statements do not specifically contradict any relevant information and even if they did, Plaintiff could surely rely on publicly available court documents for accurate information. Third, plaintiff argues that in the face of conflicting newspaper stories, she did not have sufficient, reliable information. Although she does not cite the newspaper articles, she claims that as late as 1997 newspapers reported government denials of a corrupt relationship between the FBI and Bulger and Flemmi. However, the lack of conflicting stories in 1998 and 1999 and the publicly available court documents allow us to easily dispose of this argument. Finally, Plaintiff makes much of a statement in Judge Wolf's September 15, 1999 opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the delayed disclosure of the Halloran documents by the government and of the failure of the adversary system to operate fully and effectively on this issue, questions remain regarding the role, if any, played by Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders, and the full degree to which the FBI in Boston has, from 1981 until recently, attempted to keep and such role from being discerned and demonstrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement, however, hurts Plaintiff more than it helps her. Certainty is not required for a claim to accrue. Rather, Judge Wolf's statement would prompt a reasonable person to further investigate the matter by seeking legal advice in order to determine whether action should be taken against the government. This is all that is required for accrual. <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Fraudulent Concealment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the discovery rule, the doctrine of fraudulent concealment is a means available to plaintiffs seeking to toll the statute of limitations. In order for a plaintiff to prevail on a fraudulent concealment claim, the defendant \"`must have engaged in fraud or deliberate concealment of material facts relating to his wrongdoing and the plaintiff must have failed to discover these facts within the normal limitations period despite his exercise of due diligence.'\" <i>Torres Ram&#237;rez v. Berm&#250;dez Garc&#237;a,</i> 898 F.2d 224, 229 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>Hern&#225;ndez Jim&#233;nez v. Calero Toledo,</i> 604 F.2d 99, 101 (1st Cir.1979)). During the course of this sordid affair, the FBI almost surely engaged in fraudulent concealment by denying any FBI complicity in the criminal activities of Bulger and Flemmi. We need not specifically address this, however, because we find that any fraudulent concealment by the FBI ended no later than October 1, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff claims that the FBI engaged in fraudulent concealment when agents refused to tell her who killed Callahan. Any purported fraudulent concealment of this fact ended when portions of Martorano's plea agreement were made public on September 9, 1999. The public portion of the plea agreement stated that Martorano would plead guilty to the murder of Callahan. Even if after this date FBI agents refused to tell Plaintiff who killed Callahan, this fact was no longer concealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also claims fraudulent concealment as a result of FBI agents' statements to her that she \"should not rely on newspaper stories\" and that \"reports were inaccurate.\" Such general statements cannot rise to the level of fraudulent concealment because they do not even indicate which newspaper stories are inaccurate or should not be relied upon. Further, the statements have a non-fraudulent explanation. The FBI agents could simply have been evading Plaintiff's questions because they did not wish to discuss a pending criminal prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already decided in considering the discovery rule that Plaintiff should have known of sufficient facts by October 1, 1999 to prompt a reasonable person to file an administrative claim. The reason that Plaintiff should have known of these facts is that they were easily discoverable had she diligently (or even not so diligently) kept herself informed of the legal proceedings and news reporting of events closely related to Callahan's murder. Thus, Plaintiff had either discovered the purportedly concealed information or was not diligent in seeking to obtain it. Either way, we find no fraudulent concealment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1, 1999, which was more than two years before she filed her administrative claim, and we find that any fraudulent concealment by the government ended before this date, we affirm the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff stated rather cryptically in her complaint that \"[c]omplaints of this activity fell on deaf ears.\" From this we presume that Callahan complained to Wheeler even though other sources portray Callahan less innocently<i>See Salemme,</i> 91 F.Supp.2d at 208-09 (\"Wheeler suspected that Callahan was skimming money from World Jai Lai for members of the Winter Hill Gang, including Halloran, Bulger, and Flemmi.

Callahan (\"Callahan\"), and members of her family filed suit for wrongful death and emotional distress arising from the murder of her husband. The suit is founded in a long and sordid history between Boston FBI agents and the Winter Hill Gang, an organized crime syndicate in Boston. Defendants are the United States and individuals who were once members of the FBI, the Winter Hill Gang, or both. This corrupt relationship produced many unfortunate victims, several of whom have already sought relief in the federal courts. <i>See generally McIntyre v.

The Winter Hill Gang and the FBI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Winter Hill Gang was the name for the dominant organized crime syndicate in the Boston area in the 1970s and 1980s. The Gang's activities included murder, bribery, extortion, loan sharking, and illegal gambling. James \"Whitey\" Bulger (\"Bulger\") and Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi (\"Flemmi\") were two prominent members of the Gang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1967, FBI Agent H. Paul Rico (\"Rico\") recruited Flemmi as an FBI informant. In 1976, Agent John Connolly (\"Connolly\") recruited Bulger as an informant. Connolly and Bulger were childhood neighbors in South Boston. Eventually, both Bulger and Flemmi were promoted to the status of \"Top Echelon\" informant. The Winter Hill Gang's main rival in crime was the Boston branch of La Cosa Nostra, another organized crime syndicate. The FBI wanted to bring down La Cosa Nostra and Bulger and Flemmi were very pleased to help it do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This convenient relationship eventually took a turn for the worse. While they were informants, Bulger and Flemmi were responsible for multiple murders, including those of Roger Wheeler, Brian Halloran, and Callahan, to be discussed below. The FBI, intent on keeping its informants happy, turned a blind eye to their crimes and failed to follow FBI guidelines for dealing with informants. For example, FBI agents interfered with the investigation of Bulger and Flemmi for the murder of Callahan by preventing Oklahoma FBI agents from interviewing them. The FBI also informed Bulger and Flemmi of a \"bugged\" location to prevent them from incriminating themselves. At the same time, Bulger and Flemmi ingratiated themselves to the FBI by assisting the agents. For example, when FBI Agent John Morris (\"Morris\"), Agent Connolly's supervisor, was in Georgia for training and he wanted his secretary to fly to meet him for a romantic tryst, Bulger and Flemmi paid for her plane ticket. This cozy relationship created a protective shield around Bulger and Flemmi that emboldened them in their criminal activities &#8212; so much so that at one point Flemmi stated that the FBI gave Bulger and him free reign to commit any crime short of murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, this cozy relationship between the FBI and Bulger and Flemmi broke down when more reputable law enforcement agents charged Bulger and Flemmi with numerous crimes. Agent Connolly tipped off Bulger, who, to this day, is in hiding from law enforcement authorities. Agent Morris was granted immunity for his testimony, and he testified against Flemmi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Callahan's Death</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Callahan was chief executive officer of a business called World Jai Alai (\"WJA\"), owned by one Roger Wheeler (\"Wheeler\"). WJA operated \"frontons\" where customers could place bets on the outcome of jai alai matches. In an unusual coincidence, Callahan hired Rico, now retired from the FBI and the one who had recruited Flemmi as an FBI informant, as head of security for WJA. Around 1981, Callahan learned that individuals were skimming profits from WJA. He was concerned and reported his suspicions to Wheeler.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In response, Wheeler began an audit of WJA. To prevent Wheeler from discovering their profit skimming, Bulger and Flemmi wanted Wheeler killed. At their direction, John Martorano (\"Martorano\"), another member of the Winter Hill Gang, murdered Wheeler in May 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1982, one Brian Halloran (\"Halloran\") began cooperating with the FBI while being prosecuted for an unrelated murder. He told the FBI that Bulger, Flemmi, and Callahan had asked him to murder Wheeler but that he had declined the offer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Halloran also stated that Bulger, Flemmi, Callahan, and Martorano were ultimately responsible for Wheeler's murder. Agent Morris relayed this information to Agent Connolly, who in turn informed Bulger and Flemmi. In May 1982, Bulger and Flemmi had Halloran killed to prevent his further cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1982, Callahan's body was found in the trunk of a car at the Miami airport. Plaintiff makes two allegations as to a direct connection between the FBI and Callahan's death.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The first is from Plaintiff's complaint in this suit, and the second is from her administrative complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first allegation is that the FBI's investigation of the Wheeler murder eventually turned to Callahan. Around June 1982, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that Callahan was under investigation. Although it is not clear how Callahan could have any incriminating information about the Wheeler murder, Bulger and Flemmi directed Martorano to kill Callahan to prevent him from cooperating with law enforcement authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second allegation is that Callahan told Rico that he feared that Wheeler's death was related to Wheeler's knowledge of the profit skimming at WJA. Rico told this to Morris and Connolly who in turn told Bulger and Flemmi. Bulger and Flemmi directed Martorano to kill Callahan because he knew of their profit skimming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. News Reports of FBI Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as March 1996, Boston newspapers reported possible FBI complicity in the Callahan murder. A March 1996 article reported that Callahan, Bulger, and Flemmi had asked Halloran to kill Wheeler; Callahan told Halloran that Martorano had killed Wheeler with Flemmi's help; investigators were probing whether the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders were related; and \"sources and published reports have long said that Bulger was an informant for the FBI.\" Ralph Ranalli, <i>The Jai Alai Murders,</i> Boston Herald, Mar. 10-11, 1996.

Under the discovery rule, the plaintiff's claim accrues when she \"knows both the existence and the cause of [her] injury.\" <i>Id.</i> We have previously considered the Supreme Court's reasoning in <i>Kubrick</i> and applied the discovery rule to claims under the FTCA involving theft, <i>Attallah v.

For claims other than medical malpractice, we apply a more forgiving rule because \"the identity of the individual(s) responsible for an injury may be less evident.\" <i>Id.</i> at 77. In such cases, a plaintiff's claim accrues only when she also knows \"that there is a causal connection between the government and her injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"knowledge\" standard under the discovery rule has two qualifications. First, \"something less than definitive knowledge is required.\" <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78. Accrual is triggered by \"the discovery of sufficient facts about the injury and its cause to prompt a reasonable person to inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there is a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.\" <i>Id.</i> Second, a plaintiff is charged with knowledge of facts which \"in the exercise of reasonable diligence [she] should have discovered.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez v.

This is an objective standard. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff filed an administrative claim with the FBI on May 14, 2002. The United States argues that her suit is barred because her claim accrued more than two years before this date. We must therefore determine (1) what facts relevant to her claim Plaintiff knew or should have known, and (2) whether Plaintiff had sufficient facts about the existence of her injury (that Callahan was killed), the cause of her injury (that Bulger and Flemmi had Callahan killed), and a causal connection between her injury and the government to prompt her to \"inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there is a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.\" <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78. Plaintiff clearly knew of her injuries soon after Callahan's death. Thus, we must determine the facts relevant to showing that Bulger and Flemmi had Callahan killed and showing that the government was causally connected to the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dismissal of the complaint in this case was not based on what facts Plaintiff actually knew. Rather, the district court concluded, in light of a variety of uncontested facts, that Plaintiff should have known of her claim by October 1, 1999. Here, as below, the facts themselves are not at issue. We determine only whether the judge was correct to conclude, as a matter of law, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff objectively should have known of her claim by October 1, 1999. While review of Rule 12(b)(1) dismissals requires deference to a judge's factual findings, our review of this case, which involves only a question of law, is <i>de novo. Valent&#237;n,</i> 254 F.3d at 363. <i>See also Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's complaint describes two possible theories of causation. The first theory is that the FBI created a \"protective shield\" around Bulger and Flemmi. This protective shield not only allowed them to escape prosecution for past crimes but emboldened them to commit future crimes. The second theory, and the one emphasized on appeal, is that the FBI told Bulger and Flemmi information that prompted them to kill Callahan. The information was either that the FBI was seeking information from Callahan regarding the Wheeler murder or that Callahan knew that Bulger and Flemmi were skimming profits from WJA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two theories roughly correspond to the two theories this court considered for the two groups of appellants in <i>McIntyre v. United States.</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786063\"><a href=\"/opinion/786063/emily-mcintyre-as-administrator-of-the-estate-of-john-l-mcintyre/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 53-54, 57-58 (1st Cir.2004). For the Wheeler appellants (family of the same Wheeler referred to in this case), we addressed the claim that the FBI \"provided Bulger and Flemmi with a `protective shield' against prosecution and investigation that gave the two criminals the opportunity to commit crimes and emboldened them to do so, proximately causing Wheeler's murder.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58. For the McIntyre appellants, we addressed the claim that \"the FBI caused McIntyre's death . . . by leaking his confidential informant status to Bulger and Flemmi, in violation of a special duty of non-disclosure owed to him by the government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54. Although the two theories are \"fundamentally different,\" <i>id.</i> at 57, the dispositive issue for the Wheelers and the McIntyres was not the theory itself, but when the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the facts supporting the theory, <i>id.</i> at 54-55, 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>McIntyre,</i> we specifically reserved the question of whether a plaintiff could put forth multiple theories of causation for the same tort. <i>Id.</i> at 54 n. 6. We now hold that although a plaintiff is free to put forth multiple theories of causation, the only relevant theory for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations is the first one in time to establish the requisite causation. A plaintiff's claim accrues at the time when she knew or should have known of a causal connection between her injury and the government. Thus, a claim accrues if there is <i>any</i> causal connection. Putting forth a specific theory of causation based on particular facts does not help a plaintiff, because only the earliest theory of causation matters for accrual analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Plaintiff is emphasizing her second theory on appeal, presumably because it will create a later accrual date than her first theory. The second theory, however, cannot change the fact that causation could have been known at an earlier date under the first theory. Even if Plaintiff discovered tomorrow a new, crucial fact related to causation &#8212; e.g., that Agent Connolly gave Martorano the gun used to kill Callahan &#8212; Plaintiff could not change the fact that she should have known of causation at an earlier date. We will thus determine accrual under Plaintiff's first theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to when Plaintiff's claim accrued. The court below held that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1, 1999, this date being soon after the news reporting of Martorano's plea agreement and Judge Wolf's <i>Salemme</i> opinion. On appeal, Plaintiff contends that her claim could not have accrued until after May 14, 2000 and points to the fact that Martorano did not formally plead guilty to the murder of Callahan until March 20, 2001. We agree with the court below that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must address what Plaintiff should have known regarding the cause of Callahan's death and the causal connection between the government and his death. We will consider national and Boston news reporting because \"[w]here events receive widespread publicity, plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge of their occurrence.\" <i>McIntyre,</i> 367 F.3d at 60 (internal quotation marks omitted). Numerous articles in Boston newspapers, as early as 1996, speculated that Bulger and Flemmi killed Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan and that the FBI was somehow involved. <i>See supra</i> Part I.C. In 1998, two nationwide news broadcasts, \"CNN Impact\" and \"60 Minutes,\" also speculated that Bulger and Flemmi killed Callahan, possibly with the acquiescence of the FBI. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, Boston newspapers heavily reported three events from federal court proceedings connected with the Callahan murder. The first event was FBI Agent Morris's testimony in April 1998 that the FBI had informed Bulger and Flemmi that Halloran was implicating them in Wheeler's murder and that he believed that Bulger and Flemmi may have killed Halloran. Agent Morris also testified that he informed Bulger and Flemmi of a bugged location that they should avoid. The Boston Globe and Boston Herald reported his testimony the next day. <i>See supra</i> Part I.D. While his testimony was not directly connected with the Callahan murder, the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders were long thought to be related. <i>See supra</i> Part I.C. For example, a December 1997 article reported that federal court hearings will \"probe whether FBI agents and federal organized crime prosecutors violated any federal laws or guidelines in the way they handled informants\" like Bulger and Flemmi, and that Florida police investigating the Callahan murder are \"hoping [the] hearings . . . will lead to a break in the case.\" Ralph Ranalli, <i>Police Reopen Mob Murder Probe,</i> Boston Herald, Dec. 15, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second event, made public on September 9, 1999, was Martorano's agreement to plead guilty to a number of murders, including the murder of Callahan. In the following days, Boston newspapers published several articles about Martorano's plea agreement and his willingness to implicate Bulger and Flemmi. <i>See supra</i> Part I.E. Further, Plaintiff was quoted in a September 12, 1999 article, saying that she was trying to forgive Martorano, the killer of her husband. Andrea Estes, <i>Outraged Hit Man Turned Rat for Revenge,</i> Boston Herald, Sept. 12, 1999. The same article clearly indicates that Bulger and Flemmi were involved in the Callahan murder and that Martorano would implicate them. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third event was the publication of Judge Wolf's opinion in <i>United States v. Salemme</i> on September 15, 1999. As we have already noted, his opinion discussed in depth the corrupt relationship between the FBI, Bulger, and Flemmi. That Judge Wolf's opinion contains a section titled \"The Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan Murders\" where he discusses the connections between the three murders, Bulger and Flemmi, and the FBI is particularly relevant. <i>Salemme,</i> 91 F.Supp.2d at 208-13. He details specific instances of clear misconduct, including attempts by the FBI to protect Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution, and attempts by Bulger and Flemmi to curry favor with the FBI agents. <i>See supra</i> Part I.F.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the extensive news reporting and the close connection of the events to her husband's death, we find that Plaintiff should have known the basic facts underlying these three events. Further, the reporting on these three events should have prompted Plaintiff to obtain certain publicly available documents, namely Morris's 1998 testimony, Martorano's plea agreement, and the <i>Salemme</i> decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts that Plaintiff should have known would have \"prompt[ed] a reasonable person to inquire and seek advice preliminary to deciding if there [was] a basis for filing an administrative claim against the government.\" <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78. John Martorano's plea agreement and Judge Wolf's opinion easily provide the requisite knowledge under the discovery rule that Bulger and Flemmi were responsible for the murder of Callahan. Moreover, Agent Morris's testimony and Judge Wolf's opinion easily provide the requisite knowledge that the FBI protected Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution and emboldened them to commit crimes, including the murder of Callahan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that conflicting information reasonably prevented her filing an administrative claim. First, she emphasizes that the FBI would not release the name of Callahan's killer as late as April 2000. Given Martorano's plea agreement, made public on September 9, 1999, we find this argument unavailing. Second, she contends that the FBI told her that she \"should not rely on newspaper stories\" and that \"reports were inaccurate.\" However, such statements do not specifically contradict any relevant information and even if they did, Plaintiff could surely rely on publicly available court documents for accurate information. Third, plaintiff argues that in the face of conflicting newspaper stories, she did not have sufficient, reliable information. Although she does not cite the newspaper articles, she claims that as late as 1997 newspapers reported government denials of a corrupt relationship between the FBI and Bulger and Flemmi. However, the lack of conflicting stories in 1998 and 1999 and the publicly available court documents allow us to easily dispose of this argument. Finally, Plaintiff makes much of a statement in Judge Wolf's September 15, 1999 opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the delayed disclosure of the Halloran documents by the government and of the failure of the adversary system to operate fully and effectively on this issue, questions remain regarding the role, if any, played by Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders, and the full degree to which the FBI in Boston has, from 1981 until recently, attempted to keep and such role from being discerned and demonstrated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement, however, hurts Plaintiff more than it helps her. Certainty is not required for a claim to accrue. Rather, Judge Wolf's statement would prompt a reasonable person to further investigate the matter by seeking legal advice in order to determine whether action should be taken against the government. This is all that is required for accrual. <i>Skwira,</i> 344 F.3d at 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Fraudulent Concealment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the discovery rule, the doctrine of fraudulent concealment is a means available to plaintiffs seeking to toll the statute of limitations. In order for a plaintiff to prevail on a fraudulent concealment claim, the defendant \"`must have engaged in fraud or deliberate concealment of material facts relating to his wrongdoing and the plaintiff must have failed to discover these facts within the normal limitations period despite his exercise of due diligence.'\" <i>Torres Ram&#237;rez v. Berm&#250;dez Garc&#237;a,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538368\"><a href=\"/opinion/538368/rafael-torres-ramirez-v-juan-bermudez-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>Hern&#225;ndez Jim&#233;nez v. Calero Toledo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369073\"><a href=\"/opinion/369073/francisco-hernandez-jimenez-v-astol-calero-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.1979)). During the course of this sordid affair, the FBI almost surely engaged in fraudulent concealment by denying any FBI complicity in the criminal activities of Bulger and Flemmi. We need not specifically address this, however, because we find that any fraudulent concealment by the FBI ended no later than October 1, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff claims that the FBI engaged in fraudulent concealment when agents refused to tell her who killed Callahan. Any purported fraudulent concealment of this fact ended when portions of Martorano's plea agreement were made public on September 9, 1999. The public portion of the plea agreement stated that Martorano would plead guilty to the murder of Callahan. Even if after this date FBI agents refused to tell Plaintiff who killed Callahan, this fact was no longer concealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff also claims fraudulent concealment as a result of FBI agents' statements to her that she \"should not rely on newspaper stories\" and that \"reports were inaccurate.\" Such general statements cannot rise to the level of fraudulent concealment because they do not even indicate which newspaper stories are inaccurate or should not be relied upon. Further, the statements have a non-fraudulent explanation. The FBI agents could simply have been evading Plaintiff's questions because they did not wish to discuss a pending criminal prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already decided in considering the discovery rule that Plaintiff should have known of sufficient facts by October 1, 1999 to prompt a reasonable person to file an administrative claim. The reason that Plaintiff should have known of these facts is that they were easily discoverable had she diligently (or even not so diligently) kept herself informed of the legal proceedings and news reporting of events closely related to Callahan's murder. Thus, Plaintiff had either discovered the purportedly concealed information or was not diligent in seeking to obtain it. Either way, we find no fraudulent concealment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that Plaintiff's claim accrued no later than October 1, 1999, which was more than two years before she filed her administrative claim, and we find that any fraudulent concealment by the government ended before this date, we affirm the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff stated rather cryptically in her complaint that \"[c]omplaints of this activity fell on deaf ears.\" From this we presume that Callahan complained to Wheeler even though other sources portray Callahan less innocently<i>See Salemme,</i> 91 F.Supp.2d at 208-09 (\"Wheeler suspected that Callahan was skimming money from World Jai Lai for members of the Winter Hill Gang, including Halloran, Bulger, and Flemmi. Thus, he fired Callahan . . . and began an audit.\") (internal citations omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiff does not admit that Callahan partook in any illegal activity or had any involvement with the Winter Hill Gang. Agent Morris did not believe Halloran's implication of Bulger and Flemmi and thought Halloran was lying.
