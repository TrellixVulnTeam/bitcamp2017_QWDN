Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Dana A.

This is an appeal from the district\n\ncourt's denial of habeas relief to Francesco Campiti.                The outcome\n\nis   certain   but    an    opinion    is     warranted   because    of   several\n\nimportant, potentially recurring issues en route, two of which we\n\ndecide:     one concerns the timeliness of the appeal and the other\n\nthe order in which claims of wrongfully withheld evidence are\n\naddressed.     The background events in the case can be briefly\n\nstated.\n\n            Campiti was convicted in Massachusetts state court in\n\nMarch   1989   of    drug   trafficking.         At   trial,   two   accomplices\n\ntestified against Campiti.            One, Joseph Rego, testified that he\n\ntraveled three times with Campiti to Florida in 1986 where Campiti\n\nacquired in total five kilograms of cocaine for Rego and others to\n\nsmuggle back to Boston.       Joseph Labriola reported three more trips\n\nin the same year, with Campiti or at his behest, to bring back\n\nmultiple kilograms of cocaine to Boston.\n\n             At trial, the jury also heard audio tapes in which\n\nCampiti was heard to tell associates that he had given out \"nine\"\n\nthe previous day, this referring (in the prosecution's view) to\n\nnine ounces of cocaine and also advising an associate to \"talk in\n\nriddles.\"      The jury also learned of a November 1986 search of\n\nCampiti's house and the house of another Campiti associate; the\n\nlatter yielded 412 grams of cocaine.              After the search, the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwas told, Campiti fled to Florida, having altered his features and\n\nassumed a false name.\n\n           Following his conviction, Campiti was sentenced to five\n\n10-to-15-year terms in prison, four of which were to be served\n\nconsecutively.   By post-trial motion and then in the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court, Campiti made various claims including the one\n\ncentral to his appeal in this court: that the prosecutor at trial\n\nhad failed to reveal useful impeachment information concerning John\n\nMace.   Mace was a state police officer who had testified against\n\nCampiti at trial by supplying, along with another testifying\n\nofficer,   information    that      laid    the   background     and   served   to\n\nauthenticate the audio tapes played at trial.\n\n           The impeachment information derived from an event on\n\nOctober 23, 1989, some seven months after Campiti's conviction.\n\nThat evening, a young prosecutor, returning late to his office,\n\nfound Mace burning files and was attacked by Mace with a knife.\n\nMace had been burning records to conceal his embezzlement of funds\n\nincluding, it turned out, some funds relating to Campiti's crimes.\n\nMace was convicted of embezzlement in March 1990.                  In Campiti's\n\npost-trial proceedings and appeal, he argued that the underlying\n\nembezzlement–-known      at   the    time    of   trial   only    to   Mace–-was\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fimpeachment evidence that had to be disclosed under Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).1\n\n              The state trial and appeals courts rejected the Brady\n\nclaim, the latter pointing out that the evidence against Campiti\n\nwas \"voluminous.\"      Campiti v. Commonwealth, 668 N.E.2d 1308, 1322\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1994), review denied, 671 N.E.2d 951 (Mass. 1996).\n\nCampiti then brought the present habeas action in the federal\n\ndistrict court. That court in turn denied relief, saying that Mace\n\nwas not a critical figure in the trial and that the other evidence\n\nagainst Campiti was strong, Campiti v. Matesanz, 186 F. Supp. 2d.\n\n29,   50-52    (D.   Mass.   2002),   but   it   granted   a   certificate   of\n\nappealability. We review the district court determination de novo.\n\nNadeau v. Matesanz, 289 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 2002).2\n\n              At the threshold, the state asserts that Campiti's appeal\n\nis untimely so that we lack jurisdiction. After the district court\n\ndenied relief on February 28, 2002, Campiti filed a timely motion\n\nfor reconsideration, tolling the time to appeal; the motion was\n\ndenied on March 26, 2002, giving Campiti 30 days to appeal.              Fed.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Campiti suggests that the other officers who testified in\nsupport of the audio tapes may also have known about Mace's\nthieving but turned a blind eye.      He points to nothing to\nsubstantiate this suggestion.\n      2\n      Under habeas law the underlying state court determinations\nmay be disregarded only to the extent that they are contrary to or\nan incorrect application of clearly established federal law. See\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (2000); McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 35\n(1st Cir. 2002) (en banc).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fR. App. P. 4(a)(1), 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Before this denial Campiti had\n\nsought, and the district court had granted, an extension of 120\n\ndays to file this appeal.           Unfortunately, Rule 4 permits an\n\nextension of only 30 days after the original 30 days for the appeal\n\nexpires or the motion is granted, so Campiti had at most until May\n\n28, 2002, to appeal (the first business day after May 25).           Fed. R.\n\nApp. P.    4(a)(5)(C), 26(a)(3).\n\n            Campiti's notice of appeal, filed on July 23, 2002, was\n\ntherefore untimely unless rescued by some other doctrine or device.\n\nAn appeal is normally taken by filing in the district court, within\n\nthe time allowed by Rule 4, a notice of appeal providing specified\n\ninformation (primarily, parties, judgment appealed from, and court\n\nto which the appeal is taken).       Fed. R. App. P. 3(a)(1), (c)(1).\n\nHowever, this requirement may be satisfied by the filing of the\n\n\"functional    equivalent,\"    so   long   as   it   gives   the   pertinent\n\ninformation and evinces an intention to appeal.              E.g., Smith v.\n\nBarry, 502 U.S. 244, 248-49 (1992).\n\n            Here, Campiti relies on both his March 11, 2002, request\n\nfor an extension of time and his April 19, 2002, request for\n\nappointment of counsel.       Whether a particular type of document is\n\nthe functional equivalent of a notice of appeal may depend on its\n\ncontent and surrounding circumstances rather than on any general\n\nrule.     Here, we bypass the question whether the request for an\n\nextension satisfies the doctrine, an issue on which the circuits\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhave taken different views,3 because we are satisfied that this\n\nrequest for counsel does meet the requirements.       Under the case\n\ncaption, the request read:\n\n          I am the petitioner in the above captioned\n          habeas corpus proceeding. My counsel, Vincent\n          Bongiorni, Esq., has been allowed to withdraw\n          by the court.\n\n          I am indigent and hereby request that the\n          court appoint counsel to represent me for the\n          purposes of filing a notice of appeal and a\n          request for a certificate of appealability. A\n          financial affidavit is attached for the\n          court's consideration.\n\n          This document plainly evidences an intention to appeal.\n\nIt asks for counsel to be appointed \"for the purposes of filing a\n\nnotice   of   appeal\"   and   for   requesting   a   certificate   of\n\nappealability.   See Ray v. Cowley, 975 F.2d 1478, 1478-79 (10th\n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Ward, 696 F.2d 1315, 1318 (11th Cir.\n\n1983).   Admittedly, the document does not specify the judgment\n\nappealed from or the appellate court; but here, where no doubt\n\nexists as to either, Rule 3 buttressed by latitude for a pro se\n\nlitigant forgives these \"informalit[ies] of form.\" Fed. R. App. P.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Compare Harris v. Ballard, 158 F.3d 1164, 1166 (11th Cir.\n1998) (motion for extension insufficient), with Listenbee v. City\nof Milwaukee, 976 F.2d 348, 350-51 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding\nopposite).   Our own circuit, in a pre-Smith case, held that a\nmotion for an extension of a time could not be construed as the\nnotice itself. See Thomas v. Morton Int'l, Inc., 916 F.2d 39, 40\n(1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam). We have no reason here to consider\nwhether that conclusion survives Smith.\n\n                                -6-\n\f3(c)(4).    See also Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312,\n\n316-17 (1988); Grune v. Coughlin, 913 F.2d 41, 43 (2d Cir. 1990).\n\n            This brings us to the merits.               Brady relief requires a\n\ndouble showing, namely, that the prosecution wrongly withheld\n\nevidence that      it    should   have    disclosed      and    that     this   caused\n\nprejudice to the defendant.            Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263,\n\n281-82 (1999).          Whether the prosecutor can be deemed to have\n\nwrongly    withheld      information     he    does     not    possess    where     the\n\ninformation   is    about    unrelated         crimes    committed       by   his   own\n\npoliceman-witness, is an unusual question with major ramifications.\n\nCf. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 438 (1995).                    Ordinarily, we\n\nwould bypass it in a case where--as here--the non-disclosure\n\nplainly did not affect the result.\n\n            The state, which for future guidance wants a negative\n\nanswer to the question whether disclosure was required at all,\n\nargues that we must decide whether such a rule exists and applies\n\nto the case before reaching the prejudice question.                      The reasons\n\nfor the state's concern about future disclosure are obvious; but\n\nthe state may be wrong in thinking that a bright-line answer can be\n\nprovided for all cases in which the prosecutor is ignorant but\n\nothers connected with his side possess exculpatory information. In\n\nall events, the state's claim that we must decide the \"wrongful\n\nwithholding\" issue first is ingenious but flatly wrong.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            The state bases this priority claim on two Supreme Court\n\ncases.    One, Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 307 (1989), bars habeas\n\nrelief except in narrow circumstances if the defendant relies on a\n\nnew rule of constitutional law established after his conviction.\n\nSee also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1); Horn v. Banks, 122 S.Ct. 2147,\n\n2151 (2002) (per curiam).    The other, Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S.\n\n383, 389-90 (1994), reversed a grant of habeas relief where the\n\ncircuit court failed to consider the state's argument that the\n\nclaim rested on a new constitutional rule and therefore that Teague\n\nforeclosed a grant of relief.    See also Horn, 122 S. Ct. at 2150-\n\n51.\n\n            Since Caspari, two circuits have rejected the claim that\n\nCaspari and Horn create some kind of absolute priority rule,\n\nobligating a court to decide Teague issues before others, but one\n\ncircuit court said that the Teague issue must be resolved first,\n\nand another may share the same view.4      We think that Caspari and\n\nHorn have nothing to do with obligatory priorities: in both cases,\n\nthe lower courts had granted relief without considering seemingly\n\npreserved    Teague   objections–-a    straightforward   merits   error\n\ncompelling reversal. Neither Supreme Court case involved the lower\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      Compare Eaglin v. Welborn, 57 F.3d 496, 499 (7th Cir. 1995)\n(en banc) and Townes v. Murray, 68 F.3d 840, 847-48 (4th Cir. 1995)\n(rejecting such claims) with Sweet v. Delo, 125 F.3d 1144, 1155\n(8th Cir. 1997), (accepting the claim) and Williams v. Cain, 229\nF.3d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 2000) (leaning that way).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcourt's denial of habeas relief on some ground that made it\n\nunnecessary to reach Teague.\n\n          There    is   no   obvious   reason   why   there   should   be   a\n\ncompulsory priority for Teague issues where the court can resolve\n\nthe matter on narrower or easier grounds.        The suggestion has been\n\nmade that putting Teague first avoids deciding a constitutional\n\nissue, i.e., whether the alleged new constitutional rule exists,\n\nsee Townes, 68 F.3d at 855 (concurring opinion).              But avoiding\n\nconstitutional issues is a presumption, not a requirement, e.g.,\n\nHarris v. United States, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 2413 (2002), and Teague\n\nissues themselves involve readings of constitutional precedent.\n\nFurther, the avoidance precept itself is beside the point where, as\n\nhere, the shortcut to the result is a garden variety prejudice\n\nissue.\n\n          Only as a last resort should the circuit courts read\n\nSupreme Court decisions to create such mandatory priorities.                A\n\ncircuit court judge may, in an average circuit, be responsible for\n\n50 full-scale opinions a year and may vote on several hundred\n\nmerits cases.     See 2002 Federal Courts Management Statistics 26.\n\nSome circuits have heavier loads as do many district judges.\n\nAnything that precludes judges from taking the shortest distance to\n\na result impairs their ability to give truly difficult cases the\n\ntime they require.      In sum, we reject the state's claim that we\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fmust decide whether Teague bars the particular reading of Brady\n\nthat Campiti proffers.\n\n          Turning then to the issue of prejudice, we join both\n\nstate courts in this case and the district court in concluding that\n\nMace's wrongdoing, even if it had been confessed by Mace on the\n\nwitness stand, would not have altered the result.            The audio tapes\n\ndid not depend on Mace–-a second officer also testified–-but even\n\nif the tapes had been eliminated from the case, two accomplices\n\ngave direct   evidence    against    Campiti   and,   when    his   home   was\n\nsearched, he fled from the state and assumed a new identity.               The\n\noutcome was inevitable.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

That evening, a young prosecutor, returning late to his office, found Mace burning files and was attacked by Mace with a knife. Mace had been burning records to conceal his embezzlement of funds including, it turned out, some funds relating to Campiti's crimes. Mace was convicted of embezzlement in March 1990. In Campiti's post-trial proceedings and appeal, he argued that the underlying embezzlement &#8212; known at the time of trial only to Mace &#8212; was impeachment evidence that had to be disclosed under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state trial and appeals courts rejected the <i>Brady</i> claim, the latter pointing out that the evidence against Campiti was \"voluminous.\" <i>Commonwealth v.

Campiti then brought the present habeas action in the federal district court. That court in turn denied relief, saying that Mace was not a critical figure in the trial and that the other evidence against Campiti was strong, <i>Campiti v.

Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Whether the prosecutor can be deemed to have wrongly withheld information he does not possess where the information is about unrelated crimes committed by his own policeman-witness, is an unusual question with major ramifications. <i>Cf. Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Ordinarily, we would bypass it in a case where &#8212; as here &#8212; the non-disclosure plainly did not affect the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state, which for future guidance wants a negative answer to the question whether disclosure was required at all, argues that we <i>must</i> decide whether such a rule exists and applies to the case before reaching the prejudice question. The reasons for the state's concern about future disclosure are obvious; but the state may be wrong in thinking that a bright-line answer can be provided for all cases in which the prosecutor is ignorant but others connected with his side possess exculpatory information. In all events, the state's claim that we must decide the \"wrongful withholding\" issue first is ingenious but flatly wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state bases this priority claim on two Supreme Court cases. One, <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), bars habeas relief except in narrow circumstances if the defendant relies on a new rule of constitutional law established after his conviction. <i>See also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1); <i>Horn v. Banks,</i> 536 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 2151, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) (per curiam). The other, <i>Caspari v. Bohlen,</i> 510 U.S. 383, 389-90, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994), reversed a grant of habeas relief where the circuit court failed to consider the state's argument that the claim rested on a new constitutional rule and therefore that <i>Teague</i> foreclosed a grant of relief. <i>See also Horn,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2150-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Caspari,</i> two circuits have rejected the claim that <i>Caspari</i> and <i>Horn</i> create some kind of absolute priority rule, obligating a court to decide <i>Teague</i> issues before others, but one circuit court said that the <i>Teague</i> issue must be resolved first, and another may share the same view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We think that <i>Caspari</i> and <i>Horn</i> have nothing to do with obligatory priorities: in both cases, the lower courts had <i>granted</i> relief without considering seemingly preserved <i>Teague</i> objections &#8212; a straightforward merits error compelling reversal. Neither Supreme Court case involved the lower court's <i>denial</i> of habeas relief on some ground that made it unnecessary to reach <i>Teague.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no obvious reason why there should be a compulsory priority for <i>Teague</i> issues where the court can resolve the matter on narrower or easier grounds. The suggestion has been made that putting <i>Teague</i> first avoids deciding a constitutional issue, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the alleged new constitutional rule exists, <i>see Townes,</i> 68 F.3d at 855 (concurring opinion). But avoiding constitutional issues is a presumption, not a requirement, <i>e.g., Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2413, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), and <i>Teague</i> issues themselves involve readings of constitutional precedent. Further, the avoidance precept itself is beside the point where, as here, the shortcut to the result is a garden variety prejudice issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only as a last resort should the circuit courts read Supreme Court decisions to create such mandatory priorities. A circuit court judge may, in an average circuit, be responsible for 50 full-scale opinions a year and may vote on several hundred merits cases. <i>See</i> 2002 Federal Courts Management Statistics 26. Some circuits have heavier loads as do many district judges. Anything that precludes judges from taking the shortest distance to a result impairs their ability to give truly difficult cases the time they require. In sum, we reject the state's claim that we must decide whether <i>Teague</i> bars the particular reading of <i>Brady</i> that Campiti proffers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the issue of prejudice, we join both state courts in this case and the district court in concluding that Mace's wrongdoing, even if it had been confessed by Mace on the witness stand, would not have altered the result. The audio tapes did not depend on Mace &#8212; a second officer also testified &#8212; but even if the tapes had been eliminated from the case, two accomplices gave direct evidence against Campiti and, when his home was searched, he fled from the state and assumed a new identity.

The outcome is certain but an opinion is warranted because of several important, potentially recurring issues en route, two of which we decide: one concerns the timeliness of the appeal and the other the order in which claims of wrongfully withheld evidence are addressed. The background events in the case can be briefly stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campiti was convicted in Massachusetts state court in March 1989 of drug trafficking. At trial, two accomplices testified against Campiti. One, Joseph Rego, testified that he traveled three times with Campiti to Florida in 1986 where Campiti acquired in total five kilograms of cocaine for Rego and others to smuggle back to Boston. Joseph Labriola reported three more trips in the same year, with Campiti or at his behest, to bring back multiple kilograms of cocaine to Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the jury also heard audio tapes in which Campiti was heard to tell associates that he had given out \"nine\" the previous day, this referring (in the prosecution's view) to nine ounces of cocaine and also advising an associate to \"talk in riddles.\" The jury also learned of a November 1986 search of Campiti's house and the house of another Campiti associate; the latter yielded 412 grams of cocaine. After the search, the jury was told, Campiti fled to Florida, having altered his features and assumed a false name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his conviction, Campiti was sentenced to five 10-to-15-year terms in prison, four of which were to be served consecutively. By post-trial motion and then in the Massachusetts Appeals Court, Campiti made various claims including the one central to his appeal in this court: that the prosecutor at trial had failed to reveal useful impeachment information concerning John Mace. Mace was a state police officer who had testified against Campiti at trial by supplying, along with another testifying officer, information that laid the background and served to authenticate the audio tapes played at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impeachment information derived from an event on October 23, 1989, some seven months <i>after</i> Campiti's conviction. That evening, a young prosecutor, returning late to his office, found Mace burning files and was attacked by Mace with a knife. Mace had been burning records to conceal his embezzlement of funds including, it turned out, some funds relating to Campiti's crimes. Mace was convicted of embezzlement in March 1990. In Campiti's post-trial proceedings and appeal, he argued that the underlying embezzlement &#8212; known at the time of trial only to Mace &#8212; was impeachment evidence that had to be disclosed under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Campiti,</i> 41 Mass.App.Ct. 43, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span>, 1322 (1994), <i>review denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">951</span></span> (1996). Campiti then brought the present habeas action in the federal district court. That court in turn denied relief, saying that Mace was not a critical figure in the trial and that the other evidence against Campiti was strong, <i>Campiti v. Matesanz,</i> 186 F.Supp.2d. 29, 50-52 (D.Mass.2002), but it granted a certificate of appealability. We review the district court determination <i>de novo. Nadeau v.

After the district court denied relief on February 28, 2002, Campiti filed a timely motion for reconsideration, tolling the time to appeal; the motion was denied on March 26, 2002, giving Campiti 30 days to appeal. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1), 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Before this denial Campiti had sought, and the district court had granted, an extension of 120 days to file this appeal. Unfortunately, Rule 4 permits an extension of only 30 days after the original 30 days for the appeal expires or the motion is granted, so Campiti had at most until May 28, 2002, to appeal (the first business day after May 25). Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(5)(C), 26(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Campiti's notice of appeal, filed on July 23, 2002, was therefore untimely unless rescued by some other doctrine or device. An appeal is normally taken by filing in the district court, within the time allowed by Rule 4, a notice of appeal providing specified information (primarily, parties, judgment appealed from, and court to which the appeal is taken).

Whitley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 438, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (1995). Ordinarily, we would bypass it in a case where &#8212; as here &#8212; the non-disclosure plainly did not affect the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state, which for future guidance wants a negative answer to the question whether disclosure was required at all, argues that we <i>must</i> decide whether such a rule exists and applies to the case before reaching the prejudice question. The reasons for the state's concern about future disclosure are obvious; but the state may be wrong in thinking that a bright-line answer can be provided for all cases in which the prosecutor is ignorant but others connected with his side possess exculpatory information. In all events, the state's claim that we must decide the \"wrongful withholding\" issue first is ingenious but flatly wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state bases this priority claim on two Supreme Court cases. One, <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span> (1989), bars habeas relief except in narrow circumstances if the defendant relies on a new rule of constitutional law established after his conviction. <i>See also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1); <i>Horn v. Banks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121156\"><a href=\"/opinion/121156/horn-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121156\"><a href=\"/opinion/121156/horn-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span> (2002) (per curiam). The other, <i>Caspari v. Bohlen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112928\"><a href=\"/opinion/112928/caspari-v-bohlen/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 389-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112928\"><a href=\"/opinion/112928/caspari-v-bohlen/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112928\"><a href=\"/opinion/112928/caspari-v-bohlen/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span> (1994), reversed a grant of habeas relief where the circuit court failed to consider the state's argument that the claim rested on a new constitutional rule and therefore that <i>Teague</i> foreclosed a grant of relief. <i>See also Horn,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2150-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Caspari,</i> two circuits have rejected the claim that <i>Caspari</i> and <i>Horn</i> create some kind of absolute priority rule, obligating a court to decide <i>Teague</i> issues before others, but one circuit court said that the <i>Teague</i> issue must be resolved first, and another may share the same view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We think that <i>Caspari</i> and <i>Horn</i> have nothing to do with obligatory priorities: in both cases, the lower courts had <i>granted</i> relief without considering seemingly preserved <i>Teague</i> objections &#8212; a straightforward merits error compelling reversal. Neither Supreme Court case involved the lower court's <i>denial</i> of habeas relief on some ground that made it unnecessary to reach <i>Teague.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no obvious reason why there should be a compulsory priority for <i>Teague</i> issues where the court can resolve the matter on narrower or easier grounds. The suggestion has been made that putting <i>Teague</i> first avoids deciding a constitutional issue, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the alleged new constitutional rule exists, <i>see Townes,</i> 68 F.3d at 855 (concurring opinion). But avoiding constitutional issues is a presumption, not a requirement, <i>e.g., Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2406</span></a></span>, 2413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span> (2002), and <i>Teague</i> issues themselves involve readings of constitutional precedent. Further, the avoidance precept itself is beside the point where, as here, the shortcut to the result is a garden variety prejudice issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only as a last resort should the circuit courts read Supreme Court decisions to create such mandatory priorities. A circuit court judge may, in an average circuit, be responsible for 50 full-scale opinions a year and may vote on several hundred merits cases. <i>See</i> 2002 Federal Courts Management Statistics 26. Some circuits have heavier loads as do many district judges. Anything that precludes judges from taking the shortest distance to a result impairs their ability to give truly difficult cases the time they require. In sum, we reject the state's claim that we must decide whether <i>Teague</i> bars the particular reading of <i>Brady</i> that Campiti proffers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the issue of prejudice, we join both state courts in this case and the district court in concluding that Mace's wrongdoing, even if it had been confessed by Mace on the witness stand, would not have altered the result. The audio tapes did not depend on Mace &#8212; a second officer also testified &#8212; but even if the tapes had been eliminated from the case, two accomplices gave direct evidence against Campiti and, when his home was searched, he fled from the state and assumed a new identity. The outcome was inevitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Campiti suggests that the other officers who testified in support of the audio tapes may also have known about Mace's thieving but turned a blind eye.
