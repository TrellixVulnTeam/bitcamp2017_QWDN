Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                 Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                   and DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Malcolm Reed Hopper, with whom Gregory T. Broderick was on\nbrief for appellants.\n     John L. Smeltzer, with whom Kelly A. Johnson, Acting Assistant\nAttorney General and Ellen Durkee, Attorney, Department of Justice\nEnvironment & Natural Resources Division, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                          October 31, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.            Following the panel's decision in\n\nthis case, see United States v. Johnson, 437 F.3d 157 (1st. Cir.\n\n2006), appellants moved for rehearing en banc, noting the Supreme\n\nCourt's grant of certiorari in United States v. Rapanos, 376 F.3d\n\n629 (6th Cir. 2004).         We held their petition in abeyance pending a\n\ndecision in that case. Following the decision in Rapanos v. United\n\nStates,     547    U.S.     ___,     126     S.Ct.    2208     (2006),     appellants\n\nsupplemented their previous petition.                They request that we grant\n\nrehearing    en    banc     to    resolve    the    conflict   between     the   panel\n\ndecision and Rapanos, or, alternately, that we vacate the decision\n\nwith prejudice on the ground that the evidence in the record\n\nsupports a judgment in their favor.                     The government filed a\n\nresponse requesting that we vacate our previous decision and remand\n\nto the district court.           After careful consideration, we vacate and\n\nremand    for     further     proceedings         consistent    with     Rapanos,   as\n\ndescribed below.\n\n\n\n                             I.    The Panel Decision\n\n            This case began when the United States filed a civil\n\naction alleging that defendants (now appellants), a group of\n\ncranberry       farmers     in    Carver,     Massachusetts,       had     discharged\n\npollutants into federally-regulated waters without a permit in\n\nviolation of § 301 and § 502 of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), 33\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1311, 1352.            In response, appellants contended that the\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fUnited States lacked jurisdiction over the three properties in\n\nquestion: (1) the Cross Street site; (2) the Fosdick Street site;\n\nand (3) the Forest/Fuller Street site (collectively, the \"target\n\nsites\").\n\n           In separate rulings on liability and remedy, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of the government.                   The\n\ndistrict   court     denied    appellants'    motion   for    reconsideration,\n\nstating that \"there is a sufficient basis for the United States to\n\nexercise jurisdiction because the undisputed evidence shows that\n\nthe three wetlands are hydrologically connected to the navigable\n\nWeweantic River by nonnavigable tributaries.\"\n\n           In an appeal to this court, appellants challenged the\n\ndistrict court's judgment that the jurisdiction of the CWA extends\n\nto the target sites.        First, they asserted that their property is\n\nnot   covered   by    the     Environmental    Protection     Agency    (\"EPA\")\n\nregulation promulgated to carry out the CWA.             In the alternative,\n\nappellants   argued     that,    if   their   property   is   covered   by   the\n\nregulation, either the regulation exceeds the authority granted by\n\nthe CWA, or the CWA exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce\n\nClause.\n\n           We affirmed the trial court's judgment in a divided\n\ndecision, with two members of the panel concurring in the judgment\n\nfor different reasons, and one member dissenting.               One member of\n\nthe majority concluded that the hydrological connection between the\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ftarget sites and the Weweantic River establishes a \"significant\n\nnexus\" between the sites and the river, sufficient to establish\n\njurisdiction under the CWA without creating constitutional issues\n\nunder the Commerce Clause.             For two of the target sites, in the\n\nview    of   this   judge,    the     hydrological    connection     depended   on\n\ndiffusion of water through wetlands.               See 437 F.3d at 162.\n\n             The    other    member     of   the   majority   read   the   record\n\ndifferently to conclude that the hydrological connection was a\n\nsystem of tributaries, some of which happened to flow through\n\nwetlands or other bogs.          See id. at 182.       The concurring panelist\n\nthus concluded that it was unnecessary to decide whether the\n\ndiffusion of water through wetlands was a sufficient hydrological\n\nconnection to support a \"significant nexus.\"               Id.\n\n             The dissent concluded that the United States \"may not\n\nconstitutionally regulate wetlands that are neither themselves\n\nnavigable nor truly adjacent to navigable waters.\"                    Id. at 187\n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).              Moreover, even if the\n\nEPA's assertion of jurisdiction was constitutional, the dissent\n\nwould    have      held   that    the    government's     attempt     to   assert\n\njurisdiction over appellants' wetlands is inconsistent with its own\n\nregulations because the system of tributaries linking the target\n\nsites to the Weweantic includes other wetlands.                      Because the\n\nregulations explicitly exclude wetlands adjacent to waters that are\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthemselves wetlands, the dissent argued that the government lacked\n\njurisdiction under its own regulations.                         Id. at 187.1\n\n\n\n                       II.    Response to the Panel Decision\n\n               As noted, appellants filed a petition for rehearing en\n\nbanc       pursuant    to    Rule     35    of     the    Federal      Rules    of    Appellate\n\nProcedure,       arguing that the case should be reheard following the\n\nSupreme Court's then-pending decision in Rapanos.                                    We ordered\n\nappellants' petition held in abeyance pending the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Rapanos.               We further stated that appellants could file\n\na supplemental petition for rehearing en banc within fourteen days\n\nafter the decision in Rapanos was issued, and the government could\n\nthen respond.\n\n\n\n                            III.    Rapanos v. United States\n\n               The decision in Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S. ___,\n\n126 S.Ct. 2208 (2006), resolved two consolidated cases from the\n\nSixth       Circuit.         In    one     case,    the       United    States    brought      an\n\nenforcement       action          alleging       that     property       owners      and    their\n\naffiliated       businesses          deposited         fill    materials       into    wetlands\n\nwithout a permit, in violation of the CWA.                             Id. at 2219.        In the\n\n\n\n       1\n      The regulation states that \"waters of the United States\"\ninclude \"[w]etlands adjacent to waters (other than waters that are\nthemselves wetlands) identified in paragraphs (s)(1)-(6) of this\nsection.\" 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(s)(7).\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fother,   property   owners    were   denied   a   permit   to   deposit   fill\n\nmaterial in a wetland approximately one mile from a lake and, after\n\nexhausting their administrative appeals, they filed suit.              Id.\n\n            In both cases, the district court found that there was\n\nfederal regulatory jurisdiction over the sites in question, and the\n\nSixth Circuit affirmed.       The Supreme Court then consolidated the\n\ncases and granted certiorari to decide whether these wetlands\n\nconstitute \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA, and, if so,\n\nwhether the CWA is constitutional.         See id. at 2220.\n\n            The Court issued a split decision construing the phrase\n\n\"waters of the United States\" as used in the CWA.               The plurality\n\nconcluded that the phrase \"waters of the United States\" includes\n\nonly \"relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies\n\nof water 'forming geographic features' that are described in\n\nordinary parlance as 'streams[,] . . . oceans, rivers, [and]\n\nlakes.'\"    Id. at 2225.     Thus, for purposes of determining federal\n\nregulatory jurisdiction, \"only those wetlands with a continuous\n\nsurface connection to bodies that are 'waters of the United States'\n\nin their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between\n\n'waters' and wetlands, are 'adjacent to' such waters and covered by\n\nthe Act.\"     Id. at 2226 (emphasis in original).               The plurality\n\nvacated the decision of the Sixth Circuit in both cases and, noting\n\n\"the paucity of the record,\" remanded for further proceedings. Id.\n\nat 2235.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f              Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment, but rejected\n\nthe plurality's rationale. Instead, he concluded that jurisdiction\n\nextends to wetlands that \"possess a 'significant nexus' to waters\n\nthat are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so\n\nmade.\"    Id. at 2236.      Justice Kennedy further found that wetlands\n\n\"possess the requisite nexus\" if \"either alone or in combination\n\nwith similarly situated lands in the region, [they] significantly\n\naffect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other\n\ncovered waters more readily understood as 'navigable.'\"               Id. at\n\n2248.    Where the wetlands in question are \"adjacent to navigable-\n\nin-fact waters, [the government] may rely on adjacency to establish\n\nits jurisdiction.\"      Id. at 2249.     Where the wetlands are adjacent\n\nto nonnavigable tributaries, \"[a]bsent more specific regulations\n\n. . . [the government] must establish a significant nexus on a\n\ncase-by-case basis.\"        Id. at 2249.\n\n              Justice Stevens authored a dissent joined by three other\n\nJustices.      In the view of the dissenters, to the extent that the\n\nCWA includes a \"significant nexus\" requirement, this requirement\n\n\"is categorically satisfied as to wetlands adjacent to navigable\n\nwaters or their tributaries.\"              Id. at 2263-64.       The dissent\n\nconcluded by noting specifically that \"all four Justices who have\n\njoined this opinion would uphold the Corps' jurisdiction . . . in\n\nall   other    cases   in   which   either   the   plurality's   or   Justice\n\nKennedy's test is satisfied . . . .\"          Id. at 2265.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                          IV.      Subsequent Motions\n\n            Following    the     Supreme        Court's   decision    in    Rapanos,\n\nappellants filed a supplemental petition for rehearing en banc\n\nchallenging    the    view    in    one    of    the   panel   opinions      that    a\n\nhydrological connection constitutes a jurisdictionally sufficient\n\n\"significant    nexus.\"         Appellants        contend   that     rehearing      is\n\nnecessary to resolve the tension between the panel opinion and\n\nRapanos.    They argue that under either the plurality opinion or\n\nJustice    Kennedy's    concurrence,        a     hydrological     connection       is\n\ninsufficient to establish jurisdiction, although they also argue\n\nstrenuously    that     the     plurality's        test   alone    should     apply.\n\nAlternatively, appellants          contend that the evidence in the record\n\nis sufficient to support a finding in their favor under the\n\nstandards in Rapanos, and urge that we vacate the decision and\n\ndirect the district court to enter judgment for them.\n\n            The United States opposes the petition for en banc review\n\nand urges us instead to vacate the panel's decision and remand the\n\ncase to the district court.          The government argues that additional\n\nfactfinding is necessary before the legal principles articulated in\n\nRapanos can be applied in this case.                   Moreover, the government\n\nasserts that on remand it should be allowed to establish CWA\n\njurisdiction under either the Rapanos plurality's test or Justice\n\nKennedy's test.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                   V.   Remand to the District Court\n\n            We agree with the government that remand to the district\n\ncourt for application of the Rapanos standards is appropriate. The\n\nparties presented their cases in the district court without any\n\nawareness of the standards that now apply.      They should now have an\n\nopportunity to develop their positions in the district court with\n\nan awareness of these standards.         However, the question of what\n\nlegal standard to apply is one of some complexity, and other courts\n\nhave taken varying approaches to the issue.       We conclude that the\n\nUnited States may assert jurisdiction over the target sites if it\n\nmeets either Justice Kennedy's legal standard or that of the\n\nplurality.    We explain our reasoning.\n\n\n\n              A.   Other Courts’ Application of Rapanos\n\n     In the months since Rapanos, four courts have applied its\n\nlegal standards - two district courts and two courts of appeals.\n\n\n\n                        1. Decisions of District Courts\n\n     In United States v. Evans, 2006 WL 2221629 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 2,\n\n2006), the Middle District of Florida adopted Justice Stevens's\n\nsuggestion to apply either the plurality’s or Justice Kennedy’s\n\nstandard.    That court cited the Supreme Court's decision in Marks\n\nv. United States for the proposition that \"[w]hen a fragmented\n\nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fenjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be\n\nviewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the\n\njudgments on the narrowest grounds.\" Evans at *19 (citing Marks v.\n\nUnited States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977)).                 The court noted that\n\n\"'narrowest grounds' is understood as the 'less far-reaching'\n\ncommon ground,\" Evans at *19 (citing Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of\n\nthe Univ. of Ga., 263 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001)), but found\n\nthat    because    the    plurality       and   Justice   Kennedy   articulated\n\ndifferent standards for application on remand it was unclear which\n\nwould   control.         Hence,    the    court   adopted   Justice   Stevens's\n\napproach.    Evans at *19.\n\n            The Northern District of Texas used a sharply contrasting\n\napproach in United States v. Chevron Pipe Line Co., 437 F.Supp.2d\n\n605 (N.D. Tex. 2006), determining that because of the lack of a\n\nclear legal standard in Rapanos, it would instead rely on precedent\n\nwithin its own circuit.           The court noted that \"the Supreme Court\n\nfailed to reach a consensus of a majority as to the jurisdictional\n\nboundary of the CWA.\"        It added that Justice Kennedy \"advanced an\n\nambiguous test--whether a 'significant nexus' exists to waters that\n\nare/were/might be navigable.             This test leaves no guidance on how\n\nto implement its vague, subjective centerpiece.               That is, exactly\n\nwhat is 'significant' and how is a 'nexus' determined?\"               Id. at 613\n\n(internal citation omitted).             The court then concluded:\n\n       Because Justice Kennedy failed to elaborate on the\n       'significant nexus' required, this Court will look to the\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      prior reasoning in this circuit.      The Fifth Circuit, as\n      discussed above, has interpreted 'the waters of the United\n      States' narrowly under the OPA. Without any clear direction\n      on determining a significant nexus, this Court will do exactly\n      as Chief Justice Roberts declared--'feel [its] way on a case-\n      by-case basis.’\n\nId.   The court did not discuss Justice Stevens’s instruction.\n\n                 2.   Decisions of Courts of Appeals\n\n      The Ninth Circuit, the first circuit court to apply Rapanos,\n\nconcluded   without   analysis   that    Justice   Kennedy’s   concurrence\n\nprovides the controlling test.      No. Cal. River Watch v. City of\n\nHealdsburg, 457 F.3d 1023 (9th Cir. 2006).         The court stated:\n\n      Justice Kennedy, constituting the fifth vote for reversal,\n      concurred only in the judgment and, therefore, provides the\n      controlling rule of law. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S.\n      188, 193 (1977) (explaining that “[w]hen a fragmented Court\n      decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result\n      enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court\n      may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\n      concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”).\n\nId. at 1029. Without further discussion, the Ninth Circuit applied\n\nJustice Kennedy’s test.      The court did not acknowledge Justice\n\nStevens’s instruction.\n\n      Most recently, in United States v. Gerke Excavating, Inc.,\n\n2006 WL 2707971 (7th Cir. Sept. 22, 2006), the Seventh Circuit also\n\nfound that Justice Kennedy’s test is controlling without discussing\n\nJustice Stevens’s instruction.          The court paraphrases Marks v.\n\nUnited States:\n\n      When a majority of the Supreme Court agrees only on the\n      outcome of a case and not on the ground for that outcome,\n      lower-court judges are to follow the narrowest ground to which\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f     a majority of the Justices would have assented if forced to\n     choose. In Rapanos, that is Justice Kennedy’s ground.\n\nId. at *1 (citing Marks, 430 U.S. at 193).            Curiously, without\n\nexplanation, the court equates the “narrowest opinion\" with the one\n\nleast restrictive of federal authority to regulate.            It states:\n\n     The plurality Justices thought that Justice Kennedy’s ground\n     for reversing was narrower than their own, because they\n     concluded their extensive and in places harsh criticism of the\n     concurrence by saying that ‘Justice Kennedy tips a wink at the\n     agency [i.e., the Corps of Engineers], inviting it to try its\n     same expansive reading again.’\n     . . .\n     [Justice Kennedy’s] test is narrower (so far as reining in\n     federal authority is concerned) than the plurality’s in most\n     cases, though not in all because Justice Kennedy also said\n     that 'by saying the Act covers wetlands (however remote)\n     possessing a surface-water connection with a continuously\n     flowing stream (however small), the plurality's reading would\n     permit applications of the statute as far from traditional\n     federal authority as are the waters it deems beyond the\n     statute's reach.'\n\nId. at *1, *2 (quoting Rapanos, 126 S.Ct. at 2234 n.15 & 2246)\n\n(emphasis added).      Gerke concludes by acknowledging the following\n\nanomaly: If Justice Kennedy finds federal jurisdiction over a\n\nparticular   site   using     the   “significant   nexus”    test   the   four\n\ndissenters would also find jurisdiction.             However, if Justice\n\nKennedy   does   not   find    federal   jurisdiction,      there   could   be\n\ninstances where both the plurality and the dissent disagree with\n\nhis conclusion.     Id. at *2.      In other words, there could be a case\n\nin which Justice Kennedy\n\n     would vote against federal authority only to be outvoted 8-to-\n     1 (the four dissenting Justices plus the members of the\n     Rapanos plurality) because there was a slight surface\n     hydrological connection. The plurality’s insistence that the\n\n                                     -12-\n\f       issue of federal authority be governed by strict rules will on\n       occasion align the Justices in the plurality with the Rapanos\n       dissenters when the balancing approach of Justice Kennedy\n       favors the landowner.\n\nId.    However, Gerke writes off this “rare case,” concluding that\n\n“as a practical matter the Kennedy concurrence is the least common\n\ndenominator.”     Id.\n\n\n\n                        B.   Interpretation of Marks\n\n       The Marks directive that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a\n\ncase and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the\n\nassent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as\n\nthat position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments\n\non    the   narrowest   grounds,\"   Marks,    430   U.S.   at   193   (internal\n\ncitation omitted), has proven troublesome in application for the\n\nSupreme Court itself and for the lower courts.                  Therefore, the\n\ngenesis of that directive and its application require scrutiny.\n\n       In Marks, the defendant raised a Due Process challenge to his\n\nobscenity conviction on the grounds that he had been punished\n\nretroactively under a definition of obscenity laid out in Miller v.\n\nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), when he had actually engaged in the\n\npunished conduct prior to the Miller decision.                  The “narrowest\n\ngrounds”     approach    emerged    when    the   Court    examined   Miller’s\n\npredecessor, Memoirs v. Attorney General of the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966), to determine whether the law\n\nhad provided fair warning at the time of the defendant’s conduct.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fMarks, 430 U.S. at 193-94.      In Memoirs, a majority of the Supreme\n\nCourt found that a lower court erred in finding a book obscene and\n\nthus unprotected by the First Amendment.        However, three Justices\n\nfelt that materials would not be protected by the First Amendment\n\nif they were deemed obscene, Memoirs, 383 U.S. at 418 (Brennan,\n\nJ.), while two other Justices insisted that the First Amendment\n\nprovides an absolute shield against government action aimed at\n\nsuppressing obscenity.      Id. at 421 (Black, J., concurring); id. at\n\n426 (Douglas, J., concurring).       Marks concluded that the opinion\n\nexcluding obscene materials from First Amendment protection was the\n\n“narrowest grounds” for the judgment in Memoirs.\n\n      Relatedly, the “narrowest grounds” language of Marks is itself\n\na quotation from a previous Supreme Court case, Gregg v. Georgia,\n\n428 U.S. 153 (1976).     Gregg discusses Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S.\n\n238 (1972), which examined the constitutionality of the death\n\npenalty as imposed under a Georgia statute.            In Furman, five\n\nJustices agreed that the death penalty was unconstitutional as\n\nimposed in the case.    However, two of these Justices believed that\n\ncapital punishment was unconstitutional per se, while the other\n\nthree Justices felt that the death penalty was unconstitutional\n\nunder the conditions present in the cases before the court but did\n\nnot   necessarily   agree    that    capital   punishment   was   per   se\n\nunconstitutional.      Gregg concluded: “Since five Justices wrote\n\nseparately in support of the judgments in Furman, the holding of\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\n\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds . . . .” 428\n\nU.S. at 169 n.15.\n\n       In sum, the cases on which Marks directly relies both involve\n\nsituations in which the “narrowest ground” was also the ground\n\nleast restrictive of federal jurisdiction, as the Seventh Circuit\n\nindicated in Gerke. However, this coincidence does not necessarily\n\nmean    that    the    Supreme       Court    in    Marks    equated   the    \"narrowest\n\ngrounds\" of decision in a case with fragmented decisions to the\n\ngrounds least restrictive of the assertion of federal authority.\n\nSuch an equation leaves unanswered the question of how one would\n\ndetermine      which       opinion    is     controlling      in   a   case    where   the\n\ngovernment      is    not    a   party.        Moreover,       given   the    underlying\n\nconstitutional question presented by Rapanos, it seems just as\n\nplausible to conclude that the narrowest ground of decision in\n\nRapanos is the ground most restrictive of government authority (the\n\nposition       of    the    plurality),       because       that   ground     avoids   the\n\nconstitutional issue of how far Congress can go in asserting\n\njurisdiction under the Commerce Clause.                     See Rapanos, 126 S.Ct. at\n\n2224 (plurality opinion).               The appellants argue for that result\n\nhere.\n\n       As an alternative to the Seventh Circuit’s reading of Marks,\n\none might sensibly conclude, as one court has, that the \"narrowest\n\ngrounds\" are simply understood as the \"less far-reaching-common\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\fground.\"    Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Ga., 263 F.3d\n\n1234, 1247 (11th Cir. 2001); see also Mark Alan Thurmon, Note, When\n\nthe Court Divides: Reconsidering the Precedential Value of Supreme\n\nCourt Plurality Decisions, 42 Duke L.J. 419, 420-21 (1992) (quoting\n\nLinda    Novak,    Note,   The    Precedential    Value   of   Supreme    Court\n\nPlurality Decisions, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 756, 763 (1980) (\"One way to\n\ndetermine the 'narrowest grounds' is to look for the opinion 'most\n\nclearly tailored to the specific fact situation before the Court\n\nand thus applicable to the fewest cases, in contrast to an opinion\n\nthat takes a more absolutist position or suggests more general\n\nrules.'\").        This reading is also consistent with Memoirs and\n\nFurman: in both cases, the opinion deemed “narrowest” was the one\n\nmore    closely    tailored      to   the   specific   situation   the    Court\n\nconfronted.\n\n       Even if we take this more sensible approach to Marks, however,\n\nthe case still poses problems in the situation before us.                As the\n\nD.C. Circuit held in an en banc opinion, “Marks is workable - one\n\nopinion can be meaningfully regarded as ‘narrower’ than another -\n\nonly when one opinion is a logical subset of other, broader\n\nopinions.”    King v. Palmer, 950 F.2d 771, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (en\n\nbanc).   In other words, the “narrowest grounds” approach makes the\n\nmost sense when two opinions reach the same result in a given case,\n\nbut one opinion reaches that result for less sweeping reasons than\n\nthe other. When applied to future cases, the less sweeping opinion\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwould require the same outcome in a subset of the cases that the\n\nmore sweeping opinion would.     For example, in Furman, the Justices\n\nwho concluded that capital punishment was per se unconstitutional\n\nwould always strike down future death penalty sentences, but the\n\nJustices who found only that the death penalty was unconstitutional\n\nas administered in Furman would only strike down capital sentences\n\nin a subset of future capital cases.       Similarly, in Memoirs, the\n\nabsolutist view of the First Amendment held by two Justices would\n\nalways require a ruling in favor of protecting speech, but the view\n\nof three other Justices that only non-obscene speech is protected\n\nwould extend First Amendment protection only to a subset of such\n\ncases. Thus, the less sweeping opinion in each case represents the\n\n\"narrowest grounds\" for the decision.\n\n     This understanding of \"narrowest grounds\" as used in Marks\n\ndoes not translate easily to the present situation.        The cases in\n\nwhich Justice Kennedy would limit federal jurisdiction are not a\n\nsubset   of   the   cases   in   which   the   plurality   would   limit\n\njurisdiction.   As Gerke points out, in cases where there is a small\n\nsurface water connection to a stream or brook, the plurality’s\n\njurisdictional test would be satisfied, but Justice Kennedy’s\n\nbalancing of interests might militate against finding a significant\n\nnexus.   In such a case, if Justice Kennedy’s test is the single\n\ncontrolling test (as advocated by the Seventh and Ninth Circuits),\n\nthere would be a bizarre outcome -- the court would find no federal\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fjurisdiction even though eight Justices (the four members of the\n\nplurality and the four dissenters) would all agree that federal\n\nauthority should extend to such a situation.               This possibility\n\ndemonstrates the shortcomings of the Marks formulation in applying\n\nRapanos.\n\n\n\n                     C.    The Rapanos Dissent's Approach\n\n       Justice Stevens foresaw the possibility that the plurality\n\nmight find jurisdiction in some cases where Justice Kennedy does\n\nnot.    His instruction to find jurisdiction where either test is\n\nsatisfied provides a simple and pragmatic way to assess what\n\ngrounds would command a majority of the Court.              Justice Stevens\n\nobserves:\n\n       I assume that Justice Kennedy’s approach will be controlling\n       in most cases because it treats more of the Nation’s waters as\n       within the Corps’ jurisdiction, but in the unlikely event that\n       the plurality’s test is met but Justice Kennedy’s is not,\n       courts should also uphold the Corps’ jurisdiction. In sum, in\n       these and future cases the United States may elect to prove\n       jurisdiction under either test.\n\nRapanos,    126   S.Ct    at   2265   n.14.   Following   Justice   Stevens's\n\ninstruction ensures that lower courts will find jurisdiction in all\n\ncases where a majority of the Court would support such a finding.\n\nIf Justice Kennedy's test is satisfied, then at least Justice\n\nKennedy plus the four dissenters would support jurisdiction.              If\n\nthe plurality's test is satisfied, then at least the four plurality\n\nmembers plus the four dissenters would support jurisdiction. Other\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fcircuits have previously taken this common sense approach to\n\nfragmented opinions.        See, e.g., Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,\n\n958 F.2d 1176, 1182 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"In essence, what we must do is\n\nfind common ground shared by five or more justices.\"); United\n\nStates v. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148, 1157 (9th Cir. 2006) (“We need\n\nnot find a legal opinion which a majority joined, but merely a\n\nlegal   standard    which,   when   applied,    will   necessarily   produce\n\nresults with which a majority of the Court from that case would\n\nagree.”   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n\n     We note that one circuit court has previously reached a\n\nconclusion at odds with the position Justice Stevens now advocates.\n\nIn King v. Palmer, the D.C. Circuit stated that \"we do not think we\n\nare free to combine a dissent with a concurrence to form a Marks\n\nmajority.\"    950    F.2d    at   783.   King   discussed   Pennsylvania   v.\n\nDelaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U.S. 711\n\n(1987) (Delaware Valley II), in which the Supreme Court considered\n\nthe availability and amount of contingency fees under federal fee-\n\nshifting statutes.      In Delaware Valley II, the Court ultimately\n\nissued a plurality opinion signed by four Justices, a dissent\n\nsigned by four Justices, and a concurrence by Justice O'Connor.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit refused to examine the points of commonality among\n\nJustice O'Connor's opinion and that of the dissent, relying mainly\n\non a literal reading of Marks's language that the holding is the\n\nposition of the Justices \"who concurred in the judgments on the\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fnarrowest grounds,\" Marks, 430 U.S. at 193 (emphasis added), as\n\nwell as the fact that the Supreme Court had not explicitly applied\n\nMarks to situations where concurring and dissenting votes would be\n\ncombined.    King, 950 F.2d at 783.\n\n     However, the situation in King is different from the case\n\nbefore us.     In Delaware Valley II, Justice O'Connor and the\n\ndissenting   Justices   simply   took   different   approaches   to   the\n\nquestion of how to calculate a contingency enhancement, with the\n\nresult that it is not immediately obvious how their views could be\n\ncombined to form a five-Justice majority.           In Rapanos, Justice\n\nStevens states that whenever either the plurality or Justice\n\nKennedy would find jurisdiction, the Rapanos dissenters would\n\nagree.   Moreover, the Third Circuit took a position opposite to\n\nthat of the D.C. Circuit in interpreting Delaware Valley II,\n\nholding that \"[b]ecause the four dissenters would allow contingency\n\nmultipliers in all cases in which Justice O'Connor would allow\n\nthem, her position commands a majority of the court.\" Student Pub.\n\nInterest Research Group of N.J., Inc. v. AT&T Bell Labs., 842 F.2d\n\n1436, 1451 (3d. Cir. 1988).        Therefore, we do not share the\n\nreservations of the D.C. Circuit about combining a dissent with a\n\nconcurrence to find the ground of decision embraced by a majority\n\nof the Justices.\n\n     Moreover, Justice Stevens's instruction seems particularly\n\nsound given that the Supreme Court itself has moved away from the\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fMarks formula.         In Nichols v. United States, the court observed\n\nthat \"[t]his test is more easily stated than applied,\" adding,\n\n\"[w]e think it not useful to pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost\n\nlogical possibility when it has so obviously baffled and divided\n\nthe lower courts that have considered it.\"                511 U.S. 738, 745-46\n\n(1994); see also Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 325 (2003)\n\n(quoting Nichols for the same proposition).               Since Marks, several\n\nmembers of the Court have indicated that whenever a decision is\n\nfragmented such that no single opinion has the support of five\n\nJustices, lower courts should examine the plurality, concurring and\n\ndissenting opinions to extract the principles that a majority has\n\nembraced.       See Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 685 (1994)\n\n(Souter, J., concurring) (analyzing the points of agreement between\n\nplurality, concurring, and dissenting opinions to identify the test\n\nthat   lower    courts     should   apply);    League    of   United   Latin   Am.\n\nCitizens v. Perry, 126 S. Ct. 2594, 2607 (2006) (Kennedy, J.)\n\n(analyzing Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004) to find that\n\nagreement      among    one   concurring    and   four    dissenting      Justices\n\nestablishes majority support for a legal proposition); Alexander v.\n\nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 281-82 (2001) (Scalia, J.) (noting the\n\nagreement      of   five   Justices   who     joined    plurality   and   various\n\ndissenting opinions).          Thus, it is not surprising that Justice\n\nStevens in his Rapanos dissent explicitly directs courts to examine\n\nthe views of dissenting Justices to determine which propositions\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fhave the support of a majority.    This approval is consistent with\n\nthe direction that the Court as a whole has taken since Marks.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Justice Stevens does not even refer to\n\nMarks indicates that he found its framework inapplicable to the\n\ninterpretation by the lower courts of the divergent tests laid out\n\nby the opinions in Rapanos.\n\n\n\n                           VI.   Conclusion\n\n     The foregoing considerations lead us to conclude that the\n\ndistrict court should do exactly as Justice Stevens has suggested.\n\nThe federal government can establish jurisdiction over the target\n\nsites if it can meet either the plurality's or Justice Kennedy's\n\nstandard as laid out in Rapanos.\n\n     In light of these standards, the district court may conduct\n\nadditional factfinding if it deems it necessary to address the\n\njurisdictional question.   The district court may also address any\n\nother issues it deems necessary in deciding that jurisdictional\n\nissue.   As discussed previously, the two members of the majority\n\neach had different interpretations of the record. We urge the\n\nparties and the district court to provide a clear factual record in\n\nthe context of applying the new standards.\n\n     Accordingly, we vacate our decision in United States v.\n\nJohnson, 437 F.3d 157 (1st Cir. 2006), and remand for further\n\nproceedings.   Each party is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fSo ordered.\n\n       - Concurring/Dissenting Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                         -23-\n\f              TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part, Dissenting\n\nin part).       I join the majority in remanding the case to the\n\ndistrict court so that the new legal standards developed in Rapanos\n\nv. United States, 547 U.S. ___, 126 S. Ct. 2208 (2006), can be\n\napplied on the first instance by that court after the parties have\n\nhad an opportunity to expand the record to the extent necessary\n\ngiven the new standards.        The opportunity to expand the record is\n\nimportant to both the government and the Johnsons. New evidence is\n\nas likely to militate against federal regulatory jurisdiction over\n\nthe Johnsons' property as it is to demonstrate it.\n\n              I depart from the majority in interpreting what standards\n\nRapanos has established. The plurality's \"hydrological connection\"\n\ntest provides the proper constitutional limit on federal regulation\n\nunder the Clean Water Act.           Although the majority has provided an\n\nable analysis of a thorny issue, I cannot concur that Justice\n\nKennedy's      seemingly   opaque      \"significant    nexus\"    test   is   a\n\nconstitutional      measure     of     federal    regulatory    jurisdiction.\n\nExtending regulatory jurisdiction to wetlands that \"possess a\n\n'significant nexus' to waters that are or were navigable in fact or\n\nthat could reasonably be so made . . .\" id. at 2236, leaves the\n\ndoor   open    to   continued   federal       overreach.   The    plurality's\n\nrestriction of federal jurisdiction to \"only those wetlands with a\n\ncontinuous surface connection to bodies that are 'waters of the\n\nUnited States' in their own right, so that there is no clear\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fdemarcation between 'waters' and wetlands, are 'adjacent to' such\n\nwaters and covered by the [Clean Water] Act . . .\" id. at 2226\n\n(emphasis in original), strikes a constitutional balance between\n\nfederal and state regulatory interests, and our nation's interest\n\nin clean water and the individual land owner's right to manage\n\ntheir property in accordance with their dreams and aspirations,\n\nwhether economic or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f",

The Panel Decision\n\n            This case began when the United States filed a civil\n\naction alleging that defendants (now appellants), a group of\n\ncranberry       farmers     in    Carver,     Massachusetts,       had     discharged\n\npollutants into federally-regulated waters without a permit in\n\nviolation of § 301 and § 502 of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), 33\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1311, 1352.            In response, appellants contended that the\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fUnited States lacked jurisdiction over the three properties in\n\nquestion: (1) the Cross Street site; (2) the Fosdick Street site;\n\nand (3) the Forest/Fuller Street site (collectively, the \"target\n\nsites\").\n\n           In separate rulings on liability and remedy, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of the government.                   The\n\ndistrict   court     denied    appellants'    motion   for    reconsideration,\n\nstating that \"there is a sufficient basis for the United States to\n\nexercise jurisdiction because the undisputed evidence shows that\n\nthe three wetlands are hydrologically connected to the navigable\n\nWeweantic River by nonnavigable tributaries.\"\n\n           In an appeal to this court, appellants challenged the\n\ndistrict court's judgment that the jurisdiction of the CWA extends\n\nto the target sites.        First, they asserted that their property is\n\nnot   covered   by    the     Environmental    Protection     Agency    (\"EPA\")\n\nregulation promulgated to carry out the CWA.             In the alternative,\n\nappellants   argued     that,    if   their   property   is   covered   by   the\n\nregulation, either the regulation exceeds the authority granted by\n\nthe CWA, or the CWA exceeds Congress's authority under the Commerce\n\nClause.\n\n           We affirmed the trial court's judgment in a divided\n\ndecision, with two members of the panel concurring in the judgment\n\nfor different reasons, and one member dissenting.               One member of\n\nthe majority concluded that the hydrological connection between the\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ftarget sites and the Weweantic River establishes a \"significant\n\nnexus\" between the sites and the river, sufficient to establish\n\njurisdiction under the CWA without creating constitutional issues\n\nunder the Commerce Clause.             For two of the target sites, in the\n\nview    of   this   judge,    the     hydrological    connection     depended   on\n\ndiffusion of water through wetlands.               See 437 F.3d at 162.\n\n             The    other    member     of   the   majority   read   the   record\n\ndifferently to conclude that the hydrological connection was a\n\nsystem of tributaries, some of which happened to flow through\n\nwetlands or other bogs.          See id. at 182.       The concurring panelist\n\nthus concluded that it was unnecessary to decide whether the\n\ndiffusion of water through wetlands was a sufficient hydrological\n\nconnection to support a \"significant nexus.\"               Id.\n\n             The dissent concluded that the United States \"may not\n\nconstitutionally regulate wetlands that are neither themselves\n\nnavigable nor truly adjacent to navigable waters.\"                    Id. at 187\n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).              Moreover, even if the\n\nEPA's assertion of jurisdiction was constitutional, the dissent\n\nwould    have      held   that    the    government's     attempt     to   assert\n\njurisdiction over appellants' wetlands is inconsistent with its own\n\nregulations because the system of tributaries linking the target\n\nsites to the Weweantic includes other wetlands.                      Because the\n\nregulations explicitly exclude wetlands adjacent to waters that are\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthemselves wetlands, the dissent argued that the government lacked\n\njurisdiction under its own regulations.                         Id. at 187.1\n\n\n\n                       II.    Response to the Panel Decision\n\n               As noted, appellants filed a petition for rehearing en\n\nbanc       pursuant    to    Rule     35    of     the    Federal      Rules    of    Appellate\n\nProcedure,       arguing that the case should be reheard following the\n\nSupreme Court's then-pending decision in Rapanos.                                    We ordered\n\nappellants' petition held in abeyance pending the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Rapanos.               We further stated that appellants could file\n\na supplemental petition for rehearing en banc within fourteen days\n\nafter the decision in Rapanos was issued, and the government could\n\nthen respond.\n\n\n\n                            III.    Rapanos v. United States\n\n               The decision in Rapanos v. United States, 547 U.S. ___,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145642\"><a href=\"/opinion/145642/rapanos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), resolved two consolidated cases from the\n\nSixth       Circuit.         In    one     case,    the       United    States    brought      an\n\nenforcement       action          alleging       that     property       owners      and    their\n\naffiliated       businesses          deposited         fill    materials       into    wetlands\n\nwithout a permit, in violation of the CWA.                             Id. at 2219.        In the\n\n\n\n       1\n      The regulation states that \"waters of the United States\"\ninclude \"[w]etlands adjacent to waters (other than waters that are\nthemselves wetlands) identified in paragraphs (s)(1)-(6) of this\nsection.\" 40 C.F.R. § 230.3(s)(7).\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fother,   property   owners    were   denied   a   permit   to   deposit   fill\n\nmaterial in a wetland approximately one mile from a lake and, after\n\nexhausting their administrative appeals, they filed suit.              Id.\n\n            In both cases, the district court found that there was\n\nfederal regulatory jurisdiction over the sites in question, and the\n\nSixth Circuit affirmed.       The Supreme Court then consolidated the\n\ncases and granted certiorari to decide whether these wetlands\n\nconstitute \"waters of the United States\" under the CWA, and, if so,\n\nwhether the CWA is constitutional.         See id. at 2220.\n\n            The Court issued a split decision construing the phrase\n\n\"waters of the United States\" as used in the CWA.               The plurality\n\nconcluded that the phrase \"waters of the United States\" includes\n\nonly \"relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies\n\nof water 'forming geographic features' that are described in\n\nordinary parlance as 'streams[,] . . . oceans, rivers, [and]\n\nlakes.'\"    Id. at 2225.     Thus, for purposes of determining federal\n\nregulatory jurisdiction, \"only those wetlands with a continuous\n\nsurface connection to bodies that are 'waters of the United States'\n\nin their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between\n\n'waters' and wetlands, are 'adjacent to' such waters and covered by\n\nthe Act.\"     Id. at 2226 (emphasis in original).               The plurality\n\nvacated the decision of the Sixth Circuit in both cases and, noting\n\n\"the paucity of the record,\" remanded for further proceedings. Id.\n\nat 2235.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f              Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment, but rejected\n\nthe plurality's rationale. Instead, he concluded that jurisdiction\n\nextends to wetlands that \"possess a 'significant nexus' to waters\n\nthat are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so\n\nmade.\"    Id. at 2236.      Justice Kennedy further found that wetlands\n\n\"possess the requisite nexus\" if \"either alone or in combination\n\nwith similarly situated lands in the region, [they] significantly\n\naffect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other\n\ncovered waters more readily understood as 'navigable.'\"               Id. at\n\n2248.    Where the wetlands in question are \"adjacent to navigable-\n\nin-fact waters, [the government] may rely on adjacency to establish\n\nits jurisdiction.\"      Id. at 2249.     Where the wetlands are adjacent\n\nto nonnavigable tributaries, \"[a]bsent more specific regulations\n\n. . . [the government] must establish a significant nexus on a\n\ncase-by-case basis.\"        Id. at 2249.\n\n              Justice Stevens authored a dissent joined by three other\n\nJustices.      In the view of the dissenters, to the extent that the\n\nCWA includes a \"significant nexus\" requirement, this requirement\n\n\"is categorically satisfied as to wetlands adjacent to navigable\n\nwaters or their tributaries.\"              Id. at 2263-64.       The dissent\n\nconcluded by noting specifically that \"all four Justices who have\n\njoined this opinion would uphold the Corps' jurisdiction . . . in\n\nall   other    cases   in   which   either   the   plurality's   or   Justice\n\nKennedy's test is satisfied . . . .\"          Id. at 2265.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f                          IV.      Subsequent Motions\n\n            Following    the     Supreme        Court's   decision    in    Rapanos,\n\nappellants filed a supplemental petition for rehearing en banc\n\nchallenging    the    view    in    one    of    the   panel   opinions      that    a\n\nhydrological connection constitutes a jurisdictionally sufficient\n\n\"significant    nexus.\"         Appellants        contend   that     rehearing      is\n\nnecessary to resolve the tension between the panel opinion and\n\nRapanos.    They argue that under either the plurality opinion or\n\nJustice    Kennedy's    concurrence,        a     hydrological     connection       is\n\ninsufficient to establish jurisdiction, although they also argue\n\nstrenuously    that     the     plurality's        test   alone    should     apply.\n\nAlternatively, appellants          contend that the evidence in the record\n\nis sufficient to support a finding in their favor under the\n\nstandards in Rapanos, and urge that we vacate the decision and\n\ndirect the district court to enter judgment for them.\n\n            The United States opposes the petition for en banc review\n\nand urges us instead to vacate the panel's decision and remand the\n\ncase to the district court.          The government argues that additional\n\nfactfinding is necessary before the legal principles articulated in\n\nRapanos can be applied in this case.                   Moreover, the government\n\nasserts that on remand it should be allowed to establish CWA\n\njurisdiction under either the Rapanos plurality's test or Justice\n\nKennedy's test.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                   V.   Remand to the District Court\n\n            We agree with the government that remand to the district\n\ncourt for application of the Rapanos standards is appropriate. The\n\nparties presented their cases in the district court without any\n\nawareness of the standards that now apply.      They should now have an\n\nopportunity to develop their positions in the district court with\n\nan awareness of these standards.         However, the question of what\n\nlegal standard to apply is one of some complexity, and other courts\n\nhave taken varying approaches to the issue.       We conclude that the\n\nUnited States may assert jurisdiction over the target sites if it\n\nmeets either Justice Kennedy's legal standard or that of the\n\nplurality.    We explain our reasoning.\n\n\n\n              A.   Other Courts’ Application of Rapanos\n\n     In the months since Rapanos, four courts have applied its\n\nlegal standards - two district courts and two courts of appeals.\n\n\n\n                        1. Decisions of District Courts\n\n     In United States v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2221629</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (M.D. Fla. Aug. 2,\n\n2006), the Middle District of Florida adopted Justice Stevens's\n\nsuggestion to apply either the plurality’s or Justice Kennedy’s\n\nstandard.    That court cited the Supreme Court's decision in Marks\n\nv. United States for the proposition that \"[w]hen a fragmented\n\nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fenjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be\n\nviewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the\n\njudgments on the narrowest grounds.\" Evans at *19 (citing Marks v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1977)).                 The court noted that\n\n\"'narrowest grounds' is understood as the 'less far-reaching'\n\ncommon ground,\" Evans at *19 (citing Johnson v.

Hence,    the    court   adopted   Justice   Stevens's\n\napproach.    Evans at *19.\n\n            The Northern District of Texas used a sharply contrasting\n\napproach in United States v. Chevron Pipe Line Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2492318\"><a href=\"/opinion/2492318/united-states-v-chevron-pipe-line-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Tex. 2006), determining that because of the lack of a\n\nclear legal standard in Rapanos, it would instead rely on precedent\n\nwithin its own circuit.           The court noted that \"the Supreme Court\n\nfailed to reach a consensus of a majority as to the jurisdictional\n\nboundary of the CWA.\"        It added that Justice Kennedy \"advanced an\n\nambiguous test--whether a 'significant nexus' exists to waters that\n\nare/were/might be navigable.             This test leaves no guidance on how\n\nto implement its vague, subjective centerpiece.               That is, exactly\n\nwhat is 'significant' and how is a 'nexus' determined?\"               Id. at 613\n\n(internal citation omitted).             The court then concluded:\n\n       Because Justice Kennedy failed to elaborate on the\n       'significant nexus' required, this Court will look to the\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      prior reasoning in this circuit.      The Fifth Circuit, as\n      discussed above, has interpreted 'the waters of the United\n      States' narrowly under the OPA. Without any clear direction\n      on determining a significant nexus, this Court will do exactly\n      as Chief Justice Roberts declared--'feel [its] way on a case-\n      by-case basis.’\n\nId.   The court did not discuss Justice Stevens’s instruction.\n\n                 2.   Decisions of Courts of Appeals\n\n      The Ninth Circuit, the first circuit court to apply Rapanos,\n\nconcluded   without   analysis   that    Justice   Kennedy’s   concurrence\n\nprovides the controlling test.      No. Cal. River Watch v. City of\n\nHealdsburg, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1023</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2006).         The court stated:\n\n      Justice Kennedy, constituting the fifth vote for reversal,\n      concurred only in the judgment and, therefore, provides the\n      controlling rule of law. See Marks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n      <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1977) (explaining that “[w]hen a fragmented Court\n      decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result\n      enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court\n      may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\n      concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”).\n\nId. at 1029. Without further discussion, the Ninth Circuit applied\n\nJustice Kennedy’s test.      The court did not acknowledge Justice\n\nStevens’s instruction.\n\n      Most recently, in United States v. Gerke Excavating, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2707971</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. Sept. 22, 2006), the Seventh Circuit also\n\nfound that Justice Kennedy’s test is controlling without discussing\n\nJustice Stevens’s instruction.          The court paraphrases Marks v.\n\nUnited States:\n\n      When a majority of the Supreme Court agrees only on the\n      outcome of a case and not on the ground for that outcome,\n      lower-court judges are to follow the narrowest ground to which\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f     a majority of the Justices would have assented if forced to\n     choose. In Rapanos, that is Justice Kennedy’s ground.\n\nId. at *1 (citing Marks, 430 U.S. at 193).            Curiously, without\n\nexplanation, the court equates the “narrowest opinion\" with the one\n\nleast restrictive of federal authority to regulate.            It states:\n\n     The plurality Justices thought that Justice Kennedy’s ground\n     for reversing was narrower than their own, because they\n     concluded their extensive and in places harsh criticism of the\n     concurrence by saying that ‘Justice Kennedy tips a wink at the\n     agency [i.e., the Corps of Engineers], inviting it to try its\n     same expansive reading again.’\n     . . .\n     [Justice Kennedy’s] test is narrower (so far as reining in\n     federal authority is concerned) than the plurality’s in most\n     cases, though not in all because Justice Kennedy also said\n     that 'by saying the Act covers wetlands (however remote)\n     possessing a surface-water connection with a continuously\n     flowing stream (however small), the plurality's reading would\n     permit applications of the statute as far from traditional\n     federal authority as are the waters it deems beyond the\n     statute's reach.'\n\nId. at *1, *2 (quoting Rapanos, 126 S.Ct. at 2234 n.15 & 2246)\n\n(emphasis added).      Gerke concludes by acknowledging the following\n\nanomaly: If Justice Kennedy finds federal jurisdiction over a\n\nparticular   site   using     the   “significant   nexus”    test   the   four\n\ndissenters would also find jurisdiction.             However, if Justice\n\nKennedy   does   not   find    federal   jurisdiction,      there   could   be\n\ninstances where both the plurality and the dissent disagree with\n\nhis conclusion.     Id. at *2.      In other words, there could be a case\n\nin which Justice Kennedy\n\n     would vote against federal authority only to be outvoted 8-to-\n     1 (the four dissenting Justices plus the members of the\n     Rapanos plurality) because there was a slight surface\n     hydrological connection. The plurality’s insistence that the\n\n                                     -12-\n\f       issue of federal authority be governed by strict rules will on\n       occasion align the Justices in the plurality with the Rapanos\n       dissenters when the balancing approach of Justice Kennedy\n       favors the landowner.\n\nId.    However, Gerke writes off this “rare case,” concluding that\n\n“as a practical matter the Kennedy concurrence is the least common\n\ndenominator.”     Id.\n\n\n\n                        B.   Interpretation of Marks\n\n       The Marks directive that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a\n\ncase and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the\n\nassent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as\n\nthat position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments\n\non    the   narrowest   grounds,\"   Marks,    430   U.S.   at   193   (internal\n\ncitation omitted), has proven troublesome in application for the\n\nSupreme Court itself and for the lower courts.                  Therefore, the\n\ngenesis of that directive and its application require scrutiny.\n\n       In Marks, the defendant raised a Due Process challenge to his\n\nobscenity conviction on the grounds that he had been punished\n\nretroactively under a definition of obscenity laid out in Miller v.\n\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108838\"><a href=\"/opinion/108838/miller-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), when he had actually engaged in the\n\npunished conduct prior to the Miller decision.

In Memoirs, a majority of the Supreme\n\nCourt found that a lower court erred in finding a book obscene and\n\nthus unprotected by the First Amendment.        However, three Justices\n\nfelt that materials would not be protected by the First Amendment\n\nif they were deemed obscene, Memoirs, 383 U.S. at 418 (Brennan,\n\nJ.), while two other Justices insisted that the First Amendment\n\nprovides an absolute shield against government action aimed at\n\nsuppressing obscenity.

In Furman, five\n\nJustices agreed that the death penalty was unconstitutional as\n\nimposed in the case.    However, two of these Justices believed that\n\ncapital punishment was unconstitutional per se, while the other\n\nthree Justices felt that the death penalty was unconstitutional\n\nunder the conditions present in the cases before the court but did\n\nnot   necessarily   agree    that    capital   punishment   was   per   se\n\nunconstitutional.      Gregg concluded: “Since five Justices wrote\n\nseparately in support of the judgments in Furman, the holding of\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\n\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds . . . .” 428\n\nU.S. at 169 n.15.\n\n       In sum, the cases on which Marks directly relies both involve\n\nsituations in which the “narrowest ground” was also the ground\n\nleast restrictive of federal jurisdiction, as the Seventh Circuit\n\nindicated in Gerke. However, this coincidence does not necessarily\n\nmean    that    the    Supreme       Court    in    Marks    equated   the    \"narrowest\n\ngrounds\" of decision in a case with fragmented decisions to the\n\ngrounds least restrictive of the assertion of federal authority.\n\nSuch an equation leaves unanswered the question of how one would\n\ndetermine      which       opinion    is     controlling      in   a   case    where   the\n\ngovernment      is    not    a   party.        Moreover,       given   the    underlying\n\nconstitutional question presented by Rapanos, it seems just as\n\nplausible to conclude that the narrowest ground of decision in\n\nRapanos is the ground most restrictive of government authority (the\n\nposition       of    the    plurality),       because       that   ground     avoids   the\n\nconstitutional issue of how far Congress can go in asserting\n\njurisdiction under the Commerce Clause.                     See Rapanos, 126 S.Ct. at\n\n2224 (plurality opinion).               The appellants argue for that result\n\nhere.\n\n       As an alternative to the Seventh Circuit’s reading of Marks,\n\none might sensibly conclude, as one court has, that the \"narrowest\n\ngrounds\" are simply understood as the \"less far-reaching-common\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\fground.\"    Johnson v.

This reading is also consistent with Memoirs and\n\nFurman: in both cases, the opinion deemed “narrowest” was the one\n\nmore    closely    tailored      to   the   specific   situation   the    Court\n\nconfronted.\n\n       Even if we take this more sensible approach to Marks, however,\n\nthe case still poses problems in the situation before us.                As the\n\nD.C. Circuit held in an en banc opinion, “Marks is workable - one\n\nopinion can be meaningfully regarded as ‘narrower’ than another -\n\nonly when one opinion is a logical subset of other, broader\n\nopinions.”    King v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573058\"><a href=\"/opinion/573058/mabel-a-king-v-james-f-palmer-director-dc-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (en\n\nbanc).   In other words, the “narrowest grounds” approach makes the\n\nmost sense when two opinions reach the same result in a given case,\n\nbut one opinion reaches that result for less sweeping reasons than\n\nthe other. When applied to future cases, the less sweeping opinion\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fwould require the same outcome in a subset of the cases that the\n\nmore sweeping opinion would.     For example, in Furman, the Justices\n\nwho concluded that capital punishment was per se unconstitutional\n\nwould always strike down future death penalty sentences, but the\n\nJustices who found only that the death penalty was unconstitutional\n\nas administered in Furman would only strike down capital sentences\n\nin a subset of future capital cases.       Similarly, in Memoirs, the\n\nabsolutist view of the First Amendment held by two Justices would\n\nalways require a ruling in favor of protecting speech, but the view\n\nof three other Justices that only non-obscene speech is protected\n\nwould extend First Amendment protection only to a subset of such\n\ncases. Thus, the less sweeping opinion in each case represents the\n\n\"narrowest grounds\" for the decision.\n\n     This understanding of \"narrowest grounds\" as used in Marks\n\ndoes not translate easily to the present situation.        The cases in\n\nwhich Justice Kennedy would limit federal jurisdiction are not a\n\nsubset   of   the   cases   in   which   the   plurality   would   limit\n\njurisdiction.   As Gerke points out, in cases where there is a small\n\nsurface water connection to a stream or brook, the plurality’s\n\njurisdictional test would be satisfied, but Justice Kennedy’s\n\nbalancing of interests might militate against finding a significant\n\nnexus.   In such a case, if Justice Kennedy’s test is the single\n\ncontrolling test (as advocated by the Seventh and Ninth Circuits),\n\nthere would be a bizarre outcome -- the court would find no federal\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fjurisdiction even though eight Justices (the four members of the\n\nplurality and the four dissenters) would all agree that federal\n\nauthority should extend to such a situation.               This possibility\n\ndemonstrates the shortcomings of the Marks formulation in applying\n\nRapanos.\n\n\n\n                     C.    The Rapanos Dissent's Approach\n\n       Justice Stevens foresaw the possibility that the plurality\n\nmight find jurisdiction in some cases where Justice Kennedy does\n\nnot.    His instruction to find jurisdiction where either test is\n\nsatisfied provides a simple and pragmatic way to assess what\n\ngrounds would command a majority of the Court.              Justice Stevens\n\nobserves:\n\n       I assume that Justice Kennedy’s approach will be controlling\n       in most cases because it treats more of the Nation’s waters as\n       within the Corps’ jurisdiction, but in the unlikely event that\n       the plurality’s test is met but Justice Kennedy’s is not,\n       courts should also uphold the Corps’ jurisdiction. In sum, in\n       these and future cases the United States may elect to prove\n       jurisdiction under either test.\n\nRapanos,    126   S.Ct    at   2265   n.14.   Following   Justice   Stevens's\n\ninstruction ensures that lower courts will find jurisdiction in all\n\ncases where a majority of the Court would support such a finding.\n\nIf Justice Kennedy's test is satisfied, then at least Justice\n\nKennedy plus the four dissenters would support jurisdiction.              If\n\nthe plurality's test is satisfied, then at least the four plurality\n\nmembers plus the four dissenters would support jurisdiction. Other\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fcircuits have previously taken this common sense approach to\n\nfragmented opinions.        See, e.g., Tyler v.

In Delaware Valley II, the Court ultimately\n\nissued a plurality opinion signed by four Justices, a dissent\n\nsigned by four Justices, and a concurrence by Justice O'Connor.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit refused to examine the points of commonality among\n\nJustice O'Connor's opinion and that of the dissent, relying mainly\n\non a literal reading of Marks's language that the holding is the\n\nposition of the Justices \"who concurred in the judgments on the\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fnarrowest grounds,\" Marks, 430 U.S. at 193 (emphasis added), as\n\nwell as the fact that the Supreme Court had not explicitly applied\n\nMarks to situations where concurring and dissenting votes would be\n\ncombined.

In Delaware Valley II, Justice O'Connor and the\n\ndissenting   Justices   simply   took   different   approaches   to   the\n\nquestion of how to calculate a contingency enhancement, with the\n\nresult that it is not immediately obvious how their views could be\n\ncombined to form a five-Justice majority.           In Rapanos, Justice\n\nStevens states that whenever either the plurality or Justice\n\nKennedy would find jurisdiction, the Rapanos dissenters would\n\nagree.   Moreover, the Third Circuit took a position opposite to\n\nthat of the D.C. Circuit in interpreting Delaware Valley II,\n\nholding that \"[b]ecause the four dissenters would allow contingency\n\nmultipliers in all cases in which Justice O'Connor would allow\n\nthem, her position commands a majority of the court.\" Student Pub.\n\nInterest Research Group of N.J., Inc. v.
