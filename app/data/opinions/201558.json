Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Arturo Luciano Delgado for appellants.\n     Luis Villares Sarmiento with whom Sánchez-Betances, Sifre,\nMuñoz-Noya & Rivera, P.S.C. was on brief for appellees Hernandez-\nColon and Maldonado-Arrigoitia.\n     Gary H. Montilla with whom Roberto Márquez-Sánchez was on\nbrief for Arecibo.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 27, 2005\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.      This is an appeal from a\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Puerto Rico defendant municipality,\n\nArecibo, its mayor and its director of human resources, in a\n\npolitical discharge suit brought by fourteen employees. Plaintiffs\n\nare members of the New Progressive Party (NPP) and the individual\n\ndefendants are members of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), which\n\nwas restored to power after the election of 2000.           The newly\n\nelected   mayor,   Frankie   Hernández-Colón,   allegedly   facing   a\n\nformidable municipal financial crisis, instigated the termination\n\nof many employees, including the plaintiffs.\n\n     Plaintiffs' complaint, seeking both injunctive relief and\n\ndamages, invoked 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985(3), and other federal\n\ncauses of action, as well as several Commonwealth provisions.\n\nDefendants submitted motions for dismissal and summary judgment\n\nsupported by statements of municipal officers evidencing not only\n\nfinancial stringency but also implementation of a seniority-based\n\nlayoff plan devised in contemplation of such an emergency by the\n\nprior mayor, an NPP member.       The district court accepted the\n\nrecommendations of a magistrate judge that summary judgment be\n\ngranted in favor of the defendants.\n\n     After reviewing the evidentiary state of the record in search\n\nof material issues of fact and noting a series of procedural\n\ndefaults, we affirm the rulings of the district court rejecting\n\nbelated requests for discovery and concluding that the record is\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fbereft   of    any    evidence      of   political     animus   motivating   the\n\ndischarges.        We review the former ruling for abuse of discretion,\n\nTorres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 5 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003),\n\nand the latter de novo, Rodriguez v. American Int'l Ins. Co. of\n\nPuerto Rico, 402 F.3d 45, 46 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     We first consider plaintiffs' complaint, which the district\n\ncourt generously characterized as establishing a prima facie case\n\nof discrimination.         The complaint described plaintiffs as NPP\n\n\"activists,\" who served as NPP officers and delegates on election\n\nday in 2000 and assisted at rallies and meetings during the\n\ncampaign.      Their political beliefs were alleged, in conclusory\n\nterms, to be known by defendants.              The fourteen plaintiffs were\n\ndescribed     as    holding   the    following   positions:     carpenter    (2),\n\njanitor (2), driver (2), clerk (3), secretary (2), coordinator,\n\nreceptionist, and worker.\n\n     These allegations may very well describe plaintiffs' jobs as\n\nprotected from politically motivated dismissal, see, e.g., Padilla-\n\nGarcía v. Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(non-policymaking employees are protected from employment decisions\n\nbased on political affiliation), but job terminations are not\n\nunconstitutional        solely      \"because   those    affiliated   with    one\n\npolitical party are disproportionately impacted,\" Sanchez-Lopez v.\n\nFuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f       In Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir. 1993),\n\nplaintiffs were described as playing prominent roles in \"publicly\n\nand vocally supporting\" a former mayor.             Even so, we acknowledged\n\nthat, \"[s]tanding alone, even the circumstantial evidence that some\n\nplaintiffs were especially conspicuous targets for discriminatory\n\nemployment action by defendants would give us serious pause.\" And,\n\neven more recently, in Gonzalez de Blasini v. Family Dep't, 377\n\nF.3d   81,   85-86    (1st   Cir.   2004),   we    affirmed   dismissal   of   a\n\ncomplaint, concluding that even though plaintiff was alleged to be\n\na well known supporter of the NPP, had held a trust position under\n\nthe    previous   NPP   administration,      and   defendant   had   expressed\n\ninterest in giving her position to a PDP member, this fell short of\n\nevidence that defendant knew of plaintiff's affiliation.              See also\n\nCosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodríguez, 360 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(statement of PDP mayor of intent to rid town of NPP activists\n\ninsufficient to generate genuine issue of material fact); Figueroa-\n\nSerrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000) (similar).\n\n       We note our doubt concerning whether plaintiffs had truly set\n\nforth a prima facie case to emphasize that it is at best not a\n\nstrong    one.       Their   task   under    the   burden-shifting   analysis\n\napplicable to political discrimination cases was to show that their\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor for the adverse employment decision.             See, e.g., Padilla-\n\nGarcía, 212 F.3d at 74 (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)).    Assuming their skimpy\n\nshowing met this standard, the allegations nonetheless lack any\n\nspecific information that could bulwark a case for rejecting the\n\ngenuineness of defendants' response that they \"would have taken the\n\nsame action regardless of the plaintiff's political beliefs,\" id.\n\n(referring to \"the Mt. Healthy defense\").\n\n     This sets the stage for the critical assessment of defendants'\n\nproffered   justification.   After   considerable   jousting   by   the\n\nparties over service of process and plans for discovery, the court\n\nset the date of May 7, 2003 for a status conference.      A few days\n\nbefore that date, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment\n\nwith a Statement of Uncontested Material Facts and a motion to\n\ndismiss. Unaccountably, plaintiffs' counsel did not attend the May\n\n7 conference.\n\n     This was only the beginning of missed cues.          Plaintiffs\n\nresponded on May 14 to the motion for summary judgment only by\n\nrequesting an extension of time beyond the customary ten day limit\n\nto June 11 to oppose the motions.     That date passed without any\n\neffort to secure a further extension, or to conduct discovery, and\n\nwithout any statement of opposition or opposing statement of\n\nmaterial facts, as required by local rules.    Accordingly, on July\n\n14, the court referred the case to the magistrate judge for a\n\nreport and recommendation, which was to be considered \"unopposed.\"\n\nUnder the applicable local rule, facts in a statement of material\n\n\n                               -5-\n\ffacts, if supported by record citations, are deemed admitted unless\n\nproperly controverted.     See D.P.R. R. 56(e).\n\n     Three weeks later, on August 8, plaintiffs' counsel filed a\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the order of reference.                We have\n\nlooked in vain for any support for such a motion except an appeal\n\nfor sheer mercy.      Counsel averred that it was \"foreseeable that\n\nplaintiffs would need additional time [beyond June 11] to conclude\n\nthe discovery\" but did not explain why preventive anticipatory\n\naction was not attempted.      Counsel had \"coordinated\" the tentative\n\ndeposition    of   defendant   Mayor    Hernández    but   \"the   undersigner\n\ncalendar [sic] during the months of June and July of 2003 prevented\n\nto   do    so.\"    Finally,    the   request:   \"Plaintiffs       deserve   an\n\nopportunity to conduct further discovery . . . .                  It was our\n\nmistake not to request an additional extension of time to oppose\n\nsaid motion.\"\n\n      Counsel perhaps deserves high marks for candor, but to ask us\n\nto find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing\n\nto grant this motion is to ask us to use this sad case to make very\n\nbad law.    Counsel for Arecibo appropriately calls our attention to\n\nJustice Harlan's thought in Link v. Wabash Railroad Co.: \"[K]eeping\n\nthis suit alive merely because plaintiff should not be penalized\n\nfor the omissions of his own attorney would be visiting the sins of\n\nplaintiff's lawyer upon the defendant.\"             370 U.S. 626, 634 n.10\n\n(1962) (emphasis in original).         Now, if ever, are the teachings of\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fsuch cases as Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Assocs., 22\n\nF.3d 1198 (1st Cir. 1994), pertinent.              There, we called attention\n\nto the safety valve of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), which gives a party\n\nwith an authentic need the opportunity to buy more time to mount an\n\nopposition to summary judgment.              Id. at 1203. But we emphasized\n\nthat invoking the rule required \"due diligence both in pursuing\n\ndiscovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in\n\npursuing an extension of time thereafter.\"             Id. In addition to due\n\ndiligence, we added:\n\n      When, as is often the case, the reason [for a requested\n      extension] relates to incomplete discovery, the party's\n      explanation must take a special form: it should show good\n      cause for the failure to have discovered the facts\n      sooner; it should set forth a plausible basis for\n      believing that specified facts, susceptible of collection\n      within a reasonable time frame, probably exist; and it\n      should indicate how the emergent facts, if adduced, will\n      influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment\n      motion.\n\nId.\n\n      In this case, there was no diligence exercised during the\n\nthree months of May, June, and July after the motion for summary\n\njudgment surfaced.          And not only was no good cause shown for\n\nfailure   to    have    discovered     facts      sooner,   but    there   was    no\n\nindication     of   plausibly    hoped      for   \"specified      facts\"   and   the\n\nfeasibility of their timely collection.                 We therefore have no\n\nalternative but to conclude that the district court did not abuse\n\nits   discretion       in   refusing   to    reconsider     and    grant   belated\n\ndiscovery.     The magistrate judge therefore properly considered the\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdefendants' statement of uncontested material facts as unopposed\n\nand, consequently, conceded to be true.\n\n     Thus guided, the magistrate judge first noted the sworn\n\nstatement of Arecibo's Finance Director stating that as of the\n\nbeginning of Mayor Hernández's administration in 2001 Arecibo had\n\na deficit of twelve million dollars.            The statement asserted that\n\nbecause of this extreme situation, and after considering other\n\noptions such as personnel relocation and reduction of working\n\nhours, \"the only option available to prevent a collapse of the\n\nMunicipal economy was to implement layoff of personnel.\"\n\n     The report went on to consider the sworn statement of the\n\nmunicipality's Human Resources Director, referring to letters of\n\ndismissal (copies of which were included) informing employees of\n\ntheir impending dismissal, due to the economic crisis, under a\n\ndismissal plan based on seniority.                Each letter notified the\n\nrecipient of his right to appeal the dismissal to the Appeals Board\n\nof the Personnel System.\n\n     Finally, the magistrate judge found no evidence of pretext\n\nconcealing a discriminatory animus.              He then, apparently having\n\ngiven    every   favorable    inference     to    the    allegations      in    the\n\ncomplaint, recommended that summary judgment issue for defendants.\n\n        Plaintiffs   made    timely   objections        to   this    report     and\n\nrecommendation,      which   are   really   a     replay     of    the   plea   for\n\ndiscovery made in the motion for reconsideration.                 They consist of\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\ftwo types of allegations.                The first is a criticism of both the\n\nfinancial    deficit      information        and     the    procedures      followed   in\n\nimplementing the layoff plan.               For example, the assertion is made\n\nthat defendants' \"fact\" concerning financial crisis \"can be easily\n\nquestioned\" by reviewing municipal financial statements and the\n\n\"totality    of     the    personnel        actions.\"          The    demand    is     for\n\nunidentified more \"reliable\" documents than the affidavits of the\n\nFinance Director and the Human Resources Director.\n\n     The    second       set   of    allegations           consists   of    categorical\n\nassertions lacking in any specificity, such as: \"certain employees\"\n\nhave been excluded from dismissal and allowed to continue working;\n\nnew personnel have been hired; \"big spending\" has taken place; all\n\nmunicipal    appointed         directors      have      received      substantial      pay\n\nincreases.    Plaintiffs assert that, if discovery is allowed, all\n\nthis will be proven.\n\n     What all this comes down to is an outline of areas of hopeful\n\ninquiry, something that plaintiffs could have articulated and\n\npursued months earlier. Ultimately, we come to the judgment of the\n\ndistrict    court    when      it    adopted      and    approved     the    Report    and\n\nRecommendation of the magistrate judge, granting summary judgment\n\nfor defendants and dismissing all claims. Its key finding was that\n\n\"[t]he   record     is    void      of    evidence      supporting     allegations      of\n\npolitical discrimination.\"               While plaintiffs assert that the court\n\nplaced an improper burden on them to show pretext affirmatively, we\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fthink the state of the record is such that there is no basis for a\n\nrational jury to conclude other than that plaintiffs' terminations\n\nwere    the   result    of    \"uniformly     applied   personnel     practices[]\n\npredicated on legitimate reasons,\" Sanchez-Lopez, 375 F.3d at 140.\n\n       There are two remaining arguments of plaintiffs that claim our\n\nattention.     On October 31, 2003, they filed an \"Informative Motion\n\nand Request of Judicial Knowledge,\" asking the court to take\n\njudicial notice \"for all legal purposes\" of another case involving\n\nsome two hundred dismissed employees in which plaintiffs had filed\n\na motion for summary judgment before another judge.                 We note first\n\nthat plaintiffs did not make this argument to the magistrate, and\n\nit is therefore waived.              See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun.\n\nWholesale     Elec.    Co.,    840    F.2d   985,   990-91   (1st    Cir.   1988).\n\nMoreover, plaintiffs          made no attempt to specify what \"adjudicable\n\nfacts\" met the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 201.                  Not\n\nonly do pleadings, parties, issues, and facts differ in different\n\ncases, but plaintiffs cannot sidestep their neglect to offer\n\nevidence in this case by asking the court to rule on the basis of\n\nthe    record in another case.         Finally, the district court's ruling\n\nin the other case – finding that the seniority plan used by\n\ndefendants \"could not, as a matter of law, have formed the legal\n\nbasis for Plaintiffs' dismissal\" – did not occur until March 2004,\n\nsome four months after the Informative Motion was made and on the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fsame day that the district court in this case signed its order.\n\nRefusal to take judicial notice was amply justified.\n\n     A final contention is that the district court improperly\n\ndismissed plaintiffs' claims based on Act No. 382 of May 11, 1950,\n\n29 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 136-139.   This argument dwindles in the face\n\nof the municipality's assertion, not denied by plaintiffs, that the\n\nprovision was repealed by Act 121 of September 13, 1997, before any\n\nevents relating to this case took place.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Now, if ever, are the teachings of such cases as <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Assocs.,</i> 22 F.3d 1198 (1st Cir. 1994), pertinent. There, we called attention to the safety valve of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), which gives a party with an authentic need the opportunity to buy more time to mount an opposition to summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 1203. But we emphasized that invoking the rule required \"due diligence both in pursuing discovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in pursuing an extension of time thereafter.\" <i>Id.</i> In addition to due diligence, we added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as is often the case, the reason [for a requested extension] relates to incomplete discovery, the party's explanation must take a special form: it should show good cause for the failure to have discovered the facts sooner; it should set forth a plausible basis for believing that specified facts, susceptible of collection within a reasonable time frame, probably exist; and it should indicate how the emergent facts, if adduced, will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was no diligence exercised during the three months of May, June, and July after the motion for summary judgment surfaced. And not only was no good cause shown for failure to have discovered facts sooner, but there was no indication of plausibly hoped for \"specified facts\" and the feasibility of their timely collection. We therefore have no alternative but to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider and grant belated discovery. The magistrate judge therefore properly considered the defendants' statement of uncontested material facts as unopposed and, consequently, conceded to be true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus guided, the magistrate judge first noted the sworn statement of Arecibo's Finance Director stating that as of the beginning of Mayor Hern&#225;ndez's administration in 2001 Arecibo had a deficit of twelve million dollars. The statement asserted that because of this extreme situation, and after considering other options such as personnel relocation and reduction of working hours, \"the only option available to prevent a collapse of the Municipal economy was to implement layoff of personnel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report went on to consider the sworn statement of the municipality's Human Resources Director, referring to letters of dismissal (copies of which were included) informing employees of their impending dismissal, due to the economic crisis, under a dismissal plan based on seniority. Each letter notified the recipient of his right to appeal the dismissal to the Appeals Board of the Personnel System.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the magistrate judge found no evidence of pretext concealing a discriminatory animus. He then, apparently having given every favorable inference to the allegations in the complaint, recommended that summary judgment issue for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs made timely objections to this report and recommendation, which are really a replay of the plea for discovery made in the motion for reconsideration. They consist of two types of allegations. The first is a criticism of both the financial deficit information and the procedures followed in implementing the layoff plan. For example, the assertion is made that defendants' \"fact\" concerning financial crisis \"can be easily questioned\" by reviewing municipal financial statements and the \"totality of the personnel actions.\" The demand is for unidentified more \"reliable\" documents than the affidavits of the Finance Director and the Human Resources Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of allegations consists of categorical assertions lacking in any specificity, such as: \"certain employees\" have been excluded from dismissal and allowed to continue working; new personnel have been hired; \"big spending\" has taken place; all municipal appointed directors have received substantial pay increases. Plaintiffs assert that, if discovery is allowed, all this will be proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What all this comes down to is an outline of areas of hopeful inquiry, something that plaintiffs could have articulated and pursued months earlier. Ultimately, we come to the judgment of the district court when it adopted and approved the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, granting summary judgment for defendants and dismissing all claims. Its key finding was that \"[t]he record is void of evidence supporting allegations of political discrimination.\" While plaintiffs assert that the court placed an improper burden on them to show pretext affirmatively, we think the state of the record is such that there is no basis for a rational jury to conclude other than that plaintiffs' terminations were the result of \"uniformly applied personnel practices[ ] predicated on legitimate reasons,\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two remaining arguments of plaintiffs that claim our attention. On October 31, 2003, they filed an \"Informative Motion and Request of Judicial Knowledge,\" asking the court to take judicial notice \"for all legal purposes\" of another case involving some two hundred dismissed employees in which plaintiffs had filed a motion for summary judgment before another judge. We note first that plaintiffs did not make this argument to the magistrate, and it is therefore waived. <i>See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 990-91 (1st Cir.1988). Moreover, plaintiffs made no attempt to specify what \"adjudicable facts\" met the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 201. Not only do pleadings, parties, issues, and facts differ in different cases, but plaintiffs cannot sidestep their neglect to offer evidence in this case by asking the court to rule on the basis of the record in another case. Finally, the district court's ruling in the other case &#8212; finding that the seniority plan used by defendants \"could not, as a matter of law, have formed the legal basis for Plaintiffs' dismissal\" &#8212; did not occur until March 2004, some four months after the Informative Motion was made and on the same day that the district court in this case signed its order. Refusal to take judicial notice was amply justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A final contention is that the district court improperly dismissed plaintiffs' claims based on Act No. 382 of May 11, 1950, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 136-139. This argument dwindles in the face of the municipality's assertion, not denied by plaintiffs, that the provision was repealed by Act 121 of September 13, 1997, before any events relating to this case took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Plaintiffs are members of the New Progressive Party (NPP) and the individual defendants are members of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), which was restored to power after the election of 2000.

Defendants submitted motions for dismissal and summary judgment supported by statements of municipal officers evidencing not only financial stringency but also implementation of a seniority-based layoff plan devised in contemplation of such an emergency by the prior mayor, an NPP member.

Their political beliefs were alleged, in conclusory terms, to be known by defendants.

The statement asserted that because of this extreme situation, and after considering other options such as personnel relocation and reduction of working hours, \"the only option available to prevent a collapse of the Municipal economy was to implement layoff of personnel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report went on to consider the sworn statement of the municipality's Human Resources Director, referring to letters of dismissal (copies of which were included) informing employees of their impending dismissal, due to the economic crisis, under a dismissal plan based on seniority. Each letter notified the recipient of his right to appeal the dismissal to the Appeals Board of the Personnel System.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the magistrate judge found no evidence of pretext concealing a discriminatory animus. He then, apparently having given every favorable inference to the allegations in the complaint, recommended that summary judgment issue for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs made timely objections to this report and recommendation, which are really a replay of the plea for discovery made in the motion for reconsideration. They consist of two types of allegations. The first is a criticism of both the financial deficit information and the procedures followed in implementing the layoff plan. For example, the assertion is made that defendants' \"fact\" concerning financial crisis \"can be easily questioned\" by reviewing municipal financial statements and the \"totality of the personnel actions.\" The demand is for unidentified more \"reliable\" documents than the affidavits of the Finance Director and the Human Resources Director.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of allegations consists of categorical assertions lacking in any specificity, such as: \"certain employees\" have been excluded from dismissal and allowed to continue working; new personnel have been hired; \"big spending\" has taken place; all municipal appointed directors have received substantial pay increases. Plaintiffs assert that, if discovery is allowed, all this will be proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What all this comes down to is an outline of areas of hopeful inquiry, something that plaintiffs could have articulated and pursued months earlier. Ultimately, we come to the judgment of the district court when it adopted and approved the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, granting summary judgment for defendants and dismissing all claims. Its key finding was that \"[t]he record is void of evidence supporting allegations of political discrimination.\" While plaintiffs assert that the court placed an improper burden on them to show pretext affirmatively, we think the state of the record is such that there is no basis for a rational jury to conclude other than that plaintiffs' terminations were the result of \"uniformly applied personnel practices[ ] predicated on legitimate reasons,\" <i>Sanchez-Lopez,</i> 375 F.3d at 140.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two remaining arguments of plaintiffs that claim our attention. On October 31, 2003, they filed an \"Informative Motion and Request of Judicial Knowledge,\" asking the court to take judicial notice \"for all legal purposes\" of another case involving some two hundred dismissed employees in which plaintiffs had filed a motion for summary judgment before another judge. We note first that plaintiffs did not make this argument to the magistrate, and it is therefore waived. <i>See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 990-91 (1st Cir.1988). Moreover, plaintiffs made no attempt to specify what \"adjudicable facts\" met the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 201. Not only do pleadings, parties, issues, and facts differ in different cases, but plaintiffs cannot sidestep their neglect to offer evidence in this case by asking the court to rule on the basis of the record in another case. Finally, the district court's ruling in the other case &#8212; finding that the seniority plan used by defendants \"could not, as a matter of law, have formed the legal basis for Plaintiffs' dismissal\" &#8212; did not occur until March 2004, some four months after the Informative Motion was made and on the same day that the district court in this case signed its order. Refusal to take judicial notice was amply justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A final contention is that the district court improperly dismissed plaintiffs' claims based on Act No. 382 of May 11, 1950, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 136-139. This argument dwindles in the face of the municipality's assertion, not denied by plaintiffs, that the provision was repealed by Act 121 of September 13, 1997, before any events relating to this case took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
