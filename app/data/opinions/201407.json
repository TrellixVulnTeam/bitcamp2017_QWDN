R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-1382\n\n                           INGRID CRUZ RAMOS,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n       JO ANNE BARNHART, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n         [Hon. José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Salvador Medina De La Cruz on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Lisa E. Bhatia, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, and Karen B. Burzycki, Assistant Regional Counsel,\nSocial Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            January 11, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.      Claimant Ingrid Cruz Ramos appeals from a\n\ndecision of the district court upholding the Commissioner's denial\n\nof disability and disability insurance benefits under the Social\n\nSecurity Act.      After carefully reviewing the briefs and record, we\n\naffirm the Commissioner's decision.\n\n             On appeal, appellant argues that it was error for the\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") to apply the Medical-Vocational\n\nGuidelines (the \"Grid\"), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2,\n\nin   light    of   the    evidence     of   her    nonexertional    impairment.\n\nAppellant also argues that the Commissioner failed to demonstrate\n\nthrough    particularized      proof    that      appellant   was   capable   of\n\nperforming jobs which exist in significant numbers in the national\n\neconomy.\n\n             We conclude that there is ample support in the record for\n\nthe ALJ's determination that appellant's mental impairment did not\n\nsignificantly affect her ability to perform the full range of jobs\n\nat   the   relevant      exertional    level.      Although   appellant   cites\n\ntreating source evaluations in support of her contention that her\n\nmental condition significantly limited her ability to function in\n\na work setting, the record contains substantial countervailing\n\nevidence. While the evidence shows that appellant was consistently\n\ndiagnosed with severe depression, she was treated conservatively,\n\ndemonstrated no suicidal or homicidal thinking, and there is no\n\nrecord of any hospitalization for that condition.                   Examination\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fnotes consistently indicate that appellant was alert, that she\n\ndemonstrated fair judgment, and that her orientation, intellect,\n\ninsight, and memory were adequate.               The state agency consultative\n\nexamining psychiatrist noted that, although appellant's flow of\n\nthought was slow, it was logical, coherent, and relevant.                          In\n\naddition, appellant herself reported that she got along well with\n\nco-workers      and   supervisors       while    she   was   working.       The   non-\n\nexamining state agency psychiatrist and psychologist concluded,\n\nbased on their review of the medical evidence, that appellant was\n\ncapable of understanding, remembering, and carrying out simple and\n\ndetailed instructions, could sustain attention and concentration\n\nfor at least two-hour periods, and could complete a normal workday\n\nand work-week.        Accordingly, the non-examining physicians opined\n\nthat appellant's mental impairment did not significantly affect her\n\nresidual functional capacity (\"RFC\").                  These assessments and the\n\nreports    of     the     consultative          examining    physicians      provide\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the ALJ's determination.                           See\n\nBerrios Lopez v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 951 F.2d 427,\n\n431-32 (1st Cir. 1991); Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 373 (1st\n\nCir. 1985).\n\n           To     the    extent   appellant       contends    that    her   treating\n\npsychiatrist's opinion was entitled to controlling weight, her\n\nargument   fails        because   the    treating       physician's     opinion    is\n\ninconsistent with the bulk of the medical evidence and is not\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fsupported by any progress notes or clinical or laboratory findings.\n\nThe ALJ was justified in according the treating psychiatrist's\n\nreport little weight.        See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d).           T o     t h e\n\nextent appellant suggests that the ALJ should have obtained the\n\ntestimony of a medical expert to resolve any apparent conflicts\n\nbetween the treating physicians' assessments and the opinions of\n\nthe state agency physicians, her argument is unavailing because RFC\n\nis not a medical assessment, but is instead an administrative\n\nfinding reserved to the Commissioner.            20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e).\n\nMoreover, as discussed above, it was appropriate for the ALJ to\n\nrely   on   the   reports     of   the    consultative    and   non-examining\n\nphysicians in assessing appellant's RFC.                 See Evangelista v.\n\nSecretary of Health & Human Servs., 826 F.2d 136, 144 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (ALJ may piece together relevant medical facts from the\n\nfindings    and   opinions    of   multiple    physicians).         Since    the\n\nconsultative and non-examining physicians concluded that appellant\n\nsuffered from mild limitations at most, the ALJ's RFC determination\n\nappears to be sufficiently supported by the record.\n\n            Having determined that the ALJ's finding that appellant's\n\nRFC was not significantly affected by nonexertional limitations, it\n\nis apparent that application of the Grid was appropriate and that\n\nno   'particularized   proof'      of    appellant's     specific   vocational\n\ncapabilities or other vocational evidence was required. See Ortiz,\n\n890 F.2d at 524 (reliance on Grid appropriate if nonexertional\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\flimitation reduces claimant's occupational base only marginally);\n\nLugo,   794   F.2d   at   17   (similar).   Accordingly,   in   light   of\n\nappellant's age, education, and past work experience, the ALJ\n\nproperly found that Medical-Vocational Rule 203.19 directed a\n\nfinding that appellant was not disabled.          Affirmed.     See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
