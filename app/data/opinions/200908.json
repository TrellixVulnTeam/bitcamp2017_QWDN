Nery Oliveirio Najera Mendez (\"Najera\") and\n\nElda Susana Jimenez Mendez Najera (\"Jimenez\") are citizens of\n\nGuatemala, who entered the United States at the Mexican border\n\nwithout being admitted or paroled on April 3, 1993, and August 27,\n\n1992, respectively.     The two were married in the United States on\n\nApril 14, 1998, and have one child born in the United States.    On\n\nOctober 15, 1998, the INS issued each of them a Notice to Appear\n\nwhich charged Najera and Jimenez with removability under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2000) as aliens present in the United States\n\nwithout being admitted or paroled.\n\n          Najera and Jimenez conceded removability as charged, and\n\nrequested asylum and withholding of removal.    An Immigration Judge\n\nheld a hearing on the asylum applications on November 16, 1999,\n\nduring which both Najera and Jimenez testified.    At the conclusion\n\nof the hearing, the Immigration Judge denied the petitioners'\n\napplications for asylum because they had not been timely filed and\n\nthere were no excusing exceptional circumstances.        8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(2) (2000).    No appeal was taken from this aspect of the\n\nruling.\n\n          The   Immigration     Judge   also   denied   petitioners'\n\napplications for withholding of removal, finding that they had\n\nfailed to demonstrate past persecution or a probability of future\n\npersecution on account of a protected ground. Petitioners appealed\n\nthis part of the Immigration Judge's decision to the Board of\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fImmigration Appeals, which affirmed without opinion the decision of\n\nthe Immigration Judge.    8 C.F.R. 1003.1(a)(7) (2003).        Petitioners\n\nnow seek review in this court, and under the new procedures this\n\nmeans that we review directly the decision of the Immigration\n\nJudge.   Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           \"The burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding\n\nof removal . . . to establish that his or her life or freedom would\n\nbe threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"      8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b) (2003).          An\n\nalien can establish withholding of removal in one of two ways.\n\nFirst, the alien may demonstrate past persecution on one of the\n\nprotected grounds, which creates a rebuttable presumption that the\n\nalien's life or freedom would be threatened in the future.           Id. §\n\n208.16(b)(1) (2003).     Second, the alien may show that his or her\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened in the future by demonstrating\n\nthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted\n\non account of a protected ground.       Id. § 208.16(b)(2) (2003).\n\n          The Immigration Judge found that petitioners had not\n\nproduced evidence sufficient to establish withholding of removal\n\nunder either   method.     That   determination   \"must   be    upheld   if\n\nsupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole.\"      El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f195, 202 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481      (1992)    (internal   quotation     omitted)).        We    deny   the\n\npetitions for review because the evidence fails to establish past\n\npersecution or a threat of future persecution on account of one of\n\nthe five enumerated grounds.\n\n              The evidence produced in support of petitioners' claim is\n\nbriefly as follows: Najera was born in the village of Santo Domingo\n\nin Guatemala, and moved with his family to the village of Peten.\n\nJimenez also lived in the village of Peten, although she did not\n\nknow Najera before coming to America.                   In January 1984, when\n\npetitioners were ten or eleven years old, the village was attacked\n\nby   guerrillas.        Najera's    parents    disappeared     in   the    attack.\n\nJimenez's parents were wounded in the attack, but survived and\n\ncontinue to reside in Guatemala; her aunt, uncle, and cousin\n\ndisappeared in the attack.\n\n              Najera testified that his parents were not involved\n\npolitically, had no contact with the guerillas, and that although\n\nthey were Catholic his family was not persecuted on account of\n\ntheir religion.         Jimenez also testified that her family was not\n\npart of any political or religious group that would have made them\n\nsubject to this kind of attack.            Jimenez speculated that the 1984\n\nattack   by    the     guerrillas   on    Peten   was    caused   by     the   false\n\naccusation either that the villagers or her family specifically--\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fher testimony is ambiguous on this point--were acting as informants\n\nto the military against the guerillas.\n\n          Nothing in the evidence suggests past persecution on one\n\nof the five protected grounds.   The only other evidence as to past\n\npersecution involved a 1986 guerilla attack on Najera's neighbor's\n\nhome in Santa Domingo.   Najera fled to Santa Domingo after leaving\n\nPeten but before leaving Guatemala altogether.   The attack, which\n\nfocused on Najera's neighbor and not him, does not suggest past\n\npersecution on account of one of the protected grounds.\n\n          Petitioners fare no better in seeking to prove future\n\npersecution on account of one of the five protected grounds.\n\nNajera testified that he has not had any contact with friends or\n\nrelatives in Guatemala since he left the country in 1986, and had\n\nno knowledge of the current conditions there.      Najera is not a\n\nmember of any organizations or groups in Guatemala, nor has he ever\n\nbeen arrested, detained or interrogated in any country.   He stated\n\nthat notwithstanding peace accords agreed on in 1996 in Guatemala,\n\nhe was still afraid to return because of what he experienced in\n\n1984.   When pressed as to whether he thought anyone in Guatemala\n\nwas looking for him specifically, he merely stated \"there's always\n\npeople to harm you and I'm very frightened to be killed.\"\n\n          Jimenez, who left Guatemala in 1987 at the request of her\n\nparents, still keeps in touch with her parents and siblings who\n\nreside in Guatemala.     She stated that although no member of her\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffamily has recently been attacked in Guatemala, she is afraid to\n\nreturn there because \"it is known that these people are always\n\nkilling there.\"   Jimenez is not a member of any organizations or\n\ngroups in Guatemala, nor has she ever been arrested, detained or\n\ninterrogated in any country.\n\n           While petitioners have produced evidence that guerilla\n\nattacks continue in Guatemala, and may even be able to demonstrate\n\nthat they too could fall victim to guerilla attacks, they have\n\nproduced no evidence to suggest that any persecution they may\n\nsuffer will be on account of one of the five enumerated protected\n\ngrounds.   Petitioners concede as much in their brief:\n\n           Eventhough [sic] the retribution which the\n           Petitioners believes [sic] they will suffer if\n           they are returned to Guatemala, does not\n           appear to be on account of race, religion,\n           nationality, membership in a particular social\n           group or political opinion, the fact the\n           Guatemalan government has been so ineffective\n           in preventing, policing and prosecuting cases\n           of retribution and other violent crime,\n           demonstrates an acquiescence and acceptance by\n           the government of these activities which place\n           people in the Petitioners' position in great\n           danger.\n\n           \"[I]t is the law that general fears (even 'well-founded'\n\nones) of future harm from political upheaval or terrorist violence\n\nare not sufficient to establish eligibility for asylum,\" Meguenine\n\nv.
