Yue Yun Lin, a native and\n\ncitizen of China, petitions for review of a Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (“BIA”) decision affirming an immigration judge’s (“IJ”)\n\ndenial of Lin’s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).        Lin\n\nclaims that she was targeted by Chinese authorities on account of\n\nher opposition to China’s coercive birth control policies, and\n\nwould face future persecution if she were removed to China.      We\n\nconclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination\n\nthat Lin lacked credibility, and therefore we deny Lin’s petition\n\nfor review.\n\nI.   Background\n\n           Lin was born in China in 1975, and first entered the\n\nUnited States in November 2000.    In December 2000, Lin was served\n\nwith a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability.         In\n\nNovember 2001, Lin applied for asylum, withholding of removal and\n\nCAT protection.\n\n           In her asylum application, Lin described several run-ins\n\nwith Chinese family planning officials.    First, she said that in\n\nMarch 1999 she was falsely accused by family planning officials of\n\nliving with her boyfriend without being married. According to Lin,\n\nshe actually lived with her parents at that time.    The officials\n\nbeat Lin’s boyfriend and forced Lin to submit to a gynecological\n\nexam to check for pregnancy.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          Next, in May 1999, the family planning officials in Lin’s\n\nvillage began seeking Lin’s brother, because he and his wife had a\n\nsecond child in violation of government policy.    Officials visited\n\nLin’s home three times to question Lin and her parents regarding\n\nLin’s brother, in May, June, and July 1999.    Lin stated that at the\n\nJuly visit, the officials insisted that her parents pay a 30,000\n\nyuan RMB fine because of their refusal to divulge the whereabouts\n\nof Lin’s brother’s family.   As Lin’s parents could not afford to\n\npay the fine, the officials decided to arrest the parents.      When\n\nLin protested, a struggle ensued.     An official struck Lin, then\n\nkicked her when she fell to the ground.   Lin’s parents were held by\n\nthe authorities for several months.\n\n          In reaction to this second incident, Lin said that she\n\ndecided to protest the officials’ acts. Because Lin was not highly\n\nliterate, she asked someone else to write a statement for her\n\ndescribing what had happened to her family and criticizing the\n\nfamily planning officials.   Lin posted the statement around the\n\nvillage, and sent a copy to the local court.    Lin was subsequently\n\ntold that the family planning officials, upset by her public\n\nprotest, wanted to arrest her.       To avoid arrest, Lin left the\n\nvillage and eventually settled in Xiamen, taking a job in a\n\nclothing factory there.\n\n          Lin described a final encounter with the authorities that\n\noccurred in Xiamen later that fall.        Lin, however, gave two\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fdiffering versions of the incident in her asylum application and\n\nher later testimony in a hearing before the IJ.               In Lin’s asylum\n\napplication, she stated that in November 1999, police conducted a\n\ncheck for ID cards among the workers at Lin’s factory.                    Fearing\n\narrest because she was not a resident of Xiamen and thus not\n\nlegally permitted to work in Xiamen, Lin attempted to flee from the\n\npolice.    During the chase, Lin said that she fell into a deep gully\n\nand was knocked unconscious.       She woke in a hospital, with severe\n\ninjuries to her left arm and her face.          During the next year, Lin\n\nstayed with friends in order to avoid arrest.           Eventually, she met\n\nan alien smuggler who helped her make her way to the United States\n\nby way of Vietnam and Japan.\n\n            In her oral testimony before the IJ, speaking through a\n\ntranslator, Lin described the incident in Xiamen that led to her\n\ninjuries differently.      She testified that one day she went out to\n\nthe grocery store and encountered family planning officials from\n\nher home village who were there searching for her to arrest her.\n\nShe fled into the mountains, and fell, which caused the injuries to\n\nher arm and face.         Lin’s oral description of the events that\n\nfollowed, including her recovery and travel to the United States,\n\nremained    essentially    the   same    as   that    given   in    her    asylum\n\napplication.\n\n            After   receiving    Lin’s    testimony    over   the    course    of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fseveral hearings,1 the IJ rejected Lin’s application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT protection.                  In a written decision\n\nfiled in February 2005, the IJ stated that Lin’s testimony was not\n\ncredible, based on discrepancies and vagueness in Lin’s account of\n\nher experiences.\n\n                  Specifically, the IJ cited six inconsistencies in Lin’s\n\nwritten          asylum   application    and    her   oral    testimony.      These\n\ndiscrepancies included: (1) that Lin gave inconsistent dates for\n\nher employment in Xiamen; (2) that Lin told two quite distinct\n\nversions of the chase by government officials in Xiamen in the\n\napplication and in her testimony; (3) that Lin listed eight total\n\nyears of education on her application, but stated at the hearing\n\nthat she had only five years of schooling; (4) that Lin failed to\n\nmention at the hearing that she had traveled through Vietnam and\n\nJapan       en    route   to   the   United    States,   though   her   application\n\nincluded this information; (5) that Lin misrepresented her place of\n\nresidence at an earlier hearing before an IJ in New York; and (6)\n\nthat Lin gave differing accounts of the family planning officials’\n\nthree visits to her parents’ home in search of her brother.\n\n                  Based on Lin’s lack of credibility, the IJ found that Lin\n\nhad not established her eligibility for asylum.                         The IJ also\n\n\n\n        1\n       Lin’s individual hearing on her asylum application was\ncontinued twice, once so that she could apply for a different form\nof immigration relief and once so that she could secure child care\nfor her infant during the hearing.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fconcluded that, even if Lin were found credible, Lin had not\n\ndemonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution, as she had\n\nremained in a state-run hospital for a month following the chase by\n\ngovernment officials without incident, and suffered no further\n\nproblems before she left China a year later.                  Moreover, Lin’s\n\nparents and the family of her brother all continued to live in\n\nChina peaceably. Given that Lin had failed to show her eligibility\n\nfor   asylum,   the   IJ   found   that    Lin   had   also   failed   to   show\n\neligibility for withholding of removal or CAT protection.\n\n            In a per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ’s decision. The BIA stated that “the discrepancies noted by the\n\nImmigration Judge are material and relevant to [Lin’s] persecution\n\nclaim and the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility finding is\n\nsupported by the record before us.”         As a result, the BIA concluded\n\nthat Lin had failed to satisfy her burden of proof as to her\n\nclaims, and her appeal was dismissed.\n\nII.   Standard of Review\n\n            Where, as here, “the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ’s\n\nruling, but also discussed some of the bases for the IJ’s opinion,\n\nwe review both the IJ’s and BIA’s opinions.”              Zheng v. Gonzales,\n\n475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007).           We review the agency’s factual\n\nfindings,    including      credibility      determinations,      under     the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard, and may overturn those findings only\n\nif “any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthe contrary.”       8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Dhima v. Gonzales, 416\n\nF.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005).         We “give great deference to an IJ’s\n\n[credibility] determinations so long as the IJ provide[d] specific\n\nreasons for those determinations.”            Id. at 95 (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n            An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing her\n\neligibility for asylum.         8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a).     She may do so by\n\ndemonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution in her home country on the basis of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.     8     U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(42)(A);   8   C.F.R.   §   1208.13(b).\n\nOpposition    to    a   government’s   coercive   birth   control    policies\n\nqualifies as political opinion.          Zheng, 475 F.3d at 34 (citing 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)).\n\n            An applicant may establish her eligibility for asylum on\n\nthe basis of her testimony alone, but if she attempts to do so, an\n\nagency finding that she is not credible will usually doom her\n\napplication.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); see also Dhima, 416 F.3d\n\nat 95.     While we defer to the agency’s credibility findings, we\n\nadhere to the principle that “an adverse credibility determination\n\ncannot rest on trivia but must be based on discrepancies that\n\ninvolved the heart of the asylum claim.”          Bojorques-Villanueva v.\n\nINS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation and internal\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fquotation marks omitted).2 Further, the discrepancies or omissions\n\nrelied upon by the IJ “must actually be present in the record . .\n\n. and . . . a convincing explanation for the discrepancies or\n\nomissions must not have been supplied by the alien.”      Zheng v.\n\nGonzales, 464 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2006) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n          In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s\n\nfinding that Lin was not credible. Our primary basis for upholding\n\nthe IJ’s adverse credibility finding is the glaring inconsistency\n\nin Lin’s two accounts of the incident that led her to leave China,\n\ni.e., the alleged chase by authorities that led to Lin’s fall and\n\nsevere injuries to her left arm.\n\n          Lin first alleged that she was chased by police after she\n\nsought to evade an ID card check at the factory where she worked\n\n(an event that would be irrelevant to her claim of persecution on\n\naccount of her opposition to Chinese birth control policies).   She\n\nlater claimed that the chase began during a trip to the grocery\n\nstore, when she encountered family planning officials from her home\n\n\n\n     2\n       The REAL ID Act of 2005 added a provision to the asylum\nstatute stating that inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods\nin the asylum applicant’s statements may support an adverse\ncredibility finding “without regard to whether [the] inconsistency,\ninaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant’s claim\n. . . .” REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 101(a)(3), 119\nStat. 231, 303 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii)).\nHowever, Lin’s asylum application was filed well before the Act’s\neffective date and thus should be adjudicated under the standards\nof prior law. See In re S-B, 24 I. & N. Dec. 42, 45 (BIA 2006).\n\n                               -8-\n\fvillage and fled to avoid arrest. These accounts are fundamentally\n\ninconsistent, and the inconsistency undermines the core basis for\n\nLin’s claimed fear of persecution, which was Lin’s allegation that\n\nfamily planning officials from her village actively sought her\n\narrest following Lin’s public opposition to the officials’ coercive\n\npractices. Lin has never explained why she told two such different\n\nversions of this incident in Xiamen.\n\n               Moreover, the record also supports the IJ’s description\n\nof the other inconsistencies and omissions in Lin’s accounts of her\n\nexperiences.         While    these   additional     discrepancies      do    not\n\nnecessarily go to the heart of Lin’s persecution claim, and thus\n\nmight    not    be   enough   standing     alone   to   support    an   adverse\n\ncredibility finding, see Bojorques-Villanueva, 194 F.3d at 16, in\n\nthis case they provide further support for the IJ’s conclusion that\n\nLin was not candid in her recitation of events.             Thus, we conclude\n\nthat    the    record   supports   the    IJ’s   finding   that   Lin   was   not\n\ntruthful.\n\n               Given Lin’s lack of credibility in describing the basis\n\nfor her alleged fear of future persecution, Lin has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that she is eligible for asylum.                 See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.13(a).      For the same reason, Lin has also failed to establish\n\nher eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT protection, as\n\nshe has not demonstrated that she is likely to suffer threats to\n\nher life or freedom, or face torture if removed to China.                 See 8\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (withholding of removal required where alien’s\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected\n\nground if removed); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16 (c)(2) (CAT protection\n\naccorded where alien would more likely than not be tortured if\n\nremoved).    Consequently, we affirm the BIA’s order.\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

Lin claims that she was targeted by Chinese authorities on account of her opposition to China's coercive birth control policies, and would face future persecution if she were removed to China. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Lin lacked credibility, and therefore we deny Lin's petition for review.</p>\n<p>I. Background</p>\n<p>Lin was born in China in 1975, and first entered the United States in November 2000. In December 2000, Lin was served with a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability. In November 2001, Lin applied for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p>In her asylum application, Lin described several run-ins with Chinese family planning officials. First, she said that in March 1999 she was falsely accused by family planning officials of living with her boyfriend without being married. According to Lin, she actually lived with her parents at that time. The officials beat Lin's boyfriend and forced Lin to submit to a gynecological exam to check for pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Next, in May 1999, the family planning officials in Lin's village began seeking Lin's brother, because he and his wife had a second child in violation of government policy. Officials visited Lin's home three times to question Lin and her parents regarding Lin's brother, in May, June, and July 1999. Lin stated that at the July visit, the officials insisted that her parents pay a 30,000 yuan RMB fine because of their refusal to divulge the whereabouts of Lin's brother's family. As Lin's parents could not afford to pay the fine, the officials decided to arrest the parents. When Lin protested, a struggle ensued. An official struck Lin, then kicked her when she fell to the ground. Lin's parents were held by the authorities for several months.</p>\n<p>In reaction to this second incident, Lin said that she decided to protest the officials' acts. Because Lin was not highly literate, she asked someone else to write a statement for her describing what had happened to her family and criticizing the family planning officials. Lin posted the statement around the village, and sent a copy to the local court. Lin was subsequently told that the family planning officials, upset by her public protest, wanted to arrest her. To avoid arrest, Lin left the village and eventually settled in Xiamen, taking a job in a clothing factory there.</p>\n<p>Lin described a final encounter with the authorities that occurred in Xiamen later that fall. Lin, however, gave two differing versions of the incident in her asylum application and her later testimony in a hearing before the IJ. In Lin's asylum application, she stated that in November 1999, police conducted a check for ID cards among the workers at Lin's factory. Fearing arrest because she was not a resident of Xiamen and thus not legally permitted to work in Xiamen, Lin attempted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> to flee from the police. During the chase, Lin said that she fell into a deep gully and was knocked unconscious. She woke in a hospital, with severe injuries to her left arm and her face. During the next year, Lin stayed with friends in order to avoid arrest. Eventually, she met an alien smuggler who helped her make her way to the United States by way of Vietnam and Japan.</p>\n<p>In her oral testimony before the IJ, speaking through a translator, Lin described the incident in Xiamen that led to her injuries differently. She testified that one day she went out to the grocery store and encountered family planning officials from her home village who were there searching for her to arrest her. She fled into the mountains, and fell, which caused the injuries to her arm and face. Lin's oral description of the events that followed, including her recovery and travel to the United States, remained essentially the same as that given in her asylum application.</p>\n<p>After receiving Lin's testimony over the course of several hearings,<sup>[1]</sup> the IJ rejected Lin's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. In a written decision filed in February 2005, the IJ stated that Lin's testimony was not credible, based on discrepancies and vagueness in Lin's account of her experiences.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the IJ cited six inconsistencies in Lin's written asylum application and her oral testimony. These discrepancies included: (1) that Lin gave inconsistent dates for her employment in Xiamen; (2) that Lin told two quite distinct versions of the chase by government officials in Xiamen in the application and in her testimony; (3) that Lin listed eight total years of education on her application, but stated at the hearing that she had only five years of schooling; (4) that Lin failed to mention at the hearing that she had traveled through Vietnam and Japan en route to the United States, though her application included this information; (5) that Lin misrepresented her place of residence at an earlier hearing before an IJ in New York; and (6) that Lin gave differing accounts of the family planning officials' three visits to her parents' home in search of her brother.</p>\n<p>Based on Lin's lack of credibility, the IJ found that Lin had not established her eligibility for asylum. The IJ also concluded that, even if Lin were found credible, Lin had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution, as she had remained in a state-run hospital for a month following the chase by government officials without incident, and suffered no further problems before she left China a year later. Moreover, Lin's parents and the family of her brother all continued to live in China peaceably.

Lin claims that she was targeted by Chinese authorities on account of her opposition to China's coercive birth control policies, and would face future persecution if she were removed to China. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Lin lacked credibility, and therefore we deny Lin's petition for review.</p>\n<p>I. Background</p>\n<p>Lin was born in China in 1975, and first entered the United States in November 2000. In December 2000, Lin was served with a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability. In November 2001, Lin applied for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT protection.</p>\n<p>In her asylum application, Lin described several run-ins with Chinese family planning officials. First, she said that in March 1999 she was falsely accused by family planning officials of living with her boyfriend without being married. According to Lin, she actually lived with her parents at that time. The officials beat Lin's boyfriend and forced Lin to submit to a gynecological exam to check for pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Next, in May 1999, the family planning officials in Lin's village began seeking Lin's brother, because he and his wife had a second child in violation of government policy. Officials visited Lin's home three times to question Lin and her parents regarding Lin's brother, in May, June, and July 1999. Lin stated that at the July visit, the officials insisted that her parents pay a 30,000 yuan RMB fine because of their refusal to divulge the whereabouts of Lin's brother's family. As Lin's parents could not afford to pay the fine, the officials decided to arrest the parents. When Lin protested, a struggle ensued. An official struck Lin, then kicked her when she fell to the ground. Lin's parents were held by the authorities for several months.</p>\n<p>In reaction to this second incident, Lin said that she decided to protest the officials' acts. Because Lin was not highly literate, she asked someone else to write a statement for her describing what had happened to her family and criticizing the family planning officials. Lin posted the statement around the village, and sent a copy to the local court. Lin was subsequently told that the family planning officials, upset by her public protest, wanted to arrest her. To avoid arrest, Lin left the village and eventually settled in Xiamen, taking a job in a clothing factory there.</p>\n<p>Lin described a final encounter with the authorities that occurred in Xiamen later that fall. Lin, however, gave two differing versions of the incident in her asylum application and her later testimony in a hearing before the IJ. In Lin's asylum application, she stated that in November 1999, police conducted a check for ID cards among the workers at Lin's factory. Fearing arrest because she was not a resident of Xiamen and thus not legally permitted to work in Xiamen, Lin attempted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> to flee from the police. During the chase, Lin said that she fell into a deep gully and was knocked unconscious. She woke in a hospital, with severe injuries to her left arm and her face. During the next year, Lin stayed with friends in order to avoid arrest. Eventually, she met an alien smuggler who helped her make her way to the United States by way of Vietnam and Japan.</p>\n<p>In her oral testimony before the IJ, speaking through a translator, Lin described the incident in Xiamen that led to her injuries differently. She testified that one day she went out to the grocery store and encountered family planning officials from her home village who were there searching for her to arrest her. She fled into the mountains, and fell, which caused the injuries to her arm and face. Lin's oral description of the events that followed, including her recovery and travel to the United States, remained essentially the same as that given in her asylum application.</p>\n<p>After receiving Lin's testimony over the course of several hearings,<sup>[1]</sup> the IJ rejected Lin's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. In a written decision filed in February 2005, the IJ stated that Lin's testimony was not credible, based on discrepancies and vagueness in Lin's account of her experiences.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the IJ cited six inconsistencies in Lin's written asylum application and her oral testimony. These discrepancies included: (1) that Lin gave inconsistent dates for her employment in Xiamen; (2) that Lin told two quite distinct versions of the chase by government officials in Xiamen in the application and in her testimony; (3) that Lin listed eight total years of education on her application, but stated at the hearing that she had only five years of schooling; (4) that Lin failed to mention at the hearing that she had traveled through Vietnam and Japan en route to the United States, though her application included this information; (5) that Lin misrepresented her place of residence at an earlier hearing before an IJ in New York; and (6) that Lin gave differing accounts of the family planning officials' three visits to her parents' home in search of her brother.</p>\n<p>Based on Lin's lack of credibility, the IJ found that Lin had not established her eligibility for asylum. The IJ also concluded that, even if Lin were found credible, Lin had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution, as she had remained in a state-run hospital for a month following the chase by government officials without incident, and suffered no further problems before she left China a year later. Moreover, Lin's parents and the family of her brother all continued to live in China peaceably. Given that Lin had failed to show her eligibility for asylum, the IJ found that Lin had also failed to show eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT protection.</p>\n<p>In a per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision. The BIA stated that \"the discrepancies noted by the Immigration Judge are material and relevant to [Lin's] persecution claim and the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding is supported by the record before us.\" As a result, the BIA concluded that Lin had failed to satisfy her burden of proof as to her claims, and her appeal was dismissed.</p>\n<p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p>Where, as here, \"the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, but also discussed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions.\" <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202616\"><a href=\"/opinion/202616/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2007). We review the agency's factual findings, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, and may overturn those findings only if \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201733\"><a href=\"/opinion/201733/dhima-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir. 2005). We \"give great deference to an IJ's [credibility] determinations so long as the IJ provide[d] specific reasons for those determinations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 95 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>III. Discussion</p>\n<p>An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a). She may do so by demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution in her home country on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b). Opposition to a government's coercive birth control policies qualifies as political opinion. <i>Zheng,</i> 475 F.3d at 34 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)).</p>\n<p>An applicant may establish her eligibility for asylum on the basis of her testimony alone, but if she attempts to do so, an agency finding that she is not credible will usually doom her application. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); <i>see also </i><i>Dhima,</i> 416 F.3d at 95.
