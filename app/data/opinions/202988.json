Sandoval with whom Frank Inserni-Milam and Luis\nMellado-González were on brief for appellants.\n     Anthony A. Yang, Appellate Staff, Civil Division, Department\nof Justice, with whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General,\nRosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Robert S.\nGreenspan, Appellate Staff, Civil Division, Department of Justice,\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         October 23, 2007\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge. This is an appeal from the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of a case under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n(\"FTCA\"), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (2000), arising out of the death of\n\nAntonio Velez-Garcia.        Velez, arrested for drug possession in\n\nJanuary 2003, agreed to serve as an undercover FBI cooperating\n\nwitness.   He was murdered by a gang member in March 2003 while\n\nassisting the FBI in a sting operation directed against gang-\n\nrelated drug trafficking in Puerto Rico.\n\n           Claiming   that   the     FBI   agents    had   mishandled   Velez'\n\nassignment, his family first sought damages in a suit against named\n\nFBI agents in their individual capacities, relying upon Bivens v.\n\nSix Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388\n\n(1971), and on Puerto Rico law.            The agents claimed qualified\n\nimmunity and the United States sought to substitute itself for the\n\nagents under the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d), by filing the\n\nnecessary certificate.\n\n           The   district    court    rejected      both   requests,    but   on\n\ninterlocutory appeal, this court ordered dismissal of the Bivens\n\nclaims on grounds of qualified immunity and allowed the United\n\nStates to substitute itself as defendant in the claims against the\n\nagents arising under Puerto Rico law. Velez-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry,\n\n421 F.3d 71, 77-80 (2005) (\"Velez-Diaz I\").            On remand the United\n\nStates then moved on December 14, 2005, to dismiss the suit on the\n\nground that the plaintiffs had to exhaust their administrative\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fremedies before an action against the United States could be\n\npursued. Under the FTCA, a court suit filed before exhaustion does\n\nnot ripen but is barred.    McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106,\n\n112-13 (1993).\n\n          As it happens, the plaintiffs had filed an administrative\n\nclaim against the United States simultaneously with their federal\n\nlaw suit against the agents, and the administrative claim had been\n\ndenied by a letter dated April 19, 2005, even before this court\n\ndecided the initial appeal in Velez-Diaz I.     This denial of the\n\nadministrative claim left the plaintiffs free to file a federal law\n\nsuit against the United States within six months of the denial.   28\n\nU.S.C. § 2401(b).\n\n          Plaintiffs did then file a new law suit against the\n\nUnited States sub nom. (\"Velez-Diaz II\"). Unhappily, the complaint\n\nwas filed on October 24, 2005, a few days after the expiration of\n\nthe six month deadline on October 19.   Plaintiffs had been advised\n\nof the six month deadline in the April 19, 2005, letter denying the\n\nadministrative complaint.   Indeed, the court complaint was dated\n\nOctober 19, 2005, although it was not filed until five days later.\n\n          On February 9, 2006, the district court granted the\n\ngovernment's motion to dismiss Velez-Diaz I without prejudice\n\nbecause it had been filed before exhaustion of administrative\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fremedies.1     A final judgment was entered the next day.         The\n\nplaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), and urged the court to consolidate the case\n\nwith Velez-Diaz II.     Finding that Velez-Diaz I had been properly\n\ndismissed, the district court said there was nothing left to\n\nconsolidate.     No appeal was filed from the dismissal or denial of\n\nreconsideration.\n\n             Thereafter, in August 2006, the district court granted\n\nthe government's motion to dismiss Velez-Diaz II on the ground that\n\nit had been filed after the six month filing deadline.     Plaintiffs\n\nhave now appealed from that decision. The facts are undisputed and\n\nour review on the motion to dismiss is de novo.      Skwira v. United\n\nStates, 344 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 903\n\n(2004).   Plaintiffs offer two arguments as to why Velez-Diaz II\n\nshould not have been dismissed.\n\n             The first argument is that the complaint in Velez-Diaz II\n\nfiled in October 2005 should be deemed a motion to amend the\n\nearlier complaint in Velez-Diaz I by adding the United States as a\n\nparty under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3).      The amendment (they say),\n\n\n\n     1\n      Of course, at the time that Velez-Diaz I was filed, it was\nagainst the agents and no exhaustion requirement applied; but the\ncertification, upheld on appeal, made the case one against the\nUnited States.    The FTCA provides that when such a conversion\noccurs and the case is dismissed for failure to exhaust, a\nplaintiff is given a fresh period of 60 days within which to file\nan administrative complaint even if the initial period for doing so\nhas lapsed. 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d)(5).\n\n                                  -4-\n\fcoming after the April 2005 exhaustion of remedies, resolved the\n\n\"jurisdictional\" defect of the premature filing of Velez-Diaz I.\n\nNor, they urge, is the amendment too late because Rule 15(c)(3)\n\namendments relate back to the original complaint's filing.\n\n          There are various problems with this argument.         The\n\ncomplaint in Velez-Diaz II did not purport to be an amendment to\n\nthe complaint in Velez-Diaz I.   Further,   Rule 15(c), by its terms,\n\napplies to amended pleadings in the same action as an original,\n\ntimely pleading: the pleading sought to be amended may not be a\n\npleading filed in a different case.         Carter v. Tex. Dep't of\n\nHealth, 119 Fed. Appx. 577, 581 (5th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 545\n\nU.S. 1146 (2005); Morgan Distrib. Co. v. Unidynamic Corp., 868 F.2d\n\n992, 994 (8th Cir. 1989).\n\n          In all events, Velez-Diaz I was dismissed and no appeal\n\nwas taken from the dismissal.    The requirement of a timely   appeal\n\nis jurisdictional.   Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459\n\nU.S. 56, 58-59 (1982).   Plaintiffs are in substance asking us to\n\nrevive Velez-Diaz I and to permit it to serve as the vehicle for\n\npursuing their claims against the United States.       Perhaps there\n\nwere arguments for such an approach, but we cannot undo the\n\ndismissal of a case where no timely appeal was taken.\n\n          To prevail on their present appeal, plaintiffs must show\n\nthat Velez-Diaz II itself was wrongly dismissed since that judgment\n\nalone is properly before us.     Their second argument, directed to\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthis end, is that because the exhaustion letter was mailed to them,\n\nthey had three extra days under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e) to file their\n\nclaim over and above the six month period provided in 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2401(b); and, because the sixty-third day, October 22, 2005, was a\n\nSaturday    they   had    until     Monday,     October   24,   to   file    their\n\ncomplaint.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).\n\n            The FTCA states that a \"tort claim against the United\n\nStates shall be forever barred . . . unless action is begun within\n\nsix months after the date of mailing . . . of notice of final\n\ndenial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.\"                  28\n\nU.S.C. § 2401(b).        The letter rejecting the claims itself warned\n\nthat the federal suit had to be filed \"in an appropriate United\n\nStates District Court not later than six months after the date of\n\nmailing of this notification of denial.             28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).\"\n\n            Rule   6(e),    known    as   the    \"mailbox   rule,\"    says   that\n\n\"[w]henever a party must or may act within a prescribed period\n\nafter service and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(B), (C), or\n\n(D), 3 days are added after the prescribed period would otherwise\n\nexpire.\"      The rule is directed to parties acting within the\n\nframework of an existing case and relates to acts done \"after\n\nservice.\"    Nothing in it qualifies or extends a limitations period\n\nthat refers, as the FTCA does, to the date of mailing of an\n\nexhaustion letter.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Other circuits have rejected the claim that Rule 6(e)\n\napplies to such exhaustion letters.2    Although we have not ruled\n\ndirectly on this issue, the result is preordained by Berman v.\n\nUnited States, 264 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2001), holding that Rule\n\n6(e) did not extend the deadline for filing a petition to quash an\n\nIRS summons.   Since compliance with the six month time limit under\n\nthe FTCA is a condition of the United States' waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity,    Hatchell v. United States, 776 F.2d 244, 246 (9th Cir.\n\n1985), failure to comply is a fatal defect.   Cf. Roman v. Townsend,\n\n224 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Velez' death while helping law enforcement agents is a\n\ntragedy, and one might prefer that his relatives had their day in\n\ncourt. This is so even though undercover work in the drug world is\n\ninherently high risk and winning a such a law suit would normally\n\nnot be easy.   But the filing requirements are clear; six months was\n\nample time to file; and that must be the end of the matter.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d 876, 880 (6th Cir. 1999);\nHatchell v. United States, 776 F.2d 244, 246 (9th Cir. 1985); Carr\nv.

P. 6(a).\n\n            The FTCA states that a \"tort claim against the United\n\nStates shall be forever barred . . . unless action is begun within\n\nsix months after the date of mailing . . . of notice of final\n\ndenial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.\"                  28\n\nU.S.C. § 2401(b).        The letter rejecting the claims itself warned\n\nthat the federal suit had to be filed \"in an appropriate United\n\nStates District Court not later than six months after the date of\n\nmailing of this notification of denial.             28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).\"\n\n            Rule   6(e),    known    as   the    \"mailbox   rule,\"    says   that\n\n\"[w]henever a party must or may act within a prescribed period\n\nafter service and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(B), (C), or\n\n(D), 3 days are added after the prescribed period would otherwise\n\nexpire.\"      The rule is directed to parties acting within the\n\nframework of an existing case and relates to acts done \"after\n\nservice.\"    Nothing in it qualifies or extends a limitations period\n\nthat refers, as the FTCA does, to the date of mailing of an\n\nexhaustion letter.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Other circuits have rejected the claim that Rule 6(e)\n\napplies to such exhaustion letters.2    Although we have not ruled\n\ndirectly on this issue, the result is preordained by Berman v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199618\"><a href=\"/opinion/199618/berman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 2001), holding that Rule\n\n6(e) did not extend the deadline for filing a petition to quash an\n\nIRS summons.

This is so even though undercover work in the drug world is\n\ninherently high risk and winning a such a law suit would normally\n\nnot be easy.   But the filing requirements are clear; six months was\n\nample time to file; and that must be the end of the matter.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Clay v.
