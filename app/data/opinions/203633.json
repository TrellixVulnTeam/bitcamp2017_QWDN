Allen and Peter Allen, P.C. on brief for petitioner.\n     Theodore C. Hirt, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nU.S. Department of Justice, Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, and Linda S. Wernery, Assistant Director, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                        January 16, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f           GARCÍA-GREGORY,        District       Judge.   Petitioner      Muhammad\n\nRashad (“Rashad”) submitted a petition for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture   and    Other   Cruel,    Inhuman       or   Degrading   Treatment       or\n\nPunishment      (“Convention   Against       Torture”).    Rashad       filed   his\n\npetition after he was ordered to appear before an immigration court\n\nbecause he had exceeded the time period to remain in the United\n\nStates as authorized by his non-immigrant visa. In his petition,\n\nRashad claimed that he would be arrested, jailed, tortured, and\n\npossibly killed if he were to return to his native Pakistan. The\n\nImmigration Judge (“IJ”) rejected Rashad’s petition since it was\n\nfiled past the one (1) year statutory period mandated by the\n\nImmigration     and   Nationality    Act     §    208(a)(2)(B),     8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1158(a)(2)(B) and because there were no changed or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances that would ban the application of the one (1) year\n\nstatute of limitations.1 Furthermore, the IJ held that Rashad did\n\nnot qualify for withholding of removal2 or protection under the\n\n\n     1\n       An alien must seek asylum within one year of entering the\nUnited States. 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (a)(2)(B). However, an alien’s\nfailure to timely file an asylum application may be excused if the\nalien shows “changed circumstances which materially affect the\napplicant’s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances\nrelating to the delay in filing an application.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158\n(a)(2)(D).\n     2\n       As a general rule, the withholding of the deportation of an\nalien is mandatory if he establishes that it is more likely than\nnot that he would be subject to persecution on account of race,\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\npolitical opinion, should he return to his homeland. INS v.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fConvention Against Torture. A timely appeal with the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (the “BIA”) followed. The appeal was dismissed.\n\nRashad challenges the IJ and BIA’s ruling declaring him ineligible\n\nfor asylum, the denial of his application for withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We\n\nlack jurisdiction over the asylum application and find that the\n\nremainder of Rashad’s allegations are unpersuasive. As such, we\n\nwill deny Rashad’s petition for review.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            The facts are drawn mainly from the IJ and the BIA’s\n\ndecisions and the exhibits referenced therein. Rashad is a sixty-\n\none (61) year old male, who is a native born citizen of Pakistan.\n\nRashad is also a married father of six (6) children, whose wife and\n\nchildren live in Pakistan. On or about August of 2000, Rashad\n\nobtained a non-immigrant visa from the United States Embassy in\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan. On or about November 11, 2000, Rashad secured\n\nadmission   to   the   United   States.   Rashad’s   non-immigrant   visa\n\nauthorized him to remain in the United States for a temporary\n\nperiod not to extend beyond February 11, 2001. Prior to leaving\n\nPakistan, Rashad was a card carrying member of the Nawaz faction of\n\nthe Pakistan Muslim League (“PML-N”), an organization he joined in\n\n2000. The PML-N was named after former Pakistani Prime Minister\n\n\n\n\nAguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419 (1999).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fNawaz Sharif, who was deposed in a bloodless coup by Pakistani army\n\nchief, General Pervez Musharraf on October 15, 1999.\n\n           On March 19, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security\n\nsent Rashad a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) in immigration court,\n\ncharging him as subject to removal because he had remained in the\n\nUnited States for a longer time period than permitted. Rashad\n\nresponded to the NTA and on April 7, 2004, more than three years\n\nafter his admission to the United States, Rashad filed a petition\n\nfor asylum alleging that he would be arrested, jailed, tortured,\n\nand possibly killed if he returned to Pakistan because he was an\n\nactive member of the PML-N. On July 11, 2006, after a hearing on\n\nthe merits, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Rashad’s asylum\n\nrequest. Specifically, the IJ denied Rashad’s asylum request as\n\nuntimely because he had failed to file his request within the one\n\n(1) year statutory deadline. Furthermore, the IJ determined that\n\nRashad   had    failed      to   submit    clear     and    convincing     evidence\n\nestablishing a legal entitlement to an exception from the one (1)\n\nyear   statutory      deadline     on   account    of     extraordinary    personal\n\ncircumstances in his life or changed human rights conditions in\n\nPakistan. Specifically, the IJ found that Rashad’s ignorance of the\n\nlaw was not an excuse. Furthermore, the IJ noted that Rashad had\n\nnot been under stress or trauma, nor had he suffered from any\n\nphysical or mental problems, from any mistreatment or harm suffered\n\nbefore   he    came    to    the   United       States.    As   to   the   “changed\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fconditions,” the IJ indicated that the PML-N continued to exist as\n\na significant political party in Pakistan.\n\n          The IJ also denied Rashad’s request for withholding of\n\nremoval and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The IJ\n\nfound that Rashad failed to establish that he would be persecuted\n\nand/or tortured if he were to return to Pakistan. Namely, the IJ\n\nstated that Rashad failed to demonstrate that he was a leader of\n\nthe PML-N or that he was of any significant interest to Pakistani\n\nauthorities. Furthermore, the IJ found that Rashad did not show\n\nthat he had to go into hiding in Pakistan or that he had any other\n\nsignificant problems because prior to traveling to the United\n\nStates, Rashad had been able to move freely throughout Pakistan\n\nstaying at various locations including his family home. The IJ\n\nfurther noted that his wife and children continued to reside in his\n\nfamily home. Accordingly, the IJ denied Rashad’s request for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention\n\nAgainst   Torture.\n\n          Rashad filed a timely appeal with the BIA. Like the IJ,\n\nthe BIA agreed that Rashad was not eligible for asylum on account\n\nof his failure to submit his application within one (1) year of his\n\narrival to the United States. Further, the BIA acknowledged the\n\nIJ’s decision that Rashad failed to establish a valid exception to\n\nthis requirement or prove that his asylum application was filed\n\nwithin a reasonable period under the circumstances. Moreover, the\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fBIA held that even if Rashad’s asylum application were timely filed\n\nand his testimony before the IJ deemed credible, his appeal would\n\nbe   denied    because   he   failed   to    sustain   the   burden   of   proof\n\napplicable to asylum petitions as well as the more stringent burden\n\napplicable to claims for withholding of removal or protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture. Specifically, the BIA held that the\n\nrecord did not show that he would be mistreated by the government\n\nof Pakistan on account of a protected ground. Additionally, the BIA\n\nconcluded that Rashad failed to proffer an adequate torture claim.\n\nThe BIA dismissed Rashad’s appeal, and the instant petition for\n\nreview followed.\n\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              When this Court has jurisdiction to review, we uphold\n\ndeterminations by the BIA or the IJ if “supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.” INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). This deferential standard is applied to\n\nfindings of fact including credibility determinations. Chhay v.\n\nMukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008). Likewise, the “substantial\n\nevidence” standard applies to claims for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Settenda\n\nv. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004). Under this standard,\n\n“[w]e will reverse only if the petitioner’s evidence would compel\n\na reasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted.”\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fId.; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)(“administrative findings of\n\nfact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary”).3\n\n          Usually, this Court confines its review to the BIA’s\n\norder that is being challenged by the petitioner. Sharari v.\n\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005). If the BIA has simply\n\nadopted or deferred to the IJ’s reasoning, the Court must look to\n\nthat decision instead, “treating the findings and conclusion of the\n\nIJ as the Board’s own opinion.” Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68,\n\n71 (1st Cir. 2003). However, when as here, the BIA adopts the\n\ndecision of the IJ, and provides some analysis of its own, the\n\nCourt reviews both decisions. Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n\n          Rashad asks us to review his application for asylum,\n\nrequest for withholding of removal, and petition for protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture. Furthermore, Rashad contests\n\nthe IJ’s credibility assessment. We begin with Rashad’s asylum\n\napplication.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Thus, a credibility determination will be sustained when the\nIJ has given reasoned consideration to the evidence and has\nprovided a cogent explanation for his finding. Chhay, 540 F.3d at\n5.\n\n                               -7-\n\f             1. Rashad’s Asylum Application\n\n             An application for asylum must be filed within one year\n\nof   the   alien’s   arrival    in    the    United   States,     absent   changed\n\ncircumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances     relating     to    the    delay   in   filing.    8   U.S.C.    §§\n\n1158(a)(2)(B); 1158(a)(2)(D).          Here, it is undisputed that Rashad\n\nresided in the United States for more than three years before\n\nfiling his asylum application. Accordingly, both the IJ and the BIA\n\ndetermined that Rashad’s petition was untimely. Furthermore, the IJ\n\nand the BIA concluded that there were no changed or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances that might have justified his untimely application.\n\n             Unless the alien identifies a legal or constitutional\n\ndefect in the decision, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the\n\nBIA’s determination that a petition for asylum was untimely or that\n\nthere were no changed or extraordinary circumstances that might\n\nhave justified considering the application. Hana v. Gonzales, 503\n\nF.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)).\n\nBoth   the   IJ   and   the   BIA    have    determined    that    there    are   no\n\nextraordinary        circumstances          justifying     Rashad’s        untimely\n\napplication for asylum. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe rejection of Rashad’s asylum application on this ground.\n\n             Nonetheless, Rashad claims that Congress violated his\n\nright to due process by precluding our review of determinations\n\nmade by the Attorney General in connection with the one (1) year\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\ffiling rules or request for exceptions. This Court, nonetheless,\n\nhas previously held that this jurisdictional bar does not represent\n\na due process violation. Hana, 503 F.3d at 44 (holding that the\n\njudicial review bar of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) does not represent a\n\ndue process violation). Rashad further argues that the agency\n\nviolated his due process rights because it failed to provide him\n\nwith a fair and efficient procedure for determining the validity of\n\nhis persecution claim and failed to fully evaluate his exceptions\n\nto the one (1) year statute of limitation for filing asylum\n\npetitions. However, Rashad’s argument is meritless as it is not a\n\ncolorable constitutional claim.4 See Lutaaya v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d\n\n63, 69 (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that petitioner’s argument that the\n\nIJ violated her due process rights because the IJ did not consider\n\nher testimony and failed to allow her to “fully explain” her\n\nreasons   to   meet   the   one   year   deadline   was   not   a   colorable\n\nconstitutional claim that would allow this court to exercise\n\njudicial review over the untimely asylum application); Jamal v.\n\nMukasey, 531 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2008) (rejecting as frivolous\n\npetitioner’s argument that the failure of the IJ to make an\n\nindividualized analysis to determine whether there was sufficient\n\nevidence to qualify him for an exception from the one (1) year\n\n\n\n     4\n       “The underlying constitutional or legal question must be\ncolorable; that is, the argument advanced must, at the very least,\nhave some potential validity.” Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fasylum ban was a violation of due process). Rashad’s allegation\n\nthat   the    IJ    and   the    BIA   failed     to    “fully    evaluate”     his\n\nqualification for the exception to the one (1) year filing deadline\n\nis another way of saying that the agency got the facts wrong, which\n\nis simply a factual claim masqueraded as a legal challenge that\n\ncertainly cannot defeat the operation of the jurisdiction-stripping\n\nprovision. See Pan, 489 F.3d at 85. Hence, this Court lacks\n\njurisdiction to review Rashad’s asylum petition.\n\n             2.    Withholding   of    Removal    and   Protection      under   the\n\nConvention Against Torture\n\n             Although we lack jurisdiction to consider Rashad’s asylum\n\npetition, we can consider his request for withholding of removal\n\nand protection under the Convention Against Torture. See Saad v.\n\nKeisler, No. 06-2347, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 24493, at *8 (1st Cir.\n\nOct. 19, 2007). In order to qualify for withholding of removal, a\n\npetitioner must either demonstrate past persecution, which gives\n\nrise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or must\n\nshow that more likely than not he would face persecution on account\n\nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion should he return to his homeland.\n\nAguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. at 419; Limani v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 25,\n\n31 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)).\n\nBasically,    “[w]ithholding      of    removal    requires      that   the   alien\n\nestablish a clear probability of persecution, rather than merely a\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwell-founded fear of persecution.” Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 2005). “To qualify as persecution, a person’s experience\n\nmust    rise       above   unpleasantness,        harassment,      and       even   basic\n\nsuffering.” Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n              Unlike       withholdings      of      removal,     relief under the\n\nConvention Against Torture does not require the petitioner to prove\n\nthe reason for torture. Romilus, 385 F.3d at 8. Instead, the\n\npetitioner must prove that more likely than not he will be tortured\n\nif he is returned to his homeland. Id. “To establish a prima facie\n\nclaim under the [Convention Against Torture], an applicant must\n\noffer specific objective evidence showing that he will be subject\n\nto:    ‘(1)    an    act   causing   severe       physical   or    mental       pain   or\n\nsuffering;         (2)   intentionally    inflicted;      (3)     for    a    proscribed\n\npurpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical\n\ncontrol of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.’”\n\nId. (internal citations omitted).\n\n              Rashad avers that he qualifies for withholding of removal\n\nand/or protection under the Convention Against Torture because if\n\nhe    were    to    return   to   Pakistan      he   would   be    tortured         and/or\n\npersecuted because of his political affiliations. Rashad brings to\n\nthis Court’s attention that even though he was not an official of\n\nthe PML-N, he helped organize political rallies. According to\n\nRashad, on October 2000, he spoke at a political rally. Thereafter,\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthe police, which were loyal to General Pervez Musharraf, searched\n\nfor him and forced him into hiding.5 Rashad fears that if he\n\nreturns to Pakistan he could be tortured and/or persecuted by\n\nsecurity forces. However, the IJ and the BIA held that Rashad did\n\nnot qualify for withholding of removal and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture.\n\n            Our deferential standard of review does not permit us to\n\nsecond-guess the determinations of the IJ or the BIA, if they are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record. Khan v. Mukasey,\n\n549 F.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir. 2008). “The substantial evidence\n\nstandard demands that we uphold the agency’s determination unless\n\nthe evidence points unerringly in the opposite direction.” Id.\n\n(internal   quotation   marks   and   citations   omitted).   Here,   the\n\nevidence does not compel us to reject the agency’s conclusion. See\n\nid.\n\n            The evidence in the record does not show that Rashad\n\nexperienced past torture, persecution, or that it was “more likely\n\nthan not” that he would be persecuted on one of the above specified\n\ngrounds if he returned to Pakistan. This conclusion is supported by\n\nthe fact that before coming to the United States, Rashad traveled\n\n\n      5\n       In reaching her conclusion that Rashad did not travel to the\nUnited States for safety reasons, the IJ noted that Rashad had made\nplans to come to the United States prior to the October 2000 rally,\nbefore he allegedly had any knowledge that Pakistani authorities\n“were looking for him and wanted to arrest him or anything else.”\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\ffreely around Pakistan, stayed at his family’s home, and was able\n\nto leave Pakistan in November of 2000 using his passport without\n\nany interference by Pakistani officials. Furthermore, Rashad’s\n\nfamily continues to live peacefully in Pakistan. See Aguilar-Solis\n\nv. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding that “the fact\n\nthat close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien’s\n\nhomeland undercuts the alien’s claim that persecution awaits his\n\nreturn”). As such, this Court finds that the evidence and testimony\n\noffered by Rashad is insufficient to compel a reasonable factfinder\n\nto conclude that more likely than not he would be tortured or\n\npersecuted if he were to return to Pakistan.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\nDENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Rashad filed his petition after he was ordered to appear before an immigration court because he had exceeded the time period to remain in the United States as authorized by his non-immigrant visa. In his petition, Rashad claimed that he would be arrested, jailed, tortured, and possibly killed if he were to return to his native Pakistan. The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") rejected Rashad's petition since it was filed past the one (1) year statutory period mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act § 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) and because there were no changed or extraordinary circumstances that would ban the application of the one (1) year statute of limitations.<sup>[1]</sup> Furthermore, the IJ held that Rashad did not qualify for withholding of removal<sup>[2]</sup> or protection under the Convention Against Torture. A timely appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"BIA\") followed. The appeal was dismissed. Rashad challenges the IJ and BIA's ruling declaring him ineligible for asylum, the denial of his application for withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We lack jurisdiction over the asylum application and find that the remainder of Rashad's allegations are unpersuasive. As such, we will deny Rashad's petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts are drawn mainly from the IJ and the BIA's decisions and the exhibits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> referenced therein. Rashad is a sixty-one (61) year old male, who is a native born citizen of Pakistan. Rashad is also a married father of six (6) children, whose wife and children live in Pakistan. On or about August of 2000, Rashad obtained a non-immigrant visa from the United States Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan. On or about November 11, 2000, Rashad secured admission to the United States. Rashad's non-immigrant visa authorized him to remain in the United States for a temporary period not to extend beyond February 11, 2001. Prior to leaving Pakistan, Rashad was a card carrying member of the Nawaz faction of the Pakistan Muslim League (\"PML-N\"), an organization he joined in 2000. The PML-N was named after former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was deposed in a bloodless coup by Pakistani army chief, General Pervez Musharraf on October 15, 1999.</p>\n<p>On March 19, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security sent Rashad a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") in immigration court, charging him as subject to removal because he had remained in the United States for a longer time period than permitted. Rashad responded to the NTA and on April 7, 2004, more than three years after his admission to the United States, Rashad filed a petition for asylum alleging that he would be arrested, jailed, tortured, and possibly killed if he returned to Pakistan because he was an active member of the PML-N. On July 11, 2006, after a hearing on the merits, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Rashad's asylum request. Specifically, the IJ denied Rashad's asylum request as untimely because he had failed to file his request within the one (1) year statutory deadline. Furthermore, the IJ determined that Rashad had failed to submit clear and convincing evidence establishing a legal entitlement to an exception from the one (1) year statutory deadline on account of extraordinary personal circumstances in his life or changed human rights conditions in Pakistan. Specifically, the IJ found that Rashad's ignorance of the law was not an excuse. Furthermore, the IJ noted that Rashad had not been under stress or trauma, nor had he suffered from any physical or mental problems, from any mistreatment or harm suffered before he came to the United States. As to the \"changed conditions,\" the IJ indicated that the PML-N continued to exist as a significant political party in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>The IJ also denied Rashad's request for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The IJ found that Rashad failed to establish that he would be persecuted and/or tortured if he were to return to Pakistan. Namely, the IJ stated that Rashad failed to demonstrate that he was a leader of the PML-N or that he was of any significant interest to Pakistani authorities. Furthermore, the IJ found that Rashad did not show that he had to go into hiding in Pakistan or that he had any other significant problems because prior to traveling to the United States, Rashad had been able to move freely throughout Pakistan staying at various locations including his family home. The IJ further noted that his wife and children continued to reside in his family home. Accordingly, the IJ denied Rashad's request for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p>Rashad filed a timely appeal with the BIA. Like the IJ, the BIA agreed that Rashad was not eligible for asylum on account of his failure to submit his application within one (1) year of his arrival to the United States. Further, the BIA acknowledged the IJ's decision that Rashad failed to establish a valid exception to this requirement or prove that his asylum application was filed within a reasonable period <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> under the circumstances. Moreover, the BIA held that even if Rashad's asylum application were timely filed and his testimony before the IJ deemed credible, his appeal would be denied because he failed to sustain the burden of proof applicable to asylum petitions as well as the more stringent burden applicable to claims for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Specifically, the BIA held that the record did not show that he would be mistreated by the government of Pakistan on account of a protected ground. Additionally, the BIA concluded that Rashad failed to proffer an adequate torture claim. The BIA dismissed Rashad's appeal, and the instant petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>When this Court has jurisdiction to review, we uphold determinations by the BIA or the IJ if \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). This deferential standard is applied to findings of fact including credibility determinations. <i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2008). Likewise, the \"substantial evidence\" standard applies to claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. <i>Settenda v. Ashcroft,</i> 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.2004). Under this standard, \"[w]e will reverse only if the petitioner's evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)(\"administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\").<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Usually, this Court confines its review to the BIA's order that is being challenged by the petitioner. <i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.2005). If the BIA has simply adopted or deferred to the IJ's reasoning, the Court must look to that decision instead, \"treating the findings and conclusion of the IJ as the Board's own opinion.\" <i>Herbert v. Ashcroft,</i> 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.2003). However, when as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, and provides some analysis of its own, the Court reviews both decisions. <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Rashad asks us to review his application for asylum, request for withholding of removal, and petition for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Furthermore, Rashad contests the IJ's credibility assessment. We begin with Rashad's asylum application.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Rashad's Asylum Application</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An application for asylum must be filed within one year of the alien's arrival in the United States, absent changed circumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(2)(B); 1158(a)(2)(D). Here, it is undisputed that Rashad resided in the United States for more than three years before filing his asylum application. Accordingly, both the IJ and the BIA determined that Rashad's petition was untimely. Furthermore, the IJ and the BIA concluded that there were no changed or extraordinary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> circumstances that might have justified his untimely application.</p>\n<p>Unless the alien identifies a legal or constitutional defect in the decision, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's determination that a petition for asylum was untimely or that there were no changed or extraordinary circumstances that might have justified considering the application. <i>Hana v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)). Both the IJ and the BIA have determined that there are no extraordinary circumstances justifying Rashad's untimely application for asylum. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the rejection of Rashad's asylum application on this ground.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Rashad claims that Congress violated his right to due process by precluding our review of determinations made by the Attorney General in connection with the one (1) year filing rules or request for exceptions. This Court, nonetheless, has previously held that this jurisdictional bar does not represent a due process violation. <i>Hana,</i> 503 F.3d at 44 (holding that the judicial review bar of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) does not represent a due process violation). Rashad further argues that the agency violated his due process rights because it failed to provide him with a fair and efficient procedure for determining the validity of his persecution claim and failed to fully evaluate his exceptions to the one (1) year statute of limitation for filing asylum petitions. However, Rashad's argument is meritless as it is not a colorable constitutional claim.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Lutaaya v. Mukasey,</i> 535 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir.2008) (holding that petitioner's argument that the IJ violated her due process rights because the IJ did not consider her testimony and failed to allow her to \"fully explain\" her reasons to meet the one year deadline was not a colorable constitutional claim that would allow this court to exercise judicial review over the untimely asylum application); <i>Jamal v. Mukasey,</i> 531 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2008) (rejecting as frivolous petitioner's argument that the failure of the IJ to make an individualized analysis to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to qualify him for an exception from the one (1) year asylum ban was a violation of due process). Rashad's allegation that the IJ and the BIA failed to \"fully evaluate\" his qualification for the exception to the one (1) year filing deadline is another way of saying that the agency got the facts wrong, which is simply a factual claim masqueraded as a legal challenge that certainly cannot defeat the operation of the jurisdiction-stripping provision. <i>See </i><i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 85. Hence, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Rashad's asylum petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Withholding of Removal and Protection under the Convention Against Torture</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although we lack jurisdiction to consider Rashad's asylum petition, we can consider his request for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. <i>See Saad v. Keisler,</i> 251 Fed.Appx. 1, 3 (1st Cir.2007). In order to qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must either demonstrate past persecution, which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or must show that more likely than not he would face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> should he return to his homeland. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439; <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> 538 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.2008) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)). Basically, \"[w]ithholding of removal requires that the alien establish a clear probability of persecution, rather than merely a well-founded fear of persecution.\" <i>Ang v. Gonzales,</i> 430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.2005). \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Unlike withholdings of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture does not require the petitioner to prove the reason for torture. <i>Romilus,</i> 385 F.3d at 8. Instead, the petitioner must prove that more likely than not he will be tortured if he is returned to his homeland. <i>Id.</i> \"To establish a <i>prima facie</i> claim under the [Convention Against Torture], an applicant must offer specific objective evidence showing that he will be subject to: `(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.'\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Rashad avers that he qualifies for withholding of removal and/or protection under the Convention Against Torture because if he were to return to Pakistan he would be tortured and/or persecuted because of his political affiliations. Rashad brings to this Court's attention that even though he was not an official of the PML-N, he helped organize political rallies. According to Rashad, on October 2000, he spoke at a political rally. Thereafter, the police, which were loyal to General Pervez Musharraf, searched for him and forced him into hiding.<sup>[5]</sup> Rashad fears that if he returns to Pakistan he could be tortured and/or persecuted by security forces. However, the IJ and the BIA held that Rashad did not qualify for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p>Our deferential standard of review does not permit us to second-guess the determinations of the IJ or the BIA, if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <i>Khan v. Mukasey,</i> 549 F.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir.2008). \"The substantial evidence standard demands that we uphold the agency's determination unless the evidence points unerringly in the opposite direction.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the evidence does not compel us to reject the agency's conclusion. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The evidence in the record does not show that Rashad experienced past torture, persecution, or that it was \"more likely than not\" that he would be persecuted on one of the above specified grounds if he returned to Pakistan. This conclusion is supported by the fact that before coming to the United States, Rashad traveled freely around Pakistan, stayed at his family's home, and was able to leave Pakistan in November of 2000 using his passport without any interference by Pakistani officials. Furthermore, Rashad's family continues to live peacefully in Pakistan. See <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding that \"the fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return\"). As such, this Court finds that the evidence and testimony offered by Rashad is insufficient to compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that more likely than not he would be tortured or persecuted if he were to return to Pakistan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  An alien must seek asylum within one year of entering the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). However, an alien's failure to timely file an asylum application may be excused if the alien shows \"changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p>[2]  As a general rule, the withholding of the deportation of an alien is mandatory if he establishes that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, should he return to his homeland. <i>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999).</p>\n<p>[3]  Thus, a credibility determination will be sustained when the IJ has given reasoned consideration to the evidence and has provided a cogent explanation for his finding. <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"The underlying constitutional or legal question must be colorable; that is, the argument advanced must, at the very least, have some potential validity.\" <i>Pan</i> v. <i>Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[5]  In reaching her conclusion that Rashad did not travel to the United States for safety reasons, the IJ noted that Rashad had made plans to come to the United States prior to the October 2000 rally, before he allegedly had any knowledge that Pakistani authorities \"were looking for him and wanted to arrest him or anything else.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

Rashad filed his petition after he was ordered to appear before an immigration court because he had exceeded the time period to remain in the United States as authorized by his non-immigrant visa. In his petition, Rashad claimed that he would be arrested, jailed, tortured, and possibly killed if he were to return to his native Pakistan. The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") rejected Rashad's petition since it was filed past the one (1) year statutory period mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act § 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) and because there were no changed or extraordinary circumstances that would ban the application of the one (1) year statute of limitations.<sup>[1]</sup> Furthermore, the IJ held that Rashad did not qualify for withholding of removal<sup>[2]</sup> or protection under the Convention Against Torture. A timely appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"BIA\") followed. The appeal was dismissed. Rashad challenges the IJ and BIA's ruling declaring him ineligible for asylum, the denial of his application for withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We lack jurisdiction over the asylum application and find that the remainder of Rashad's allegations are unpersuasive.

Rashad's allegation that the IJ and the BIA failed to \"fully evaluate\" his qualification for the exception to the one (1) year filing deadline is another way of saying that the agency got the facts wrong, which is simply a factual claim masqueraded as a legal challenge that certainly cannot defeat the operation of the jurisdiction-stripping provision. <i>See </i><i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 85. Hence, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Rashad's asylum petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Withholding of Removal and Protection under the Convention Against Torture</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Although we lack jurisdiction to consider Rashad's asylum petition, we can consider his request for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. <i>See Saad v. Keisler,</i> 251 Fed.Appx. 1, 3 (1st Cir.2007). In order to qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must either demonstrate past persecution, which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or must show that more likely than not he would face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> should he return to his homeland. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 419, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1439</span></a></span>; <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203442\"><a href=\"/opinion/203442/limani-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2008) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)). Basically, \"[w]ithholding of removal requires that the alien establish a clear probability of persecution, rather than merely a well-founded fear of persecution.\" <i>Ang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201939\"><a href=\"/opinion/201939/ang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2005). \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Unlike withholdings of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture does not require the petitioner to prove the reason for torture. <i>Romilus,</i> 385 F.3d at 8. Instead, the petitioner must prove that more likely than not he will be tortured if he is returned to his homeland. <i>Id.</i> \"To establish a <i>prima facie</i> claim under the [Convention Against Torture], an applicant must offer specific objective evidence showing that he will be subject to: `(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.'\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Rashad avers that he qualifies for withholding of removal and/or protection under the Convention Against Torture because if he were to return to Pakistan he would be tortured and/or persecuted because of his political affiliations. Rashad brings to this Court's attention that even though he was not an official of the PML-N, he helped organize political rallies. According to Rashad, on October 2000, he spoke at a political rally. Thereafter, the police, which were loyal to General Pervez Musharraf, searched for him and forced him into hiding.<sup>[5]</sup> Rashad fears that if he returns to Pakistan he could be tortured and/or persecuted by security forces. However, the IJ and the BIA held that Rashad did not qualify for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p>Our deferential standard of review does not permit us to second-guess the determinations of the IJ or the BIA, if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <i>Khan v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203580\"><a href=\"/opinion/203580/khan-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 576 (1st Cir.2008). \"The substantial evidence standard demands that we uphold the agency's determination unless the evidence points unerringly in the opposite direction.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the evidence does not compel us to reject the agency's conclusion. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The evidence in the record does not show that Rashad experienced past torture, persecution, or that it was \"more likely than not\" that he would be persecuted on one of the above specified grounds if he returned to Pakistan. This conclusion is supported by the fact that before coming to the United States, Rashad traveled freely around Pakistan, stayed at his family's home, and was able to leave Pakistan in November of 2000 using his passport without any interference by Pakistani officials. Furthermore, Rashad's family continues to live peacefully in Pakistan. See <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding that \"the fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return\"). As such, this Court finds that the evidence and testimony offered by Rashad is insufficient to compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that more likely than not he would be tortured or persecuted if he were to return to Pakistan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  An alien must seek asylum within one year of entering the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). However, an alien's failure to timely file an asylum application may be excused if the alien shows \"changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p>[2]  As a general rule, the withholding of the deportation of an alien is mandatory if he establishes that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, should he return to his homeland. <i>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 419, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (1999).</p>\n<p>[3]  Thus, a credibility determination will be sustained when the IJ has given reasoned consideration to the evidence and has provided a cogent explanation for his finding. <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 5.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"The underlying constitutional or legal question must be colorable; that is, the argument advanced must, at the very least, have some potential validity.\" <i>Pan</i> v. <i>Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[5]  In reaching her conclusion that Rashad did not travel to the United States for safety reasons, the IJ noted that Rashad had made plans to come to the United States prior to the October 2000 rally, before he allegedly had any knowledge that Pakistani authorities \"were looking for him and wanted to arrest him or anything else.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
