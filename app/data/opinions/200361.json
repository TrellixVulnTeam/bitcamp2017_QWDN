St. Clair, with whom Charles K. Bergin, Jr. was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n     John W. McConnell, with whom Wachtel & Masyr, LLP was on brief\nfor appellant.\n\n\n\n                        February 28, 2003\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            Leon Schara sued his former\n\nemployer, Commercial Envelope, in federal court for bonuses not\n\npaid to him during his three years' employment there.                 Schara\n\nalleged that his original employment contract had provided for a\n\none percent    bonus    on   non-house    accounts   only,   and   that   this\n\nagreement was subsequently revised, following Commercial's failure\n\nto obtain life insurance for him, to a bonus on all accounts.\n\nCommercial responded that neither the original agreement nor the\n\nrevised agreement had ever been signed by Commercial, and so no\n\nagreement existed.     Commercial   requested that the judge deliver a\n\njury instruction on the Statute of Frauds; the judge refused,\n\nsaying he had ruled the Statute inapplicable but he did not give\n\nhis reasons for that conclusion.            The jury found for Schara,\n\nawarding him damages of over $220,000, equivalent to a bonus on all\n\nof the accounts.       Commercial now appeals the judge's refusal to\n\nsubmit the issue to the jury, and to deliver a jury instruction on\n\nthe Statute.   We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          In 1995, Leon Schara was 58 years old and had undergone\n\nquintuple heart bypass surgery. He had worked at Westvaco Company,\n\nan envelope manufacturing company, for 23 years and was their\n\nnational sales manager for national and wholesale accounts.                 In\n\nMarch of that year, Ira Kristel, Chairman of Commercial Envelope,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fanother envelope manufacturer, approached Schara about taking a job\n\nas National Sales Director.\n\n           Schara was interested, but told Ira Kristel that he had\n\n\"had a couple of heart attacks, . . . five bypasses, and . . . two\n\nstents put in.\"    As a result, he wanted a half million dollar life\n\ninsurance policy \"because I don't expect to outlive my wife.\"                      (At\n\nWestvaco, he had a life insurance policy of around $330,000.)\n\nDuring the course of negotiations, according to Schara, Ira Kristel\n\npersonally    assured     him    that    Commercial       would    get     him    life\n\ninsurance.    Ira Kristel also promised him a bonus of one percent of\n\nthe increase in sales, excluding \"house\" accounts -- a specified\n\nlist of sales accounts which predated Schara's arrival.                     He also\n\nassured Schara's wife that Schara would receive life insurance.\n\n             On June 23, 1995, Commercial's external counsel, Steve\n\nCohen,   forwarded   an    employment         agreement    to     Schara    for   his\n\nsignature.     Cohen did so at Steven Kristel's instruction, after\n\nSteven Kristel had reviewed the contract.             Steven Kristel is Ira's\n\nson and Vice President of Commercial.             In his cover letter, Cohen\n\ndescribed the agreement as \"final\" and asked Schara to \"return both\n\ncontracts signed by yourself to Ira Kristel.\"                      That agreement\n\ncalled for Commercial to take out life insurance for Schara in the\n\namount of $500,000.       It also provided for a one percent bonus on\n\nall   business,   above    the    base    level    set     in     1995,    excluding\n\ndesignated house accounts.        One provision of the contract provided\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffor a severance payment in the event that more than half of\n\nCommercial was sold and Commercial was unable to perform as a\n\nresult.    This pay-out would take place over a two-year period.\n\n            The cover letter said that the list of house accounts\n\nwould be provided to Schara directly by Commercial.       The appendix\n\nlisting house accounts was blank, however, according to Schara.\n\nHe said he asked Ira Kristel about the blank page, and was told\n\n\"Sign it.     It's in your favor.\"      Schara signed the contract and\n\nreturned it to Ira Kristel; he never received a copy signed by Ira\n\nKristel.    Schara testified that when he called Ira Kristel to ask\n\nabout the contract, he was assured that Kristel had signed the\n\nagreement.    Subsequently, Schara received a six-page list of house\n\naccounts, some time after he began work for Commercial in July\n\n1995.\n\n             Because of Schara's medical history, however, Commercial\n\ncould not obtain life insurance for him.          This was apparently\n\ndiscovered after Schara started work for Commercial, although there\n\nis some dispute as to the exact timing.       Schara testified that he\n\nmet with Steven Kristel and attorney Wachtel, another lawyer for\n\nthe Kristels.    They agreed that, in lieu of life insurance, Schara\n\nwould receive a bonus based on all of Commercial's accounts,\n\nincluding house accounts.\n\n             On November 29, 1995 attorney Cohen faxed a revised\n\nemployment contract to Schara for his signature.      The cover letter\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fstated, \"At the request of Steven Kristel, I have revised your\n\nemployment agreement by deleting Section (d) to Appendix B.\"\n\nSection (d) referred to the $500,000 life insurance provision.\n\nSchara signed the contract and returned it to Commercial; he never\n\nreceived a copy signed by either Kristel.\n\n          Schara also testified that he spoke with Steven Kristel\n\non April 5, 1996.    He produced notes in his handwriting from that\n\nconversation, reading \"4/15/96, revision per Steven Kristel. He'll\n\nsend me a copy of the revised contract to include these changes, no\n\nhouse accounts in exchange for five hundred thousand dollar life\n\ninsurance policy.\"\n\n          During    the   three   years   Schara   worked   at   Commercial\n\nEnvelope its sales grew by approximately $11 million dollars, from\n\n$36 million dollars to $47 million dollars.             Throughout this\n\nperiod, Schara received his full salary, health insurance, use of\n\na company car, and paid membership in a country club, as he was\n\nentitled under both written and oral assurances from Commercial.\n\nThe bonus is the only disputed aspect of his compensation.          Schara\n\ndid not make a written demand for his bonuses at any time.          Schara\n\ntestified that he had made oral demands, but that they were ignored\n\nby the Kristels.    He said he was afraid to press his claims while\n\nhe was still employed at Commercial for fear that they would lead\n\nto litigation and retaliatory firing.         Schara was terminated in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f1998, and subsequently brought suit for his unpaid bonuses for all\n\nthree years of employment.\n\n            A jury trial was held in May 2002.       At trial, Ira Kristel\n\ncontended that there was no agreement, that he had never signed\n\nanything.   During cross-examination, Ira Kristel acknowledged that\n\nthere was probably \"something owed Mr. Schara\" for unpaid bonuses.\n\nThe   district   court    denied    Commercial's    repeated     motions   for\n\njudgment as a matter of law and a directed verdict on the basis of\n\nthe   Statute    of   Frauds.      It    also   refused    to   deliver    jury\n\ninstructions on the Statute of Frauds, ruling from the bench that\n\nthe Statute did not apply.         The jury found in Schara's favor, and\n\nawarded him $223,135.39 in damages for the breach, an amount equal\n\nto a one-percent bonus on all of Commercial's sales, including\n\nhouse accounts.       With interest calculated by the judge, the total\n\njudgment was for $311,178,73.           Commercial then filed this appeal,\n\nprotesting the judge's failure to give jury instructions based on\n\nthe Statute of Frauds.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            Our standard of review for refusal to give a requested\n\njury instruction is de novo.        See Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289\n\nF.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            The Statute of Frauds was originally promulgated in the\n\nseventeenth century to protect against the dangers of perjury and\n\nuncertain memory inherent in oral testimony.              \"Thus, the purpose\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\funderlying the statute of frauds is to prevent frauds by assertion\n\nof claims not evidenced by a written agreement or by a note or\n\nmemorandum containing essential terms of the contract between the\n\nparties.\"     61 N.Y. Jurisprudence 2d, Statute of Frauds, §4, at 21\n\n(1987) (footnote omitted).           This dispute is governed by New York\n\nlaw.    The Statute of Frauds, codified in New York, reads in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n            Every agreement, promise or undertaking is void, unless\n            it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and\n            subscribed by the party to be charged . . . if such\n            agreement, promise or undertaking ... [b]y its terms is\n            not to be performed within one year from the making\n            thereof . . . .\n\nN.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law § 5-701(a) (Consol. 2002).\n\n             Over the past century, there has been a general trend to\n\ncut back on the reach of the Statute.                See 2 E.A. Farnsworth,\n\nFarnsworth on Contracts § 6.1, at 98 (2d ed. 1998).               The Statute\n\nof Frauds has been largely abolished in England since 1954.            Id. at\n\n95.    In the United States, it has been \"the subject of constant\n\nerosion. Courts have long been receptive to pleas that the statute\n\nshould be narrowly interpreted so as not to cover the contract in\n\nquestion.\"     Id. at 98-99.\n\n            This erosion has happened on a number of fronts; one is\n\npertinent here.     New York has consistently chosen to construe the\n\none-year provision of the Statute -- the requirement that contracts\n\nnot performable within a year fall within the Statute -- narrowly.\n\n\"Wherever    an   agreement    has    been   found   to   be   susceptible   of\n\n                                       -7-\n\ffulfillment within that time, in whatever manner and however\n\nimpractical, this court has held the one-year provision of the\n\nStatute    to   be    inapplicable,     a    writing     unnecessary,    and   the\n\nagreement not barred.\"          D&N Boening, Inc. v. Kirsch Beverages,\n\nInc., 63 N.Y.2d 449, 455 (1984).               This is usually a matter of\n\ninterpretation of the contract language by the court, and often\n\nresolved on a motion to dismiss.               Id.; Cron v. Hargro Fabrics,\n\nInc., 91 N.Y.2d 362, 370 (1998).            In any event, there are no issues\n\nof fact on this point.\n\n            New      York   courts   have    found   a   range   of   termination\n\nprovisions sufficient to keep agreements out of the reach of the\n\nStatute.    See, e.g., Coinmach Inds. Corp. v. Domnitch, 37 N.Y.2d\n\n889, 891 (1975) (where defendant had the option of selling at any\n\ntime the property on lease to the plaintiff); N. Shore Bottling Co.\n\nv. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., 22 N.Y.2d 171, 176-77 (1968) (where\n\ndefendant had the option to discontinue at any time the activities\n\nupon which the agreement was based); Nat Nal Serv. Stations, Inc.\n\nv. Wolf, 304 N.Y. 332, 340 (1952) (where agreement merely set the\n\nterms of anticipated prospective purchases); Blake v. Voigt, 134\n\nN.Y. 69, 71 (1892) (where either party had the option to terminate\n\nwithin seven months).\n\n            Here, the policy concerns which underlie the application\n\nof the Statute are not at issue.              This is not a situation where\n\nSchara's claims are based solely on oral testimony, unsupported by\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwritings, and subject to the vagaries of memory.                   Instead, he\n\nrelies on writings drafted and presented by Commercial.              Moreover,\n\nthe facts surrounding the presentation of those writings -- where\n\neach writing was presented by Commercial's attorney, labelled first\n\na \"final\" agreement and then a \"revision\" to a final agreement,\n\nwhere Schara followed instructions to sign each and return it, and\n\nwhere Commercial neither signed nor indicated to Schara that it had\n\nnot   signed   --   do   not    incline   us   to   invoke   the   Statute   on\n\nCommercial's behalf.           Consequently, we interpret the one-year\n\nprovision narrowly, avoiding use of the Statute to \"afford persons\n\na means of evading just obligations.\"               Morris Cohon & Co. v.\n\nRussell, 23 N.Y.2d 569, 574 (1969).\n\n           The contract provided for payment of salary and a bonus\n\nto Schara in the event the company was sold:\n\n           11. Sale of Business. If at any time during the term\n           hereof more than 50% of the assets or stock of the\n           Company is sold, and if as a result thereof, the Company\n           is unable to perform its obligations hereunder, the\n           Employee shall be entitled to receive the compensation to\n           which he was otherwise entitled hereunder, in addition to\n           severance in an amount equal to 300% of the Bonus, if\n           any, he received for the previous Contract Year. If such\n           sale is consummated during the first Contract Year\n           hereunder, the severance hereunder shall be $500,000.\n           The severance hereunder shall be paid over a period of 24\n           months in 48 semi-monthly installments.\n\nThis provision removes the contract from the ambit of the Statute.\n\n           A mere breach of contract within a year would not suffice\n\nto remove a contract from the Statute under New York law.               As all\n\ncontracts could be in breach, allowing breaches within a year to\n\n                                     -9-\n\fremove an agreement from the Statute would potentially vitiate it.\n\nSee Ohanian v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc., 779 F.2d 101, 107-08 (2d\n\nCir.   1985).     But   the   contract   provision   here   envisions   a\n\ntermination, not a breach.     Likewise, if the termination provision\n\nis not set forth explicitly in the contract, the Statute of Frauds\n\nwill apply.     See Paper Corp. v. Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc.,\n\n742 F. Supp. 808, 810 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); City of Yonkers v. Otis\n\nElevator Co., 649 F. Supp. 716, 727 n.15 (S.D.N.Y. 1986).            Here,\n\nhowever, the termination provision is express.\n\n           New York law does not allow termination provisions solely\n\nwithin the control of the plaintiff to remove an agreement from the\n\nscope of the one-year provision.         But the case at hand does not\n\ninvolve an oral agreement terminable within a year only by the\n\nparty that seeks to enforce the agreement; instead it is an\n\nagreement where the right to terminate within a year is in the\n\nhands of the defendant.       New York courts have long found such\n\nagreements to be outside of the Statute of Frauds.        See Huebener v.\n\nKenyon & Eckhardt, Inc., 534 N.Y.S.2d 952, 955 (N.Y. App. Div.\n\n1988).\n\n           Commercial   argues   that    the   two-year   pay-out   period\n\nenvisioned by paragraph 11 suffices to place this contract within\n\nthe Statute.    We disagree. Because \"the terms of the contract here\n\n... included an event which might end the contractual relationship\n\nof the parties within a year, defendant's possible liability beyond\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthat time [does] not bring the contract within the statute.\" Cron,\n\n91 N.Y.2d at 370 (quoting Martocci v. Greater N.Y. Brewery, Inc.,\n\n301 N.Y. 57, 62 (1950)).\n\n             As to the two-year pay-out, Commercial stresses the\n\nimportance of the test of the \"endurance of defendant's liability.\"\n\nThe language of \"enduring liability,\" however, derives from cases\n\nin which contractual rights persist other than mere pay-out of a\n\npre-determined severance amount.       See, e.g., Martocci, 301 N.Y. at\n\n62-63 (ongoing obligation to pay commission based on plaintiff's\n\nintroduction of defendant to customer); Cohen v. Bartgis Bros. Co.,\n\n289   N.Y.   846,   846-47   (1943)   (obligation   to   pay    commissions\n\noutlasting plaintiff's employment with defendant).             The doctrine\n\ndoes not limit Cron's holding.\n\n             Schara advances other arguments as to why the Statute of\n\nFrauds does not apply; because we find for the above reasons that\n\nthe contract was not within the one-year provision, we do not\n\naddress them here.\n\n             The district court is affirmed.    Costs to Schara.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

In his cover letter, Cohen described the agreement as \"final\" and asked Schara to \"return both contracts signed by yourself to Ira Kristel.\" That agreement called for Commercial to take out life insurance for Schara in the amount of $500,000. It also provided for a one percent bonus on all business, above the base level set in 1995, excluding designated house accounts. One provision of the contract provided for a severance payment in the event that more than half of Commercial was sold and Commercial was unable to perform as a result. This pay-out would take place over a two-year period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cover letter said that the list of house accounts would be provided to Schara directly by Commercial. The appendix listing house accounts was blank, however, according to Schara. He said he asked Ira Kristel about the blank page, and was told \"Sign it. It's in your favor.\" Schara signed the contract and returned it to Ira Kristel; he never received a copy signed by Ira Kristel. Schara testified that when he called Ira Kristel to ask about the contract, he was assured that Kristel had signed the agreement. Subsequently, Schara received a six-page list of house accounts, some time after he began work for Commercial in July 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of Schara's medical history, however, Commercial could not obtain life insurance for him. This was apparently discovered after Schara started work for Commercial, although there is some dispute as to the exact timing. Schara testified that he met with Steven Kristel and attorney Wachtel, another lawyer for the Kristels. They agreed that, in lieu of life insurance, Schara would receive a bonus based on all of Commercial's accounts, including house accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 1995 attorney Cohen faxed a revised employment contract to Schara for his signature. The cover letter stated, \"At the request of Steven Kristel, I have revised your employment agreement by deleting Section (d) to Appendix B.\" Section (d) referred to the $500,000 life insurance provision. Schara signed the contract and returned it to Commercial; he never received a copy signed by either Kristel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Schara also testified that he spoke with Steven Kristel on April 5, 1996. He produced notes in his handwriting from that conversation, reading \"4/15/96, revision per Steven Kristel. He'll send me a copy of the revised contract to include these changes, no house accounts in exchange for five hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the three years Schara worked at Commercial Envelope its sales grew by approximately $11 million dollars, from $36 million dollars to $47 million dollars. Throughout this period, Schara received his full salary, health insurance, use of a company car, and paid membership in a country club, as he was entitled under both written and oral assurances from Commercial. The bonus is the only disputed aspect of his compensation. Schara did not make a written demand for his bonuses at any time. Schara testified that he had made oral demands, but that they were ignored by the Kristels. He said he was afraid to press his claims while he was still employed at Commercial for fear that they would lead to litigation and retaliatory firing. Schara was terminated in 1998, and subsequently brought suit for his unpaid bonuses for all three years of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial was held in May 2002. At trial, Ira Kristel contended that there was no agreement, that he had never signed anything. During cross-examination, Ira Kristel acknowledged that there was probably \"something owed Mr. Schara\" for unpaid bonuses. The district court denied Commercial's repeated motions for judgment as a matter of law and a directed verdict on the basis of the Statute of Frauds. It also refused to deliver jury instructions on the Statute of Frauds, ruling from the bench that the Statute did not apply. The jury found in Schara's favor, and awarded him $223,135.39 in damages for the breach, an amount equal to a one-percent bonus on all of Commercial's sales, including house accounts. With interest calculated by the judge, the total judgment was for $311,178.73. Commercial then filed this appeal, protesting the judge's failure to give jury instructions based on the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review for refusal to give a requested jury instruction is de novo. <i>See Gray v.

Jurisprudence 2d,</i> Statute of Frauds, &#167; 4, at 21 (1987) (footnote omitted). This dispute is governed by New York law. The Statute of Frauds, codified in New York, reads in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every agreement, promise or undertaking is void, unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged... if such agreement, promise or undertaking...

Farnsworth, <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 6.1, at 98 (2d ed.1998). The Statute of Frauds has been largely abolished in England since 1954. <i>Id.</i> at 95. In the United States, it has been \"the subject of constant erosion. Courts have long been receptive to pleas that the statute should be narrowly interpreted so as not to cover the contract in question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98-99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This erosion has happened on a number of fronts; one is pertinent here. New York has consistently chosen to construe the one-year provision of the Statute &#8212; the requirement that contracts not performable within a year fall within the Statute &#8212; narrowly. \"Wherever an agreement has been found to be susceptible of fulfillment within that time, in whatever manner and however impractical, this court has held the one-year provision of the Statute to be inapplicable, a writing unnecessary, and the agreement not barred.\" <i>D &amp; N Boening, Inc. v. Kirsch Beverages, Inc.,</i> 63 N.Y.2d 449, 455, 483 N.Y.S.2d 164, 472 N.E.2d 992 (1984). This is usually a matter of interpretation of the contract language by the court, and often resolved on a motion to dismiss. <i>Id.; Cron v. Hargro Fabrics, Inc.,</i> 91 N.Y.2d 362, 370, 670 N.Y.S.2d 973, 694 N.E.2d 56 (1998). In any event, there are no issues of fact on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York courts have found a range of termination provisions sufficient to keep agreements out of the reach of the Statute. <i>See, e.g., Coinmach Inds. Corp. v. Domnitch,</i> 37 N.Y.2d 889, 891, 378 N.Y.S.2d 370, 340 N.E.2d 735 (1975) (where defendant had the option of selling at any time the property on lease to the plaintiff); <i>N. Shore Bottling Co. v. Schmidt &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 22 N.Y.2d 171, 176-77, 292 N.Y.S.2d 86, 239 N.E.2d 189 (1968) (where defendant had the option to discontinue at any time the activities upon which the agreement was based); <i>Nat Nal Serv. Stations, Inc. v. Wolf,</i> 304 N.Y. 332, 340, 107 N.E.2d 473 (1952) (where agreement merely set the terms of anticipated prospective purchases); <i>Blake v. Voigt,</i> 134 N.Y. 69, 71, 31 N.E. 256 (1892) (where either party had the option to terminate within seven months).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the policy concerns which underlie the application of the Statute are not at issue. This is not a situation where Schara's claims are based solely on oral testimony, unsupported by writings, and subject to the vagaries of memory. Instead, he relies on writings drafted and presented by Commercial. Moreover, the facts surrounding the presentation of those writings &#8212; where each writing was presented by Commercial's attorney, labelled first a \"final\" agreement and then a \"revision\" to a final agreement, where Schara followed instructions to sign each and return it, and where Commercial neither signed nor indicated to Schara that it had not signed &#8212; do not incline us to invoke the Statute on Commercial's behalf. Consequently, we interpret the one-year provision narrowly, avoiding use of the Statute to \"afford persons a means of evading just obligations.\" <i>Morris Cohon &amp; Co. v. Russell,</i> 23 N.Y.2d 569, 574, 297 N.Y.S.2d 947, 245 N.E.2d 712 (1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract provided for payment of salary and a bonus to Schara in the event the company was sold:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11. <i>Sale of Business.</i> If at any time during the term hereof more than 50% of the assets or stock of the Company is sold, <i>and</i> if as a result thereof, the Company is unable to perform its obligations hereunder, the Employee shall be entitled to receive the compensation to which he was otherwise entitled hereunder, in addition to severance in an amount equal to 300% of the Bonus, if any, he received for the previous Contract Year. If such sale is consummated during the first Contract Year hereunder, the severance hereunder shall be $500,000. The severance hereunder shall be paid over a period of 24 months in 48 semi-monthly installments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision removes the contract from the ambit of the Statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mere breach of contract within a year would not suffice to remove a contract from the Statute under New York law. As all contracts could be in breach, allowing breaches within a year to remove an agreement from the Statute would potentially vitiate it. <i>See Ohanian v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc.,</i> 779 F.2d 101, 107-08 (2d Cir.1985). But the contract provision here envisions a termination, not a breach. Likewise, if the termination provision is not set forth explicitly in the contract, the Statute of Frauds will apply. <i>See Paper Corp. v. Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc.,</i> 742 F.Supp. 808, 810 (S.D.N.Y.1990); <i>City of Yonkers v. Otis Elevator Co.,</i> 649 F.Supp. 716, 727 n. 15 (S.D.N.Y.1986). Here, however, the termination provision is express.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York law does not allow termination provisions solely within the control of the plaintiff to remove an agreement from the scope of the one-year provision. But the case at hand does not involve an oral agreement terminable within a year only by the party that seeks to enforce the agreement; instead it is an agreement where the right to terminate within a year is in the hands of the defendant. New York courts have long found such agreements to be outside of the Statute of Frauds. <i>See Huebener v. Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, Inc.,</i> 142 A.D.2d 185, 534 N.Y.S.2d 952, 955 (N.Y.App.Div. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commercial argues that the two-year pay-out period envisioned by paragraph 11 suffices to place this contract within the Statute. We disagree. Because \"the terms of the contract here ... included an event which might end the contractual relationship of the parties within a year, defendant's possible liability beyond that time [does] not bring the contract within the statute.\" <i>Cron,</i> 91 N.Y.2d at 370, 670 N.Y.S.2d 973, 694 N.E.2d 56 (quoting <i>Martocci v. Greater N.Y. Brewery, Inc.,</i> 301 N.Y. 57, 62, 92 N.E.2d 887 (1950)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the two-year pay-out, Commercial stresses the importance of the test of the \"endurance of defendant's liability.\" The language of \"enduring liability,\" however, derives from cases in which contractual rights persist other than mere pay-out of a pre-determined severance amount. <i>See, e.g., Martocci,</i> 301 N.Y. at 62-63, 92 N.E.2d 887 (ongoing obligation to pay commission based on plaintiff's introduction of defendant to customer); <i>Cohen v. Bartgis Bros. Co.,</i> 289 N.Y. 846, 846-47, 47 N.E.2d 443 (1943) (obligation to pay commissions outlasting plaintiff's employment with defendant).

Schara alleged that his original employment contract had provided for a one percent bonus on non-house accounts only, and that this agreement was subsequently revised, following Commercial's failure to obtain life insurance for him, to a bonus on all accounts. Commercial responded that neither the original agreement nor the revised agreement had ever been signed by Commercial, and so no agreement existed. Commercial requested that the judge deliver a jury instruction on the Statute of Frauds; the judge refused, saying he had ruled the Statute inapplicable but he did not give his reasons for that conclusion. The jury found for Schara, awarding him damages of over $220,000, equivalent to a bonus on all of the accounts. Commercial now appeals the judge's refusal to submit the issue to the jury, and to deliver a jury instruction on the Statute.

He had worked at Westvaco Company, an envelope manufacturing company, for 23 years and was their national sales manager for national and wholesale accounts.

During the course of negotiations, according to Schara, Ira Kristel personally assured him that Commercial would get him life insurance. Ira Kristel also promised him a bonus of one percent of the increase in sales, excluding \"house\" accounts &#8212; a specified list of sales accounts which predated Schara's arrival. He also assured Schara's wife that Schara would receive life insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1995, Commercial's external counsel, Steve Cohen, forwarded an employment agreement to Schara for his signature.

New York has consistently chosen to construe the one-year provision of the Statute &#8212; the requirement that contracts not performable within a year fall within the Statute &#8212; narrowly. \"Wherever an agreement has been found to be susceptible of fulfillment within that time, in whatever manner and however impractical, this court has held the one-year provision of the Statute to be inapplicable, a writing unnecessary, and the agreement not barred.\" <i>D &amp; N Boening, Inc. v.

This is usually a matter of interpretation of the contract language by the court, and often resolved on a motion to dismiss. <i>Id.; Cron v.

In any event, there are no issues of fact on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York courts have found a range of termination provisions sufficient to keep agreements out of the reach of the Statute. <i>See, e.g., Coinmach Inds.

This is not a situation where Schara's claims are based solely on oral testimony, unsupported by writings, and subject to the vagaries of memory. Instead, he relies on writings drafted and presented by Commercial. Moreover, the facts surrounding the presentation of those writings &#8212; where each writing was presented by Commercial's attorney, labelled first a \"final\" agreement and then a \"revision\" to a final agreement, where Schara followed instructions to sign each and return it, and where Commercial neither signed nor indicated to Schara that it had not signed &#8212; do not incline us to invoke the Statute on Commercial's behalf. Consequently, we interpret the one-year provision narrowly, avoiding use of the Statute to \"afford persons a means of evading just obligations.\" <i>Morris Cohon &amp; Co. v.

As all contracts could be in breach, allowing breaches within a year to remove an agreement from the Statute would potentially vitiate it. <i>See Ohanian v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462283\"><a href=\"/opinion/462283/robert-s-ohanian-cross-appellant-v-avis-rent-a-car-system-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 107-08 (2d Cir.1985). But the contract provision here envisions a termination, not a breach. Likewise, if the termination provision is not set forth explicitly in the contract, the Statute of Frauds will apply. <i>See Paper Corp. v. Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1689293\"><a href=\"/opinion/1689293/paper-corp-of-us-v-schoeller-technical-papers/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But the case at hand does not involve an oral agreement terminable within a year only by the party that seeks to enforce the agreement; instead it is an agreement where the right to terminate within a year is in the hands of the defendant. New York courts have long found such agreements to be outside of the Statute of Frauds. <i>See Huebener v. Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></span>, 955 (N.Y.App.Div. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commercial argues that the two-year pay-out period envisioned by paragraph 11 suffices to place this contract within the Statute. We disagree.
