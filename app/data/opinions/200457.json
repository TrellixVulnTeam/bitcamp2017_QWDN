Joyce L. Alexander, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n    Don Boyd on brief pro se.\n\n\n                                  May 2, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.      Pro se plaintiff-appellant Don Boyd\n\nappeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of pro se\n\ndefendant-appellee Anthony Camardo.          We affirm.\n\n            Boyd alleges that he was misled to believe that\n\nCamardo's employer, a music instrument and equipment retailer\n\nnamed    E.U.   Wurlitzer   Sound    and   Music,   Inc.   (\"EUW\"),   was\n\nassociated with Wurlitzer, Inc. (\"Wurlitzer\"), a well-known\n\npiano and jukebox manufacturer.            Boyd contends that, as a\n\nresult    of    EUW's   misrepresentations     in    certain   magazine\n\nadvertisements, he purchased $14,000 worth of defective music\n\nequipment from EUW. The district court concluded that Boyd had\n\nnot established that any misrepresentations were made.\n\n            We review the grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\nexamining the record independently and drawing any factual\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant. See,\n\ne.g., Gu v. Boston Police Dep't, 312 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Summary judgment is appropriate if \"the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\n\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\n\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"           Straughn\n\nv. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          Where the party moving for summary judgment does not\n\nbear the burden of proof at trial, that party must merely\n\ndemonstrate \"an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving\n\nparty's case.\"   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325\n\n(1986).   If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the\n\nburden shifts to the non-movant, who cannot rely on bare\n\nallegations but must specify facts showing that a genuine\n\ncontroversy is presented for trial.     See Anderson v. Liberty\n\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1986).     A genuine factual\n\ndispute exists only when there is sufficient evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party.\n\nSee F.D.I.C. v. Elder Care Servs., Inc., 82 F.3d 524, 526 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n          Boyd makes three arguments in this appeal. His first\n\nargument that the lower court's findings of fact were erroneous\n\nand unreasonable has no merit.      In his brief, Boyd provides\n\nseven paragraphs of \"background facts\" that purportedly reflect\n\nthe error in the court's findings.      The majority of Boyd's\n\nrecitations, however, are consistent with the court's findings,\n\nand any discrepancies or omissions are either irrelevant or not\n\nsupported by the record.     For the most part, Boyd merely\n\ndisputes the legal significance of, and inferences to be drawn\n\nfrom, those facts.   See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248 (noting that\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\ffactual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary should not\n\nbe counted for summary judgment).\n\n            Next, Boyd argues that the lower court erred in\n\nfinding that EUW did not make any misrepresentations in its\n\nadvertisements.        We need not resolve this issue because we\n\naffirm the court's grant of summary judgment for Camardo on a\n\ndifferent ground, which is discussed below.            See, e.g., Four\n\nCorners Serv. Station, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 51 F.3d 306,\n\n314 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that appellate court is free to\n\naffirm district court judgment on any ground supported by the\n\nrecord).\n\n            Finally, Boyd argues that the lower court erred in\n\nconcluding that Camardo could not be held personally liable for\n\nthe   misrepresentations,     or,    in   the   alternative,   that   the\n\ncourt's opinion regarding Camardo's lack of liability was\n\nunconstitutionally vague.           Boyd misunderstands the court's\n\nruling     regarding    Camardo's     personal    liability    for    the\n\nmisrepresentation claims.      The court assumed, for purposes of\n\nsummary judgment on these claims, that Camardo was personally\n\nresponsible for the advertisements. However, because the court\n\nhad determined that there were no misrepresentations in the\n\nadvertisements, the court concluded that there was nothing for\n\nwhich Camardo could be held liable, and, accordingly, rendered\n\nsummary judgment for Camardo on the misrepresentation claims.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fWe conclude that summary judgment for Camardo was appropriate\n\non the alternative ground that Boyd failed to meet his burden\n\nof showing a genuine issue of material fact as to Camardo's\n\npersonal liability for the alleged misrepresentations.                    In\n\nother       words,    even   assuming      that    EUW    made   fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentations in its advertisements, there is no basis in\n\nthe record for holding Camardo personally liable for them.\n\n               Camardo was a corporate officer of EUW.           Under both\n\nMassachusetts and South Carolina law,1 a corporate officer may\n\nbe held liable for the tortious conduct of the corporation if\n\nhe       personally   participated   in    the    tort   by,   for   example,\n\ndirecting, controlling, approving or ratifying the act that\n\ninjured the aggrieved party.         See Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366,\n\n369, 468 S.E.2d 649, 650 (1996); Townsends, Inc. v. Beaupre, 47\n\nMass. App. Ct. 747, 751-52, 716 N.E.2d 160, 164 (1999) (citing\n\nRefrigeration Discount Corp. v. Catino, 330 Mass. 230, 235, 112\n\nN.E.2d 790, 793 (1953)).         In this case, there is no evidence\n\nthat Camardo participated in the creation or submission of the\n\nadvertisements that allegedly harmed Boyd.               The mere fact that\n\nCamardo held various positions at EUW (including director,\n\nchief executive officer and president) is not enough to render\n\n     1\n\n     This was a diversity action. Boyd is a resident of South\n     Carolina. Camardo is a resident of Massachusetts and was\n     employed by EUW, a Massachusetts corporation. Boyd did not\n     challenge the court's decision to apply both Massachusetts\n     and South Carolina law to his misrepresentation claims.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhim    liable    for       EUW's   alleged       misrepresentations         in     the\n\nadvertisements.        See, e.g., Rowe, 321 S.C. at 369, 468 S.E.2d\n\nat 650 (holding that person who was sole shareholder, president\n\nand director of corporation could not be held personally liable\n\nfor fraud without evidence that he had made misrepresentations,\n\nor     that     he     had      directed,        authorized        or     encouraged\n\nmisrepresentations); Addis v. Steele, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 433,\n\n439, 648 N.E.2d 773, 776 (1995) (holding that president of\n\ncorporation      could       not   be   held      personally      liable     without\n\nevidence      that    he     participated       in   acts    causing      injury    to\n\nplaintiffs).         Nor is there any basis in the record to justify\n\n\"piercing the corporate veil.\"                  See Evans v. Multicon Constr.\n\nCorp., 30 Mass. App. Ct. 728, 732-33, 574 N.E.2d 395, 398\n\n(1991); Sturkie v. Sifly, 280 S.C. 453, 457-59, 313 S.E.2d 316,\n\n318-19 (Ct. App. 1984) (listing factors for piercing corporate\n\nveil    in    order        to   hold      corporate        officer      liable     for\n\ncorporation's        acts).        Lastly,      we   are    not    persuaded      that\n\nCamardo's statement that \"Plaintiff does not offer any evidence\n\nof    wrongdoing      on     the   part    of     Defendant       other    than    the\n\nsubmission of paid advertisements that were placed by E.U.\n\nWurlitzer Co., Inc. in various musical retailers' publications\"\n\nconstitutes an admission of Camardo's personal liability for\n\nthe alleged misrepresentations.\n\n              The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",

Boyd did not\n     challenge the court's decision to apply both Massachusetts\n     and South Carolina law to his misrepresentation claims.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhim    liable    for       EUW's   alleged       misrepresentations         in     the\n\nadvertisements.
