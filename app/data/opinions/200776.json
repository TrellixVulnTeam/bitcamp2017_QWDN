This is an appeal by a lobster\n\ndealer (Little Bay Lobster Company) and several lobster boat\n\noperators based in New Hampshire from a decision of the district\n\ncourt sustaining new federal regulations affecting the plaintiffs.\n\nFor convenience, we refer to the appellants collectively as \"Little\n\nBay\" in describing the claims presented on appeal and assume\n\nfamiliarity with earlier decisions cited below setting forth the\n\nlegal and factual background in great detail.\n\n           The   federal   regulations    in    question      govern   lobster\n\ncatches in the so-called exclusive economic zone (\"the EEZ\")--an\n\narea of federal jurisdiction extending from 3 to 200 nautical miles\n\nseaward of the U.S. coastline.      Ace Lobster Co., Inc. v. Evans, 165\n\nF. Supp. 2d. 148, 152 n.3 (D.R.I. 2001).                State governments\n\nregulate the first three miles seaward of their coastline and the\n\nfederal   government   regulates    beyond     that   limit    to   the   outer\n\nboundary of the zone.      Id.     The legal framework and regulatory\n\nhistory are peculiarly complicated, but only a nutshell description\n\nis needed to set the scene.\n\n           In 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act\n\n(\"the Magnuson-Stevens Act\"), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1883 (2000), was\n\nadopted to conserve and manage fishery resources.                16 U.S.C. §\n\n1801(b)(1) (2000);     Campanale & Sons, Inc. v. Evans, 311 F.3d 120\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).    Regional fishery management councils, including\n\nfederal and state officials and others, were authorized to adopt\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffor each fishery requiring conservation a fishery management plan,\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1801(b)(4),(5) (2000); Campanale, 311 F.3d at 111; and\n\nthe   statute   provided    for   the       Secretary   of   Commerce   (\"the\n\nSecretary\") to adopt implementing regulations based on notice and\n\ncomment rule-making if the plan was consistent with a set of\n\n\"national standards\" set forth in the statute.                 16 U.S.C. §§\n\n1851(a), 1854(a)(1)(A) (2000).\n\n           East coast lobsters are such an endangered fishery, and\n\nin 1978 a group of east coast states proposed a plan for both state\n\nand federal waters.   In 1983, the pertinent regional council under\n\nthe   Magnuson-Stevens     Act--the     New   England   Fishery   Management\n\nCouncil (\"the Council\")--adopted a fishery management plan for\n\nlobsters that was later implemented by the federal National Marine\n\nFisheries Service.    Nevertheless, 10 years later a study revealed\n\nthat Northeast lobsters were dangerously overfished.              In December\n\n1993 the Council circulated a draft amendment proposing that four\n\nareas be designated in the EEZ and subjecting each to different\n\nrestrictions (e.g., trap limits) aimed at rebuilding stocks.\n\n           Counterpart regulations were adopted by the Secretary in\n\nthe spring of 1994.      59 Fed. Reg. 26,454 (May 20, 1994) (codified\n\nat 50 C.F.R. § 649.20 (1995), subsequently repealed effective Jan.\n\n5, 2000); 59 Fed. Reg. 31,938 (June 21, 1994) (codified at 50\n\nC.F.R. § 649.42(b) (1995), subsequently repealed effective Jan. 5,\n\n2000).   The four new management areas included two areas in the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ffederal waters of the gulf of Maine: area 1 starting three miles\n\noffshore and area 3 adjacent to area 1 but lying seaward of it.                59\n\nFed. Reg. at 31,950-51.             The line separating the two areas,\n\nsometimes called the Dick Allen line, lay about 30 miles off the\n\ncoast.    The restrictions on lobster traps in area 1 have been more\n\nstringent than those applying in area 3.\n\n            In    the   meantime,    Congress   in    1993   had   adopted    the\n\nAtlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (\"Atlantic\n\nCoastal Act\").          16 U.S.C. §§ 5101-5108 (2000).             This statute\n\nchartered an Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (\"the\n\nCommission\") comprising representatives of states from Maine to\n\nFlorida.     16 U.S.C. § 5102(3), (13) (2000).               The Commission's\n\ndirect concern is with mobile Atlantic coast fisheries within state\n\nwaters, but in the absence of regulations under the Magnuson-\n\nStevens    Act,   the    Secretary   can    adopt    for   EEZ   waters   a   plan\n\ncompatible with one adopted by the Commission for state waters. 16\n\nU.S.C. § 5103(b)(1) (2000).\n\n             This case involves such a plan under the new statute.\n\nThe new plan began life as a proposed amendment to the existing\n\nplan; but, along the way, prompted by further pessimistic studies\n\nin 1996, the federal National Marine Fisheries Service proposed\n\nthat the Magnuson-Stevens Act regulations be withdrawn and that new\n\nregulations be adopted under the authority of the new statute if\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fand   when    a   suitable   state-waters    plan      was    adopted       by    the\n\nCommission.       Ace Lobster, 165 F. Supp. 2d. at 157.\n\n             During the summer of 1997, the Commission sought comments\n\non its so-called amendment 3.            This plan included among other\n\nthings more stringent limits on the number of lobster traps in\n\nareas 1 and 3.       In September 1997, after further public hearings,\n\nthe Commission's lobster management board voted to alter amendment\n\n3 to move the boundary line between area 1 and area 3 from 30 to 50\n\nmiles offshore.       The alteration enlarged area 1, the area subject\n\nto most stringent limits, thereby disadvantaging anyone who had\n\nsought lobsters within the area lying between the old line and the\n\none now proposed.\n\n             The Commission approved amendment 3 with the revised\n\nboundary line between areas 1 and 3 in December 1997.                   In March\n\n1998,   National       Marine   Fisheries    Service         issued     a        draft\n\nenvironmental impact statement (\"EIS\"), pursuant to the National\n\nEnvironmental       Policy   Act,   42   U.S.C.   §§    4321-4370d          (2000),\n\nevaluating new alternatives for lobster regulation in federal\n\nwaters; one of the alternatives was amendment 3.                  A number of\n\nhearings on the draft EIS were held including one in Portsmouth,\n\nNew Hampshire, in May 1998, and written comments were received\n\nincluding one from Little Bay itself attacking the shift from the\n\nDick Allen line.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            In January 1999, a proposed federal rule was published\n\nimplementing amendment 3 for federal waters, 64 Fed. Reg. 2,708\n\n(proposed January 15, 1999), and public comments were received\n\nincluding several pertaining to the new line.                   A final EIS was\n\nissued in May 1999, noting that amendment 3 had the most support of\n\nall the alternatives under consideration.               The final EIS included\n\na   final   regulatory    flexibility        analysis,   as     required   by   the\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612 (2000), concluding\n\nthat those using lobster traps would be impacted in the short-run\n\nbut that the benefits of rebuilding stocks outweighed the harm.\n\n            In December 1999, the National Marine Fisheries Service\n\nissued final regulations, 64 Fed. Reg. 68,228 (Dec. 6, 1999)\n\n(codified    at   50   C.F.R.   Part   697)     which    were    adopted   by   the\n\nSecretary pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Act, 16 U.S.C. § 5103(b)\n\n(2000).     These regulations implemented amendment 3 for federal\n\nwaters including the new stricter trap limits and the shift of the\n\nDick Allen line.       In early January 2000, Little Bay and a number of\n\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire, lobster boat operators brought suit in\n\nthe federal district court against the Secretary to challenge the\n\nnew regulations.\n\n            An action of this kind, framed as a declaratory judgment\n\nproceeding, is in effect a suit for review of agency action\n\nordinarily based on the administrative record.                See Campanale, 311\n\nF.3d at 115; Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fDaley,    170     F.3d   23,   28    (1st    Cir.   1999).        After    extensive\n\nproceedings, the district court on May 16, 2002, granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Secretary, and this appeal followed.                      Our\n\nreview of the district court decision is de novo, Massachusetts ex\n\nrel. Div. of Marine Fisheries, 170 F.3d at 28.                    What standard we\n\nand the district court both apply to the agency's own decisions\n\nvaries with the issue.         Id.\n\n            The most prominent issue on appeal concerns one of the\n\nrequirements       the   Secretary     had    to    meet    before      adopting   the\n\nregulations.       The Atlantic Coastal Act requires inter alia that\n\nfederal regulations adapting the Commission plan for use in the\n\nfederal     EEZ    (1)   follow      \"consultation         with   the    appropriate\n\n[Regional] Councils,\" and (2) be consistent with the national\n\nstandards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.                     16 U.S.C. §5103(b)(1)\n\n(2000).      Here, Little Bay claims, the failure to consult is\n\nestablished by our intervening decision in Campanale & Sons, Inc.\n\nv. Evans.\n\n            That case, like this one, involved amendment 3 and the\n\nDecember 1999 regulations implementing the plan for the EEZ,                       but\n\nthe plaintiffs were Rhode Island fishermen concerned with the\n\nnumerical limits on traps.             Campanale, 311 F.3d at 115.                 The\n\ndistrict court rebuffed the attacks but a divided panel of this\n\ncourt held that the Secretary had violated his obligation to\n\nconsult with the Council.           Id. at 121.      The court declined to say\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fthat the error had been harmless, ruling that this inquiry was \"a\n\nfactual one . . . best undertaken initially by the district court.\"\n\nId. at 120 n. 13.\n\n             Campanale was decided after the district court in our own\n\ncase   had   sustained      summary    judgment     for   the    Secretary.      In\n\nCampanale, the court acknowledged that the Secretary had advised\n\nthe Council of the proposed trap limits through the draft EIS's\n\nalternatives and had gotten comments back from the council.                      The\n\nCampanale panel held this to be inadequate at least where the\n\nSecretary did not tell the Council that this was its statutory\n\nconsultation opportunity.         Campanale, 311 F.3d at 117-21.\n\n             Conceivably, the Secretary might have \"consulted\" with\n\nthe Council on one issue (the line) but not another (the trap\n\nlimits);     but   in    our   case,   the   Secretary     has    not   sought   to\n\ndistinguish Campanale by arguing that consultation met the letter\n\nof the statute.         Rather, he argues that the Council knew what was\n\nbeing proposed      and     that--at   least   as    to   the    line   shift--the\n\nsurrounding circumstances show that a more formal process of\n\nconsultation would not have altered the result. This is a standard\n\nharmless error argument, fully available in administrative matters.\n\nSave Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA, 269 F.3d 49, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\naccord Campanale, 311 F.3d at 120 n. 13.\n\n             In Campanale the court chose to leave this harmless error\n\nissue to the district court on remand but there is no need for us\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fto do so.    Although the harmless error inquiry is in one sense a\n\n\"factual\" one, it is ordinarily resolved not with new evidence but\n\nby reasoned conjecture as to what would have happened \"if\" a\n\nparticular error had not occurred.       Here, forewarned by Campanale,\n\nLittle Bay and the government have briefed the prejudice issue\n\nrelying upon materials in the administrative record before us.\n\n            The   principal   question    is   whether   the   Secretary's\n\ndecision to shift the boundary line would have been altered if he\n\nhad engaged in the more formal consultation with the Council called\n\nfor by Campanale.    Little Bay argues that the Council had devised\n\nthe line and had expert knowledge; that such consultation would\n\nhave provided Little Bay with an opportunity to appear before the\n\nCouncil and argue against the shift; and that the shift prejudices\n\nit by imposing more stringent regulation on a large area in which\n\nLittle Bay operates.\n\n            The Secretary says that there is no proof that Little Bay\n\nwill be disadvantaged by the new line, but we will assume arguendo\n\nthe contrary.     There is apparently no dispute that the appellant\n\nfishermen have operated in the EEZ in areas 1 and 3 and that the\n\nshift in the area 1 boundary line seaward by a substantial amount\n\nwill restrict more severely operations in the very large area\n\ntransferred from area 3 to area 1.       That this will adversely impact\n\nthe appellants appears a natural inference.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            But this, of course, does not show prejudice of the kind\n\nthat concerns us.        The Secretary knew full well that the new\n\nrestrictions would cause short-term harm to fishermen--harm that\n\nwould be counterbalanced in the Secretary's view by the long-term\n\nbenefits to everyone of rebuilding lobster fisheries for the\n\nfuture.    64 Fed. Reg. 2,708, 2,712 (proposed January 15, 1999).\n\nThe question is whether anything that formal consultation with the\n\nCouncil would have brought about would have been likely to change\n\nthe   Secretary's     position.    And        on    this   issue,     based   on   the\n\narguments presented, everything points the Secretary's way.\n\n            The overall reason for the shift of the line, needless to\n\nsay, was to protect more lobsters; but this was underpinned by a\n\nfairly    technical    judgment   by    the        Commission   and    its    Lobster\n\nManagement Board.        The record indicates that the new line was\n\ndeemed to have a series of advantages:\n\n                   !to make the boundary lines compatible\n            with stock assessment boundaries and produce\n            more accurate stock assessments and evaluation\n            of each area's management measures;\n\n                   !to extend the existing area 1 size\n            limits aimed at protecting the larger, more\n            fruitful lobsters from area 1 to area 1\n            lobsters that tended to breed in the nearby\n            reaches of area 3;\n\n                   !to simplify compliance by fishermen\n            because the boundary lines would now be more\n            consistent with the boundary lines in other\n            fisheries.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          Little Bay's brief says virtually nothing about what it\n\nmight have said to the Council to counter this reasoning.   Nor does\n\nit suggest anything that the Council would have been likely to say\n\nto the Secretary that would likely have led the Secretary to alter\n\nhis reliance on the Commission's judgment that the line should be\n\nmoved.   Absent such specifics, there is no reason to think that\n\nconsultation would have produced a different result.\n\n          This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the\n\nCouncil was informally involved in the new plan and commented on it\n\nto the Secretary.1   Further, the Secretary held public hearings,\n\nincluding one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the draft EIS\n\ncontaining the boundary shift as one option.      Little Bay itself\n\nsubmitted comments to the Secretary on the issue.   And there is no\n\nreason why Little Bay could not have sought to enlist the support\n\nof the Council if it thought it could gain such support.\n\n          Although the burden of proof as to prejudice lies with\n\nLittle Bay, First Am. Disc. Corp. v. CFTC, 222 F.3d 1008, 1015\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2000), the substantive standard for harmless error tends\n\nto favor the objecting party.   See, e.g., Moulton v. Rival Co., 116\n\n\n\n     1\n      In addition to interchange of written communications, there\nwas also a significant number of opportunities for Council members\nto express their views in person.       National Marine Fisheries\nService representatives attend all New England Council meetings and\na member of the National Marine Fisheries Service sits on the\nCouncil as a voting member. 16 § U.S.C. 1852(b)(1)(B) (2000). New\nEngland Council members have also commonly held seats on the\nAtlantic Commission.\n\n                                -11-\n\fF.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"highly probable that the error did\n\nnot affect the outcome of the case\"). Here, however, nothing\n\nsuggests that the result was affected.\n\n             Little Bay's next set of arguments are directed to its\n\nclaim that the Secretary failed to meet a second condition for\n\nadopting regulations under the Atlantic Coastal Act, namely, that\n\nthe regulations conform to the national standards set forth in the\n\nMagnuson-Stevens Act.       16 U.S.C. § 5103(b)(1)(B) (2000).       Little\n\nBay says that the adoption of the new boundary line violates\n\nnational standards 2, 4, and 8.\n\n             National standard 2 provides that a fishery management\n\nplan   and    regulations   to   implement   it   must,    in   respect   of\n\nconservation and management measures, be \"based upon the best\n\nscientific information available.\"        16 U.S.C. § 1851(a)(2) (2000).\n\nA regulation broadly defines the phrase \"scientific information\" to\n\ninclude scientific, economic and social information.            50 C.F.R. §\n\n600.315(b)(1) (2002). Little Bay says that the Secretary failed to\n\npresent \"any scientific analysis or reasoning\" to support the shift\n\nin the boundary line.\n\n             Little Bay concedes that there is ample support for the\n\nconclusion that lobster stocks off the Atlantic coast are in peril\n\nand that new measures are urgently needed.                And it does not\n\ndirectly dispute that moving the line seaward will restrict lobster\n\ncatches by imposing the more restrictive area 1 regime over a wider\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\farea (indeed, its claim of prejudice rests on the inference that\n\ncatches will be restricted).         Nor does it say, or at least argue in\n\nany detail, that the inference is not \"scientific\" enough.\n\n            Rather, Little Bay argues tersely that it is the net\n\neffect that matters and the Secretary failed to consider that the\n\nexpansion of area 1 would mean more lobsters caught in area 1.            At\n\nfirst this appears to be a specious objection: expanding area 1\n\nseaward means that trapping in what was previously part of area 3\n\nis   now   occurring   with   more    severe   restrictions   in   the   same\n\nterritory now renamed area 1. But Little Bay then refers summarily\n\nto \"requirements recently adopted which require a showing of\n\nhistoric participation in order to fish in area 3.\"           Little Bay is\n\nreferring, we take it, to 68 Fed. Reg. 14,902 (Mar. 27, 2003),\n\nlimiting fishing in areas 3, 4, and 5 to those permit holders that\n\ncan establish historical participation.\n\n            Conceivably the interaction of two changes could produce\n\na net negative effect on conservation, but Little Bay offers no\n\ndeveloped argument of such a threat here.           If the implication is\n\nthat the recent regulation may force some fishermen from area 3 to\n\nthe richer (albeit more restricted) area 1, this sounds like an\n\nattack simply upon the \"recently adopted\" historical participation\n\nrequirements.    At best, it is an undeveloped claim that a new step-\n\n-taken after the challenged regulation was adopted--undermines its\n\nrationale.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f              So viewed, the claim still fails.                  Presumptively an\n\nagency decision is reviewed on the record, Fla. Power & Light Co.\n\nv. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743 (1985); Citizens to Preserve Overton\n\nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971); and while rare\n\ncircumstances might encourage a reviewing court to look at later\n\ndevelopments (e.g., if both proposals were developed in tandem),\n\nnothing of the kind is alleged in this case.                 Further, even if the\n\n\"historic      participation\"        requirement      were     part    of    the    very\n\nregulations      at    issue,    Little    Bay       says    nothing       beyond    one\n\nspeculative sentence to suggest a likelihood of its undermining the\n\nbenefits of the new line, and that alone is fatal.\n\n              Little   Bay   next     invokes       national    standard      4     which\n\nrequires that any action that \"allocate[s] or assign[s] fishing\n\nprivileges among the various U.S. fishermen\" shall meet various\n\ntests, including a requirement that it be \"fair and equitable to\n\nall    such    fishermen.\"      16    U.S.C.    §    1851(a)(4)       (2000).         The\n\nregulations say that an allocation means a \"direct and deliberate\n\ndistribution\" of fishing privileges and not management measures\n\nthat    have     \"incidental         allocative      effects.\"        50    C.F.R.      §\n\n600.325(c)(1) (2002).\n\n              We agree with the Secretary, and the district court, that\n\nthe boundary line shift is not such a direct allocation.                        Nothing\n\nin the shift, or the other concurrent changes, prevents fisherman\n\nfrom operating in areas 1 or 3 or both.               To the extent that Little\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fBay thinks that the \"historic participation\" limitations later\n\nadopted for area 3 do effect such an allocation--a matter on which\n\nwe express no view--it is challenging the wrong regulation.\n\n           Little Bay's last attack is based on national standard 8\n\nwhich, so far as pertinent, requires the Secretary in adopting\n\nrestrictions to take account of the interests of local fishing\n\ncommunities and, \"to the extent practicable\" and consistent with\n\nconservation goals, to minimize the adverse economic impact.     16\n\nU.S.C. § 1851(a)(8) (2000).   Little Bay does not deny the draft EIS\n\ndiscussed various alternative conservation measures and the impacts\n\non local communities; but it says that there was no separate\n\nassessment of the effects on its local community of moving the\n\nboundary line.   This appears to be true.\n\n           Nevertheless, the required analysis of alternatives and\n\nimpacts is subject to a rule of reason, for study could go on\n\nforever.   See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d\n\n104, 110-111 (1st Cir. 1997); cf. Roosevelt Campobello Int'l Park\n\nCom'n v. EPA, 684 F.2d 1041, 1047 (1st Cir. 1982).          This is\n\nespecially so where, as here, a plan comprises a set of new or\n\nchanged restrictions designed to work as a whole; a rule that every\n\nelement in such a plan be assessed separately to determine its own\n\nindividual impact would be unworkable for most complex plans could\n\nbe subdivided almost without end.\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f           In this instance, the shifting of the boundary--although\n\nquite likely to have some economic impact on some fishermen--was\n\npeculiarly   hard    to    quantify:        the   impact      depends      both on    the\n\ninteraction of the boundary shift with other regulatory measures\n\n(e.g.,   changes    in    trap    limits)     and      on   the   differing    fishing\n\nstrategies   (choice       of    area,   number        of   traps)   that     different\n\nfishermen may choose to adopt in response to the new changes--\n\nstrategies   that    may     alter    over      time    and   are    not    within    the\n\nSecretary's control.         See 64 Fed. Reg. 68,228, 68,235-36 (Dec. 6,\n\n1999).\n\n           There is no mechanical way to say when enough is enough.\n\nAbout the best a court can do is to ask whether the Secretary has\n\nexamined   the     impacts      of,   and    alternatives         to,   the    plan    he\n\nultimately adopts and whether a challenged failure to carry the\n\nanalysis further is clearly unreasonable, taking account of the\n\nusual considerations (e.g., whether information is available and\n\nwhether the further analysis is likely to be determinative).                           In\n\nthis gray area, some burden lies on the contestant to show why a\n\nparticular gap or omission is unreasonable.\n\n           Here the basic obligation to assess the impacts of, and\n\nalternatives to, the adopted plan as a whole was achieved.                            The\n\nfeasibility of fruitfully analyzing the boundary shift in isolation\n\nis unclear; and given the independent technical reasons for the\n\nshift, it appears to follow naturally from the decision to adopt\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fthe new management area scheme--a choice that was the subject of\n\nfull scale study.      Accordingly, there was no failure to meet\n\nnational standard 8.\n\n            This discussion of national standard 8 also disposes, in\n\nsubstance, of the final objection offered by Little Bay based on a\n\nquite different statute: the Regulatory Flexibility Act,     5 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 601-612 (2000).     This statute does not alter the substantive\n\nmission of the agencies under their own statutes; rather, the Act\n\ncreates procedural obligations to assure that the special concerns\n\nof small entities are given attention in the comment and analysis\n\nprocess when the agency undertakes rule-makings that affect small\n\nentities.    Associated Fisheries of Me., 127 F.3d at 116.\n\n            The regime at issue in this case unquestionably affects\n\na substantial number of small businesses; most, if not all, of the\n\naffected fishing is done by such entities.   Therefore, as required\n\nby the statute, 5 U.S.C. § 603(a) (2000), the Service prepared an\n\ninitial regulatory flexibility analysis as to the impact on small\n\nentities in conjunction with the proposal for rule-making; and,\n\nwhen it adopted the final regime, it included a final statement\n\naddressed to the subject.   5 U.S.C. § 604(a) (2000).   This much is\n\ncommon ground.\n\n            The statute also specifies what the final statement must\n\ncover, and in compliance with its terms the final statement in this\n\ncase described the range of small businesses affected and the\n\n\n                                -17-\n\festimated magnitude of the effects, summarized comments on the\n\nproposed rule and the response of the agency to the comments,\n\naddressed record-keeping burdens incident to the new regime, and\n\ndiscussed the reasons for the regime adopted and the reasons for\n\npreferring it to other alternatives. 5 U.S.C. § 604(a) (2000); see\n\nAssociated Fisheries of Me., 127 F.3d at 116.\n\n              In a short final section of its brief, Little Bay\n\noffers several different criticisms of the agency's compliance, but\n\nthe core of the main argument is this: that the agency gave very\n\nlittle separate attention to comments regarding the change in the\n\nboundary line and, above all, \"[n]o analysis was conducted to\n\ndetermine whether an alternative boundary line would have minimized\n\nthe economic impact upon the [a]ppellants or others similarly\n\nsituated.\"\n\n          Admittedly the final statement did little more than\n\nacknowledge that \"several commentators\" had objected to the change\n\nin the boundary line and responded by referring to the \"current\n\nconsensus\" in support of the new regime as a whole, 64 Fed. Reg. at\n\n68,235; and the agency certainly did not separately analyze the new\n\nregime by comparing as two separate alternatives the new regime\n\nwith the boundary shift and without it.   The question is whether\n\nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act required more and we conclude, in\n\nthe context of this case, that it did not.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f           The agency's final statement adopting the new regime,\n\ntogether with materials cross-referenced in it, set forth in detail\n\nthe reasons for adopting the new regime as a whole and the reasons\n\nfor preferring it to a series of alternatives.             This is what the\n\nstatute requires where it applies.          But, just as was true with\n\nnational standard 8, there is no requirement as to the amount of\n\ndetail with which specific comments need to be discussed and\n\ncertainly no obligation to treat every element of a plan as a\n\nseparate alternative.\n\n           Here, as with national standard 8, a rule of reason\n\napplies.   See Associated Fisheries of Me., 127 F.3d at 116.2 The\n\nagency's obligation is simply to make a reasonable good faith\n\neffort to address comments and alternatives.           Id.; accord Alenco\n\nCommunications, Inc. v. FCC,        201 F.3d 608, 625 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\nAnd, where the agency has addressed a range of comments and\n\nconsidered a set of alternatives to the proposal adopted, the\n\nburden is upon the critic to show why a brief response on one set\n\nof comments or the failure to analyze one element as a separate\n\nalternative condemns the effort.\n\n           In   this   case,   we   have   assumed   for   the   purpose   of\n\nstanding, if nothing else, that the boundary shift probably has\n\n\n\n     2\n      Although our discussion in Associated Fisheries of Maine,\nInc., focused on the Regulatory Flexibility Act as it stood before\nseveral amendments regarding judicial review under the Act, nothing\nin those amendments has changed our approach here.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fsome impact on the appellants; but Little Bay has not pointed to\n\nany facts as to show a dramatic impact of the boundary line shift\n\nor any facts that undermine the original reasons proffered for the\n\nshift or any other reason why the response was inadequate or the\n\nboundary   line   shift   required   consideration   as   a   separate\n\nalternative. Absent some discussion of such considerations, we can\n\nhardly hold the agency acted unreasonably or in bad faith by\n\nproceeding as it did.\n\n           In the same section of the brief, Little Bay says that\n\nthe district judge was mistaken in expressing doubts whether the\n\nRegulatory Flexibility statute applied at all in this case.        The\n\ndistrict court did say that because small businesses are the main\n\nsubject of the new regime, there was little chance that the agency\n\nanalysis would overlook small businesses. But as neither he nor we\n\nhave rested on such a theory to avoid application of the statute,\n\nit is beside the point on this appeal.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f",

For convenience, we refer to the appellants collectively as \"Little Bay\" in describing the claims presented on appeal and assume familiarity with earlier decisions cited below setting forth the legal and factual background in great detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal regulations in question govern lobster catches in the so-called exclusive economic zone (\"the EEZ\") &#8212; an area of federal jurisdiction extending from 3 to 200 nautical miles seaward of the U.S. coastline. <i>Ace Lobster Co., Inc. v. Evans,</i> 165 F.Supp.2d. 148, 152 n. 3 (D.R.I.2001). State governments regulate the first three miles seaward of their coastline and the federal government regulates beyond that limit to the outer boundary of the zone. <i>Id.</i> The legal framework and regulatory history are peculiarly complicated, but only a nutshell description is needed to set the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act (\"the Magnuson-Stevens Act\"), 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1801-1883 (2000), was adopted to conserve and manage fishery resources. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1801(b)(1) (2000); <i>Campanale &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Evans,</i> 311 F.3d 109, 110 (1st Cir.2002). Regional fishery management councils, including federal and state officials and others, were authorized to adopt for each fishery requiring conservation a fishery management plan, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1801(b)(4),(5) (2000); <i>Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 111; and the statute provided for the Secretary of Commerce (\"the Secretary\") to adopt implementing regulations based on notice and comment rule-making if the plan was consistent with a set of \"national standards\" set forth in the statute. 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1851(a), 1854(a)(1)(A) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">East coast lobsters are such an endangered fishery, and in 1978 a group of east coast states proposed a plan for both state and federal waters. In 1983, the pertinent regional council under the Magnuson-Stevens Act &#8212; the New England Fishery Management Council (\"the Council\") &#8212; adopted a fishery management plan for lobsters that was later implemented by the federal National Marine Fisheries Service. Nevertheless, 10 years later a study revealed that Northeast lobsters were dangerously overfished. In December 1993 the Council circulated a draft amendment proposing that four areas be designated in the EEZ and subjecting each to different restrictions (<i>e.g.,</i> trap limits) aimed at rebuilding stocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counterpart regulations were adopted by the Secretary in the spring of 1994. 59 Fed.Reg. 26,454 (May 20, 1994) (codified at 50 C.F.R. &#167; 649.20 (1995), subsequently repealed effective Jan. 5, 2000); 59 Fed. Reg. 31,938 (June 21, 1994) (codified at 50 C.F.R. &#167; 649.42(b) (1995), subsequently repealed effective Jan. 5, 2000). The four new management areas included two areas in the federal waters of the gulf of Maine: area 1 starting three miles offshore and area 3 adjacent to area 1 but lying seaward of it. 59 Fed.Reg. at 31,950-51. The line separating the two areas, sometimes called the Dick Allen line, lay about 30 miles off the coast. The restrictions on lobster traps in area 1 have been more stringent than those applying in area 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Congress in 1993 had adopted the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (\"Atlantic Coastal Act\"). 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5101-5108 (2000). This statute chartered an Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (\"the Commission\") comprising representatives of states from Maine to Florida. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5102(3), (13) (2000). The Commission's direct concern is with mobile Atlantic coast fisheries within state waters, but in the absence of regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Secretary can adopt for EEZ waters a plan compatible with one adopted by the Commission for state waters. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b)(1) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves such a plan under the new statute. The new plan began life as a proposed amendment to the existing plan; but, along the way, prompted by further pessimistic studies in 1996, the federal National Marine Fisheries Service proposed that the Magnuson-Stevens Act regulations be withdrawn and that new regulations be adopted under the authority of the new statute if and when a suitable state-waters plan was adopted by the Commission. <i>Ace Lobster,</i> 165 F.Supp.2d. at 157.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1997, the Commission sought comments on its so-called amendment 3. This plan included among other things more stringent limits on the number of lobster traps in areas 1 and 3. In September 1997, after further public hearings, the Commission's lobster management board voted to alter amendment 3 to move the boundary line between area 1 and area 3 from 30 to 50 miles offshore. The alteration enlarged area 1, the area subject to most stringent limits, thereby disadvantaging anyone who had sought lobsters within the area lying between the old line and the one now proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission approved amendment 3 with the revised boundary line between areas 1 and 3 in December 1997. In March 1998, National Marine Fisheries Service issued a draft environmental impact statement (\"EIS\"), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4321-4370d (2000), evaluating new alternatives for lobster regulation in federal waters; one of the alternatives was amendment 3. A number of hearings on the draft EIS were held including one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in May 1998, and written comments were received including one from Little Bay itself attacking the shift from the Dick Allen line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1999, a proposed federal rule was published implementing amendment 3 for federal waters, 64 Fed.Reg. 2,708 (proposed January 15, 1999), and public comments were received including several pertaining to the new line. A final EIS was issued in May 1999, noting that amendment 3 had the most support of all the alternatives under consideration. The final EIS included a final regulatory flexibility analysis, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 601-612 (2000), concluding that those using lobster traps would be impacted in the short-run but that the benefits of rebuilding stocks outweighed the harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued final regulations, 64 Fed.Reg. 68,228 (Dec. 6, 1999) (codified at 50 C.F.R. Part 697) which were adopted by the Secretary pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b) (2000). These regulations implemented amendment 3 for federal waters including the new stricter trap limits and the shift of the Dick Allen line. In early January 2000, Little Bay and a number of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, lobster boat operators brought suit in the federal district court against the Secretary to challenge the new regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An action of this kind, framed as a declaratory judgment proceeding, is in effect a suit for review of agency action ordinarily based on the administrative record. <i>See Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 115; <i>Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,</i> 170 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.1999). After extensive proceedings, the district court on May 16, 2002, granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary, and this appeal followed. Our review of the district court decision is <i>de novo, Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries,</i> 170 F.3d at 28. What standard we and the district court both apply to the agency's own decisions varies with the issue. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most prominent issue on appeal concerns one of the requirements the Secretary had to meet before adopting the regulations. The Atlantic Coastal Act requires <i>inter alia</i> that federal regulations adapting the Commission plan for use in the federal EEZ (1) follow \"consultation with the appropriate [Regional] Councils,\" and (2) be consistent with the national standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b)(1) (2000). Here, Little Bay claims, the failure to consult is established by our intervening decision in <i>Campanale &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

The district court rebuffed the attacks but a divided panel of this court held that the Secretary had violated his obligation to consult with the Council. <i>Id.</i> at 121. The court declined to say that the error had been harmless, ruling that this inquiry was \"a factual one ... best undertaken initially by the district court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 120 n. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Campanale</i> was decided after the district court in our own case had sustained summary judgment for the Secretary. In <i>Campanale,</i> the court acknowledged that the Secretary had advised the Council of the proposed trap limits through the draft EIS's alternatives and had gotten comments back from the council. The <i>Campanale</i> panel held this to be inadequate at least where the Secretary did not tell the Council that this was its statutory consultation opportunity. <i>Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 117-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably, the Secretary might have \"consulted\" with the Council on one issue (the line) but not another (the trap limits); but in our case, the Secretary has not sought to distinguish <i>Campanale</i> by arguing that consultation met the letter of the statute. Rather, he argues that the Council knew what was being proposed and that &#8212; at least as to the line shift &#8212; the surrounding circumstances show that a more formal process of consultation would not have altered the result. This is a standard harmless error argument, fully available in administrative matters. <i>Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA,</i> 269 F.3d 49, 61-62 (1st Cir.2001); <i>accord Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 120 n. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Campanale</i> the court chose to leave this harmless error issue to the district court on remand but there is no need for us to do so. Although the harmless error inquiry is in one sense a \"factual\" one, it is ordinarily resolved not with new evidence but by reasoned conjecture as to what would have happened \"if\" a particular error had not occurred. Here, forewarned by <i>Campanale,</i> Little Bay and the government have briefed the prejudice issue relying upon materials in the administrative record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal question is whether the Secretary's decision to shift the boundary line would have been altered if he had engaged in the more formal consultation with the Council called for by <i>Campanale.</i> Little Bay argues that the Council had devised the line and had expert knowledge; that such consultation would have provided Little Bay with an opportunity to appear before the Council and argue against the shift; and that the shift prejudices it by imposing more stringent regulation on a large area in which Little Bay operates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary says that there is no proof that Little Bay will be disadvantaged by the new line, but we will assume <i>arguendo</i> the contrary. There is apparently no dispute that the appellant fishermen have operated in the EEZ in areas 1 and 3 and that the shift in the area 1 boundary line seaward by a substantial amount will restrict more severely operations in the very large area transferred from area 3 to area 1. That this will adversely impact the appellants appears a natural inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this, of course, does not show prejudice of the kind that concerns us. The Secretary knew full well that the new restrictions would cause short-term harm to fishermen &#8212; harm that would be counterbalanced in the Secretary's view by the long-term benefits to everyone of rebuilding lobster fisheries for the future. 64 Fed.Reg. 2,708, 2,712 (proposed January 15, 1999). The question is whether anything that formal consultation with the Council would have brought about would have been likely to change the Secretary's position. And on this issue, based on the arguments presented, everything points the Secretary's way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overall reason for the shift of the line, needless to say, was to protect more lobsters; but this was underpinned by a fairly technical judgment by the Commission and its Lobster Management Board. The record indicates that the new line was deemed to have a series of advantages:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; to make the boundary lines compatible with stock assessment boundaries and produce more accurate stock assessments and evaluation of each area's management measures;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; to extend the existing area 1 size limits aimed at protecting the larger, more fruitful lobsters from area 1 to area 1 lobsters that tended to breed in the nearby reaches of area 3;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; to simplify compliance by fishermen because the boundary lines would now be more consistent with the boundary lines in other fisheries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay's brief says virtually nothing about what it might have said to the Council to counter this reasoning. Nor does it suggest anything that the Council would have been likely to say to the Secretary that would likely have led the Secretary to alter his reliance on the Commission's judgment that the line should be moved. Absent such specifics, there is no reason to think that consultation would have produced a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Council was informally involved in the new plan and commented on it to the Secretary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Further, the Secretary held public hearings, including one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the draft EIS containing the boundary shift as one option. Little Bay itself submitted comments to the Secretary on the issue. And there is no reason why Little Bay could not have sought to enlist the support of the Council if it thought it could gain such support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the burden of proof as to prejudice lies with Little Bay, <i>First Am. Disc. Corp. v. CFTC,</i> 222 F.3d 1008, 1015 (D.C.Cir.2000), the substantive standard for harmless error tends to favor the objecting party. <i>See, e.g., Moulton v. Rival Co.,</i> 116 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1997) (\"highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case\"). Here, however, nothing suggests that the result was affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay's next set of arguments are directed to its claim that the Secretary failed to meet a second condition for adopting regulations under the Atlantic Coastal Act, namely, that the regulations conform to the national standards set forth in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b)(1)(B) (2000). Little Bay says that the adoption of the new boundary line violates national standards 2, 4, and 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National standard 2 provides that a fishery management plan and regulations to implement it must, in respect of conservation and management measures, be \"based upon the best scientific information available.\" 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(2) (2000). A regulation broadly defines the phrase \"scientific information\" to include scientific, economic and social information. 50 C.F.R. &#167; 600.315(b)(1) (2002). Little Bay says that the Secretary failed to present \"any scientific analysis or reasoning\" to support the shift in the boundary line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay concedes that there is ample support for the conclusion that lobster stocks off the Atlantic coast are in peril and that new measures are urgently needed. And it does not directly dispute that moving the line seaward will restrict lobster catches by imposing the more restrictive area 1 regime over a wider area (indeed, its claim of prejudice rests on the inference that catches will be restricted). Nor does it say, or at least argue in any detail, that the inference is not \"scientific\" enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Little Bay argues tersely that it is the <i>net effect</i> that matters and the Secretary failed to consider that the expansion of area 1 would mean more lobsters caught in area 1. At first this appears to be a specious objection: expanding area 1 seaward means that trapping in what was previously part of area 3 is now occurring with more severe restrictions in the same territory now renamed area 1. But Little Bay then refers summarily to \"requirements recently adopted which require a showing of historic participation in order to fish in area 3.\" Little Bay is referring, we take it, to 68 Fed.Reg. 14,902 (Mar. 27, 2003), limiting fishing in areas 3, 4, and 5 to those permit holders that can establish historical participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably the interaction of two changes could produce a net negative effect on conservation, but Little Bay offers no developed argument of such a threat here. If the implication is that the recent regulation may force some fishermen from area 3 to the richer (albeit more restricted) area 1, this sounds like an attack simply upon the \"recently adopted\" historical participation requirements. At best, it is an undeveloped claim that a new step &#8212; taken after the challenged regulation was adopted &#8212; undermines its rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, the claim still fails. Presumptively an agency decision is reviewed on the record, <i>Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion,</i> 470 U.S. 729, 743, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985); <i>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</i> 401 U.S. 402, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); and while rare circumstances might encourage a reviewing court to look at later developments (<i>e.g.,</i> if both proposals were developed in tandem), nothing of the kind is alleged in this case. Further, even if the \"historic participation\" requirement were part of the very regulations at issue, Little Bay says nothing beyond one speculative sentence to suggest a likelihood of its undermining the benefits of the new line, and that alone is fatal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay next invokes national standard 4 which requires that any action that \"allocate[s] or assign[s] fishing privileges among the various U.S. fishermen\" shall meet various tests, including a requirement that it be \"fair and equitable to all such fishermen.\" 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(4) (2000). The regulations say that an allocation means a \"direct and deliberate distribution\" of fishing privileges and not management measures that have \"incidental allocative effects.\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 600.325(c)(1) (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Secretary, and the district court, that the boundary line shift is not such a direct allocation. Nothing in the shift, or the other concurrent changes, prevents fisherman from operating in areas 1 or 3 or both. To the extent that Little Bay thinks that the \"historic participation\" limitations later adopted for area 3 do effect such an allocation &#8212; a matter on which we express no view &#8212; it is challenging the wrong regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay's last attack is based on national standard 8 which, so far as pertinent, requires the Secretary in adopting restrictions to take account of the interests of local fishing communities and, \"to the extent practicable\" and consistent with conservation goals, to minimize the adverse economic impact. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(8) (2000). Little Bay does not deny the draft EIS discussed various alternative conservation measures and the impacts on local communities; but it says that there was no <i>separate</i> assessment of the effects on its local community of moving the boundary line. This appears to be true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the required analysis of alternatives and impacts is subject to a rule of reason, for study could go on forever. <i>See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 110-111 (1st Cir. 1997); <i>cf. Roosevelt Campobello Int'l Park Com'n v. EPA,</i> 684 F.2d 1041, 1047 (1st Cir.1982). This is especially so where, as here, a plan comprises a set of new or changed restrictions designed to work as a whole; a rule that every element in such a plan be assessed separately to determine its own individual impact would be unworkable for most complex plans could be subdivided almost without end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the shifting of the boundary &#8212; although quite likely to have some economic impact on some fishermen &#8212; was peculiarly hard to quantify: the impact depends <i>both</i> on the interaction of the boundary shift with other regulatory measures (<i>e.g.,</i> changes in trap limits) and on the differing fishing strategies (choice of area, number of traps) that different fishermen may choose to adopt in response to the new changes &#8212; strategies that may alter over time and are not within the Secretary's control. <i>See</i> 64 Fed.Reg. 68,228, 68,235-36 (Dec. 6, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no mechanical way to say when enough is enough. About the best a court can do is to ask whether the Secretary has examined the impacts of, and alternatives to, the plan he ultimately adopts and whether a challenged failure to carry the analysis further is clearly unreasonable, taking account of the usual considerations (<i>e.g.,</i> whether information is available and whether the further analysis is likely to be determinative). In this gray area, some burden lies on the contestant to show why a particular gap or omission is unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the basic obligation to assess the impacts of, and alternatives to, the adopted plan as a whole was achieved. The feasibility of fruitfully analyzing the boundary shift in isolation is unclear; and given the independent technical reasons for the shift, it appears to follow naturally from the decision to adopt the new management area scheme &#8212; a choice that was the subject of full scale study. Accordingly, there was no failure to meet national standard 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discussion of national standard 8 also disposes, in substance, of the final objection offered by Little Bay based on a quite different statute: the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 601-612 (2000). This statute does not alter the substantive mission of the agencies under their own statutes; rather, the Act creates procedural obligations to assure that the special concerns of small entities are given attention in the comment and analysis process when the agency undertakes rule-makings that affect small entities. <i>Associated Fisheries of Me.,</i> 127 F.3d at 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regime at issue in this case unquestionably affects a substantial number of small businesses; most, if not all, of the affected fishing is done by such entities. Therefore, as required by the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 603(a) (2000), the Service prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis as to the impact on small entities in conjunction with the proposal for rulemaking; and, when it adopted the final regime, it included a final statement addressed to the subject. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a) (2000). This much is common ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute also specifies what the final statement must cover, and in compliance with its terms the final statement in this case described the range of small businesses affected and the estimated magnitude of the effects, summarized comments on the proposed rule and the response of the agency to the comments, addressed record-keeping burdens incident to the new regime, and discussed the reasons for the regime adopted and the reasons for preferring it to other alternatives. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a) (2000); <i>see Associated Fisheries of Me.,</i> 127 F.3d at 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a short final section of its brief, Little Bay offers several different criticisms of the agency's compliance, but the core of the main argument is this: that the agency gave very little separate attention to comments regarding the change in the boundary line and, above all, \"[n]o analysis was conducted to determine whether an alternative boundary line would have minimized the economic impact upon the [a]ppellants or others similarly situated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly the final statement did little more than acknowledge that \"several commentators\" had objected to the change in the boundary line and responded by referring to the \"current consensus\" in support of the new regime as a whole, 64 Fed.Reg. at 68,235; and the agency certainly did not separately analyze the new regime by comparing as two separate alternatives the new regime with the boundary shift and without it. The question is whether the Regulatory Flexibility Act required more and we conclude, in the context of this case, that it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency's final statement adopting the new regime, together with materials cross-referenced in it, set forth in detail the reasons for adopting the new regime as a whole and the reasons for preferring it to a series of alternatives. This is what the statute requires where it applies. But, just as was true with national standard 8, there is no requirement as to the amount of detail with which specific comments need to be discussed and certainly no obligation to treat every element of a plan as a separate alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as with national standard 8, a rule of reason applies. <i>See Associated Fisheries of Me.,</i> 127 F.3d at 116.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The agency's obligation is simply to make a reasonable good faith effort to address comments and alternatives. <i>Id.; accord Alenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC,</i> 201 F.3d 608, 625 (5th Cir.2000). And, where the agency has addressed a range of comments and considered a set of alternatives to the proposal adopted, the burden is upon the critic to show why a brief response on one set of comments or the failure to analyze one element as a separate alternative condemns the effort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we have assumed for the purpose of standing, if nothing else, that the boundary shift probably has <i>some</i> impact on the appellants; but Little Bay has not pointed to any facts as to show a dramatic impact of the boundary line shift or any facts that undermine the original reasons proffered for the shift or any other reason why the response was inadequate or the boundary line shift required consideration as a separate alternative. Absent some discussion of such considerations, we can hardly hold the agency acted unreasonably or in bad faith by proceeding as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same section of the brief, Little Bay says that the district judge was mistaken in expressing doubts whether the Regulatory Flexibility statute applied at all in this case. The district court did say that because small businesses are the main subject of the new regime, there was little chance that the agency analysis would overlook small businesses. But as neither he nor we have rested on such a theory to avoid application of the statute, it is beside the point on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to interchange of written communications, there was also a significant number of opportunities for Council members to express their views in person.

Evans,</i> 165 F.Supp.2d. 148, 152 n. 3 (D.R.I.2001). State governments regulate the first three miles seaward of their coastline and the federal government regulates beyond that limit to the outer boundary of the zone. <i>Id.</i> The legal framework and regulatory history are peculiarly complicated, but only a nutshell description is needed to set the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act (\"the Magnuson-Stevens Act\"), 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1801-1883 (2000), was adopted to conserve and manage fishery resources. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1801(b)(1) (2000); <i>Campanale &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

Regional fishery management councils, including federal and state officials and others, were authorized to adopt for each fishery requiring conservation a fishery management plan, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1801(b)(4),(5) (2000); <i>Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 111; and the statute provided for the Secretary of Commerce (\"the Secretary\") to adopt implementing regulations based on notice and comment rule-making if the plan was consistent with a set of \"national standards\" set forth in the statute. 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1851(a), 1854(a)(1)(A) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">East coast lobsters are such an endangered fishery, and in 1978 a group of east coast states proposed a plan for both state and federal waters. In 1983, the pertinent regional council under the Magnuson-Stevens Act &#8212; the New England Fishery Management Council (\"the Council\") &#8212; adopted a fishery management plan for lobsters that was later implemented by the federal National Marine Fisheries Service. Nevertheless, 10 years later a study revealed that Northeast lobsters were dangerously overfished. In December 1993 the Council circulated a draft amendment proposing that four areas be designated in the EEZ and subjecting each to different restrictions (<i>e.g.,</i> trap limits) aimed at rebuilding stocks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counterpart regulations were adopted by the Secretary in the spring of 1994. 59 Fed.Reg. 26,454 (May 20, 1994) (codified at 50 C.F.R. &#167; 649.20 (1995), subsequently repealed effective Jan. 5, 2000); 59 Fed. Reg. 31,938 (June 21, 1994) (codified at 50 C.F.R. &#167; 649.42(b) (1995), subsequently repealed effective Jan. 5, 2000). The four new management areas included two areas in the federal waters of the gulf of Maine: area 1 starting three miles offshore and area 3 adjacent to area 1 but lying seaward of it. 59 Fed.Reg. at 31,950-51. The line separating the two areas, sometimes called the Dick Allen line, lay about 30 miles off the coast. The restrictions on lobster traps in area 1 have been more stringent than those applying in area 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Congress in 1993 had adopted the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (\"Atlantic Coastal Act\"). 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5101-5108 (2000). This statute chartered an Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (\"the Commission\") comprising representatives of states from Maine to Florida. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5102(3), (13) (2000). The Commission's direct concern is with mobile Atlantic coast fisheries within state waters, but in the absence of regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Secretary can adopt for EEZ waters a plan compatible with one adopted by the Commission for state waters. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b)(1) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves such a plan under the new statute. The new plan began life as a proposed amendment to the existing plan; but, along the way, prompted by further pessimistic studies in 1996, the federal National Marine Fisheries Service proposed that the Magnuson-Stevens Act regulations be withdrawn and that new regulations be adopted under the authority of the new statute if and when a suitable state-waters plan was adopted by the Commission. <i>Ace Lobster,</i> 165 F.Supp.2d. at 157.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1997, the Commission sought comments on its so-called amendment 3. This plan included among other things more stringent limits on the number of lobster traps in areas 1 and 3. In September 1997, after further public hearings, the Commission's lobster management board voted to alter amendment 3 to move the boundary line between area 1 and area 3 from 30 to 50 miles offshore. The alteration enlarged area 1, the area subject to most stringent limits, thereby disadvantaging anyone who had sought lobsters within the area lying between the old line and the one now proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission approved amendment 3 with the revised boundary line between areas 1 and 3 in December 1997. In March 1998, National Marine Fisheries Service issued a draft environmental impact statement (\"EIS\"), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4321-4370d (2000), evaluating new alternatives for lobster regulation in federal waters; one of the alternatives was amendment 3. A number of hearings on the draft EIS were held including one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in May 1998, and written comments were received including one from Little Bay itself attacking the shift from the Dick Allen line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1999, a proposed federal rule was published implementing amendment 3 for federal waters, 64 Fed.Reg. 2,708 (proposed January 15, 1999), and public comments were received including several pertaining to the new line. A final EIS was issued in May 1999, noting that amendment 3 had the most support of all the alternatives under consideration. The final EIS included a final regulatory flexibility analysis, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 601-612 (2000), concluding that those using lobster traps would be impacted in the short-run but that the benefits of rebuilding stocks outweighed the harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued final regulations, 64 Fed.Reg. 68,228 (Dec. 6, 1999) (codified at 50 C.F.R. Part 697) which were adopted by the Secretary pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b) (2000). These regulations implemented amendment 3 for federal waters including the new stricter trap limits and the shift of the Dick Allen line. In early January 2000, Little Bay and a number of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, lobster boat operators brought suit in the federal district court against the Secretary to challenge the new regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An action of this kind, framed as a declaratory judgment proceeding, is in effect a suit for review of agency action ordinarily based on the administrative record. <i>See Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 115; <i>Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries v. Daley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198334\"><a href=\"/opinion/198334/commonwealth-v-daley-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1999). After extensive proceedings, the district court on May 16, 2002, granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary, and this appeal followed. Our review of the district court decision is <i>de novo, Massachusetts ex rel. Div. of Marine Fisheries,</i> 170 F.3d at 28. What standard we and the district court both apply to the agency's own decisions varies with the issue. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most prominent issue on appeal concerns one of the requirements the Secretary had to meet before adopting the regulations. The Atlantic Coastal Act requires <i>inter alia</i> that federal regulations adapting the Commission plan for use in the federal EEZ (1) follow \"consultation with the appropriate [Regional] Councils,\" and (2) be consistent with the national standards of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b)(1) (2000). Here, Little Bay claims, the failure to consult is established by our intervening decision in <i>Campanale &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Evans.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That case, like this one, involved amendment 3 and the December 1999 regulations implementing the plan for the EEZ, but the plaintiffs were Rhode Island fishermen concerned with the numerical limits on traps. <i>Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 115. The district court rebuffed the attacks but a divided panel of this court held that the Secretary had violated his obligation to consult with the Council. <i>Id.</i> at 121. The court declined to say that the error had been harmless, ruling that this inquiry was \"a factual one ... best undertaken initially by the district court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 120 n. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Campanale</i> was decided after the district court in our own case had sustained summary judgment for the Secretary. In <i>Campanale,</i> the court acknowledged that the Secretary had advised the Council of the proposed trap limits through the draft EIS's alternatives and had gotten comments back from the council. The <i>Campanale</i> panel held this to be inadequate at least where the Secretary did not tell the Council that this was its statutory consultation opportunity. <i>Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 117-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably, the Secretary might have \"consulted\" with the Council on one issue (the line) but not another (the trap limits); but in our case, the Secretary has not sought to distinguish <i>Campanale</i> by arguing that consultation met the letter of the statute. Rather, he argues that the Council knew what was being proposed and that &#8212; at least as to the line shift &#8212; the surrounding circumstances show that a more formal process of consultation would not have altered the result. This is a standard harmless error argument, fully available in administrative matters. <i>Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. FAA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199641\"><a href=\"/opinion/199641/save-our-heritage-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 61-62 (1st Cir.2001); <i>accord Campanale,</i> 311 F.3d at 120 n. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Campanale</i> the court chose to leave this harmless error issue to the district court on remand but there is no need for us to do so. Although the harmless error inquiry is in one sense a \"factual\" one, it is ordinarily resolved not with new evidence but by reasoned conjecture as to what would have happened \"if\" a particular error had not occurred. Here, forewarned by <i>Campanale,</i> Little Bay and the government have briefed the prejudice issue relying upon materials in the administrative record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal question is whether the Secretary's decision to shift the boundary line would have been altered if he had engaged in the more formal consultation with the Council called for by <i>Campanale.</i> Little Bay argues that the Council had devised the line and had expert knowledge; that such consultation would have provided Little Bay with an opportunity to appear before the Council and argue against the shift; and that the shift prejudices it by imposing more stringent regulation on a large area in which Little Bay operates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary says that there is no proof that Little Bay will be disadvantaged by the new line, but we will assume <i>arguendo</i> the contrary. There is apparently no dispute that the appellant fishermen have operated in the EEZ in areas 1 and 3 and that the shift in the area 1 boundary line seaward by a substantial amount will restrict more severely operations in the very large area transferred from area 3 to area 1. That this will adversely impact the appellants appears a natural inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this, of course, does not show prejudice of the kind that concerns us. The Secretary knew full well that the new restrictions would cause short-term harm to fishermen &#8212; harm that would be counterbalanced in the Secretary's view by the long-term benefits to everyone of rebuilding lobster fisheries for the future. 64 Fed.Reg. 2,708, 2,712 (proposed January 15, 1999). The question is whether anything that formal consultation with the Council would have brought about would have been likely to change the Secretary's position. And on this issue, based on the arguments presented, everything points the Secretary's way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overall reason for the shift of the line, needless to say, was to protect more lobsters; but this was underpinned by a fairly technical judgment by the Commission and its Lobster Management Board. The record indicates that the new line was deemed to have a series of advantages:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; to make the boundary lines compatible with stock assessment boundaries and produce more accurate stock assessments and evaluation of each area's management measures;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; to extend the existing area 1 size limits aimed at protecting the larger, more fruitful lobsters from area 1 to area 1 lobsters that tended to breed in the nearby reaches of area 3;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; to simplify compliance by fishermen because the boundary lines would now be more consistent with the boundary lines in other fisheries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay's brief says virtually nothing about what it might have said to the Council to counter this reasoning. Nor does it suggest anything that the Council would have been likely to say to the Secretary that would likely have led the Secretary to alter his reliance on the Commission's judgment that the line should be moved. Absent such specifics, there is no reason to think that consultation would have produced a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Council was informally involved in the new plan and commented on it to the Secretary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Further, the Secretary held public hearings, including one in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the draft EIS containing the boundary shift as one option. Little Bay itself submitted comments to the Secretary on the issue. And there is no reason why Little Bay could not have sought to enlist the support of the Council if it thought it could gain such support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the burden of proof as to prejudice lies with Little Bay, <i>First Am. Disc. Corp. v. CFTC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769921\"><a href=\"/opinion/769921/first-american-discount-corporation-v-commodity-futures-trading-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1008</span></a></span>, 1015 (D.C.Cir.2000), the substantive standard for harmless error tends to favor the objecting party. <i>See, e.g., Moulton v. Rival Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741905\"><a href=\"/opinion/741905/prodliabrep-cch-p-14989-christopher-moulton-v-the-rival-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1997) (\"highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case\"). Here, however, nothing suggests that the result was affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay's next set of arguments are directed to its claim that the Secretary failed to meet a second condition for adopting regulations under the Atlantic Coastal Act, namely, that the regulations conform to the national standards set forth in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5103(b)(1)(B) (2000). Little Bay says that the adoption of the new boundary line violates national standards 2, 4, and 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National standard 2 provides that a fishery management plan and regulations to implement it must, in respect of conservation and management measures, be \"based upon the best scientific information available.\" 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(2) (2000). A regulation broadly defines the phrase \"scientific information\" to include scientific, economic and social information. 50 C.F.R. &#167; 600.315(b)(1) (2002). Little Bay says that the Secretary failed to present \"any scientific analysis or reasoning\" to support the shift in the boundary line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay concedes that there is ample support for the conclusion that lobster stocks off the Atlantic coast are in peril and that new measures are urgently needed. And it does not directly dispute that moving the line seaward will restrict lobster catches by imposing the more restrictive area 1 regime over a wider area (indeed, its claim of prejudice rests on the inference that catches will be restricted). Nor does it say, or at least argue in any detail, that the inference is not \"scientific\" enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Little Bay argues tersely that it is the <i>net effect</i> that matters and the Secretary failed to consider that the expansion of area 1 would mean more lobsters caught in area 1. At first this appears to be a specious objection: expanding area 1 seaward means that trapping in what was previously part of area 3 is now occurring with more severe restrictions in the same territory now renamed area 1. But Little Bay then refers summarily to \"requirements recently adopted which require a showing of historic participation in order to fish in area 3.\" Little Bay is referring, we take it, to 68 Fed.Reg. 14,902 (Mar. 27, 2003), limiting fishing in areas 3, 4, and 5 to those permit holders that can establish historical participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably the interaction of two changes could produce a net negative effect on conservation, but Little Bay offers no developed argument of such a threat here. If the implication is that the recent regulation may force some fishermen from area 3 to the richer (albeit more restricted) area 1, this sounds like an attack simply upon the \"recently adopted\" historical participation requirements. At best, it is an undeveloped claim that a new step &#8212; taken after the challenged regulation was adopted &#8212; undermines its rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, the claim still fails. Presumptively an agency decision is reviewed on the record, <i>Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Further, even if the \"historic participation\" requirement were part of the very regulations at issue, Little Bay says nothing beyond one speculative sentence to suggest a likelihood of its undermining the benefits of the new line, and that alone is fatal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay next invokes national standard 4 which requires that any action that \"allocate[s] or assign[s] fishing privileges among the various U.S. fishermen\" shall meet various tests, including a requirement that it be \"fair and equitable to all such fishermen.\" 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(4) (2000). The regulations say that an allocation means a \"direct and deliberate distribution\" of fishing privileges and not management measures that have \"incidental allocative effects.\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 600.325(c)(1) (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Secretary, and the district court, that the boundary line shift is not such a direct allocation. Nothing in the shift, or the other concurrent changes, prevents fisherman from operating in areas 1 or 3 or both. To the extent that Little Bay thinks that the \"historic participation\" limitations later adopted for area 3 do effect such an allocation &#8212; a matter on which we express no view &#8212; it is challenging the wrong regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little Bay's last attack is based on national standard 8 which, so far as pertinent, requires the Secretary in adopting restrictions to take account of the interests of local fishing communities and, \"to the extent practicable\" and consistent with conservation goals, to minimize the adverse economic impact. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1851(a)(8) (2000). Little Bay does not deny the draft EIS discussed various alternative conservation measures and the impacts on local communities; but it says that there was no <i>separate</i> assessment of the effects on its local community of moving the boundary line. This appears to be true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the required analysis of alternatives and impacts is subject to a rule of reason, for study could go on forever. <i>See Associated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197563\"><a href=\"/opinion/197563/associated-fisheries-v-us-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 110-111 (1st Cir. 1997); <i>cf.

This is especially so where, as here, a plan comprises a set of new or changed restrictions designed to work as a whole; a rule that every element in such a plan be assessed separately to determine its own individual impact would be unworkable for most complex plans could be subdivided almost without end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the shifting of the boundary &#8212; although quite likely to have some economic impact on some fishermen &#8212; was peculiarly hard to quantify: the impact depends <i>both</i> on the interaction of the boundary shift with other regulatory measures (<i>e.g.,</i> changes in trap limits) and on the differing fishing strategies (choice of area, number of traps) that different fishermen may choose to adopt in response to the new changes &#8212; strategies that may alter over time and are not within the Secretary's control. <i>See</i> 64 Fed.Reg. 68,228, 68,235-36 (Dec. 6, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no mechanical way to say when enough is enough. About the best a court can do is to ask whether the Secretary has examined the impacts of, and alternatives to, the plan he ultimately adopts and whether a challenged failure to carry the analysis further is clearly unreasonable, taking account of the usual considerations (<i>e.g.,</i> whether information is available and whether the further analysis is likely to be determinative). In this gray area, some burden lies on the contestant to show why a particular gap or omission is unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the basic obligation to assess the impacts of, and alternatives to, the adopted plan as a whole was achieved. The feasibility of fruitfully analyzing the boundary shift in isolation is unclear; and given the independent technical reasons for the shift, it appears to follow naturally from the decision to adopt the new management area scheme &#8212; a choice that was the subject of full scale study. Accordingly, there was no failure to meet national standard 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discussion of national standard 8 also disposes, in substance, of the final objection offered by Little Bay based on a quite different statute: the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 601-612 (2000). This statute does not alter the substantive mission of the agencies under their own statutes; rather, the Act creates procedural obligations to assure that the special concerns of small entities are given attention in the comment and analysis process when the agency undertakes rule-makings that affect small entities. <i>Associated Fisheries of Me.,</i> 127 F.3d at 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regime at issue in this case unquestionably affects a substantial number of small businesses; most, if not all, of the affected fishing is done by such entities. Therefore, as required by the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 603(a) (2000), the Service prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis as to the impact on small entities in conjunction with the proposal for rulemaking; and, when it adopted the final regime, it included a final statement addressed to the subject. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a) (2000). This much is common ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute also specifies what the final statement must cover, and in compliance with its terms the final statement in this case described the range of small businesses affected and the estimated magnitude of the effects, summarized comments on the proposed rule and the response of the agency to the comments, addressed record-keeping burdens incident to the new regime, and discussed the reasons for the regime adopted and the reasons for preferring it to other alternatives. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 604(a) (2000); <i>see Associated Fisheries of Me.,</i> 127 F.3d at 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a short final section of its brief, Little Bay offers several different criticisms of the agency's compliance, but the core of the main argument is this: that the agency gave very little separate attention to comments regarding the change in the boundary line and, above all, \"[n]o analysis was conducted to determine whether an alternative boundary line would have minimized the economic impact upon the [a]ppellants or others similarly situated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly the final statement did little more than acknowledge that \"several commentators\" had objected to the change in the boundary line and responded by referring to the \"current consensus\" in support of the new regime as a whole, 64 Fed.Reg. at 68,235; and the agency certainly did not separately analyze the new regime by comparing as two separate alternatives the new regime with the boundary shift and without it. The question is whether the Regulatory Flexibility Act required more and we conclude, in the context of this case, that it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency's final statement adopting the new regime, together with materials cross-referenced in it, set forth in detail the reasons for adopting the new regime as a whole and the reasons for preferring it to a series of alternatives. This is what the statute requires where it applies. But, just as was true with national standard 8, there is no requirement as to the amount of detail with which specific comments need to be discussed and certainly no obligation to treat every element of a plan as a separate alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as with national standard 8, a rule of reason applies. <i>See Associated Fisheries of Me.,</i> 127 F.3d at 116.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The agency's obligation is simply to make a reasonable good faith effort to address comments and alternatives. <i>Id.; accord Alenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"19816\"><a href=\"/opinion/19816/alenco-comm-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>, 625 (5th Cir.2000). And, where the agency has addressed a range of comments and considered a set of alternatives to the proposal adopted, the burden is upon the critic to show why a brief response on one set of comments or the failure to analyze one element as a separate alternative condemns the effort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we have assumed for the purpose of standing, if nothing else, that the boundary shift probably has <i>some</i> impact on the appellants; but Little Bay has not pointed to any facts as to show a dramatic impact of the boundary line shift or any facts that undermine the original reasons proffered for the shift or any other reason why the response was inadequate or the boundary line shift required consideration as a separate alternative. Absent some discussion of such considerations, we can hardly hold the agency acted unreasonably or in bad faith by proceeding as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same section of the brief, Little Bay says that the district judge was mistaken in expressing doubts whether the Regulatory Flexibility statute applied at all in this case. The district court did say that because small businesses are the main subject of the new regime, there was little chance that the agency analysis would overlook small businesses. But as neither he nor we have rested on such a theory to avoid application of the statute, it is beside the point on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to interchange of written communications, there was also a significant number of opportunities for Council members to express their views in person.

New England Council members have also commonly held seats on the Atlantic Commission</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although our discussion in<i>Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc.,</i> focused on the Regulatory Flexibility Act as it stood before several amendments regarding judicial review under the Act, nothing in those amendments has changed our approach here.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
