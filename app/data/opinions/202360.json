This is an interlocutory appeal\n\nbrought by the Corporación de Puerto Rico Para La Difusión Pública\n\n(WIPR), Puerto Rico's public broadcasting company. WIPR challenges\n\na district court ruling that it is not an arm of the Commonwealth\n\nof Puerto Rico and therefore does not share in the Commonwealth's\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.              See U.S.\n\nConst. amend. XI.      We affirm.\n\n            The plaintiffs are employees of WIPR who have filed a\n\nfederal court action, seeking damages and declaratory relief, that\n\nalleges that WIPR took adverse employment actions against them in\n\nretaliation for making statements that are protected by the First\n\nAmendment.1     WIPR   moved   to   dismiss   the   complaint   on   several\n\ngrounds.   For present purposes, only its argument for dismissal of\n\nthe damages claims under the Eleventh Amendment is relevant.             WIPR\n\nclaimed that it is an arm of the Commonwealth and is therefore\n\nimmune from liability for damages in federal court.             See De Leon\n\nLopez v. Corporación Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (stating that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated\n\nas a state for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment).\n\n            The district court rejected this argument.               Pastrana\n\nTorres v. Zabala Carrión, 376 F. Supp. 2d 209, 216-17 (D.P.R.\n\n2005).     It ruled that \"WIPR is exactly the sort of municipal\n\n\n     1\n      The complaint also names WIPR's president Myrna Yolanda\nZabala-Carrión as a defendant in her individual and official\ncapacities. She is not a party to this appeal.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcorporation to which the Eleventh Amendment does not extend.\"              Id.\n\nat 216.   It based this conclusion on WIPR's ability to \"sue and be\n\nsued\" and the fact that it \"has been separately incorporated.\" Id.\n\nat 217.    WIPR timely appealed this ruling.             See Puerto Rico\n\nAqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147\n\n(1993) (holding that entities claiming to be \"arms of the State\"\n\nmay bring interlocutory appeals from district court orders denying\n\nclaims of Eleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n           We   review   de   novo   the   conclusion   that   WIPR   is   not\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.         See Arecibo Cmty. Health\n\nCare, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2001).                As\n\nthis case is before us after the denial of WIPR's motion to\n\ndismiss, we accept the well-pleaded allegations as true.                   See\n\nAlternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., 374 F.3d 23, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 2004). The burden of proving that Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity applies rests with WIPR.            See Wojcik v. Mass. State\n\nLottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           \"The Eleventh Amendment largely shields States from suit\n\nin federal court without their consent, leaving parties with claims\n\nagainst a State to present them, if the State permits, in the\n\nState's own tribunals.\" Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 513\n\nU.S. 30, 39 (1994).       This immunity applies only to the states\n\nthemselves and entities that are determined to be arms of a state.\n\nSee Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth.,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f991 F.2d 935, 939 (1st Cir. 1993).          Arm-of-the-state questions\n\noften arise with respect to special-purpose public corporations\n\nestablished by the state, such as WIPR.             See Redondo Constr.\n\nCorp. v. Puerto Rico Highway and Transp. Auth., 357 F.3d 124, 126\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           This circuit has developed a two-part test to resolve\n\narm-of-the-state questions. See Fresenius Med. Care Cardiovascular\n\nRes., Inc. v. Puerto Rico & the Caribbean Cardiovascular Ctr.\n\nCorp., 322 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 2003).        The first part of the test\n\nasks whether the state has structured the entity to share its\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.        See id. at 68.         If the relevant\n\nindicia conclusively demonstrate that it has, Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity applies.    If, however, the indicia are inconclusive, the\n\nsecond part of the test focuses on the risk that money damages will\n\nbe paid from the state's treasury if the entity is found liable.\n\nSee id.   This analysis centers on whether the state has obligated\n\nitself to pay the entity's debts.          Id.    If so, the entity is\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.         See id.\n\n           The Fresenius test incorporates the twin interests served\n\nby the Eleventh Amendment: protecting the state's dignity interest\n\nin avoiding being haled into federal court, see Fed. Mar. Comm'n v.\n\nSouth   Carolina   Ports   Auth.,   535   U.S.   743,   760   (2002),   and\n\nprotecting the public fisc, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 677\n\n(1974).    We perform the arm-of-the-state analysis with \"caution,\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f[as] it would be . . . an affront to the state's dignity and fiscal\n\ninterests were a federal court to find erroneously that an entity\n\nwas an arm of the state, when the state did not structure the\n\nentity to share its sovereignty.\"          Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 63.\n\n           We begin by considering whether the Commonwealth has\n\nstructured WIPR to share its sovereignty.           See id. at 68.     This\n\ndetermination is a question of federal law but can be answered only\n\nafter consulting the provisions of Commonwealth law that define\n\nWIPR's character.   See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519\n\nU.S. 425, 429 n.5 (1997).    The control statutorily asserted by the\n\nCommonwealth over WIPR is an important aspect of this inquiry.\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 68.\n\n           WIPR operates with a significant degree of autonomy from\n\nthe Puerto Rico government.     WIPR's enabling act describes it as a\n\n\"public   corporation\"   with   \"a    juridical     personality   that   is\n\nindependent and separate from any other entity, agency, department\n\nor instrumentality of the Government of Puerto Rico.\"2               Public\n\nBroadcasting Corporation for Puerto Rico Act of 1996 (\"1996 Act\"),\n\nAct No. 216, § 1, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 501; see\n\n\n\n     2\n      WIPR disputes the importance of this characterization,\nrelying heavily on another provision in the enabling act declaring\nWIPR to be an \"instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 501. But similar language has appeared\nin the enabling acts of other Commonwealth entities and has been\ndeemed not dispositive on arm-of-the-state questions. See Metcalf\n& Eddy, 991 F.2d at 942; Ainsworth Aristocrat Int'l Pty. Ltd. v.\nTourism Co. of P.R., 818 F.2d 1034, 1038 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fFresenius, 322 F.3d at 68 (relying on similar language to support\n\na conclusion that an entity was not an arm of the state).             Its\n\nBoard of Directors may \"approve, amend, and repeal\" regulations as\n\nit deems necessary to fulfill its mission and may determine the\n\n\"use of its . . . operating budget.\"        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, §\n\n503; see Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Puerto Rico Ports Auth., 973 F.2d\n\n8,   11 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that an entity's authority over its\n\nexpenditures is an indicator of autonomy from the state). There is\n\nno provision for a veto by the Commonwealth over decisions by the\n\nBoard of Directors.   See Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 71-72 (noting that\n\nthe Commonwealth's veto power over the decisions of a board is a\n\n\"key element of control\").       Moreover, the Board of Directors is\n\npermitted to select WIPR's president without interference from\n\nother Commonwealth officials.      P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 503; cf.\n\nWojcik, 300 F.3d at 100 (stating that the fact that the governor\n\ncould   reject   choice   for   director   of   the   Lottery   Commission\n\nindicated that the Commission was an arm of the state).\n\n            Additionally, the enabling act empowers WIPR to sue and\n\nbe sued, to enter into contracts, and to acquire and maintain\n\nproperty.    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 504(a)(5), (7), (8); see\n\nMetcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 942 (stating that the power to sue and\n\nbe sued and enter into contracts suggests that an entity is\n\nautonomous from the state).        WIPR also is permitted to raise\n\nrevenue for its operations by charging user fees \"for the use of\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fits broadcasting facilities,\" and by soliciting donations.                      P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 27, § 504(a)(10), (13); Royal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at\n\n10 (stating that the ability of an entity to generate revenue\n\nindicates autonomy).3\n\n              Balanced against these indicators of autonomy are factors\n\nsuggesting Commonwealth control.                WIPR is bound by Puerto Rico's\n\nAdministrative Procedures Act in promulgating regulations to govern\n\nits affairs.            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 504(a)(3); Breneman v.\n\nUnited States ex. rel the Fed. Aviation Admin., 381 F.3d 33, 39\n\n(1st       Cir.    2004)    (that    entity     must    comply    with   the   state\n\nadministrative procedures act suggests state control).                         It is\n\ngoverned by a Board of Directors comprised of certain government\n\nofficials and private citizens appointed by the Governor and\n\nconfirmed by the Senate.            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 503; Wojcik,300\n\nF.3d at 100 (that state commission was made up of government\n\nofficials         and    politically-appointed         citizens   indicates    state\n\ncontrol). And it is required to submit reports on certain subjects\n\nto the Governor and Legislature.                P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 505;\n\nRoyal Caribbean, 973 F.2d at 12 (that entity must submit reports to\n\nthe Governor is an indication of state control).\n\n\n       3\n      There are indicia besides state control that inform the first\naspect of the Fresenius test, including whether WIPR is performing\na proprietary or government function and the existence of\nCommonwealth court decisions showing that WIPR is a part of the\ngovernment of Puerto Rico. See Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 70-71. But\nWIPR has not argued that either factor supports its immunity claim,\nand it has the burden to do so. See id. at 70.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f           As the above discussion shows, the relevant factors point\n\nin different directions.   WIPR therefore has not demonstrated that\n\nthe Commonwealth structured WIPR to share its sovereignty.         See\n\nFresenius, 322 F.3d at 72.       Accordingly, we turn to consider\n\nwhether the Commonwealth is obligated to pay WIPR's debts.   Id.    In\n\nconducting this inquiry, we examine \"what is said by state law on\n\nthe topic and what in fact has happened.\"    Id.\n\n           WIPR's enabling act does not explicitly obligate the\n\nCommonwealth to pay WIPR's debts.       But even without such an\n\nexplicit promise, the Commonwealth may have assumed this obligation\n\nby binding itself to provide virtually all of the funds that WIPR\n\nneeds to operate.   See id.   We therefore examine WIPR's statutory\n\nscheme, with particular emphasis on the provisions for raising\n\nrevenue and funding.   See id.\n\n           As mentioned above, WIPR is empowered to raise revenues\n\nthrough soliciting donations and charging user fees.   See supra at\n\n7-8.   The enabling act requires WIPR to submit an annual work plan\n\nto the Governor and Legislature identifying specific activities and\n\nanticipated expenditures for the upcoming year.      P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 27, § 505.   In the session laws, the Legislature promised to\n\nauthorize \"all additional fiscal resources that are needed to carry\n\nout the annual\" work plan.    1996 Act P.R. Laws § 14, codified at\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, § 501 (emphasis supplied).        Thus, the\n\nLegislature has   undertaken only a limited funding obligation for\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fWIPR.   It will pay the difference between WIPR's revenues and the\n\nresources needed to implement WIPR's work plan.                      It has not,\n\nhowever, committed itself to provide all of WIPR's budget, and has\n\nnot promised to cover unforeseen expenses that WIPR may incur.\n\n           We turn finally to the practical reality of WIPR's\n\nfunding situation.         \"If the [Commonwealth] substantially funds\n\n[WIPR], those funds would be the probable source to satisfy any\n\njudgment against [WIPR],\" and therefore the public fisc would be\n\njeopardized by an adverse judgment.             Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 73.\n\n           WIPR asserts that its \"entire budget comes from the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico General Fund.\"             If true, this could be\n\na significant (although not necessarily dispositive) fact. See Mt.\n\nHealthy Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280 (1977)\n\n(concluding that a public school district was not an arm of the\n\nstate even though it received \"a significant amount of money from\n\nthe   State\").     In     any   event,   WIPR    has   offered      no   materials\n\nsubstantiating its assertion and, as mentioned above, it has the\n\nburden of proof.        See Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 70.\n\n           In    sum,    WIPR's   enabling      act   does    not   unequivocally\n\nindicate   that   the     Commonwealth    structured         WIPR   to   share   its\n\nsovereignty, and there is no indication that the Commonwealth has\n\nbound itself to pay WIPR's debts.         Accordingly, the district court\n\ncorrectly denied WIPR's motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment\n\ngrounds.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -11-\n\f",

Moreover, the Board of Directors is permitted to select WIPR's president without interference from other Commonwealth officials. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 503; <i>cf.

WIPR also is permitted to raise revenue for its operations by charging user fees \"for the use of its broadcasting facilities,\" and by soliciting donations. P.R.

WIPR is bound by Puerto Rico's Administrative Procedures Act in promulgating regulations to govern its affairs. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 504(a)(3); <i>Breneman v. United States ex. rel the Fed.

WIPR therefore has not demonstrated that the Commonwealth structured WIPR to share its sovereignty. <i>See Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 72. Accordingly, we turn to consider whether the Commonwealth is obligated to pay WIPR's debts. <i>Id.</i> In conducting this inquiry, we examine \"what is said by state law on the topic and what in fact has happened.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WIPR's enabling act does not explicitly obligate the Commonwealth to pay WIPR's debts. But even without such an explicit promise, the Commonwealth may have assumed this obligation by binding itself to provide virtually all of the funds that WIPR needs to operate. <i>See id.</i> We therefore examine WIPR's statutory scheme, with particular emphasis on the provisions for raising revenue and funding. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, WIPR is empowered to raise revenues through soliciting donations and charging user fees. <i>See supra</i> at 127. The enabling act requires WIPR to submit an annual work plan to the Governor and Legislature identifying specific activities and anticipated expenditures for the upcoming year. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 505. In the session laws, the Legislature promised to authorize \"all <i>additional</i> fiscal resources that are needed to carry out the annual\" work plan. 1996 Act P.R. Laws &#167; 14, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 501 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the Legislature has undertaken only a limited funding obligation for WIPR. It will pay the <i>difference</i> between WIPR's revenues and the resources needed to implement WIPR's work plan. It has not, however, committed itself to provide all of WIPR's budget, and has not promised to cover unforeseen expenses that WIPR may incur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to the practical reality of WIPR's funding situation. \"If the [Commonwealth] substantially funds [WIPR], those funds would be the probable source to satisfy any judgment against [WIPR],\" and therefore the public fisc would be jeopardized by an adverse judgment. <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WIPR asserts that its \"entire budget comes from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico General Fund.\" If true, this could be a significant (although not necessarily dispositive) fact. <i>See Mt.

Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 501; <i>see Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 68 (relying on similar language to support a conclusion that an entity was not an arm of the state). Its Board of Directors may \"approve, amend, and repeal\" regulations as it deems necessary to fulfill its mission and may determine the \"use of its . . . operating budget.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 503; <i>see Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Puerto Rico Ports Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589642\"><a href=\"/opinion/589642/royal-caribbean-corp-and-caribbean-cruise-line-ltd-v-puerto-rico-ports/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1992) (stating that an entity's authority over its expenditures is an indicator of autonomy from the state). There is no provision for a veto by the Commonwealth over decisions by the Board of Directors. <i>See Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 71-72 (noting that the Commonwealth's veto power over the decisions of a board is a \"key element of control\"). Moreover, the Board of Directors is permitted to select WIPR's president without interference from other Commonwealth officials. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 503; <i>cf. Wojcik,</i> 300 F.3d at 100 (stating that the fact that the governor could reject choice for director of the Lottery Commission indicated that the Commission was an arm of the state).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the enabling act empowers WIPR to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, and to acquire and maintain property. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 504(a)(5), (7), (8); <i>see Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 942 (stating that the power to sue and be sued and enter into contracts suggests that an entity is autonomous from the state). WIPR also is permitted to raise revenue for its operations by charging user fees \"for the use of its broadcasting facilities,\" and by soliciting donations. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 504(a)(10), (13); <i>Royal Caribbean,</i> 973 F.2d at 10 (stating that the ability of an entity to generate revenue indicates autonomy).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Balanced against these indicators of autonomy are factors suggesting Commonwealth control. WIPR is bound by Puerto Rico's Administrative Procedures Act in promulgating regulations to govern its affairs. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 504(a)(3); <i>Breneman v. United States ex. rel the Fed. Aviation Admin.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201219\"><a href=\"/opinion/201219/breneman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2004) (that entity must comply with the state administrative procedures act suggests state control). It is governed by a Board of Directors comprised of certain government officials and private citizens appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 503; <i>Wojcik,</i> 300 F.3d at 100 (that state commission was made up of government officials and politically-appointed citizens indicates state control). And it is required to submit reports on certain subjects to the Governor and Legislature. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 505; <i>Royal Caribbean,</i> 973 F.2d at 12 (that entity must submit reports to the Governor is an indication of state control).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the above discussion shows, the relevant factors point in different directions. WIPR therefore has not demonstrated that the Commonwealth structured WIPR to share its sovereignty. <i>See Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 72. Accordingly, we turn to consider whether the Commonwealth is obligated to pay WIPR's debts. <i>Id.</i> In conducting this inquiry, we examine \"what is said by state law on the topic and what in fact has happened.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WIPR's enabling act does not explicitly obligate the Commonwealth to pay WIPR's debts. But even without such an explicit promise, the Commonwealth may have assumed this obligation by binding itself to provide virtually all of the funds that WIPR needs to operate. <i>See id.</i> We therefore examine WIPR's statutory scheme, with particular emphasis on the provisions for raising revenue and funding. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, WIPR is empowered to raise revenues through soliciting donations and charging user fees. <i>See supra</i> at 127. The enabling act requires WIPR to submit an annual work plan to the Governor and Legislature identifying specific activities and anticipated expenditures for the upcoming year. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 505. In the session laws, the Legislature promised to authorize \"all <i>additional</i> fiscal resources that are needed to carry out the annual\" work plan. 1996 Act P.R. Laws &#167; 14, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 501 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the Legislature has undertaken only a limited funding obligation for WIPR. It will pay the <i>difference</i> between WIPR's revenues and the resources needed to implement WIPR's work plan. It has not, however, committed itself to provide all of WIPR's budget, and has not promised to cover unforeseen expenses that WIPR may incur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to the practical reality of WIPR's funding situation. \"If the [Commonwealth] substantially funds [WIPR], those funds would be the probable source to satisfy any judgment against [WIPR],\" and therefore the public fisc would be jeopardized by an adverse judgment. <i>Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WIPR asserts that its \"entire budget comes from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico General Fund.\" If true, this could be a significant (although not necessarily dispositive) fact. <i>See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span> (1977) (concluding that a public school district was not an arm of the state even though it received \"a significant amount of money from the State\"). In any event, WIPR has offered no materials substantiating its assertion and, as mentioned above, it has the burden of proof. <i>See Fresenius,</i> 322 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, WIPR's enabling act does not unequivocally indicate that the Commonwealth structured WIPR to share its sovereignty, and there is no indication that the Commonwealth has bound itself to pay WIPR's debts. Accordingly, the district court correctly denied WIPR's motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> For the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint also names WIPR's president Myrna Yolanda Zabala-Carri&#243;n as a defendant in her individual and official capacities.

Laws Ann. tit. 27, &#167; 501. But similar language has appeared in the enabling acts of other Commonwealth entities and has been deemed not dispositive on arm-of-the-state questions<i>See Metcalf &amp; Eddy,</i> 991 F.2d at 942; <i>Ainsworth Aristocrat Int'l Pty.
