Petitioner Mimiya Hospital, Inc.\n\nSNF (Mimiya), a skilled nursing facility, seeks review of a final\n\ndecision of the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) of the Department\n\nof Health and Human Services.    The case concerns Mimiya's request\n\nfor a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on the\n\nimposition of a Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) by the Centers for\n\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a sanction for Mimiya's\n\nnoncompliance with federal Medicare participation requirements.\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii).      The ALJ dismissed Mimiya's\n\nrequest on the ground that it was untimely, and the DAB, in\n\npertinent part, affirmed the dismissal.       We, in turn, affirm the\n\ndecision of the DAB.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          To participate in Medicare, a skilled nursing facility\n\nmust comply with federal Medicare requirements set forth at 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1395i-3 and at 42 C.F.R. Part 483.                 Generally, the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services enters into agreements with\n\nstate agencies to conduct surveys of facilities on behalf of CMS--\n\nthe agency within the Department of Health and Human Services\n\nresponsible for administering Medicare--to determine whether the\n\nfacilities   are   in   substantial    compliance    with    the    Medicare\n\nparticipation requirements.     42 U.S.C. §         1395aa; 42 C.F.R. §§\n\n488.10(a)(1),   488.26(c)(1).     Facilities    found       not    to   be   in\n\nsubstantial compliance with participation requirements are subject\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fto    enforcement   remedies    by   CMS.     See    42     U.S.C.    §   1395i-\n\n3(h)(2)(B)(ii).      If, after reviewing the survey results, CMS\n\ndecides to take enforcement action against a facility, it issues a\n\nnotice of initial determination which entitles the facility to a\n\nhearing, provided that a request is filed within sixty days from\n\nreceipt of the notice of initial determination.                  42 U.S.C. §\n\n405(b); 42 C.F.R. §§ 498.3(b)(12), 498.5(b), 498.20(a), 498.40.\n\nRegulations governing CMS's notice of initial determination state\n\nthat the notice must contain instructions for responding to the\n\nnotice, including a statement of the facility's right to a hearing\n\nand   the   implications   of   waiving     that    right.       42   C.F.R.   §\n\n488.434(a)(2)(viii).       Specifically,     42    C.F.R.    §   488.436(b)(1)\n\nprovides that if a facility waives the right to a hearing within\n\nsixty days from the receipt of notice of the initial determination,\n\nCMS will automatically reduce the CMP by thirty-five percent.\n\n            In this case, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH)\n\nconducted a survey of Mimiya from April 4 to April 6, 2000.                  The\n\nsurvey found thirty-five separate deficiencies, one of which posed\n\nimmediate jeopardy to patient health or safety. On April 26, 2000,\n\nthe PRDH conducted a revisit survey to determine whether Mimiya had\n\nmade the required corrections to the immediate jeopardy deficiency\n\nand found that the corrections had been made, although other non-\n\nimmediate jeopardy deficiencies persisted.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          By letter dated May 26, 2000, CMS notified Mimiya of its\n\ndetermination, based on the PRDH surveys, that Mimiya was not in\n\nsubstantial   compliance      with     the   requirements     for    Medicare\n\nparticipation.    CMS further notified Mimiya of its decision to\n\nimpose the    remedies   of   denial    of   payment   for   new    admissions\n\neffective May 28, 2000, denial of nurse aide training for two\n\nyears, and imposition of a CMP.         The CMP consisted of $3,050 per\n\nday for the twenty-two-day period of April 4, 2000 through April\n\n25, 2000 during which Mimiya's noncompliance constituted immediate\n\njeopardy to resident health or safety, and $100 per day thereafter\n\nuntil such time as Mimiya achieved substantial compliance or CMS\n\nterminated the provider agreement.            The May 26 letter further\n\nstated, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 498.40,        that Mimiya had sixty days\n\nfrom receipt of the letter to request a hearing before an ALJ to\n\nchallenge CMS's determination. The letter did not inform Mimiya of\n\nits option under 42 C.F.R. § 488.436 to waive the hearing in return\n\nfor a thirty-five percent reduction in the amount of the CMP.\n\nMimiya did not file a request for a hearing within the sixty-day\n\nperiod.\n\n          By letter dated August 30, 2000, CMS notified Mimiya that\n\nit had achieved substantial compliance as of June 22, 2000, and\n\nthat the $100 per day portion of the CMP would be imposed for the\n\nperiod from April 26, 2000 through June 22, 2000 (a sum of $5,800).\n\nAdded to the $67,100 CMP imposed for noncompliance constituting\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fimmediate jeopardy, this brought the total CMP to $72,900.                   The\n\nAugust 30 letter notified Mimiya of its right to request a hearing\n\nwithin sixty days and included language, omitted in the May 26\n\nletter, informing Mimiya that if it waived its right to a hearing,\n\nthe amount of the CMP would be reduced by thirty-five percent in\n\naccordance with 42 C.F.R. § 488.436.\n\n              On October 22, 2000--149 days after CMS notified Mimiya\n\nof its initial determination of noncompliance, and fifty-three days\n\nafter   CMS    notified    Mimiya    of   its   achievement     of   substantial\n\ncompliance--Mimiya requested a hearing before an ALJ to contest the\n\ndetermination of noncompliance. On November 7, 2001, the ALJ ruled\n\nthat Mimiya's request was untimely and dismissed the request.\n\nMimiya appealed the dismissal to the DAB.\n\n              On June 5, 2002, the DAB issued a decision affirming the\n\nALJ's finding that the May 26, 2000 letter fully apprised Mimiya of\n\nCMS's   determination      of     noncompliance     and   the   imposition    of\n\npenalties, and hence that Mimiya's October 22, 2000 request for a\n\nhearing   to     contest    the     determination    of   noncompliance      and\n\nimposition of penalties was untimely.             The DAB acknowledged that\n\nthe May 26 notice was defective in that it failed to inform Mimiya\n\nof the option of a thirty-five percent reduction in exchange for\n\nwaiving the hearing, but found that this defect was easily cured by\n\nawarding Mimiya a thirty-five percent reduction of the CMP imposed\n\nfor the immediate jeopardy deficiency.               However, the DAB found\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthat   Mimiya   was   not   notified   of   the    substantial   compliance\n\ndetermination until August 30, 2000.              The date of substantial\n\ncompliance is relevant to both the $100 per day portion of the CMP\n\nand the penalty denying payment for new admissions until Mimiya\n\nachieved substantial compliance.         Because Mimiya was not notified\n\nof the determination of the date of substantial compliance until\n\nthe August 30 letter, Mimiya's request for a hearing on this issue\n\nwas within the sixty-day period, and the DAB accordingly remanded\n\nthe case to the ALJ to allow Mimiya to challenge the compliance\n\ndetermination date.\n\n           Although Mimiya appealed the DAB's decision denying the\n\nhearing, the DAB's remand to the ALJ to allow Mimiya to challenge\n\nthe compliance determination raised an issue about the finality of\n\nthe DAB's decision. However, on March 24, 2003, subsequent to oral\n\nargument, the parties notified us that they had responded to our\n\nfinality concerns by reaching a settlement agreement on the issues\n\nremanded to the ALJ.    Thus, the only issue outstanding in this case\n\nis the DAB's denial of Mimiya's request for a hearing on CMS's\n\ndetermination of noncompliance with federal Medicare participation\n\nrequirements.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Mimiya contends that the notice provided by the May 26,\n\n2000 letter was invalid for the purpose of triggering the sixty-day\n\nperiod for requesting a hearing, and that valid notice was not\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fprovided until the August 30, 2000 letter.           Thus, Mimiya reasons\n\nthat   its    request   for     a   hearing   on   the   determination   of\n\nnoncompliance and imposition of penalties, filed within sixty days\n\nof the August 30 letter, was timely.          Mimiya offers two arguments\n\nin support of this contention: (1) the failure of the May 26 letter\n\nto inform Mimiya of the option of a thirty-five percent reduction\n\nin the CMP in exchange for a waiver of hearing rights violated\n\nMimiya's due process rights and rendered the notice invalid; (2)\n\nCMS is estopped from arguing that Mimiya's request for a hearing on\n\nthe determination of noncompliance and imposition of penalties is\n\nuntimely.\n\n             A.   Due Process\n\n             The deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest\n\nin life, liberty, or property is a threshold requirement for a\n\nsuccessful procedural due process claim.           Aponte v. Calderon, 284\n\nF.3d 184, 191 (1st Cir. 2002).              It is, frankly, difficult to\n\nunderstand the nature of the property interest that underlies\n\nMimiya's claim.      Mimiya attempts to articulate that interest as\n\nfollows:     \"Medicare, through the creation of the above cited rules\n\nfor notification of penalties, endowed [Mimiya] with a proprietary\n\ninterest in being fully appraised [stet] of all its options when\n\nfacing an imposed CMP.\"             This description seems to equate a\n\nproperty interest with Mimiya's right to be advised of a thirty-\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffive percent reduction in the CMP if it waived its right to a\n\nhearing.     This equation is erroneous.\n\n             It is well established that \"individuals whose property\n\ninterests are at stake are entitled to notice and an opportunity to\n\nbe heard.\"     Dusenbery v. United States, 534 U.S. 161, 167 (2002).\n\nIn this case, the property interest at stake (and the issue for\n\nwhich Mimiya requests the hearing) is the CMP that Mimiya must pay\n\nas a penalty for noncompliance with Medicare regulations.               CMS\n\nprovided Mimiya with notice of the grounds for the noncompliance\n\ndetermination, the penalties imposed for noncompliance, and the\n\nopportunity to contest at a hearing the noncompliance determination\n\nand the penalties.       Although Mimiya did not exercise its right to\n\nrequest a hearing, CMS complied with the requirements of due\n\nprocess by giving Mimiya notice of the deficiencies and the amount\n\nof the penalty, and an opportunity to be heard.\n\n             The deficiency in the May 26 notice provided by CMS did\n\nnot implicate the notice and opportunity to be heard requirements\n\nof due process.     Instead, that notice only failed to inform Mimiya\n\nof    the   regulatory   option   of   receiving   a   thirty-five   percent\n\nreduction in the CMP if it waived its opportunity to be heard.\n\nThis failure did not affect Mimiya's choice to forgo the hearing:\n\nMimiya was advised of its right to a hearing, and decided to give\n\nup that right without knowledge of the financial benefit of doing\n\nso.     Because Mimiya so decided, the regulations governing the\n\n                                       -8-\n\fadministration of federal Medicare requirements arguably entitled\n\nMimiya to the thirty-five percent reduction in the CMP.                Mimiya\n\ncannot use its ignorance of the thirty-five percent reduction as a\n\nbasis for requesting a hearing when that ignorance had no effect on\n\nits decision to forgo a hearing.\n\n            Recognizing Mimiya's equitable claim to the financial\n\nbenefit provided by the regulations, the DAB awarded Mimiya the\n\nthirty-five percent reduction in its decision on Mimiya's appeal,\n\nthereby curing any harm from the deficiency in the May 26 notice.\n\nAs the DAB aptly observed:\n\n            Mimiya offered nothing to show how the failure\n            to receive the option to settle the CMP for\n            sixty-five percent would impact its due\n            process rights; indeed, by failing to request\n            a hearing based on the May 26 notice, it was\n            defaulting for the full imposed penalty\n            amount. If Mimiya did not seek a hearing for\n            the full proposed penalty amount, then\n            informing Mimiya of its option to waive its\n            right to a hearing in exchange for a thirty-\n            five percent penalty reduction would, if\n            anything, make Mimiya even less likely to seek\n            a hearing.\n\nIn fact, in its brief, Mimiya confirms that \"[i]f CMS had met its\n\nprocedural obligations and notified Mimiya of all its rightful\n\noptions,    [Mimiya]    would   have    chosen     the   thirty-five   percent\n\nreduction    at   the   time    of   the     May   26,   2000   notification.\"\n\nTherefore, the DAB's decision to award Mimiya the thirty-five\n\npercent reduction on appeal cured any deficiency in the May 26\n\nnotice.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f            B.   Estoppel\n\n            Mimiya argues that CMS should be estopped from arguing\n\nthat its request for a hearing was untimely because CMS's failure\n\nto   notify      Mimiya   of   the    waiver    option      amounted    to    a\n\nmisrepresentation on which Mimiya relied to its detriment.                    In\n\nHeckler v. Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51 (1984), the Supreme\n\nCourt explained that a party seeking to assert estoppel must\n\ndemonstrate that (1) the party to be estopped made a \"definite\n\nmisrepresentation of fact to another person having reason to\n\nbelieve that the other [would] rely upon it\"; (2) the party seeking\n\nestoppel relied on the misrepresentations to its detriment; and (3)\n\nthe \"reliance [was] reasonable in that the party claiming the\n\nestoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary's\n\nconduct was misleading.\" Id. at 59; see also Benitez-Pons v.\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nClauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 661-62 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            We bypass the issue of whether CMS's omission of the\n\nwaiver option in the May 26 letter was a misrepresentation (without\n\nsuggesting that it was), and conclude that Mimiya's argument must\n\nfail because Mimiya cannot show detrimental reliance.            In order to\n\nassert   estoppel,    a   party   must   show   that   it   \"relied    on    its\n\nadversary's conduct in such a        manner as to change [its] position\n\nfor the worse.\"     Heckler, 467 U.S. at 59 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Given the choice between paying the full amount and\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\frequesting a hearing, Mimiya in effect chose to pay the full\n\namount.   Notice of the option of receiving a thirty-five percent\n\nreduction for waiving its right to a hearing would not have altered\n\nthat choice, as Mimiya itself has conceded.    See supra.   Because\n\nthe DAB awarded Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction, Mimiya\n\ndid not suffer any harm as a result of the omission.    Therefore,\n\nMimiya has not demonstrated the detrimental reliance required by\n\nestoppel.1\n\n                                III.\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the\n\nDepartmental Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Assuming the availability of estoppel against the\ngovernment, we note that the burden for asserting such a claim is\ngreater than that for asserting estoppel against a private citizen.\nDantran, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Labor, 171 F.3d 58, 66 (1st\nCir. 1999) (\"If estoppel against the government possesses any\nviability . . . the phenomenon occurs only in the most extreme\ncircumstances.\") But \"however heavy the burden might be when an\nestoppel is asserted against the Government, the private party\nsurely cannot prevail without at least demonstrating that the\ntraditional elements of an estoppel are present.\" Heckler, 467 U.S.\nat 61. Because Mimiya fails to make that demonstration, we need\nnot discuss the precise parameters of an estoppel claim against the\ngovernment.\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

On April 26, 2000, the PRDH conducted a revisit survey to determine whether Mimiya had made the required corrections to the immediate jeopardy deficiency and found that the corrections had been made, although other non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies persisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated May 26, 2000, CMS notified Mimiya of its determination, based on the PRDH surveys, that Mimiya was not in substantial compliance with the requirements for Medicare participation. CMS further notified Mimiya of its decision to impose the remedies of denial of payment for new admissions effective May 28, 2000, denial of nurse aide training for two years, and imposition of a CMP. The CMP consisted of $3,050 per day for the twenty-two-day period of April 4, 2000 through April 25, 2000 during which Mimiya's non-compliance constituted immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, and $100 per day thereafter until such time as Mimiya achieved substantial compliance or CMS terminated the provider agreement. The May 26 letter further stated, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. &#167; 498.40, that Mimiya had sixty days from receipt of the letter to request a hearing before an ALJ to challenge CMS's determination. The letter did not inform Mimiya of its option under 42 C.F.R. &#167; 488.436 to waive the hearing in return for a thirty-five percent reduction in the amount of the CMP. Mimiya did not file a request for a hearing within the sixty-day period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated August 30, 2000, CMS notified Mimiya that it had achieved substantial compliance as of June 22, 2000, and that the $100 per day portion of the CMP would be imposed for the period from April 26, 2000 through June 22, 2000 (a sum of $5,800). Added to the $67,100 CMP imposed for non-compliance constituting immediate jeopardy, this brought the total CMP to $72,900. The August 30 letter notified Mimiya of its right to request a hearing within sixty days and included language, omitted in the May 26 letter, informing Mimiya that if it waived its right to a hearing, the amount of the CMP would be reduced by thirty-five percent in accordance with 42 C.F.R. &#167; 488.436.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 22, 2000 &#8212; 149 days after CMS notified Mimiya of its initial determination of noncompliance, and fifty-three days after CMS notified Mimiya of its achievement of substantial compliance &#8212; Mimiya requested a hearing before an ALJ to contest the determination of noncompliance.

The DAB acknowledged that the May 26 notice was defective in that it failed to inform Mimiya of the option of a thirty-five percent reduction in exchange for waiving the hearing, but found that this defect was easily cured by awarding Mimiya a thirty-five percent reduction of the CMP imposed for the immediate jeopardy deficiency. However, the DAB found that Mimiya was not notified of the substantial compliance determination until August 30, 2000. The date of substantial compliance is relevant to both the $100 per day portion of the CMP and the penalty denying payment for new admissions until Mimiya achieved substantial compliance. Because Mimiya was not notified of the determination of the date of substantial compliance until the August 30 letter, Mimiya's request for a hearing on this issue was within the sixty-day period, and the DAB accordingly remanded the case to the ALJ to allow Mimiya to challenge the compliance determination date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mimiya appealed the DAB's decision denying the hearing, the DAB's remand to the ALJ to allow Mimiya to challenge the compliance determination raised an issue about the finality of the DAB's decision. However, on March 24, 2003, subsequent to oral argument, the parties notified us that they had responded to our finality concerns by reaching a settlement agreement on the issues remanded to the ALJ. Thus, the only issue outstanding in this case is the DAB's denial of Mimiya's request for a hearing on CMS's determination of noncompliance with federal Medicare participation requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mimiya contends that the notice provided by the May 26, 2000 letter was invalid for the purpose of triggering the sixty-day period for requesting a hearing, and that valid notice was not provided until the August 30, 2000 letter. Thus, Mimiya reasons that its request for a hearing on the determination of noncompliance and imposition of penalties, filed within sixty days of the August 30 letter, was timely. Mimiya offers two arguments in support of this contention: (1) the failure of the May 26 letter to inform Mimiya of the option of a thirty-five percent reduction in the CMP in exchange for a waiver of hearing rights violated Mimiya's due process rights and rendered the notice invalid; (2) CMS is estopped from arguing that Mimiya's request for a hearing on the determination of noncompliance and imposition of penalties is untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Due Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property is a threshold requirement for a successful procedural due process claim. <i>Aponte v. Calderon,</i> 284 F.3d 184, 191 (1st Cir.2002). It is, frankly, difficult to understand the nature of the property interest that underlies Mimiya's claim. Mimiya attempts to articulate that interest as follows: \"Medicare, through the creation of the above cited rules for notification of penalties, endowed [Mimiya] with a proprietary interest in being fully appraised [sic] of all its options when facing an imposed CMP.\" This description seems to equate a property interest with Mimiya's right to be advised of a thirty-five percent reduction in the CMP if it waived its right to a hearing. This equation is erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that \"individuals whose property interests are at stake are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.\" <i>Dusenbery v. United States,</i> 534 U.S. 161, 167, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002). In this case, the property interest at stake (and the issue for which Mimiya requests the hearing) is the CMP that Mimiya must pay as a penalty for noncompliance with Medicare regulations. CMS provided Mimiya with notice of the grounds for the noncompliance determination, the penalties imposed for noncompliance, and the opportunity to contest at a hearing the noncompliance determination and the penalties. Although Mimiya did not exercise its right to request a hearing, CMS complied with the requirements of due process by giving Mimiya notice of the deficiencies and the amount of the penalty, and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deficiency in the May 26 notice provided by CMS did not implicate the notice and opportunity to be heard requirements of due process. Instead, that notice only failed to inform Mimiya of the regulatory option of receiving a thirty-five percent reduction in the CMP if it waived its opportunity to be heard. This failure did not affect Mimiya's choice to forgo the hearing: Mimiya was advised of its right to a hearing, and decided to give up that right without knowledge of the financial benefit of doing so. Because Mimiya so decided, the regulations governing the administration of federal Medicare requirements arguably entitled Mimiya to the thirty-five percent reduction in the CMP. Mimiya cannot use its ignorance of the thirty-five percent reduction as a basis for requesting a hearing when that ignorance had no effect on its decision to forgo a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing Mimiya's equitable claim to the financial benefit provided by the regulations, the DAB awarded Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction in its decision on Mimiya's appeal, thereby curing any harm from the deficiency in the May 26 notice. As the DAB aptly observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mimiya offered nothing to show how the failure to receive the option to settle the CMP for sixty-five percent would impact its due process rights; indeed, by failing to request a hearing based on the May 26 notice, it was defaulting for the full imposed penalty amount. If Mimiya did not seek a hearing for the full proposed penalty amount, then informing Mimiya of its option to waive its right to a hearing in exchange for a thirty-five percent penalty reduction would, if anything, make Mimiya even less likely to seek a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, in its brief, Mimiya confirms that \"[i]f CMS had met its procedural obligations and notified Mimiya of all its rightful options, [Mimiya] would have chosen the thirty-five percent reduction at the time of the May 26, 2000 notification.\" Therefore, the DAB's decision to award Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction on appeal cured any deficiency in the May 26 notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mimiya argues that CMS should be estopped from arguing that its request for a hearing was untimely because CMS's failure to notify Mimiya of the waiver option amounted to a misrepresentation on which Mimiya relied to its detriment. In <i>Heckler v. Community Health Servs.,</i> 467 U.S. 51, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984), the Supreme Court explained that a party seeking to assert estoppel must demonstrate that (1) the party to be estopped made a \"definite misrepresentation of fact to another person having reason to believe that the other [would] rely upon it\"; (2) the party seeking estoppel relied on the misrepresentations to its detriment; and (3) the \"reliance [was] reasonable in that the party claiming the estoppel did not know nor should it have known that its adversary's conduct was misleading.\" <i>Id.</i> at 59, 104 S.Ct. 2218; <i>see also Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> 136 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Clauson v. Smith,</i> 823 F.2d 660, 661-62 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bypass the issue of whether CMS's omission of the waiver option in the May 26 letter was a misrepresentation (without suggesting that it was), and conclude that Mimiya's argument must fail because Mimiya cannot show detrimental reliance. In order to assert estoppel, a party must show that it \"relied on its adversary's conduct in such a manner as to change [its] position for the worse.\" <i>Heckler,</i> 467 U.S. at 59, 104 S.Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the choice between paying the full amount and requesting a hearing, Mimiya in effect chose to pay the full amount. Notice of the option of receiving a thirty-five percent reduction for waiving its right to a hearing would not have altered that choice, as Mimiya itself has conceded. <i>See supra.</i> Because the DAB awarded Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction, Mimiya did not suffer any harm as a result of the omission. Therefore, Mimiya has not demonstrated the detrimental reliance required by estoppel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Departmental Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human Services is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Assuming the availability of estoppel against the government, we note that the burden for asserting such a claim is greater than that for asserting estoppel against a private citizen<i>Dantran, Inc. v.

SNF (Mimiya), a skilled nursing facility, seeks review of a final decision of the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) of the Department of Health and Human Services. The case concerns Mimiya's request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) on the imposition of a Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a sanction for Mimiya's non-compliance with federal Medicare participation requirements. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii). The ALJ dismissed Mimiya's request on the ground that it was untimely, and the DAB, in pertinent part, affirmed the dismissal.

Part 483. Generally, the Department of Health and Human Services enters into agreements with state agencies to conduct surveys of facilities on behalf of CMS &#8212; the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for administering Medicare &#8212; to determine whether the facilities are in substantial compliance with the Medicare participation requirements. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395aa; 42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 488.10(a)(1), 488.26(c)(1). Facilities found not to be in substantial compliance with participation requirements are subject to enforcement remedies by CMS. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii). If, after reviewing the survey results, CMS decides to take enforcement action against a facility, it issues a notice of initial determination which entitles the facility to a hearing, provided that a request is filed within sixty days from receipt of the notice of initial determination. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(b); 42 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 498.3(b)(12), 498.5(b), 498.20(a), 498.40. Regulations governing CMS's notice of initial determination state that the notice must contain instructions for responding to the notice, including a statement of the facility's right to a hearing and the implications of waiving that right. 42 C.F.R. &#167; 488.434(a)(2)(viii). Specifically, 42 C.F.R. &#167; 488.436(b)(1) provides that if a facility waives the right to a hearing within sixty days from the receipt of notice of the initial determination, CMS will automatically reduce the CMP by thirty-five percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) conducted a survey of Mimiya from April 4 to April 6, 2000.

Mimiya cannot use its ignorance of the thirty-five percent reduction as a basis for requesting a hearing when that ignorance had no effect on its decision to forgo a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing Mimiya's equitable claim to the financial benefit provided by the regulations, the DAB awarded Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction in its decision on Mimiya's appeal, thereby curing any harm from the deficiency in the May 26 notice. As the DAB aptly observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mimiya offered nothing to show how the failure to receive the option to settle the CMP for sixty-five percent would impact its due process rights; indeed, by failing to request a hearing based on the May 26 notice, it was defaulting for the full imposed penalty amount. If Mimiya did not seek a hearing for the full proposed penalty amount, then informing Mimiya of its option to waive its right to a hearing in exchange for a thirty-five percent penalty reduction would, if anything, make Mimiya even less likely to seek a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, in its brief, Mimiya confirms that \"[i]f CMS had met its procedural obligations and notified Mimiya of all its rightful options, [Mimiya] would have chosen the thirty-five percent reduction at the time of the May 26, 2000 notification.\" Therefore, the DAB's decision to award Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction on appeal cured any deficiency in the May 26 notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mimiya argues that CMS should be estopped from arguing that its request for a hearing was untimely because CMS's failure to notify Mimiya of the waiver option amounted to a misrepresentation on which Mimiya relied to its detriment.

In order to assert estoppel, a party must show that it \"relied on its adversary's conduct in such a manner as to change [its] position for the worse.\" <i>Heckler,</i> 467 U.S. at 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111187\"><a href=\"/opinion/111187/heckler-v-community-health-services-of-crawford-cty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2218</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the choice between paying the full amount and requesting a hearing, Mimiya in effect chose to pay the full amount. Notice of the option of receiving a thirty-five percent reduction for waiving its right to a hearing would not have altered that choice, as Mimiya itself has conceded. <i>See supra.</i> Because the DAB awarded Mimiya the thirty-five percent reduction, Mimiya did not suffer any harm as a result of the omission. Therefore, Mimiya has not demonstrated the detrimental reliance required by estoppel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Departmental Appeals Board of the Department of Health and Human Services is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Assuming the availability of estoppel against the government, we note that the burden for asserting such a claim is greater than that for asserting estoppel against a private citizen<i>Dantran, Inc. v.
