Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Thomas J. Butters, for appellant.\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 17, 2005\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.               Anthony Ciampi appeals from\n\nthe district court order which denied and dismissed his petition\n\nfor habeas corpus, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, in which he\n\nasserts that he never knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to\n\nappeal or collaterally challenge his illegal gambling conviction by\n\nentering into a written plea agreement with the government.                    As\n\nthere was no error, we affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n           A twenty-three count indictment was returned against\n\nCiampi in April 1997 relating to his involvement in an illegal\n\ngambling operation.       See 18 U.S.C. § 1955.           Subsequently, Ciampi\n\nwas convicted by the jury on the § 1955 count, acquitted of four\n\nother   counts,   and    no   verdicts       were   reached   on   the   remaining\n\neighteen counts.        Ciampi’s original trial attorney withdrew his\n\nappearance, and the district court appointed new counsel pending a\n\nretrial on the latter counts.        The government ultimately proposed\n\na plea agreement, whereby Ciampi would plead guilty to two counts\n\nupon which the jury had reached no verdict (viz., conspiracy to\n\ncommit murder in aid of racketeering and attempting to commit an\n\nassaultive crime with a dangerous weapon, id. §§ 1959(a) & 2).\n\n           At the plea hearing conducted on November 1, 1999, Ciampi\n\nwas provided with a copy of the plea agreement, and the terms of\n\nthe agreement were recited by government counsel, including the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fprovision waiving any right to appeal or collaterally challenge\n\neither the conviction or the sentence.    The district court asked\n\nwhether Ciampi understood the terms of the agreement, and Ciampi\n\nreplied in the affirmative. Whereupon the district court, on March\n\n1, 2000, imposed a 216-month prison term pursuant to the plea\n\nagreement.   Judgment was entered on March 8.\n\n           On February 20, 2001, Ciampi submitted a pro se habeas\n\ncorpus petition in the federal district court, pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255, claiming, inter alia,1 that the district court had\n\nfailed to inform him during the November 1999 plea colloquy that he\n\nwas waiving his right to appeal, as well as any right to assert a\n\ncollateral challenge.\n\n           On October 31, 2002, Ciampi, through counsel, submitted\n\nan amended § 2255 petition, which asserted several additional\n\nclaims, including:   (i) counsel rendered ineffective assistance by\n\nfailing to appeal his conviction on the § 1955 gambling count; and\n\n(ii) the government adduced insufficient evidence that he violated\n\n§ 1955.   The district court granted the amendment.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Additional arguments, which Ciampi no longer presses, were as\nfollows: (i) the government concealed evidence from the district\ncourt which demonstrated that the government offered Ciampi the\nplea agreement to cover up government officials’ corrupt\ninvolvement with organized crime figures in the gambling enterprise\nand the murders; (ii) his original counsel rendered ineffective\nassistance by failing to investigate these false representations by\nthe government; and (iii) the plea agreement constituted an invalid\ncontract since Ciampi received no consideration (viz., benefit)\nfrom the agreement.\n\n                                -3-\n\f          On September 19, 2003, in an unpublished opinion, the\n\ndistrict court denied the amended § 2255 petition, holding that the\n\nnew claims asserted in the amended petition – filed some 18 months\n\nafter the final judgment of conviction was entered under § 1955 –\n\nwere   time-barred   by    operation     of    the    one-year     statute    of\n\nlimitations   prescribed    by   section      2255.     Further,    the    court\n\ndetermined that these new claims could not “relate back” to the\n\ntimely pro se petition filed by Ciampi in February 2001, see Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 15(c), in that (i) the ineffective assistance claim\n\nconcerned counsel’s alleged failure to advise Ciampi to appeal\n\nfollowing his § 1955 conviction, whereas the pro se petition\n\naddressed a totally different time in the litigation, viz., the\n\nineffective assistance of counsel in persuading Ciampi to accept\n\nthe government’s plea agreement offer; and (ii) Ciampi’s pro se\n\npetition made no mention of the insufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the § 1955 conviction. Consequently, the district court\n\nruled that the only preserved claim concerned whether Ciampi had\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to appeal and to assert\n\na collateral challenge by virtue of his acceptance of the plea\n\nagreement, viz., whether the district court conducted an adequate\n\ninquiry during the plea colloquy as to whether Ciampi understood\n\nthe waiver provision.\n\n          Alternatively,     the   district     court    denied    the    timely\n\nclaims, as well as the time-barred claims, on the merits.                 As for\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe waiver claim, the court ruled that even though the district\n\ncourt had not specifically asked Ciampi during the plea hearing\n\nwhether he understood the consequences of waiving his rights to\n\nappeal   and    to   assert    collateral     challenges,   the   attendant\n\ncircumstances    nonetheless     demonstrated    that   Ciampi    had   fully\n\nunderstood the waiver.        Finally, after obtaining a certificate of\n\nappealability, Ciampi challenges the dismissal of his petition.\n\n                                     II\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Limitations Period and the “Relation Back” Argument\n\n          First, Ciampi contends that the district court erred in\n\ndismissing, as time-barred, the claims asserted in his amended\n\npetition that counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the\n\nplea process by failing to discuss with him (i) that acceptance of\n\nthe plea agreement would constitute a waiver of his appeal and\n\nhabeas corpus rights, and (ii) whether or not he had a viable\n\nappeal from his gambling conviction.           Ciampi contends that since\n\nthe pro se petition stated that “the waiver in the plea agreement\n\nwas not fully explained to him,” and inasmuch as pro se petitions\n\nare to be liberally construed, this court should supply the omitted\n\nphrase “by the court or his attorney” at the end of that sentence.\n\nCiampi maintains that once we import, from his pro se petition,\n\nthis ineffective assistance claim into his amended petition, it\n\nfollows that his related argument that he had a meritorious and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fpotentially   successful   appeal    from   his    gambling   conviction   –\n\nincluding subordinate issues such as (i) whether the government\n\nestablished all elements of a section 1955 offense, and (ii)\n\nwhether his counsel properly preserved or waived the insufficiency\n\nchallenge for appeal – must necessarily be addressed as part of his\n\namended petition.   We disagree.\n\n          The district court ruling that the pertinent new claims\n\nin Ciampi’s amended October 2002 petition do not relate back to the\n\ntimely pro se petition filed in February 2001 is reviewed only for\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Young v. Lepone, 305 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).2\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 governs amendments to\n\nhabeas petitions in a § 2255 proceeding.          See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Duffus, 174 F.3d 333, 336 (3d Cir. 1999); see also United States\n\nv. Hicks, 283 F.3d 380, 386 (D.C. Cir. 2002), thereby permitting\n\notherwise untimely pleading amendments to “relate back” to the date\n\nof the timely-filed original pleading provided the claim asserted\n\nin the amended plea \"arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\n\noccurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original\n\n\n     2\n      The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA)\nrequires that a federal prisoner submit a habeas corpus petition\nwithin one year from the date upon which the conviction becomes\n“final”. 28 U.S.C. § 2255. As Ciampi failed to appeal from the\ngambling conviction, the one-year period commenced in March 2000,\nwhen the court entered judgment on the plea agreement. See Derman\nv. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2002).      Thus, the\nFebruary 2001 pro se petition was timely, whereas the amended\npetition of October 2002 was not.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fpleading.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(2)(emphasis added).   However, in\n\nthe habeas corpus context, the Rule 15 “relation back” provision is\n\nto be strictly construed, in light of “‘Congress’ decision to\n\nexpedite collateral attacks by placing stringent time restrictions\n\non [them].’”   Mayle v. Felix, ___ U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 2562, 2570\n\n(2005) (citation omitted); see United States v. Espinoza-Saenz, 235\n\nF.3d 501, 505 (10th Cir. 2000) (noting that an overly broad\n\ninterpretation of the Rule 15 term “occurrence” in the context of\n\nhabeas proceedings “would be tantamount to judicial rescission of\n\nAEDPA’s statute of limitations period”).      Accordingly, amended\n\nhabeas corpus claims generally must arise from the “same core\n\nfacts,” and not depend upon events which are separate both in time\n\nand type from the events upon which the original claims depended.\n\nMayle, 125 S. Ct. at 2570 (disallowing relation back, and holding\n\nthat claimed violations in admission of out-of-court statements\n\nwere distinct under Rule 15, inasmuch as one involved a Fifth\n\nAmendment challenge to the defendant’s own pretrial statements, and\n\nthe other involved a Confrontation Clause challenge to videotaped\n\nwitness testimony).\n\n          Under this stringent standard, therefore, the district\n\ncourt did not remotely abuse its discretion in determining that the\n\namended Ciampi claims did not relate back to the pro se petition.\n\nCiampi erroneously posits that it is sufficient under Rule 15 that\n\nboth sets of claims generally related to his “understanding” of his\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fappellate waiver.          Instead, however, Ciampi's pro se petition\n\nrestricts its focus to whether the district court failed to make an\n\nadequate   inquiry     at    the     plea    hearing      –   pursuant   to   its\n\nresponsibility under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(6) –\n\nas to whether Ciampi understood that he was waiving his rights to\n\nappeal or to collaterally challenge his gambling conviction.                   In\n\npertinent part, the Addendum to the Ciampi pro se petition states:\n\n           Can the court accept such a waiver without\n           informing the defendant in detail that such\n           waiver would prevent the defendant from\n           arguing any constitutional or jurisdictional\n           defect found within the indictment?         To\n           compound [petitioner’s] dilemma, he assumed\n           the right to appeal was standard for all\n           defendant(s), and that (sic) the waiver in the\n           plea agreement was not fully explained to him.\n\n(Emphasis added.)     Even if it were to be liberally construed, see,\n\ne.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) (noting that pro\n\nse habeas petitions normally should be construed liberally in\n\npetitioner’s favor); Voravongsa v. A.T. Wall, 349 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 963 (2004), this quoted language\n\nspeaks   only   of   the    court,   and     makes   no   mention   of   Ciampi’s\n\nattorney. Moreover, Ciampi asserted another ineffective assistance\n\nclaim against his attorney in his pro se petition, alleging that\n\nhis counsel failed to investigate the misrepresentations allegedly\n\nmade by the government in the indictment, which Ciampi contends\n\nwould have unearthed evidence of governmental involvement in the\n\nillegal gambling enterprise.           Not only does this suggest that\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fCiampi   –   acting   pro   se   –   adequately   understood     the    required\n\nelements of an “ineffective assistance” claim, but it makes his\n\nomission of any similar claim – that his attorney failed to explain\n\nthe appellate waiver to him – glaring indeed.           As the Supreme Court\n\nrecently made crystal clear, see Mayle, 125 S. Ct. at 2570, a\n\npetitioner does not satisfy the Rule 15 \"relation back\" standard\n\nmerely by raising some type of ineffective assistance in the\n\noriginal petition, and then amending the petition to assert another\n\nineffective assistance claim based upon an entirely distinct type\n\nof attorney misfeasance.         See, e.g., Davenport v. United States,\n\n217 F.3d 1341, 1346 (11th Cir. 2000); Duffus, 174 F.3d at 337.3\n\n             Accordingly,    the     district   court   did    not     abuse   its\n\ndiscretion    in   dismissing      the   above-mentioned      claims    from   the\n\namended petition, and the only habeas claim properly before us on\n\nappeal is the claim that the district court failed to comply with\n\nRule 11(c) during the plea hearing.\n\nB.   Waiver of Right of Appeal and Collateral Challenge\n\n             Ciampi argues that the district court violated Rule\n\n\n     3\n      Ciampi contends that the government did not establish that\nhis involvement in the illegal gambling enterprise was anything\nmore than merely coincidental, hence failed to establish that the\nenterprise “involve[d] five or more persons who conduct, finance,\nmanage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.”\n18 U.S.C. § 1955(b)(1)(ii). Further muddying the waters, Ciampi's\ntrial counsel failed to preserve the insufficiency claim for appeal\nby conceding in open court that “I cannot quarrel with the\nsufficiency of the evidence.” As we conclude that Ciampi’s claims\ndo not relate back under Rule 15(c), however, we need not wade into\nthese matters.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f11(c), in that it failed to specifically inquire during the plea\n\ncolloquy whether he understood that he was waiving his right to\n\nappeal   or    to    collaterally    challenge     the    gambling   conviction.\n\nCiampi relies upon United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 24 (1st\n\nCir.   2001),       where   we   asserted   that   such    a   waiver-of-appeal\n\nprovision normally would not be enforceable unless (i) “the written\n\nplea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement\n\nelucidating the waiver and delineating its scope;” (ii) “the\n\ncourt's interrogation [during the plea hearing] suffices to ensure\n\nthat the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive her\n\nright to appeal her forthcoming sentence,” and (iii) the waiver\n\notherwise constitutes a “miscarriage of justice.”                Id. at 24-25;\n\nsee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N) (noting that court must “address\n\nthe defendant personally in open court . . . [and] inform the\n\ndefendant of, and determine that the defendant understands . . .\n\nthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to\n\nappeal or to collaterally attack the sentence”).                     The Ciampi\n\ncontention fails.\n\n              First, it is undisputed that paragraph 6 of the Ciampi\n\nplea agreement contains a plain expression of the nature of the\n\nwaiver, and that paragraph 4 likewise clearly states its scope:\n\n“This disposition encompasses both the counts of the Indictment and\n\nthe Information to which Defendant is pleading guilty, and the\n\ncount of the Indictment on which the jury found Defendant guilty.”\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f(Emphasis added.)     Ciampi was given a copy of the plea agreement\n\nat the plea hearing, and his counsel signed an acknowledgment that\n\nCiampi had read and understood its provisions.                See Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d at 26 (noting that attorney acknowledgments “furnish prima\n\nfacie evidence of the appellant's knowledge and volition”).\n\n           Second,   turning    to    the   evidence    contained     in   the\n\ntranscript of the plea colloquy, the government recited in open\n\ncourt all the terms of the plea agreement, including the waiver of\n\nappellate and habeas rights.     Immediately thereafter the district\n\ncourt addressed Ciampi and asked “[A]re those the terms of your\n\nagreement with the government as you understand them?”                 Ciampi\n\nanswered \"yes.\"    During the hearing, the court had repeatedly told\n\nCiampi that he could consult with his attorney if he did not\n\nunderstand anything the court said.         Although it is true that the\n\ndistrict court never asked Ciampi specifically or directly: “Do you\n\nunderstand the provision waiving your appellate and habeas rights,”\n\nwe have prescribed no \"mandatory language for such an inquiry\n\nbecause   the   circumstances   will    vary   from    case   to   case,   from\n\ndefendant to defendant, and from plea agreement to plea agreement.\n\nWe caution only that the court's interrogation should be specific\n\nenough to confirm the defendant's understanding of the waiver and\n\nher acquiescence in the relinquishment of rights that it betokens.\"\n\nId. at 24 n.7.     The temporal proximity of the government’s open-\n\ncourt recitation and the district court’s omnibus inquiry satisfy\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fus that Ciampi was not unduly prejudiced by the district court’s\n\nfailure to repeat each of the provisions just enumerated by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n                  Third,   Teeter    is   legally     distinguishable     on   one\n\nespecially significant front. Rule 11(c) was last amended in 1999,\n\nfollowing the Ciampi plea hearing in this case, whereas the Teeter\n\ncase dealt with the amended rule.                Prior to the 1999 amendment,\n\nsome courts had approved waivers even though the district court had\n\nnot engaged in the sort of specific questioning regarding the\n\nwaiver now explicitly required under the new Rule 11(c).                  See id.\n\nat 24 (noting that 1999 amendment – “which was in force when Teeter\n\nchanged her plea – alters the decisional calculus”) (citing United\n\nStates v. Wenger, 58 F.3d 280, 282 (7th Cir. 1995) (upholding a\n\nwaiver despite the absence of specific questioning by the court)).\n\nHere,       the    government’s     recitation   of   the   terms   of   the   plea\n\nagreement, followed immediately by the district court’s inquiry of\n\nCiampi as to whether he understood the import of each of those\n\nterms, arguably satisfied the less specific, pre-1999 version of\n\nRule 11.4\n\n\n\n        4\n      By distinguishing Teeter in this respect, we in no sense\nsanction any diminution in the district court’s important\nresponsibility under amended Rule 11(c), to take all appropriate\nmeasures to ensure that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily\nwaiving his rights of appeal, and a direct and particularized\ninquiry   plainly  remains   among   the   most  efficacious   and\nstraightforward methods to that end. Thus, wherever practicable,\nit should remain the paradigm.\n\n                                          -12-\n\f             Fourth, it is noteworthy that the district court said\n\nnothing else during the plea hearing which remotely would have\n\nnegated     or       counteracted        its     inquiry      regarding        Ciampi’s\n\nunderstanding of the waiver, or misled Ciampi into any false belief\n\nthat he was retaining either his right to appeal or to assert a\n\ncollateral challenge to the gambling conviction.                   Cf. Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d   at   26-27     (finding   Rule     11(c)    violation,      noting      that    in\n\naddition to absence of direct inquiry, the court later confused\n\ndefendant by asking:          \"[D]o you also understand that both you and\n\nthe    government     will    have   a    right    to     appeal   any    sentence      I\n\nimpose?\").\n\n             Finally, our holding does not rest exclusively upon\n\neither the written terms of the plea agreement or the precise words\n\nuttered     during     the    plea   colloquy.          The   ultimate      test      for\n\ndetermining Rule 11(c) compliance continues to be whether, given\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, it fairly can be said that the\n\ndefendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal.\n\nSee Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24 (noting that the district court’s\n\nfailure to make particularized inquiry regarding waiver of rights\n\nof appeal, “will constitute error and may serve to invalidate the\n\nwaiver, depending upon what the record shows as to the defendants'\n\nknowledge (that is, whether the defendant, notwithstanding the\n\nabsence     of   a     particularized          inquiry,    understood       the    full\n\nsignificance     of     the    waiver)     and    the     existence      vel   non     of\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fprejudice”).    Here, we are well satisfied that the totality of the\n\ncircumstances    afford   no    good   reason    to   suppose   that   Ciampi\n\nrealistically could have expected that the government would enter\n\ninto a plea agreement in which it dropped many of the serious\n\ncounts remaining for retrial, arranged for a reduction in his\n\npotential sentence from 30 to 18 years, but then left him the\n\nprerogative to appeal and/or collaterally challenge his gambling\n\nconviction. See id. at 22 (“Allowing a criminal defendant to agree\n\nto a waiver of appeal gives her an additional bargaining chip in\n\nnegotiations with the prosecution;           she may, for example, be able\n\nto   exchange   this   waiver   for    the   government's   assent     to   the\n\ndismissal of other charges.”). Far from creating a “miscarriage of\n\njustice,” id. at 25, the plea agreement in this case plainly\n\nconferred upon Ciampi a considerable benefit and an opportunity to\n\nescape the perils of a retrial, and Ciampi would have been naive\n\nindeed to suppose that he could have his cake (viz., significantly\n\nreduced jail time) and eat it too (viz., an appeal).\n\n           As the record on appeal, viewed in its entirely, amply\n\npersuades us that Ciampi understood the nature and scope of the\n\nwaiver of appeal rights prescribed in the plea agreement, the\n\ndistrict court correctly rejected his claim, and dismissed the\n\namended habeas petition.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f",

As there was no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A twenty-three count indictment was returned against Ciampi in April 1997 relating to his involvement in an illegal gambling operation. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955. Subsequently, Ciampi was convicted by the jury on the &#167; 1955 count, acquitted of four other counts, and no verdicts were reached on the remaining eighteen counts. Ciampi's original trial attorney withdrew his appearance, and the district court appointed new counsel pending a retrial on the latter counts. The government ultimately proposed a plea agreement, whereby Ciampi would plead guilty to two counts upon which the jury had reached no verdict (<i>viz.,</i> conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering and attempting to commit an assaultive crime with a dangerous weapon, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1959(a) &amp; 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the plea hearing conducted on November 1, 1999, Ciampi was provided with a copy of the plea agreement, and the terms of the agreement were recited by government counsel, including the provision waiving any right to appeal or collaterally challenge either the conviction or the sentence. The district court asked whether Ciampi understood the terms of the agreement, and Ciampi replied in the affirmative. Whereupon the district court, on March 1, 2000, imposed a 216-month prison term pursuant to the plea agreement. Judgment was entered on March 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 20, 2001, Ciampi submitted a <i>pro se</i> habeas corpus petition in the federal district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that the district court had failed to inform him during the November 1999 plea colloquy that he was waiving his right to appeal, as well as any right to assert a collateral challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2002, Ciampi, through counsel, submitted an amended &#167; 2255 petition, which asserted several additional claims, including: (i) counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal his conviction on the &#167; 1955 gambling count; and (ii) the government adduced insufficient evidence that he violated &#167; 1955. The district court granted the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 19, 2003, in an unpublished opinion, the district court denied the amended &#167; 2255 petition, holding that the new claims asserted in the amended petition &#8212; filed some 18 months after the final judgment of conviction was entered under &#167; 1955 &#8212; were time-barred by operation of the one-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 2255. Further, the court determined that these new claims could not \"relate back\" to the timely <i>pro se</i> petition filed by Ciampi in February 2001, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), in that (i) the ineffective assistance claim concerned counsel's alleged failure to advise Ciampi to appeal following his &#167; 1955 conviction, whereas the <i>pro se</i> petition addressed a totally different time in the litigation, <i>viz.,</i> the ineffective assistance of counsel in persuading Ciampi to accept the government's plea agreement offer; and (ii) Ciampi's <i>pro se</i> petition made no mention of the insufficiency of the evidence supporting the &#167; 1955 conviction. Consequently, the district court ruled that the only preserved claim concerned whether Ciampi had knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to appeal and to assert a collateral challenge by virtue of his acceptance of the plea agreement, <i>viz.,</i> whether the district court conducted an adequate inquiry during the plea colloquy as to whether Ciampi understood the waiver provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the district court denied the timely claims, as well as the time-barred claims, on the merits. As for the waiver claim, the court ruled that even though the district court had not specifically asked Ciampi during the plea hearing whether he understood the consequences of waiving his rights to appeal and to assert collateral challenges, the attendant circumstances nonetheless demonstrated that Ciampi had fully understood the waiver. Finally, after obtaining a certificate of appealability, Ciampi challenges the dismissal of his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Limitations Period and the \"Relation Back\" Argument</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ciampi contends that the district court erred in dismissing, as time-barred, the claims asserted in his amended petition that counsel rendered ineffective assistance <i>during the plea process</i> by failing to discuss with him (i) that acceptance of the plea agreement would constitute a waiver of his appeal and habeas corpus rights, and (ii) whether or not he had a viable appeal from his gambling conviction. Ciampi contends that since the <i>pro se</i> petition stated that \"the waiver in the plea agreement was not fully explained to him,\" and inasmuch as <i>pro</i> se petitions are to be liberally construed, this court should supply the omitted phrase \"by the court <i>or his attorney</i>\" at the end of that sentence. Ciampi maintains that once we import, from his <i>pro se</i> petition, this ineffective assistance claim into his amended petition, it follows that his related argument that he had a meritorious and potentially successful appeal from his gambling conviction &#8212; including subordinate issues such as (i) whether the government established all elements of a section 1955 offense, and (ii) whether his counsel properly preserved or waived the insufficiency challenge for appeal &#8212; must necessarily be addressed as part of his amended petition. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruling that the pertinent new claims in Ciampi's amended October 2002 petition do not relate back to the timely <i>pro se</i> petition filed in February 2001 is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Young v. Lepone,</i> 305 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 governs amendments to habeas petitions in a &#167; 2255 proceeding. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Duffus,</i> 174 F.3d 333, 336 (3d Cir.1999); <i>see also United States v. Hicks,</i> 283 F.3d 380, 386 (D.C.Cir.2002), thereby permitting otherwise untimely pleading amendments to \"relate back\" to the date of the timely-filed original pleading provided the claim asserted in the amended plea \"arose out of the <i>conduct, transaction, or occurrence</i> set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2)(emphasis added). However, in the habeas corpus context, the Rule 15 \"relation back\" provision is to be strictly construed, in light of \"`Congress' decision to expedite collateral attacks by placing stringent time restrictions on [them].'\" <i>Mayle v. Felix,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 2562, 2570, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005) (citation omitted); <i>see United States v. Espinoza-Saenz,</i> 235 F.3d 501, 505 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that an overly broad interpretation of the Rule 15 term \"occurrence\" in the context of habeas proceedings \"would be tantamount to judicial rescission of AEDPA's statute of limitations period\"). Accordingly, amended habeas corpus claims generally must arise from the \"same core facts,\" and not depend upon events which are separate both in time and type from the events upon which the original claims depended. <i>Mayle,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2570 (disallowing relation back, and holding that claimed violations in admission of out-of-court statements were distinct under Rule 15, inasmuch as one involved a Fifth Amendment challenge to the defendant's own pretrial statements, and the other involved a Confrontation Clause challenge to videotaped witness testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this stringent standard, therefore, the district court did not remotely abuse its discretion in determining that the amended Ciampi claims did not relate back to the <i>pro se</i> petition. Ciampi erroneously posits that it is sufficient under Rule 15 that both sets of claims generally related to his \"understanding\" of his appellate waiver. Instead, however, Ciampi's <i>pro se</i> petition restricts its focus to whether the <i>district court</i> failed to make an adequate inquiry at the plea hearing &#8212; pursuant to its responsibility under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(6) &#8212; as to whether Ciampi understood that he was waiving his rights to appeal or to collaterally challenge his gambling conviction. In pertinent part, the Addendum to the Ciampi <i>pro se</i> petition states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Can the <i>court</i> accept such a waiver without informing the defendant in detail that such waiver would prevent the defendant from arguing any constitutional or jurisdictional defect found within the indictment? To compound [petitioner's] dilemma, he assumed the right to appeal was standard for all defendant(s), and that (sic) the waiver in the plea agreement was not fully explained to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) Even if it were to be liberally construed, <i>see, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble,</i> 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (noting that <i>pro se</i> habeas petitions normally should be construed liberally in petitioner's favor); <i>Voravongsa v. A.T. Wall,</i> 349 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 541 U.S. 963, 124 S.Ct. 1724, 158 L.Ed.2d 407 (2004), this quoted language speaks only of the court, and makes no mention of Ciampi's attorney. Moreover, Ciampi asserted another ineffective assistance claim against his attorney in his <i>pro se</i> petition, alleging that his counsel failed to investigate the misrepresentations allegedly made by the government in the indictment, which Ciampi contends would have unearthed evidence of governmental involvement in the illegal gambling enterprise. Not only does this suggest that Ciampi &#8212; acting <i>pro se</i> &#8212; adequately understood the required elements of an \"ineffective assistance\" claim, but it makes his omission of any similar claim &#8212; that his attorney failed to explain the appellate waiver to him &#8212; glaring indeed. As the Supreme Court recently made crystal clear, <i>see Mayle,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2570, a petitioner does not satisfy the Rule 15 \"relation back\" standard merely by raising some type of ineffective assistance in the original petition, and then amending the petition to assert another ineffective assistance claim based upon an entirely distinct type of attorney misfeasance. <i>See, e.g., Davenport v. United States,</i> 217 F.3d 1341, 1346 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Duffus,</i> 174 F.3d at 337.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the above-mentioned claims from the amended petition, and the only habeas claim properly before us on appeal is the claim that the district court failed to comply with Rule 11(c) during the plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Waiver of Right of Appeal and Collateral Challenge</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ciampi argues that the district court violated Rule 11(c), in that it failed to specifically inquire during the plea colloquy whether he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal or to collaterally challenge the gambling conviction. Ciampi relies upon <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir.2001), where we asserted that such a waiver-of-appeal provision normally would not be enforceable unless (i) \"the written plea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope;\" (ii) \"the court's interrogation [during the plea hearing] suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence,\" <i>and</i> (iii) the waiver otherwise constitutes a \"miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24-25; <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N) (noting that court must \"address the defendant personally in open court ... [and] inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence\"). The Ciampi contention fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is undisputed that paragraph 6 of the Ciampi plea agreement contains a plain expression of the nature of the waiver, and that paragraph 4 likewise clearly states its scope: \"This disposition encompasses both the counts of the Indictment and the Information to which Defendant is pleading guilty, <i>and the count of the Indictment on which the jury found Defendant guilty.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Ciampi was given a copy of the plea agreement at the plea hearing, and his counsel signed an acknowledgment that Ciampi had read and understood its provisions. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26 (noting that attorney acknowledgments \"furnish <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the appellant's knowledge and volition\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, turning to the evidence contained in the transcript of the plea colloquy, the government recited in open court all the terms of the plea agreement, including the waiver of appellate and habeas rights. Immediately thereafter the district court addressed Ciampi and asked \"[A]re those the terms of your agreement with the government as you understand them?\" Ciampi answered \"yes.\" During the hearing, the court had repeatedly told Ciampi that he could consult with his attorney if he did not understand anything the court said. Although it is true that the district court never asked Ciampi specifically or directly: \"Do you understand the provision waiving your appellate and habeas rights,\" we have prescribed no \"mandatory language for such an inquiry because the circumstances will vary from case to case, from defendant to defendant, and from plea agreement to plea agreement. We caution only that the court's interrogation should be specific enough to confirm the defendant's understanding of the waiver and her acquiescence in the relinquishment of rights that it betokens.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24 n. 7. The temporal proximity of the government's open-court recitation and the district court's omnibus inquiry satisfy us that Ciampi was not unduly prejudiced by the district court's failure to repeat each of the provisions just enumerated by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Teeter</i> is legally distinguishable on one especially significant front. Rule 11(c) was last amended in 1999, <i>following</i> the Ciampi plea hearing in this case, whereas the <i>Teeter</i> case dealt with the amended rule. Prior to the 1999 amendment, some courts had approved waivers even though the district court had not engaged in the sort of specific questioning regarding the waiver now explicitly required under the new Rule 11(c). <i>See id.</i> at 24 (noting that 1999 amendment &#8212; \"which was in force when Teeter changed her plea &#8212; alters the decisional calculus\") (citing <i>United States v. Wenger,</i> 58 F.3d 280, 282 (7th Cir.1995) (upholding a waiver despite the absence of specific questioning by the court)). Here, the government's recitation of the terms of the plea agreement, followed immediately by the district court's inquiry of Ciampi as to whether he understood the import of each of those terms, arguably satisfied the less specific, pre-1999 version of Rule 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, it is noteworthy that the district court said nothing else during the plea hearing which remotely would have negated or counteracted its inquiry regarding Ciampi's understanding of the waiver, or misled Ciampi into any false belief that he was retaining either his right to appeal or to assert a collateral challenge to the gambling conviction. <i>Cf. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26-27 (finding Rule 11(c) violation, noting that in addition to absence of direct inquiry, the court later confused defendant by asking: \"[D]o you also understand that both you and the government will have a right to appeal any sentence I impose?\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, our holding does not rest exclusively upon either the written terms of the plea agreement or the precise words uttered during the plea colloquy. The ultimate test for determining Rule 11(c) compliance continues to be whether, given the totality of the circumstances, it fairly can be said that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 24 (noting that the district court's failure to make particularized inquiry regarding waiver of rights of appeal, \"will constitute error and may serve to invalidate the waiver, depending upon what the record shows as to the defendants' knowledge (that is, whether the defendant, notwithstanding the absence of a particularized inquiry, understood the full significance of the waiver) and the existence <i>vel non</i> of prejudice\"). Here, we are well satisfied that the totality of the circumstances afford no good reason to suppose that Ciampi realistically could have expected that the government would enter into a plea agreement in which it dropped many of the serious counts remaining for retrial, arranged for a reduction in his potential sentence from 30 to 18 years, but then left him the prerogative to appeal and/or collaterally challenge his gambling conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 22 (\"Allowing a criminal defendant to agree to a waiver of appeal gives her an additional bargaining chip in negotiations with the prosecution; she may, for example, be able to exchange this waiver for the government's assent to the dismissal of other charges.\"). Far from creating a \"miscarriage of justice,\" <i>id.</i> at 25, the plea agreement in this case plainly conferred upon Ciampi a considerable benefit and an opportunity to escape the perils of a retrial, and Ciampi would have been naive indeed to suppose that he could have his cake (<i>viz.,</i> significantly reduced jail time) and eat it too (<i>viz.,</i> an appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the record on appeal, viewed in its entirely, amply persuades us that Ciampi understood the nature and scope of the waiver of appeal rights prescribed in the plea agreement, the district court correctly rejected his claim, and dismissed the amended habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Additional arguments, which Ciampi no longer presses, were as follows: (i) the government concealed evidence from the district court which demonstrated that the government offered Ciampi the plea agreement to cover up government officials' corrupt involvement with organized crime figures in the gambling enterprise and the murders; (ii) his original counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate these false representations by the government; and (iii) the plea agreement constituted an invalid contract since Ciampi received no consideration (<i>viz.,</i> benefit) from the agreement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) requires that a federal prisoner submit a habeas corpus petition within one year from the date upon which the conviction becomes \"final\". 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. As Ciampi failed to appeal from the gambling conviction, the one-year period commenced in March 2000, when the court entered judgment on the plea agreement<i>See Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, the February 2001 <i>pro se</i> petition was timely, whereas the amended petition of October 2002 was not.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ciampi contends that the government did not establish that his involvement in the illegal gambling enterprise was anything more than merely coincidental, hence failed to establish that the enterprise \"involve[d] five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955(b)(1)(ii). Further muddying the waters, Ciampi's trial counsel failed to preserve the insufficiency claim for appeal by conceding in open court that \"I cannot quarrel with the sufficiency of the evidence.\" As we conclude that Ciampi's claims do not relate back under Rule 15(c), however, we need not wade into these matters</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> By distinguishing<i>Teeter</i> in this respect, we in no sense sanction any diminution in the district court's important responsibility under amended Rule 11(c), to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the defendant is <i>knowingly</i> and <i>voluntarily</i> waiving his rights of appeal, and a direct and particularized inquiry plainly remains among the most efficacious and straightforward methods to that end. Thus, wherever practicable, it should remain the paradigm.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

As there was no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A twenty-three count indictment was returned against Ciampi in April 1997 relating to his involvement in an illegal gambling operation. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955. Subsequently, Ciampi was convicted by the jury on the &#167; 1955 count, acquitted of four other counts, and no verdicts were reached on the remaining eighteen counts. Ciampi's original trial attorney withdrew his appearance, and the district court appointed new counsel pending a retrial on the latter counts. The government ultimately proposed a plea agreement, whereby Ciampi would plead guilty to two counts upon which the jury had reached no verdict (<i>viz.,</i> conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering and attempting to commit an assaultive crime with a dangerous weapon, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1959(a) &amp; 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the plea hearing conducted on November 1, 1999, Ciampi was provided with a copy of the plea agreement, and the terms of the agreement were recited by government counsel, including the provision waiving any right to appeal or collaterally challenge either the conviction or the sentence. The district court asked whether Ciampi understood the terms of the agreement, and Ciampi replied in the affirmative. Whereupon the district court, on March 1, 2000, imposed a 216-month prison term pursuant to the plea agreement. Judgment was entered on March 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 20, 2001, Ciampi submitted a <i>pro se</i> habeas corpus petition in the federal district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that the district court had failed to inform him during the November 1999 plea colloquy that he was waiving his right to appeal, as well as any right to assert a collateral challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2002, Ciampi, through counsel, submitted an amended &#167; 2255 petition, which asserted several additional claims, including: (i) counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal his conviction on the &#167; 1955 gambling count; and (ii) the government adduced insufficient evidence that he violated &#167; 1955. The district court granted the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 19, 2003, in an unpublished opinion, the district court denied the amended &#167; 2255 petition, holding that the new claims asserted in the amended petition &#8212; filed some 18 months after the final judgment of conviction was entered under &#167; 1955 &#8212; were time-barred by operation of the one-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 2255. Further, the court determined that these new claims could not \"relate back\" to the timely <i>pro se</i> petition filed by Ciampi in February 2001, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c), in that (i) the ineffective assistance claim concerned counsel's alleged failure to advise Ciampi to appeal following his &#167; 1955 conviction, whereas the <i>pro se</i> petition addressed a totally different time in the litigation, <i>viz.,</i> the ineffective assistance of counsel in persuading Ciampi to accept the government's plea agreement offer; and (ii) Ciampi's <i>pro se</i> petition made no mention of the insufficiency of the evidence supporting the &#167; 1955 conviction. Consequently, the district court ruled that the only preserved claim concerned whether Ciampi had knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights to appeal and to assert a collateral challenge by virtue of his acceptance of the plea agreement, <i>viz.,</i> whether the district court conducted an adequate inquiry during the plea colloquy as to whether Ciampi understood the waiver provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the district court denied the timely claims, as well as the time-barred claims, on the merits. As for the waiver claim, the court ruled that even though the district court had not specifically asked Ciampi during the plea hearing whether he understood the consequences of waiving his rights to appeal and to assert collateral challenges, the attendant circumstances nonetheless demonstrated that Ciampi had fully understood the waiver. Finally, after obtaining a certificate of appealability, Ciampi challenges the dismissal of his petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Limitations Period and the \"Relation Back\" Argument</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ciampi contends that the district court erred in dismissing, as time-barred, the claims asserted in his amended petition that counsel rendered ineffective assistance <i>during the plea process</i> by failing to discuss with him (i) that acceptance of the plea agreement would constitute a waiver of his appeal and habeas corpus rights, and (ii) whether or not he had a viable appeal from his gambling conviction. Ciampi contends that since the <i>pro se</i> petition stated that \"the waiver in the plea agreement was not fully explained to him,\" and inasmuch as <i>pro</i> se petitions are to be liberally construed, this court should supply the omitted phrase \"by the court <i>or his attorney</i>\" at the end of that sentence. Ciampi maintains that once we import, from his <i>pro se</i> petition, this ineffective assistance claim into his amended petition, it follows that his related argument that he had a meritorious and potentially successful appeal from his gambling conviction &#8212; including subordinate issues such as (i) whether the government established all elements of a section 1955 offense, and (ii) whether his counsel properly preserved or waived the insufficiency challenge for appeal &#8212; must necessarily be addressed as part of his amended petition. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruling that the pertinent new claims in Ciampi's amended October 2002 petition do not relate back to the timely <i>pro se</i> petition filed in February 2001 is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Young v. Lepone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200124\"><a href=\"/opinion/200124/cape-ann-investors-v-lepone/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 governs amendments to habeas petitions in a &#167; 2255 proceeding. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Duffus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763467\"><a href=\"/opinion/763467/united-states-v-clinton-duffus-aka-paul-lewis-beanie-clinton-duffus/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 336 (3d Cir.1999); <i>see also United States v.

However, in the habeas corpus context, the Rule 15 \"relation back\" provision is to be strictly construed, in light of \"`Congress' decision to expedite collateral attacks by placing stringent time restrictions on [them].'\" <i>Mayle v. Felix,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799989\"><a href=\"/opinion/799989/mayle-v-felix/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2562</span></a></span>, 2570, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2005) (citation omitted); <i>see United States v. Espinoza-Saenz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160495\"><a href=\"/opinion/160495/united-states-v-espinoza-saenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, 505 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that an overly broad interpretation of the Rule 15 term \"occurrence\" in the context of habeas proceedings \"would be tantamount to judicial rescission of AEDPA's statute of limitations period\"). Accordingly, amended habeas corpus claims generally must arise from the \"same core facts,\" and not depend upon events which are separate both in time and type from the events upon which the original claims depended. <i>Mayle,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2570 (disallowing relation back, and holding that claimed violations in admission of out-of-court statements were distinct under Rule 15, inasmuch as one involved a Fifth Amendment challenge to the defendant's own pretrial statements, and the other involved a Confrontation Clause challenge to videotaped witness testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this stringent standard, therefore, the district court did not remotely abuse its discretion in determining that the amended Ciampi claims did not relate back to the <i>pro se</i> petition. Ciampi erroneously posits that it is sufficient under Rule 15 that both sets of claims generally related to his \"understanding\" of his appellate waiver. Instead, however, Ciampi's <i>pro se</i> petition restricts its focus to whether the <i>district court</i> failed to make an adequate inquiry at the plea hearing &#8212; pursuant to its responsibility under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(6) &#8212; as to whether Ciampi understood that he was waiving his rights to appeal or to collaterally challenge his gambling conviction. In pertinent part, the Addendum to the Ciampi <i>pro se</i> petition states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Can the <i>court</i> accept such a waiver without informing the defendant in detail that such waiver would prevent the defendant from arguing any constitutional or jurisdictional defect found within the indictment? To compound [petitioner's] dilemma, he assumed the right to appeal was standard for all defendant(s), and that (sic) the waiver in the plea agreement was not fully explained to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) Even if it were to be liberally construed, <i>see, e.g., Estelle v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span> (2004), this quoted language speaks only of the court, and makes no mention of Ciampi's attorney. Moreover, Ciampi asserted another ineffective assistance claim against his attorney in his <i>pro se</i> petition, alleging that his counsel failed to investigate the misrepresentations allegedly made by the government in the indictment, which Ciampi contends would have unearthed evidence of governmental involvement in the illegal gambling enterprise. Not only does this suggest that Ciampi &#8212; acting <i>pro se</i> &#8212; adequately understood the required elements of an \"ineffective assistance\" claim, but it makes his omission of any similar claim &#8212; that his attorney failed to explain the appellate waiver to him &#8212; glaring indeed. As the Supreme Court recently made crystal clear, <i>see Mayle,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2570, a petitioner does not satisfy the Rule 15 \"relation back\" standard merely by raising some type of ineffective assistance in the original petition, and then amending the petition to assert another ineffective assistance claim based upon an entirely distinct type of attorney misfeasance. <i>See, e.g., Davenport v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74680\"><a href=\"/opinion/74680/davenport-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span>, 1346 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Duffus,</i> 174 F.3d at 337.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the above-mentioned claims from the amended petition, and the only habeas claim properly before us on appeal is the claim that the district court failed to comply with Rule 11(c) during the plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Waiver of Right of Appeal and Collateral Challenge</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ciampi argues that the district court violated Rule 11(c), in that it failed to specifically inquire during the plea colloquy whether he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal or to collaterally challenge the gambling conviction. Ciampi relies upon <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2001), where we asserted that such a waiver-of-appeal provision normally would not be enforceable unless (i) \"the written plea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope;\" (ii) \"the court's interrogation [during the plea hearing] suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence,\" <i>and</i> (iii) the waiver otherwise constitutes a \"miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24-25; <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N) (noting that court must \"address the defendant personally in open court ... [and] inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence\"). The Ciampi contention fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is undisputed that paragraph 6 of the Ciampi plea agreement contains a plain expression of the nature of the waiver, and that paragraph 4 likewise clearly states its scope: \"This disposition encompasses both the counts of the Indictment and the Information to which Defendant is pleading guilty, <i>and the count of the Indictment on which the jury found Defendant guilty.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Ciampi was given a copy of the plea agreement at the plea hearing, and his counsel signed an acknowledgment that Ciampi had read and understood its provisions. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26 (noting that attorney acknowledgments \"furnish <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the appellant's knowledge and volition\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, turning to the evidence contained in the transcript of the plea colloquy, the government recited in open court all the terms of the plea agreement, including the waiver of appellate and habeas rights. Immediately thereafter the district court addressed Ciampi and asked \"[A]re those the terms of your agreement with the government as you understand them?\" Ciampi answered \"yes.\" During the hearing, the court had repeatedly told Ciampi that he could consult with his attorney if he did not understand anything the court said. Although it is true that the district court never asked Ciampi specifically or directly: \"Do you understand the provision waiving your appellate and habeas rights,\" we have prescribed no \"mandatory language for such an inquiry because the circumstances will vary from case to case, from defendant to defendant, and from plea agreement to plea agreement. We caution only that the court's interrogation should be specific enough to confirm the defendant's understanding of the waiver and her acquiescence in the relinquishment of rights that it betokens.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24 n. 7. The temporal proximity of the government's open-court recitation and the district court's omnibus inquiry satisfy us that Ciampi was not unduly prejudiced by the district court's failure to repeat each of the provisions just enumerated by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Teeter</i> is legally distinguishable on one especially significant front. Rule 11(c) was last amended in 1999, <i>following</i> the Ciampi plea hearing in this case, whereas the <i>Teeter</i> case dealt with the amended rule. Prior to the 1999 amendment, some courts had approved waivers even though the district court had not engaged in the sort of specific questioning regarding the waiver now explicitly required under the new Rule 11(c). <i>See id.</i> at 24 (noting that 1999 amendment &#8212; \"which was in force when Teeter changed her plea &#8212; alters the decisional calculus\") (citing <i>United States v. Wenger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698399\"><a href=\"/opinion/698399/united-states-v-dennis-l-wenger/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 282 (7th Cir.1995) (upholding a waiver despite the absence of specific questioning by the court)). Here, the government's recitation of the terms of the plea agreement, followed immediately by the district court's inquiry of Ciampi as to whether he understood the import of each of those terms, arguably satisfied the less specific, pre-1999 version of Rule 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, it is noteworthy that the district court said nothing else during the plea hearing which remotely would have negated or counteracted its inquiry regarding Ciampi's understanding of the waiver, or misled Ciampi into any false belief that he was retaining either his right to appeal or to assert a collateral challenge to the gambling conviction. <i>Cf. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26-27 (finding Rule 11(c) violation, noting that in addition to absence of direct inquiry, the court later confused defendant by asking: \"[D]o you also understand that both you and the government will have a right to appeal any sentence I impose?\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, our holding does not rest exclusively upon either the written terms of the plea agreement or the precise words uttered during the plea colloquy. The ultimate test for determining Rule 11(c) compliance continues to be whether, given the totality of the circumstances, it fairly can be said that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 24 (noting that the district court's failure to make particularized inquiry regarding waiver of rights of appeal, \"will constitute error and may serve to invalidate the waiver, depending upon what the record shows as to the defendants' knowledge (that is, whether the defendant, notwithstanding the absence of a particularized inquiry, understood the full significance of the waiver) and the existence <i>vel non</i> of prejudice\"). Here, we are well satisfied that the totality of the circumstances afford no good reason to suppose that Ciampi realistically could have expected that the government would enter into a plea agreement in which it dropped many of the serious counts remaining for retrial, arranged for a reduction in his potential sentence from 30 to 18 years, but then left him the prerogative to appeal and/or collaterally challenge his gambling conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 22 (\"Allowing a criminal defendant to agree to a waiver of appeal gives her an additional bargaining chip in negotiations with the prosecution; she may, for example, be able to exchange this waiver for the government's assent to the dismissal of other charges.\"). Far from creating a \"miscarriage of justice,\" <i>id.</i> at 25, the plea agreement in this case plainly conferred upon Ciampi a considerable benefit and an opportunity to escape the perils of a retrial, and Ciampi would have been naive indeed to suppose that he could have his cake (<i>viz.,</i> significantly reduced jail time) and eat it too (<i>viz.,</i> an appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the record on appeal, viewed in its entirely, amply persuades us that Ciampi understood the nature and scope of the waiver of appeal rights prescribed in the plea agreement, the district court correctly rejected his claim, and dismissed the amended habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Additional arguments, which Ciampi no longer presses, were as follows: (i) the government concealed evidence from the district court which demonstrated that the government offered Ciampi the plea agreement to cover up government officials' corrupt involvement with organized crime figures in the gambling enterprise and the murders; (ii) his original counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate these false representations by the government; and (iii) the plea agreement constituted an invalid contract since Ciampi received no consideration (<i>viz.,</i> benefit) from the agreement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) requires that a federal prisoner submit a habeas corpus petition within one year from the date upon which the conviction becomes \"final\". 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. As Ciampi failed to appeal from the gambling conviction, the one-year period commenced in March 2000, when the court entered judgment on the plea agreement<i>See Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, the February 2001 <i>pro se</i> petition was timely, whereas the amended petition of October 2002 was not.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ciampi contends that the government did not establish that his involvement in the illegal gambling enterprise was anything more than merely coincidental, hence failed to establish that the enterprise \"involve[d] five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955(b)(1)(ii). Further muddying the waters, Ciampi's trial counsel failed to preserve the insufficiency claim for appeal by conceding in open court that \"I cannot quarrel with the sufficiency of the evidence.\" As we conclude that Ciampi's claims do not relate back under Rule 15(c), however, we need not wade into these matters</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> By distinguishing<i>Teeter</i> in this respect, we in no sense sanction any diminution in the district court's important responsibility under amended Rule 11(c), to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the defendant is <i>knowingly</i> and <i>voluntarily</i> waiving his rights of appeal, and a direct and particularized inquiry plainly remains among the most efficacious and straightforward methods to that end. Thus, wherever practicable, it should remain the paradigm.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
