Robert E. Keeton, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n              Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Harvey A.

Aliosi, Jr., Peter\nN. Kochansky, and Goulston & Storrs were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          November 29, 2004\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge. These two appeals, consolidated at\n\nthe request of all parties, raise First Amendment challenges to the\n\nrejection of proposed advertising submitted to a Boston-area public\n\ntransit system, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority\n\n(\"MBTA\").\n\n              In Change the Climate, Inc. v. MBTA, No. 03-2285, the\n\nMBTA rejected three advertisements designed to raise questions\n\nabout marijuana laws on the stated ground that the ads would\n\npromote illegal use of marijuana among children.              The other case,\n\nRidley   v.    MBTA,   No.   03-1970,    involves    the    rejection   of   one\n\nadvertisement from a religious group on the grounds that the ad\n\nviolated the MBTA's guidelines prohibiting advertisements which\n\ndemean or disparage an individual or group of individuals. Several\n\nFirst Amendment doctrines are at issue.\n\n              Change the Climate brought suit in federal court on May\n\n18, 2000.     The lead argument is that the MBTA advertising space is\n\na   designated     public    forum      and   so    the    rejection    of   the\n\nadvertisements is unconstitutional.           Change the Climate strongly\n\nurges the court to decide the forum issue, arguing:\n\n              Determining the nature of the \"forum\" at issue\n              is a mandatory first step in deciding a First\n              Amendment case such as the present one because\n              \"[t]he extent to which the government can\n              control access depends on the nature of the\n              relevant forum.\"    Cornelius v. NAACP Legal\n              Defense and Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800\n              (1985). Both the protection provided for the\n              plaintiff's First Amendment expression and the\n              government's    ability   to   restrict    the\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           plaintiff's speech vary according to the forum\n           in which the speech is proposed. Perry Educ.\n           Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460\n           U.S. 37, 44-46 (1983).    A reviewing court's\n           first action, therefore, must be to conduct a\n           \"deliberate analysis, e.g., Chicago Acorn v.\n           Metro. Pier & Expo. Auth., 150 F.3d 695, 702\n           (7th Cir. 1998)\" and determine \"the nature of\n           the forum first.\" New Eng. Reg'l Council of\n           Carpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 20 n.4 (1st\n           Cir.   2002).      In   Kinton,   this   Court\n           specifically rejected as \"awkward\" skipping\n           this crucial forum analysis as a first step\n           \"because it requires a reviewing tribunal to\n           know the results of a test before knowing\n           which test applies.\" Id.\n\nBecause the MBTA has created a designated public forum, it argues,\n\n\"a content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate\n\na compelling state interest,\" and the MBTA has violated these\n\nstandards.     In addition, Change the Climate argues, no matter what\n\nthe   nature    of   the   forum,   the    MBTA's    rejection   of   its   ads\n\nconstitutes viewpoint discrimination.               It also argues that the\n\nguidelines under which the ads were rejected must be narrow and\n\nobjective and cannot leave excessive discretion in state officials,\n\nand the MBTA guidelines do not comply. Finally, Change the Climate\n\nargues the district court erred in not awarding it attorney's fees.\n\n             Lischen Ridley filed suit in state court on January 8,\n\n2002, on behalf of herself and other members of the Church with the\n\nGood News (\"Good News\").        The MBTA removed the Ridley action to\n\nfederal court.       The suit alleged that the MBTA lacked compelling\n\nreasons to reject the advertisement, that the rejection of the\n\nadvertisement was the product of viewpoint discrimination, and that\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe MBTA's guideline involved was not narrowly tailored and was too\n\nvague to withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n             Although Ridley did not discuss the forum issue in her\n\nbrief, the brief did note that the outcome of the forum issue in\n\nChange the Climate would govern the Ridley case.                        Ridley's reply\n\nbrief also argued the public forum line of cases and expressly\n\nchallenged    the     MBTA's      assertion       that    the   restrictions        were\n\nreasonable, a standard of review which applies if the forum was not\n\na public forum.        And at oral argument, in response to multiple\n\nquestions from the court as to the relationship of Ridley's claims\n\nto the forum analysis issue, counsel for Ridley argued that the\n\nforum analysis       was     relevant   to    Ridley's      claims      and     could   be\n\ndispositive of those claims.            For example, Ridley argued that if\n\nthe MBTA had created a public forum as argued in Change the\n\nClimate,    she     would    be   entitled    to    judgment       on    that    ground.\n\nFurther, counsel for both Ridley and Change the Climate moved to\n\nconsolidate the appeals on the grounds that common issues of fact\n\nand   law    were    present      and   the   same       lawyers    represent       both\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n             The district court denied all forms of relief to Ridley\n\non June 5, 2003.            The court assumed that the MBTA advertising\n\nprogram constituted a non-public forum and held that the rejections\n\nof    Ridley's      advertisements       were       not    based        on    viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination,       but     rather    on    a    valid    \"content         restriction\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fprohibiting demeaning or disparaging content.\"                   The trial court\n\nheld    that    the     factual   record    based   on   the    stipulation      was\n\ninsufficiently clear for it to grant the relief Ridley requested on\n\nwhether the guidelines were viewpoint discriminatory on their face\n\nor whether they were too vague and gave MBTA administrators too\n\nmuch discretion.          Nonetheless, the court revisited the Ridley\n\nguideline question when it issued its Change the Climate opinion.\n\n               On August 1, 2003, the district court also found for the\n\nMBTA in    Change       the   Climate,    again   avoiding     the   forum   issue.\n\nHowever, consistent with the law on non-public fora, the court\n\nreviewed the MBTA's guidelines and its decision to reject these ads\n\nunder a reasonableness test.              The court found that each of the\n\nthree    advertisements        provided    misleading    messages      about     the\n\nlegality of marijuana, and that two of the ads targeted minors.                   As\n\nsuch,   the     court    held,    the    MBTA's   rejection    of    the   ads   was\n\nreasonable and not viewpoint discriminatory.                 The district court\n\nalso found that the MBTA guideline prohibiting materials which\n\npromote illegal activity was not viewpoint discriminatory on its\n\nface.    Nonetheless, in its Change the Climate opinion, the court\n\nalso said that the Ridley guideline prohibiting demeaning or\n\ndisparaging material was \"somewhat vague\" on its face and \"still\n\nleaves too much room for arbitrary decisions.\"               As a result, in its\n\njudgment, the district court ordered:\n\n               The court retains jurisdiction to consider any\n               well supported motion for modification of the\n\n                                         -5-\n\f           MBTA's amended guidelines and for modification\n           of this Final Judgment grounded on some change\n           of   law  or   change   of  relevant   factual\n           circumstances occurring after the date of this\n           judgment. The motion must be accompanied by a\n           precise showing of the change of law or change\n           of relevant factual circumstances.\n\nThe court also rejected Change the Climate's motion for attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n           In this opinion covering both cases, we address the\n\nparties' arguments about what type of \"forum\" the MBTA advertising\n\nprogram constitutes.     We hold first that the MBTA did not create a\n\npublic forum.    Second, we address whether the MBTA's pertinent\n\nguidelines and its decisions to reject both parties' advertising\n\nare unlawful as a form of viewpoint discrimination or as an\n\nunreasonable use of the forum.       We hold that the guidelines on\n\ntheir face are viewpoint neutral and reasonable, and that the\n\ndecision   to   reject    the   Ridley   ad    was   neither   viewpoint\n\ndiscriminatory nor unreasonable.         However,    we hold that the\n\nrejection of the three Change the Climate ads constituted viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination and was unreasonable.          Finally, we consider the\n\nchallenge that the guidelines at issue in both cases are vague and\n\ndelegate too much discretion to the MBTA's employees. We hold that\n\nthe pertinent guidelines are not facially unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f                                         I.\n\n                                        Facts\n\n            There are no disputed facts in this case, only disputes\n\nas to what conclusions are to be drawn from those facts.                Although\n\nonly the present 2003 MBTA advertising policy is at issue, we\n\nrecount the history of dealing between the parties, which is\n\npertinent both to the public forum claim and to other claims.               Some\n\nfacts are reserved for discussion as to the particular party.\n\nA.   Facts as to the MBTA\n\n            The   MBTA    is   a   quasi-governmental     organization     whose\n\npurpose is to provide public transportation in the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, § 5.         The MBTA provides\n\ntransportation to 1.2 million customers daily and to 2.5 million\n\npeople in the Greater Boston area.              For many riders, the MBTA is\n\nthe only transportation option available.                 The MBTA operates\n\napproximately 170 bus routes, four subway lines, a 13-branch\n\ncommuter rail network, and six ferry service routes.               The MBTA has\n\npartnered    with       the    Boston     School    Department     to    provide\n\ntransportation to up to 60,000 Boston public school students\n\nannually.    The MBTA distributed approximately 15,000 to 20,000\n\npasses to Boston students, the vast majority of whom were in high\n\nschool.\n\n            The principal purpose of the MBTA advertising program is\n\nto   generate     and    maximize   revenue.       The   MBTA    has    statutory\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdirectives both to \"maximize and increase total fare revenue and\n\nridership,\" as well as to \"establish and implement policies that\n\nprovide for the maximization of nontransportation revenues from all\n\nsources.\"    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, § 11.    The advertising program\n\neffectuates    this   second   purpose.   The   MBTA   has   about   40,000\n\nadvertising spaces, including interior \"car card\" displays in\n\nbuses, trains, and trolleys, king size and tail-light exterior\n\ndisplays on buses, and station and platform displays.\n\n            Through a private advertising contractor, Viacom Outdoor\n\nof Braintree (\"Viacom\"), the MBTA attempts to sell all of its\n\nadvertising space at the usual commercial rates.         If all space is\n\nnot sold at those rates, the MBTA policy is first that it may,\n\nwithout cost to itself, \"display advertisements or announcements\n\ncalculated (i) to increase its revenue, public travel, or goodwill\n\nor (ii) as compensation to companies which provide beneficial\n\nservices to the Authority or (iii) to be otherwise in the public\n\ninterest.\"    Only if there then remains advertising space unsold\n\ndoes the MBTA, as a third choice, sell advertisements at a reduced\n\nrate to nonprofit, tax-exempt public charities or governmental\n\nagencies to fill the remaining space.       The MBTA charges a fee of\n\n50% of the full commercial advertising rate to those nonprofit\n\norganizations. The advertisements at issue in both cases here fall\n\ninto this last category. All advertisements, of whatever type, are\n\nsubject to guidelines.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            The MBTA recognizes that its two statutory directives,\n\nmaximizing       fare    revenue        and    ridership     and    maximizing   non-\n\ntransportation revenue, can at times be at odds.                          In numerous\n\ninstances    over       the    years,    the    MBTA   has   received     significant\n\ncomplaints from its customers about particular advertisements. The\n\nMBTA    management       was    concerned      such    complaints    would   threaten\n\nridership and fare revenue.              Often those ads had been placed by the\n\nMBTA's advertising contractor without seeking prior MBTA approval.\n\nThe MBTA then reviewed the advertisements; usually the contractor\n\nhad violated the guidelines by accepting the advertisements.                      The\n\nMBTA has, accordingly, from the inception of its advertising\n\nprogram     in    1992,        adopted     both     substantive     and    procedural\n\nguidelines, described below, to limit the types of advertisements\n\nit would accept.         Indeed, in attempting to increase ridership, the\n\nMBTA initiated a Courtesy Counts program and distributes a brochure\n\nthat says: \"We're committed to courtesy.\"\n\nB.     Facts as to Plaintiffs' Advertisements\n\n     1.     Change the Climate\n\n            Change the Climate, a not-for-profit group, conducts\n\nprovocative advertising campaigns in order to generate debate about\n\nthe laws criminalizing the use of marijuana. It has conducted such\n\nadvertising       campaigns       in     Washington,       D.C.,    in    part   using\n\nadvertising on the Metro transit system.                 It sought to do the same\n\nin Boston, starting in 1999, by submitting three advertisements\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\fdesigned to catch people's attention and make them rethink the\n\nwisdom of the drug laws.\n\n           The first advertisement, (the \"Teen Ad\"), is a color\n\nphotograph of a teenage girl with a baseball cap on backwards, with\n\na caption saying: \"Smoking pot is not cool, but we're not stupid,\n\nya know.       Marijuana is NOT cocaine or heroin.            Tell us the\n\ntruth . . .\"    Change the Climate sought to place this advertisement\n\non poster cards on the inside of buses.\n\n           The second advertisement, (the \"Mother Ad\"), contains a\n\npicture of an adult female who is writing on a white board, saying:\n\n\"I've got three great kids.          I love them more than anything.         I\n\ndon't want them to smoke pot.           But I know jail is a lot more\n\ndangerous than smoking pot.\"         Change the Climate sought to place\n\nthis advertisement in MBTA subway stations.\n\n           The third advertisement, (the \"Police Ad\"), is a color\n\nphotograph of two policemen standing in front of an American flag,\n\nwith   text    stating:    \"Police    are   too   important   .    .    .   too\n\nvaluable . . . too good . . . to waste on arresting people for\n\nmarijuana when real criminals are on the loose.\"                  Change the\n\nClimate sought to run this ad on the exterior of buses, as it had\n\ndone earlier in the Washington, D.C. transit system.               All three\n\nadvertisements      also      contain       the    web   site          address,\n\nwww.changetheclimate.org.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f                 The MBTA's marketing director, Lucy Shorter, rejected the\n\nads in January 2000.              The reasons stated were that (1) the three\n\nads promote the use of marijuana, and (2) the three ads were really\n\n\"reform\" ads as part of an effort to legalize marijuana and as such\n\nwere in conflict with the MBTA's policies on drugs and alcohol.\n\nShe attached to her rejection letter the MBTA's workplace rules on\n\ndrug     and      alcohol   use,     the    advertising      guidelines,   and    the\n\nprohibition on advertising tobacco products. It appears the MBTA's\n\n\"policies\" on drugs to which she referred were internal MBTA\n\nworkplace rules.            There were no advertising guidelines dealing\n\nspecifically with marijuana or other drugs.                  The MBTA continued to\n\nreject the ads for different stated reasons at later times, as\n\ndiscussed below.            In sum, the MBTA's 2003 revised guidelines\n\nprohibit advertisements which promote the use of illegal goods or\n\nservices or unlawful conduct.               The MBTA has stated that each of the\n\nads promoted illegal use of marijuana by juveniles.\n\n       2.        Ridley\n\n                 Good News has advertised in the past on the radio, in the\n\nYellow      Pages,    in    the    newspaper,    and   via    posted   messages   on\n\nvehicles, including a motor home.\n\n                 On November 29, 2001, Ridley submitted the first of what\n\nwould       be    three     advertisements       to    the    MBTA's   advertising\n\nrepresentative, Viacom.             The copy read:\n\n                 Christians in the Bible never\n                 observed \"Christmas\"\n\n                                     -11-\n\f              neither did they believe in lies\n              about Santa Claus, flying reindeer\n              elves and drunken parties.\n              How can you honor Jesus with lies?\n              prophet-andre.com\n\nViacom initially balked at running the advertisement, saying it\n\nfell afoul of the MBTA's then-guideline (since replaced) permitting\n\nit to exclude any \"advertisement that is indecent as to child\n\nviewers, or is of a nature to frighten children, either emotionally\n\nor physically.\"     After a delay of two weeks and after Ridley's ACLU\n\nattorneys contacted        the   MBTA,     the    MBTA    decided    to    allow   the\n\nadvertisement on December 15, 2001, for a four week contract.                      The\n\nadvertisement      was    displayed   at    the    Park     Street   and    Downtown\n\nCrossing MBTA stations, two major stations.\n\n              On December 26, 2001, Ridley asked the MBTA to change the\n\ncontent of the advertisement that was posted in the MBTA system for\n\nthe last two weeks of her existing contract.                The new copy stated:\n\n              The Bible says in Rev 12:9 \"And Satan which\n              deceiveth the whole world.\" Yes, Satan set up\n              over a thousand false religions in the world\n              causing wars, racism and hatred in the world.\n              There is only one true religion. All the rest\n              are false. www.prophet-andre.com\n\nThe   MBTA     rejected    the   advertisement,          finding    both   that    the\n\nadvertisement's own text conflicted with a guideline and that the\n\ntext referenced a website which, upon examination, contained text\n\nthat violated that same guideline.1                The then-extant guideline\n\n\n      1\n          The website read, in part,\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fread: \"The MBTA will not accept advertisements . . . that denigrate\n\ngroups    based    on   gender,   religion,     race,      ethnic   or   political\n\naffiliation       for   display   in   and    upon   the   Authority's     transit\n\nfacilities.\"\n\n            Ridley sought a preliminary injunction to force the MBTA\n\nto post the second advertisement.             The district court denied the\n\nrequest on January 28, 2002, and Ridley filed an interlocutory\n\nappeal with this court.            As recounted below, that appeal was\n\nmooted.\n\n            The MBTA promulgated a new set of \"Interim Guidelines\n\nRegulating MBTA Advertising\" on April 12, 2002.                 One of the 2002\n\nguidelines provided that the MBTA \"shall not display or maintain\n\nany advertisement\" that is:\n\n            Demeaning or disparaging. The advertisement\n            contains material that demeans or disparages\n            an individual or group of individuals on the\n            basis of race, color, religion, national\n            origin, ancestry, gender, age, disability,\n            ethnicity, or sexual orientation.\n\nThe revised 2002 guidelines also reflected the results of an MBTA\n\ninternal debate over when the MBTA would look at the contents of a\n\nwebsite listed in an advertisement.             The MBTA had considered the\n\n\n\n     These are some of the false religion [sic] Satan set up:\n     CATHOLICS\n     BAPTISTS\n     PENTECOSTALS\n     JEHOVAH WITNESSES\n     MUSLIMS\n     SO CALLED JEWISH\n\n                                       -13-\n\flisted   website     when     initially         rejecting     Ridley's       second\n\nadvertisement.      Under the 2002 guidelines, the contents of a\n\nreferenced website would only be considered and judged under the\n\nguidelines when \"the message or sponsorship of the advertisement\n\ncannot reasonably be determined without reference\" to that website.\n\nThe   2002    guidelines    formalized      a    more    comprehensive       review\n\nprocedure with four different layers of scrutiny (by Viacom, the\n\nMBTA Contract Administrator, the MBTA General Counsel, and the MBTA\n\nGeneral Manager) before any advertisement could be rejected based\n\non the guidelines.\n\n             The MBTA told Ridley on April 25, 2002, that under these\n\nnew guidelines, it would accept her second advertisement. Based on\n\nthis change of stance, this court dismissed Ridley's appeal as moot\n\non July 26, 2002.\n\n             By this time, Ridley no longer wanted to post her second\n\nadvertisement.       On     June   13,   2002,     she      submitted    a    third\n\nadvertisement to the MBTA, the one now at issue.                The ad stated:\n\n             The Bible teaches that there is only one\n             religion.   There are no scriptures in the\n             Bible that teach that God set up the Catholic\n             religion,    the   Baptist    religion,   the\n             Pentecostal religion, the Jehovah's Witness\n             religion or the Muslim religion.        These\n             religions are false.     The Bible says in\n             Revelation 9:12, \"And Satan, which deceiveth\n             the whole world.\" The whole world is going to\n             hell if they do not turn from their ungodly\n             ways. God sent Prophet Andre into this world\n             to teach the people the Truth.\n             www.prophetandre.com.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fThe MBTA rejected this third advertisement in writing on August 14,\n\n2002, after the full review procedure, on the basis that the ad\n\ndemeaned or disparaged a list of specific religions in violation of\n\nthe 2002 guideline.\n\n          On January 17, 2003, the MBTA issued a revised third set\n\nof guidelines.2    Under the 2003 guidelines, the MBTA \"shall not\n\ndisplay\" advertisements that are:\n\n          Demeaning or disparaging. The advertisement\n          contains material that demeans or disparages\n          an individual or group of individuals.     For\n          purposes    of    determining    whether    an\n          advertisement contains such material, the MBTA\n          will determine whether a reasonably prudent\n          person, knowledgeable of the MBTA's ridership\n          and using prevailing community standards,\n          would believe that the advertisement contains\n          material that ridicules or mocks, is abusive\n          or hostile to, or debases the dignity or\n          stature of, an individual or group of\n          individuals.\n\nThe MBTA concluded that the third advertisement did not comply with\n\nthe 2003 guidelines.\n\n          The     2003   guidelines     explicitly   articulated   other\n\nprohibitions as well:    the MBTA will not accept advertisements for\n\ntobacco products or ads containing a depiction of firearms or\n\ngraphic violence, or ads that promote use of illegal goods or\n\nservices or unlawful conduct.         The guidelines also prohibit ads\n\n\n\n     2\n      Those guidelines were the result of the work of an advisory\nboard constituted by the MBTA after the district court issued its\ninterlocutory order in Change the Climate v. MBTA, 214 F. Supp. 2d\n135 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\n                                 -15-\n\fcontaining profanity, obscene or sexually prurient material or nude\n\nimages   (as    those   terms   are   defined   in   state    law),   false   or\n\nmisleading     commercial   speech,     libelous     speech,    or    copyright\n\ninfringing speech.        The guidelines further prohibit \"political\n\ncampaign speech,\" defined as: \"speech that (1) refers to a specific\n\nballot question, initiative, petition, or referendum, or (2) refers\n\nto any candidate for public office.\"         Finally, the 2003 guidelines\n\nprohibit any advertisement that contains, implies, or declares an\n\nendorsement by the MBTA or the state.\n\n                                      II.\n\n               We engage in de novo review of ultimate conclusions of\n\nlaw and mixed questions of law and fact in First Amendment cases.\n\nHurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\n\n515 U.S. 557, 567 (1995); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S.,\n\nInc., 466 U.S. 485, 501 (1984).\n\n           Change the Climate argues that the MBTA has created a\n\ndesignated     public   forum   and   thus   its   decision    to    reject   any\n\nadvertising must meet strict scrutiny standards.                 Public forum\n\nanalysis itself has been criticized as unhelpful in many contexts,\n\nand particularly this one where the government is operating a\n\ncommercial enterprise earning income from permitting advertising.\n\nSee, e.g., Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-24,\n\nat 992 (2d ed. 1988) (\"[W]hether or not a given place is deemed a\n\n'public forum' is ordinarily less significant than the nature of\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe speech restriction--despite the Court's rhetoric.\"); Frederick\n\nSchauer, Principles, Institutions, and the First Amendment, 112\n\nHarv. L. Rev. 84, 97 (1998) (\"Of all of the paths down which the\n\nCourt might go in dealing with the government enterprise cases, the\n\nso-called 'forum doctrine' appears least satisfactory.\").             Change\n\nthe Climate    relies    heavily   on   the   public   forum   argument   and\n\nrequests that the issue be decided.\n\n            The Supreme Court has discussed different types of fora:\n\ntraditional public fora, designated public fora, and non-public\n\nfora. See discussion in Gerald Gunther, Constitutional Law 1292-94\n\n(12th ed. 1991); Tribe, supra,          § 12-24, at 986-97.      Change the\n\nClimate argues that the standard of review for speech restrictions\n\nin a designated public forum is strict scrutiny.               Ridley admits\n\nthat a non-public forum (sometimes called a limited public forum)\n\nusually   results   in   application     of   a   lesser   \"reasonableness\"\n\nstandard.   We accept arguendo3 these premises that strict scrutiny\n\napplies to a public forum's exclusion of speech.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Contrary to Ridley's assumption, designation of the type of\nforum does not always dictate the standard of review. For example,\nstrict scrutiny may not always apply to a public forum. See Denver\nArea Educ. Telecomm. Consortium v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 741-42 (1996)\n(\"[T]he First Amendment embodies an overarching commitment to\nprotect speech from government regulation through close judicial\nscrutiny, thereby enforcing the Constitution's constraints, but\nwithout imposing judicial formulas so rigid that they become a\nstraitjacket that disables the government from responding to\nserious problems.\").\n\n                                   -17-\n\f             Plaintiffs   argue     that   while    the   MBTA's   advertising\n\nprogram is not a traditional public forum, the MBTA effectively has\n\ncreated a designated public forum for the expression of ideas\n\nbecause it has accepted a range of advertisements on its vehicles\n\nand in its stations.      The MBTA says it has not created a public\n\nforum at all.     If it has, the MBTA insists that it is at most a\n\nlimited public forum,4 which is the equivalent of a non-public\n\nforum, and that its rejection of the advertisements is within the\n\nlimits appropriate to a non-public forum.\n\nA.   Forum Analysis\n\n             The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government\n\nmust have an affirmative intent to create a public forum in order\n\nfor a designated public forum to arise.             “The government does not\n\ncreate   a   public   forum    by   inaction   or    by   permitting   limited\n\ndiscourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum\n\nfor public discourse.”        Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802.          To determine\n\nthat intent, courts must consider both explicit expressions about\n\nintent and “ the policy and practice of the government to ascertain\n\n\n     4\n      The phrase \"limited public forum\" has been used in different\nways. We used the phrase \"limited public forum\" as a synonym for\n\"designated public forum\" in Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 26\n(1st Cir. 1997), and again in New England Reg'l Council of\nCarpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2002). On the other\nhand, we used the phrase \"limited public forum\" as a synonym for\n\"nonpublic forum\" in Fund for Cmty. Progress v. Kane, 943 F.3d 137,\n138 (1st Cir. 1991). This confusion is echoed elsewhere. See,\ne.g., New York Magazine v. Metro. Transit Auth., 136 F.3d 123, 128\n& n.2 (2d Cir. 1998). We adopt the usage equating limited public\nforum with non-public forum and do not discuss the issue further.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fwhether it intended to designate a place not traditionally open to\n\nassembly and debate as a public forum.\"              Id.    We also \"examine[]\n\nthe nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive\n\nactivity to discern the government’s intent.\"                  Id.   As to the\n\nnature of the property, the MBTA does run advertisements and so\n\nthere is nothing inherent in the property which precludes its use\n\nfor some expressive activity. That nonetheless leaves the issue of\n\nwhether particular expressive activity may be inconsistent with the\n\nnature of the property.      The MBTA has determined that some types of\n\nexpressive    activity   are    not    consistent      with    the   commercial\n\nenterprise it runs.\n\n            In the 2003 advertising guidelines, the MBTA states\n\nexpressly that \"[t]he MBTA intends that its facilities constitute\n\nnonpublic    forums   that     are    subject   to    the     viewpoint-neutral\n\nrestrictions set forth below.\"         Nonetheless, a statement of intent\n\ncontradicted by consistent actual policy and practice would not be\n\nenough to support the MBTA's argument.\n\n             Change the Climate argues that we should give little\n\nweight to this express statement of intent: paying it heed would\n\nallow a government the opportunity impermissibly to censor merely\n\nby newly labeling the forum in question a non-public forum.                 The\n\npast history of characterization of a forum may well be relevant;\n\nbut that does not mean a present characterization about a forum may\n\nbe disregarded.    The government is free to change the nature of any\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fnontraditional forum as it wishes.           Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802.\n\nThus, even if MBTA's previous intent was to maintain a designated\n\npublic forum, it would be free to decide in good faith to close the\n\nforum at any time.      There is no evidence that the 2003 changes were\n\nadopted as a mere pretext to reject plaintiff's advertisements. To\n\nthe     contrary,    the    MBTA    acted    in    response     to     expressed\n\nconstitutional concerns about its prior guidelines, and cannot be\n\nfaulted for trying to adhere more closely to the constitutional\n\nline.    And if the MBTA revised a guideline merely as a ruse for\n\nimpermissible       viewpoint     discrimination,    that     would    be   found\n\nunconstitutional regardless of the type of forum created.\n\n            The plaintiffs' argument assumes that before January\n\n2003, the MBTA had created a designated public forum.                    That is\n\nunlikely:    the     MBTA   has     consistently    had     both      significant\n\nsubstantive content limitations and procedural limitations on the\n\nadvertisements it would accept, and there is little evidence the\n\nMBTA affirmatively intended to create a public forum. Even so, the\n\nMBTA has not created a public forum in its advertising program\n\nunder its 2003 guidelines, which are at issue here.\n\n            Since 1992, the MBTA has had substantive guidelines\n\nprohibiting all tobacco ads, and all libelous, slanderous, or\n\nobscene ads.    Procedurally, it required all advertisers to submit\n\nan application to the MBTA's advertising contractor, which had\n\ninstructions to send any ads potentially in conflict with the\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fguidelines to the MBTA for review, and the MBTA reserved the right\n\nto reject any ad it wished.        In AIDS Action Comm. of Massachusetts\n\nv. MBTA, 42 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1994), this court noted that these\n\nearly guidelines left a lot to be desired.\n\n          In 1995 the MBTA further prohibited ads which were\n\nindecent to, or designed to frighten, child viewers. Then in 1999,\n\nthe MBTA created new guidelines which, in addition, prohibited ads\n\ncontaining    depictions     of   violent     criminal    conduct,   firearms,\n\nprofanity, ads harmful to children, and ads that denigrate groups\n\nbased on gender, religion, race, ethnic, or political affiliation.\n\nThese prohibitions are not the indicia of an intent to create a\n\npublic forum.\n\n             The   January    2003    guidelines     intensify       both   the\n\nsubstantive and procedural limitations and protections used by the\n\nMBTA.   The January 2003 guidelines better define the substantive\n\nlimitations and further ban ads that promote or appear to promote\n\nthe use of unlawful goods or services or the commission of unlawful\n\nconduct, as well as political campaign ads. Procedurally, the 2003\n\nguidelines also create more stringent mechanisms for MBTA review of\n\npotentially prohibited ads.          Given the litany of limitations on\n\nadvertisements     from    the    inception    of   its   program,    and   the\n\nstrengthening of those limitations in 2003, the MBTA has, at least\n\nby 2003, through its policy expressed an intent not to open its\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fadvertising space to all persons and organizations for public\n\ndissemination of their views on all topics without limitation.\n\n           The MBTA's practice of enforcing its policy further shows\n\nthat it intended not to create such a forum.               In the five years\n\npreceding these litigations, the MBTA rejected at least seventeen\n\nadvertisements that were not in conformance with different aspects\n\nof its policy. Various advertisements were rejected for violating,\n\namong other grounds, the prohibitions on ads depicting violence,\n\nindecency, profanity, denigration of women, and for containing\n\ntobacco products.\n\n           Change the Climate points to one example of a seemingly\n\ncontradictory   enforcement      of   the    policy   with   respect   to   ads\n\ncontaining tobacco in an attempt to argue that the MBTA has\n\nerratically enforced its written policy.5           One or more instances of\n\nerratic   enforcement   of   a   policy      does   not   itself   defeat   the\n\ngovernment's intent not to create a public forum.            See New England\n\n\n     5\n      Change the Climate introduced evidence that the MBTA refused\nto display an ad from an organization called the Surfrider\nFoundation, a group whose goal is to encourage responsible disposal\nof cigarette butts, on the basis of the MBTA's ban on\nadvertisements for tobacco products because it included a picture\nof people smoking. The ad contained three pictures of one couple,\nduring which they are smoking, talking, and then disposing of their\ncigarettes. The ad begins: \"We're not one of those organizations\nwho believe you shouldn't smoke! What we care about is how you\ndispose of your cigarette.\" The ad then has information about the\nharmful effects of cigarettes on beaches, and has tips for\nresponsible disposal of cigarette butts. However the MBTA allowed\nan ad for the airline Al Italia, which contained a picture of a\nwoman on a motorcycle with a cigarette in one hand, with the\ncaption: \"Let's create a buzz.\"\n\n                                      -22-\n\fReg'l Council of Carpenters v. Kinton, 284 F.3d 9, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (no government intent to create a designated forum exists\n\n\"even if [government's] policy of restricted access is erratically\n\nenforced\"). By consistently limiting ads it saw as in violation of\n\nits policy, even if doing so imperfectly, the MBTA evidenced its\n\nintent not to create a designated public forum.\n\n           Most importantly, the relevant Supreme Court case law\n\ncompels the conclusion that the MBTA has not created a designated\n\npublic forum.    The only Supreme Court case directly on point, the\n\nplurality opinion in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298\n\n(1974), found that where a city banned all \"political\" (i.e.,\n\ncandidate and issues) advertising on its transit system, while\n\naccepting commercial as well as religious, civic, and public-\n\nservice   oriented     advertisements,      the   city   had   not    created   a\n\ndesignated public forum.     Id. at 304.      The opinion found that “[i]n\n\nmuch the same way that a newspaper or periodical, or even a radio\n\nor television station, need not accept every proffer of advertising\n\nfrom the general public, a city transit system has discretion to\n\ndevelop   and   make    reasonable   choices      concerning    the     type    of\n\nadvertising that may be displayed in its vehicles.”                  Id. at 303.\n\nLehman is indistinguishable from the instant case.             As in     Lehman,\n\nthe MBTA bans political candidate and some overtly political\n\nadvertising.    As here, the transit system in Lehman did not merely\n\naccept ads from commercial entities, but also accepted ads from\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f\"churches, and civic and public-service oriented groups.\"                  Id. at\n\n300.    In Lehman, the claimant, as here, was denied access to both\n\nexterior and interior advertising space. Id. at 320 n.12 (Brennan,\n\nJ., dissenting).        The transit system, as is true of the MBTA here,\n\nhad written guidelines which were managed by a third party entity,\n\nand which involved some exercise of discretion.             Id. at 298-300.\n\n            Lehman's rationale that a government instrumentality does\n\nnot    become   a   public    forum   simply   because     it   is   used    for\n\ncommunication of ideas has since been reinforced by later Supreme\n\nCourt cases.        See Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'\n\nAss'n, 460 U.S. 37, 49 n.9 (1983); United States Postal Service v.\n\nCouncil of Greenburgh Civic Ass'ns, 453 U.S. 114, 129 (1981).\n\nLehman   was    cited    favorably    in   R.A.V.   v.   City   of   St.    Paul,\n\nMinnesota, 505 U.S. 377, 390 n.6 (1992); and United States v.\n\nKokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 725-26 (1990) (plurality opinion).              Indeed,\n\nin International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505\n\nU.S. 672 (1992), the court, citing Lehman, reiterated that a lower\n\nlevel of scrutiny usually applies when the government acts as\n\nproprietor.     Id. at 678.\n\n            The only Supreme Court case to which plaintiff points is\n\nWidmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981).             Widmar held that where a\n\nstate university had a policy of opening its campus facilities for\n\nall registered student groups, it had created a designated public\n\nforum for such groups and thus violated the First Amendment when it\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fattempted to prevent a religious student group from using such\n\nfacilities.      Id. at 277.\n\n           Widmar is distinguishable from this case for multiple\n\nreasons.   First, the purpose of the forum created in Widmar was to\n\nencourage expressive activities by student groups. Id. at 265. To\n\nimplement this purpose, the campus facilities were made generally\n\navailable to all student groups, without restriction, and so the\n\ngroups received a form of subsidy from the government.             Id.   Unlike\n\nWidmar, the primary purpose of the MBTA advertising program is not\n\nto   facilitate    expression;   rather   it    is    to   generate   revenue.\n\nFurther,   the    restrictions   upon   use    of    the   MBTA   advertising,\n\nincluding the requirement of an application, payment, and the\n\nMBTA's extensive policy of limitation, are far greater than in\n\nWidmar.\n\n           Since Widmar, we know of no analogous Supreme Court case\n\napplying the forum analysis which has found that the government had\n\ncreated a designated public forum.             See, e.g., Arkansas Educ.\n\nTelevision Com’n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998); Rosenberger v.\n\nRector and Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995),\n\nLamb’s Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384\n\n(1993); Cornelius, 473 U.S. 788; Perry Education Ass'n, 460 U.S.\n\n37; cf. Legal Services Corp. v. Velasquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001).             In\n\neach of these cases, the Court assessed the challenged government\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\frestrictions only under the reasonableness/viewpoint neutrality\n\ntest.\n\n           Further, the Court has recognized that deference to\n\ngovernment intent in determining the nature of the forum may\n\npromote, rather than hinder, First Amendment principles:\n\n           [W]e encourage the government to open its\n           property to some expressive activity in cases\n           where, if faced with an all-or-nothing choice,\n           it might not open the property at all. That\n           this distinction turns on governmental intent\n           does not render it unprotective of speech.\n           Rather, it reflects the reality that, with the\n           exception of traditional public fora, the\n           government retains the choice of whether to\n           designate its property as a forum for\n           specified classes of speakers.\n\nArkansas Educ. Television Comm’n, 523 U.S. at 680.\n\n           This   court   addressed    the   question   of    rejection   of\n\nadvertisements by the MBTA a decade ago in AIDS Action, 42 F.3d 1.\n\nAlthough the district court had concluded that the MBTA was a\n\npublic forum, this court declined to reach the issue.            Id. at 9.\n\nInstead we held that the MBTA had engaged in dissimilar treatment\n\nof   advertisements   containing   sexual    content    and   innuendo,   by\n\nallowing a rather explicit movie advertisement while rejecting\n\nadvertisements featuring condoms from an anti-AIDS group.           Id. at\n\n10-11.   That amounted to the type of content discrimination that\n\n\"gave rise to an appearance of viewpoint discrimination\" which had\n\nnot been adequately explained.        Id. at 11.   The decision in AIDS\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fAction does not assist plaintiffs on the claim that the MBTA has\n\ncreated a public forum.\n\n            In Children of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix, 154 F.3d\n\n972 (9th Cir. 1998), then-retired Associate Justice White similarly\n\nfound that the Phoenix transit system did not create a designated\n\npublic forum by accepting advertising on exterior panels on buses.\n\nId. at 976.     Like the MBTA, the system did not accept advertising\n\nfrom political candidates.         The system primarily ran commercial\n\nadvertising, but did run a small number of non-commercial public\n\nservice     advertisements,      excluding         political     and   religious\n\nadvertising.      Id.   The case did not, though, address the further\n\nissue, which we do, of a transit system which accepts what is\n\napparently more non-commercial advertising.\n\n            Likewise, one circuit, relying on Lehman, has recently\n\nheld that advertising space in bus benches was a non-public forum.\n\nUptown Pawn and Jewelry, Inc. v. City of Hollywood, 337 F.3d 1275,\n\n1278-79 (11th Cir. 2003). Although the city had previously accepted\n\nads from pawnbrokers, it adopted a new policy prohibiting those\n\nads.      The   court   found   this     was   a   permissible    content-based\n\nrestriction, seeking to encourage higher caliber advertising to\n\nmaximize revenue.\n\n            The    Supreme      Court     opinions     control     this   case.\n\nNonetheless, we discuss briefly circuit opinions on which Change\n\nthe Climate relies. Without suggesting we agree with the reasoning\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fin each, each is distinguishable on its facts.                  In each of these\n\ncases,    unlike    here,     the   system    accepted   explicitly    political\n\nadvertising, an important (but not dispositive) factor in forum\n\nanalysis.\n\n            In     Christ's    Bride   Ministries,       Inc.   v.   Southeastern\n\nPennsylvania Transp. Auth., 148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir. 1998), a transit\n\nsystem's advertising space was held to be a designated public forum\n\nwhere the system had an affirmative program to use its space to\n\npromote \"awareness of social issues\" and provide \"a catalyst for\n\nchange.\"     Id. at 249-52.          Under that program, the advertising\n\nmanager picked issues of public concern for free advertising.                Id.\n\nat 249.    Further, the plaintiff's advertisements had in fact been\n\napproved and had run, and were refused only after they had sparked\n\ncontroversy.       Id. at 245-46.      SEPTA had no guidelines6 similar to\n\nthose of the MBTA.            SEPTA also had a practice of \"virtually\n\npermitting unlimited access,\" having requested modifications of\n\nadvertisements only three times.             Id. at 252.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Its restrictions were only 1) an instruction to its\ncontractor to concentrate on ads other than alcohol and tobacco; 2)\nthat it reserved to itself a final veto without guidelines as to\nwhen it would exercise that veto; and 3) it restricted the contract\nmanager from accepting \"libelous, slanderous, or obscene\"\nadvertisements (which was not the basis for the rejection of\nplaintiff's advertisement). Id. at 250-51.\n\n                                       -28-\n\f           Similarly,7 in Planned Parenthood Ass'n/Chicago Area v.\n\nChicago Transit Auth., 767 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1985), the court\n\nfound the CTA had created a public forum where it had accepted a\n\nwide range of public-issue advertising, claimed to have a policy of\n\nexcluding controversial advertisements, but in fact had no such\n\npolicy, had no written guidelines, had accepted controversial\n\nadvertisements, and was found to have come up with such a policy\n\nsolely to defend its decision to reject plaintiff's advertising.\n\nId. at 1232-33.\n\n           In New York Magazine v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 136 F.3d\n\n123 (2d. Cir. 1998), the court held that the MTA had created a\n\npublic forum in the advertising space outside of its buses when it\n\naccepted a magazine's advertisements using the Mayor's name under\n\nwritten   guidelines   which   imposed   no   restriction   on   political\n\nspeech, then removed the advertisements when the Mayor objected.\n\nId. at 130.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      In United Food & Commercial Workers Union, Local 1099 v.\nSouthwest Ohio Reg'l Transit Auth., 163 F.3d 341 (6th Cir. 1998),\nthe transit system rejected a union's proposed wrap-around bus\nadvertisement because, in large part, it was too controversial.\nId. at 347.      SORTA accepted public-service, public issue,\npolitical, and commercial advertisements, subject to a policy\nexcluding advertising on political issues controversial enough that\nthey might adversely affect ridership. Id. at 359. The court gave\nalternative holdings--that if no public forum was created, the\nrestriction was unreasonable, but that SORTA had created a\ndesignated   public  forum   by   accepting   virtually   unlimited\nadvertising. Id. at 363.\n\n                                  -29-\n\f          Change the Climate's additional arguments on the forum\n\nissue are equally unpersuasive.      It argues that the MBTA made an\n\n“affirmative”   decision    to   continue   to   allow   non-commercial\n\nadvertising, despite being advised that potential disputes could be\n\navoided   by    simply     eliminating    non-commercial   advertising\n\naltogether. This argument suffers from several flaws. As a matter\n\nof law, under Lehman, the dividing line between a public forum and\n\na non-public forum is not the dividing line between commercial\n\nadvertisements and paid advertisements from non-profit groups. And\n\nunder Arkansas Educ. Television Comm'n, the MBTA is not to be put\n\nto an \"all-or-nothing choice.\"     523 U.S. at 680.\n\n          Also, as a matter of fact, General Manager Robert Mulhern\n\ntestified that he rejected a potential solution of removing all\n\nnon-commercial advertising, because:\n\n          I believe that there's a lot of people out\n          there who rely on that information, that some\n          times that –- that's the only practical access\n          to government they have from time to time.\n          For people who live in the inner city that are\n          made aware of important programs or important\n          social services, [I believe] that we truly are\n          performing a public service in another flavor\n          rather than transportation service.      We're\n          letting them know about government services or\n          social services or not-for-profit services\n          that might have a direct impact on their\n          quality of life.\n\nBy refusing to limit the advertising program solely to commercial\n\nadvertising, the MBTA was, thus, not evidencing an intent to open\n\nthe forum to all public discourse.       Nor was the MBTA adopting its\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fown program to inform the public about issues, as in Christ's\n\nBride, 148 F.3d 242.      The MBTA's decision is not inconsistent with\n\na desire not to create a public forum, nor is it inconsistent with\n\nthe MBTA's role as a market actor.\n\n              Finally, plaintiffs argue that, because prior to this\n\nlitigation      the   MBTA     did    not     limit    advertisements      \"in    a\n\nconstitutionally permissible manner,\" the court should find that it\n\ncreated a designated public forum.             This reasoning fundamentally\n\nmisunderstands the nature of the forum analysis.                  The focus is on\n\nwhether the government has intentionally decided to create a public\n\nforum.    Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802.           If it has not, then erratic\n\nenforcement of a policy would not matter.                Further, even if the\n\ngovernment had limited ads \"in a constitutionally impermissible\n\nmanner\" by engaging in viewpoint discrimination, that would not\n\ncreate a public forum where none was intended.                The MBTA's policy\n\nclearly evidenced an intent to maintain control over the forum, and\n\nthus the MBTA did not create a designated public forum.                        As a\n\nresult, the standard of review is not strict scrutiny.\n\nB.    Viewpoint Discrimination and Unreasonableness Claims in Both\n      Change the Climate and Ridley\n\n              Although   the   MBTA   advertising       program    is   neither   a\n\ntraditional public forum nor a designated public forum, regulations\n\nare   still    unconstitutional       under    the    First   Amendment   if     the\n\ndistinctions drawn are viewpoint based or if they are unreasonable\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fin light of the purposes served by the forum.           Cornelius, 473 U.S.\n\nat 806.\n\n           The bedrock principle of viewpoint neutrality demands\n\nthat the state not suppress speech where the real rationale for the\n\nrestriction   is   disagreement     with    the   underlying     ideology     or\n\nperspective that the speech expresses.        See Rosenberger v. Rectors\n\nand Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995); McGuire v.\n\nReilly, 386 F.3d 45, 62 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"The essence of a\n\nviewpoint discrimination claim is that the government has preferred\n\nthe message of one speaker over another.\").               A distinction is\n\nviewpoint based if it \"denies access to a speaker solely to\n\nsuppress the point of view he espouses.\"           Cornelius, 473 U.S. at\n\n806.   The essence of viewpoint discrimination is not that the\n\ngovernment incidentally prevents certain viewpoints from being\n\nheard in the course of suppressing certain general topics of\n\nspeech, rather, it is a governmental intent to intervene in a way\n\nthat   prefers   one   particular    viewpoint     in   speech      over   other\n\nperspectives on the same topic.            See, e.g., Good News Club v.\n\nMilford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 107-09 (school that has opened its\n\nresources after school for the teaching of moral values cannot\n\nexclude religious group that wishes to teach about those values\n\nfrom   a   religious   perspective    without     engaging     in    viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination); Rosenberger, 515 U.S. 819; Lamb's Chapel v. Ctr.\n\nMoriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384 (1993); McGuire, 386\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fF.3d at 57-59, 64-65 (fact that \"buffer zone\" statute applying\n\naround abortion clinics might incidentally burden anti-abortion\n\nspeech more than pro-abortion speech is irrelevant to its viewpoint\n\nneutrality).\n\n      1.     Change the Climate: Viewpoint Discrimination and\n             Unreasonableness\n             The advertisements rejected were described earlier.\n\nOther material facts follow.\n\n             Robert Prince, who was the General Manager of the MBTA at\n\nthe   time   Change   the   Climate's   ads   were    rejected   by   Shorter,\n\ntestified that while he had not seen the ads in 2000, he would have\n\nrejected all three on the grounds that they encouraged marijuana\n\nuse among juveniles, and thus were harmful to juveniles and in\n\nviolation of the then-existing policy.         He found the Teen Ad to be\n\n\"geared towards young people, telling them that marijuana is not\n\ncocaine or heroin, so it's the lesser of two evils, but it's okay\n\nto smoke it.\"    Prince did not view the ad as sending a message that\n\njuveniles should be told the truth about drugs.\n\n             Prince thought that the Mother Ad was also harmful to\n\njuveniles,    because   the   ad   implies    \"that   it's   okay     to   smoke\n\nmarijuana, which is against the law.\"         Prince said the words meant\n\n\"that 'I don't want my children to smoke pot, but I know jail is\n\n. . . more dangerous, so therefore I'm going to overlook the fact\n\nthat they are allowed to break the law.'\"             Prince said that some\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fpeople could have the legitimate viewpoint that jail is more\n\nharmful to a child than marijuana smoking, but that was not a\n\nviewpoint he would allow to be displayed on the MBTA because \"[i]t\n\nallows [children] to think it's okay to break the law.\"\n\n          As to the Police Ad, Prince stated: \"It's telling them\n\nthat the police are not going to take marijuana smoking very\n\nseriously, that there are real criminals on the loose, and it's\n\nokay to break the law.\"   He further stated that the ad \"says that\n\nsmoking marijuana will not be looked upon as a criminal act.\"   When\n\nasked whether he agreed that the ad expressed a viewpoint about how\n\npolice should be used, Prince replied: \"I know this ad tells young\n\npeople that they should commit a criminal act.\"\n\n          Michael Mulhern, acting General Manager of the MBTA and\n\nthe person with final authority to accept or reject advertisements,\n\ntestified that he would reject all three ads under the current 2003\n\nguidelines.    The Teen Ad promoted marijuana use, he thought, by\n\nimplying that cocaine and heroin were really harmful but marijuana\n\nuse was not.      He held these worries although the ad states\n\nexplicitly that \"[s]moking pot is not cool.\"      Further, he was\n\nconcerned that the ad was targeted at juveniles, based on the\n\npicture of the teenage girl and the fact that the language is\n\nwritten in terms (\"cool,\" \"ya know\") that juveniles would generally\n\nuse.\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f          Mulhern   testified   that    the   Mother   Ad   also   promoted\n\nmarijuana use, and while it was \"not as clear\" as the Teen Ad, the\n\nMother Ad could also in part be targeted at children.        He testified\n\nthat by depicting a mother stating that she is less concerned about\n\nher children smoking pot, the ad sends the message to children that\n\nthey \"can smoke [pot] and still be great kids.\"        Mulhern testified\n\nthat he would permit Change the Climate to post an ad advocating\n\nthe opposite viewpoint, saying: \"I've got three great kids. I love\n\nthem more than anything.   I don't want them to smoke pot.           But if\n\nmy kids smoke pot, they should go to jail.\"\n\n          Mulhern testified that the Police Ad was rejected because\n\n\"it suggests that smoking marijuana is not a real crime,\" and so\n\npromotes an illegal activity.      He disagreed with the view that\n\n\"police resources should not be used for marijuana prosecutions.\"\n\nHe said he would allow an ad to be posted if it expressed the\n\nopposite viewpoint, saying: \"Police are important, valuable, good.\n\nPolice should be used for arresting people for marijuana crimes.\"\n\nMulhern conceded that the ad did not target children specifically,\n\nbut stated that he thought that children were more susceptible to\n\nreceiving the message that marijuana is not a real crime than were\n\nother people.\n\n          The MBTA also introduced testimony of Cornelia Kelley,\n\nthe head of the Boston Latin School, a public exam school for\n\ngrades seven through twelve, which uses the MBTA for transporting\n\n                                 -35-\n\fmore than 2,100 of its 2,400 students.               Kelley had the following\n\nconcern about the Teen Ad: \"There is a message there that marijuana\n\nis okay; it's not as bad as cocaine or heroin.              And the message, to\n\nmy mind, that's a very confusing message for young people.                  There\n\nis a sense there that marijuana is acceptable.\"                      When asked,\n\ndespite the fact that the ad says that \"Smoking pot is not cool,\"\n\nwhy it would lead students to think that smoking marijuana is okay,\n\nKelley replied:\n\n            If you look at that ad, that's a real mixed\n            message to young people.     And the students\n            with whom I deal get a great deal of\n            stimulation in different ways.       And what\n            you're looking at there is not a clear-cut\n            message.   And when children . . . are that\n            age, we try and see to it that they understand\n            clearly what's legal and what's not legal.\n            And that really says marijuana is not cocaine\n            or heroin.    It takes marijuana out of the\n            realm of cocaine and heroin, where we\n            consistently tell young people that marijuana\n            is an illegal drug and you will be expelled\n            for it or you will be arrested for it . . . .\n\nKelley conceded       that   a   student   would     not    be   disciplined    for\n\nexpressing the view: \"Tell us the truth.             Marijuana is not cocaine\n\nor   heroin,\"   but    stated    that    she   did    not   think    the   ad   was\n\nappropriate to run on the MBTA because it sends a mixed message to\n\nstudents.\n\n            Kelley testified that she was particularly concerned\n\nabout the Mother Ad because it appeared to depict a teacher at a\n\nchalkboard.     She felt that by stating that jail is more dangerous\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fthan smoking pot, the ad does not give a clear message to young\n\npeople that smoking pot is illegal.\n\n          Kelley also expressed concern that the Police Ad \"conveys\n\nthat police countenance the use of marijuana.\" When asked how, she\n\nreplied that it implies that one will not be arrested for marijuana\n\nwhich is \"another mixed message to young people.\"\n\n          Ms. Kelley conceded that her students could easily be\n\nexposed to similar ads while walking in the city.            The difference\n\nwas that she considered the MBTA to be an extension of the school\n\nhouse.   But even so, she conceded that there had been discussion\n\nencouraged    in   classrooms   at    the   school   about   the   issue   of\n\nlegalizing marijuana.\n\n          Change    the   Climate    also   introduced    evidence   of    two\n\ndifferent types of ads: other ads accepted by the MBTA which could\n\nbe seen as promoting illegal activity among juveniles and ads which\n\nencourage compliance with drug laws.         It argues this second set of\n\nads expresses the view that the drug laws are sound.\n\n             Change the Climate introduced several different ads for\n\nalcoholic beverages accepted by the MBTA in the past.          One is an ad\n\nfor Trinity Oaks Wine, which contains a picture of a woman in a\n\nbackless dress being hugged by a man.          It states: \"Trinity Oaks.\n\nIt's not a soap opera.    But it is provocative.\"        At the bottom, the\n\nad states: \"Remember the wine,\" and has a picture of a wine bottle.\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fPrince testified that this ad was not harmful to juveniles because\n\nthe ad was addressed to adults.\n\n          Another ad, for Doc Otis Hard Lemonade, depicts a woman's\n\nmouth eating an ice cube, and states \"DO IT ON THE ROCKS.\"           In the\n\ncorner there is a bottle of \"Doc Otis Hard Lemonade,\" an alcoholic\n\nlemonade beverage, being poured into a glass of ice, with the\n\nslogan: \"The perfect way to break the ice.\"        When questioned as to\n\nwhether ads   such   as   this   were   harmful   to   juveniles,   Mulhern\n\nconceded that alcohol use was illegal for juveniles, but found that\n\nalcohol ads did not fall under this guideline because the ads did\n\nnot specifically target juveniles.         Prince was also asked about\n\nthis ad and testified that it was not harmful to juveniles because\n\nthe ad was not addressed to young people, but to adults.               When\n\nasked how he could tell this ad was \"geared towards somebody who's\n\n22 and not somebody who's 20,\" Prince responded: \"Because alcohol\n\nfor anybody under that age is illegal.\"            Prince conceded that\n\nnothing in the ad protected young people from its influence.\n\n          Kelley testified that she was also concerned about the\n\nadvertisements for alcoholic beverages that her students see on the\n\nMBTA.   The distinction she saw was that alcohol was legal at a\n\ncertain age but use of marijuana was not legal at any age.\n\n          Change the Climate also introduced testimony that the\n\nMBTA has run numerous advertisements that discourage drug use.           At\n\ntrial, the MBTA stipulated to having run four such ads.             One was\n\n                                   -38-\n\fheadlined: \"TALK IS BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS THAN DRUGS . . . SO TALK!\"\n\nIt has a cartoon picture of \"McGruff, the Crime Dog,\" as well as 8\n\npointers for talking to one's children about drugs, such as: \"Tell\n\nyour kids you don't approve of the stuff\"      and \"Tell them to say no\n\n. . . and that you know they know the difference between right and\n\nwrong.\" The advertisement finishes by stating: \"Follow these steps\n\nand you'll be helpin' yourself, your kids and me . . . take a bite\n\nout of crime.\"\n\n          A second advertisement, sponsored by Drug Free America,\n\ncontains a picture of two children at a playground, with the\n\nheadline: \"Everyday after school, my kid likes to __________.         If\n\nyou can't fill in this blank, you need to start asking.           It's a\n\nproven way to steer kids clear of drugs.      It's not pestering.   It's\n\nparenting.    Ask: Who?   What?   When?   Where?   Questions.   The Anti-\n\nDrug.\" A third advertisement, sponsored by Partnership for a Drug-\n\nFree New England and America, as well as the Office of National\n\nDrug Control Policy, states simply: \"Are You Waiting for Your Kids\n\nto Talk to You About Pot?\" And the fourth advertisement, sponsored\n\nby the Office of National Drug Control Policy, contains a pair of\n\ndice, one with a skull on one side, and states: \"Just because you\n\nsurvived drugs, doesn't mean your children will.\"\n\n             The MBTA's position under the current guidelines is that\n\nit would still reject Change the Climate's three ads because each\n\nad targets children and encourages the use of illegal drugs.         The\n\n                                   -39-\n\fpresent guidelines do not prohibit ads \"harmful\" to children.            The\n\nMBTA also takes the position that it would permit ads which\n\nexpressed to adults the viewpoint that the marijuana laws should be\n\nrethought so long as the ads said that use of marijuana is illegal.\n\n            At the outset, it should be emphasized that the MBTA's\n\nguideline itself, which allows rejection of advertisements that\n\npromote     illegal   activity,   particularly      among    children,    is\n\nconstitutional. It clearly serves a viewpoint-neutral purpose, and\n\nit is surely reasonable given the characteristics of the MBTA's\n\nadvertising program.        It is indisputable that the MBTA has a\n\nlegitimate, viewpoint-neutral interest in not being used as a\n\nmessenger    to   convey   messages    promoting   illegal   conduct   among\n\njuveniles.    It is also legitimate for the MBTA to consider that it\n\nhas juveniles among its passengers. Further, as a vendor, the MBTA\n\nhas a legitimate interest in not offending riders so that they stop\n\ntheir patronage. All of these are reasons why the guideline itself\n\nis constitutional against a viewpoint-discrimination attack.\n\n             What we focus on instead are the specific decisions of\n\nthe MBTA to reject the three Change the Climate advertisements.\n\nThe MBTA's mere recitation of viewpoint-neutral rationales (or the\n\npresentation of a viewpoint-neutral guideline) for its decisions to\n\nreject the three advertisements does not immunize those decisions\n\nfrom scrutiny.     The recitation of viewpoint-neutral grounds may be\n\na mere pretext for an invidious motive.       See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at\n\n                                      -40-\n\f811-13. In practical terms, the government rarely flatly admits it\n\nis engaging in viewpoint discrimination.\n\n             Suspicion that viewpoint discrimination is afoot is at\n\nits zenith when the speech restricted is speech critical of the\n\ngovernment, because there is a strong risk that the government will\n\nact to censor ideas that oppose its own.                    See, e.g., Texas v.\n\nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 411-17 (1989) (striking down criminal flag\n\ndesecration         statute;        flag-burner's           action       expressed\n\n\"dissatisfaction with the policies of this country,\" expression\n\nwhich was \"situated at the core of our First Amendment values,\" and\n\nstate had no power to \"prescribe what shall be orthodox\" (quoting\n\nW. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).            Because Change the Climate's\n\nadvertisements here reflect core political speech that is critical\n\nof   existing      governmental    policy,      we    are   especially    wary    of\n\nviewpoint discrimination.\n\n             The Supreme Court, as well, has been particularly leery\n\nof justifications for quashing speech to adults that rest on the\n\npurported protection of children. While the protection of children\n\nis   a   compelling     state     interest,     see    Denver    Area    Telecomm.\n\nConsortium    v.    FCC,   518    U.S.   727,   755    (1996),   the     Court   has\n\ncarefully examined regulations purporting to rest on this ground,\n\noften finding that they sweep more broadly than their goal requires\n\nor that they do not serve their goal of child protection at all.\n\n                                         -41-\n\fSee Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 875-79 (1997) (\"[T]he mere fact\n\nthat a statutory regulation of speech was enacted for the important\n\npurpose of protecting children . . . does not foreclose inquiry\n\ninto its validity.\"); Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium, 518 U.S. at\n\n755-60; Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115,\n\n126-27, 130-31 (1989); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S.\n\n60, 73-75 (1983); Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205,\n\n212-14 (1975).\n\n           Almost   fifty   years    ago,    Justice   Frankfurter       found\n\nunconstitutional a Michigan obscenity statute; he emphasized that\n\nthe statute swept too broadly to carry out its asserted aim of\n\nprotecting children from sexually explicit material.            In Butler v.\n\nMichigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), Justice Frankfurter stated:\n\n          The State insists that, by thus quarantining\n          the general reading public against books not\n          too rugged for grown men and women in order to\n          shield juvenile innocence, it is exercising\n          its power to promote the general welfare.\n          Surely, this is to burn the house to roast the\n          pig. . . . The incidence of this enactment is\n          to reduce the adult population of Michigan to\n          reading only what is fit for children.\nId. at 383.\n\n           The context of these cases is admittedly not an exact\n\nfit.   Our case does not involve a criminal prohibition, but only a\n\nrefusal   to   accept   advertising.       The   context   in   Denver    Area\n\nEducucational Telecommunications Consortium is closest: there the\n\nissue was the FCC's ability to control certain sexually explicit\n\n                                    -42-\n\fcontent on cable television.            518 U.S. at 734-36.       In both Denver\n\nArea and the other cases, the question was whether statutes or\n\nregulations    had   been     drafted    narrowly    enough.      Our     focus     is\n\nparticular decisions to exclude advertisements, not the facial\n\nvalidity of the guideline.          Finally, all of these cases involved\n\nthe regulation of sexually explicit (but non-obscene) speech;\n\nsexual    speech   is   not    involved      in   this   case.        Still,    these\n\ndifferences do not weaken the general principle that a purported\n\njustification for excluding speech to adults on the grounds of\n\nprotecting    children      will   be    examined    closely     to    see     if   the\n\ndecisions    reasonably       do   protect     children.\n\n            There are various situations which will lead a court to\n\nconclude that, despite the seemingly neutral justifications offered\n\nby the government, nonetheless the decision to exclude speech is a\n\nform of impermissible discrimination.               Three are relevant here.\n\nFirst, statements by government officials on the reasons for an\n\naction can indicate an improper motive.                    See, e.g., Vill. of\n\nArlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 268\n\n(1977).      Second, where the government states that it rejects\n\nsomething because of a certain characteristic, but other things\n\npossessing the same characteristic are accepted,8 this sort of\n\n\n     8\n      For comparison purposes, it is important to be clear that the\nMBTA guidelines also preclude advertisements containing speech\nabout \"candidate[s] for public office\" or about \"specific ballot\nquestion[s], initiative petition[s], or referend[a].\" The MBTA has\nrightly not relied on this guideline in our case, because Change\n\n                                        -43-\n\funderinclusiveness raises a suspicion that the stated neutral\n\nground for action is meant to shield an impermissible motive. See,\n\ne.g., Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 812; AIDS Action, 42 F.3d at 10-12\n\n(where MBTA claimed to be excluding condom-promotion advertisements\n\nbecause they were sexually explicit and patently offensive, but\n\nMBTA allowed other sorts of sexually explicit advertisements, such\n\nas   movie   advertisements,   \"unrebutted   appearance   of   viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination\" is found).       Third, suspicion arises where the\n\nviewpoint-neutral ground is not actually served very well by the\n\nspecific governmental action at issue; where, in other words, the\n\nfit between means and ends is loose or nonexistent. This situation\n\ncomes up in a variety of legal settings.        See, e.g., Purkett v.\n\nElem, 514 U.S. 765, 768 (1995) (judges may sometimes find pretext\n\nin race-based equal protection challenge to peremptory strikes\n\nwhere prosecutor's justifications for challenges are \"implausible\n\nor fantastic\"); Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S.\n\n248, 259 (1981) (employer's misjudgments of the qualifications of\n\njob applicants may be relevant to whether the employer's neutral,\n\nmerit-based reasons for hiring are pretexts for discrimination\n\nunder Title VII).    All three factors lead us to conclude that the\n\nreasons given by the MBTA in this case are insufficient to avoid a\n\nconclusion of viewpoint discrimination.\n\n\n\nthe Climate's advertisements do not fall into these two narrow\ncategories.\n\n                                  -44-\n\f          Inherent in the MBTA's position is its recognition that\n\nsave for the risk of inducing juveniles to smoke marijuana, the\n\nrefusal to run these advertisements for an adult audience would be\n\nviewpoint discrimination.     That conclusion is essentially conceded\n\nin the MBTA's briefs.       We find the purported justification of\n\nprotecting children to be undermined for two basic reasons. First,\n\nthere is direct evidence, through statements by MBTA officials,\n\nthat the reason for rejecting the advertisements was actually\n\ndistaste for Change the Climate's viewpoint.        Second, there is\n\nevidence that the MBTA's rejection of these advertisements does not\n\nactually serve the alleged purpose of protecting children, and so\n\nthe MBTA cannot offset the direct evidence against it.\n\n          The MBTA's initial statement of reasons for rejecting the\n\nthree ads was, in part, that the ads were part of Change the\n\nClimate's effort to \"reform marijuana [laws]\" in an \"effort to\n\nlegalize.\"9     This    was    a   direct   statement   of   viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination. It was reinforced by later evidence under the 2003\n\nguidelines.   The MBTA General Manager said he would publish the\n\nMother and Police Ads if they came to the opposite conclusion –-\n\none with which he agreed -- expressing viewpoints which reinforced\n\ncompliance with, but did not question, existing laws.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      These comments were made by Lucy Shorter, then Director of\nMarketing for the MBTA and the liaison between the MBTA and its\nadvertising contractor.\n\n                                   -45-\n\f          Supporting the direct evidence is our conclusion that the\n\nMBTA's rejection of these advertisements does not reasonably serve\n\nits purported justification.   Dealing first with the Mother Ad and\n\nthe Police Ad, it is clear that they are not targeted at children,\n\nnor can they reasonably be construed to promote illegal marijuana\n\nuse among juveniles.   The ads do not advocate illegal drug use.\n\nRather, these two ads make a sophisticated argument that the\n\ncriminalization of marijuana imposes worse consequences on society\n\nthan would alternatives.    The risk posed by the Mother Ad and\n\nPolice Ad of inducing juveniles to engage in illegal marijuana\n\nactivity is remarkably minimal and, indeed, probably nonexistent.\n\nThe MBTA is certainly correct to evaluate individually each ad as\n\nto its compliance with the guidelines.      Its judgments must be\n\nreasonable and it would not be reasonable to think that juveniles\n\nwere exposed to no other information about drugs. Indeed, the MBTA\n\nhas itself a long history of running ads stressing that drug use is\n\nillegal and that drug laws should be obeyed.\n\n          The MBTA has sought to allay any suspicions of viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination by representing that it would run advertisements\n\nsaying in bold text that the drug laws should be changed, provided\n\nthe ads at the same time acknowledge that marijuana use is illegal.\n\nThis, it says, removes any concern about viewpoint discrimination\n\nbecause it proves that the same message could be run if a different\n\nmanner of expression were used.   But that is not so.   The MBTA's\n\n\n                               -46-\n\fconcession means simply that it will run advertisements which do\n\nnot attract      attention     but   will    exercise    its    veto       power   over\n\nadvertisements which are designed to be effective in delivering a\n\nmessage.      Viewpoint      discrimination        concerns     arise       when    the\n\ngovernment    intentionally      tilts      the   playing     field    for    speech;\n\nreducing the effectiveness of a message, as opposed to repressing\n\nit   entirely,    thus   may    be   an     alternative       form    of    viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination.      See R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 392 (It is viewpoint\n\ndiscriminatory for the government to \"license one side of a debate\n\nto fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of\n\nQueensberry rules.\"); see also Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 26\n\n(1971) (the emotive impact of a particular means of expression is\n\noften more important than the underlying cognitive impact of a\n\nmessage,   and    this   emotive     impact       is   also    protected      by   the\n\nConstitution).\n\n           This suspicion of viewpoint discrimination is deepened by\n\nthe fact that the MBTA has run a number of ads promoting alcohol\n\nthat are clearly more appealing to juveniles than the ads here.                     It\n\nis true that there is a distinction: alcohol, like marijuana,\n\ncannot legally be sold to minors but can be sold to adults, and\n\nmarijuana may not, in general, legally be used by either adults or\n\nminors.    That cannot be the dividing line if the argument is that\n\nthe MBTA is trying to avoid inducing illegal conduct: the MBTA has\n\n\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fcorrectly not defended on the basis that the ads will induce\n\nillegal marijuana use by adults.\n\n            The more difficult issue concerns the first advertisement\n\n-- the Teen Ad.          It certainly may reasonably be viewed as directed\n\nto    attract    the      attention   of     teenagers.       What    is   far   more\n\nquestionable is the reasonableness of the contention that the ad\n\nwould induce teenagers to smoke marijuana.                    The ad itself says\n\nnothing of the sort.          Indeed, it says the opposite -- that \"smoking\n\npot is not cool.\"          The ad then implies that marijuana should not be\n\nseen as equivalent to heroin or cocaine.                The clearest message is\n\nthat marijuana usage should be decriminalized, while heroin and\n\ncocaine usage should remain criminal.               The targeting of teenagers\n\ndoes not remove the ad from the realm of political speech.                     Many of\n\nthose who are teenagers are either voters or will soon be voters,\n\nand the ad is also aimed at adults.             The MBTA cannot put a thumb on\n\nthe    scale    to       preclude   Change    the   Climate    from    effectively\n\ncommunicating        a    message   about    changing   the   laws    to   a   likely\n\nresponsive group of voters.\n\n               The MBTA's own evidence fails to support its argument.\n\nHeadmaster Kelley's point was not that the Teen Ad would induce\n\ndrug use, but the rather different point that the Ad presented a\n\n\"mixed message.\"           The mixed nature of the message was about which\n\ndrugs were legal and which were not; thus her concern was that the\n\nad would promote confusion about whether marijuana use was illegal.\n\n                                        -48-\n\fThe MBTA's conclusion, however, requires an additional step -- that\n\nthe ads would not only confuse teenagers about marijuana's illegal\n\nstatus, but that this confusion would then lead teenagers to smoke\n\nmarijuana.   Neither step in the reasoning is supported by the\n\nrecord.\n\n          The Teen Ad must be evaluated in context.    The MBTA has\n\nrun numerous ads that discourage drug use and encourage respect for\n\nand adherence to the current drug laws.     Some of these ads are\n\nsponsored by government agencies, such as the Office of National\n\nDrug Control Policy, whose goal is to further the current drug laws\n\nand aid in their enforcement.   Juveniles are exposed frequently to\n\nanti-drug messages in a variety of settings,10 including in schools.\n\nIndeed, schools may be the very place where students, in class,\n\ndebate the wisdom of certain laws, as at Boston Latin.    That this\n\none at best ambiguous advertisement would lead teenagers to believe\n\nthat marijuana is legal, against a barrage of contrary information,\n\nis unlikely. Yet the MBTA's argument requires even a further step.\n\nThat one advertisement, which on its face says use of marijuana is\n\n\"not cool,\" would actually induce juveniles to smoke marijuana\n\nstrikes us as thin to the point of implausibility.       The MBTA's\n\n\n\n     10\n      For example, the White House reported that the fiscal year\n2003 budget included $149 million for a National Youth Anti-Drug\nMedia campaign, meant to prevent drug use by teens. See National\nDrug Control Strategy: FY 2005 Budget Summary 90 (March 2004),\navailable at http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/\npublications/policy/budgetsum04/budgetsum05.pdf.\n\n                                -49-\n\fjustifications     for    not      running       these   advertisements        are\n\nsufficiently implausible that on the totality of the evidence we\n\nconclude that the MBTA has engaged in viewpoint discrimination.\n\n           Moreover, the rejection of the three ads would fail to\n\npass   muster   under    the    other    prong    of   analysis   laid   out    in\n\nCornelius, which requires that any restriction be reasonable in\n\nlight of the purpose of the forum, because their rejection is, in\n\ncontext, unreasonable.         Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806; see also Perry\n\nEduc. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 49-54 (\"The touchstone for evaluating []\n\ndistinctions [in a non-public forum] is whether they are reasonable\n\nin light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.\").                    The\n\nreasonableness standard is not a particularly high hurdle; there\n\ncan be more than one reasonable decision, and an action need not be\n\nthe most reasonable decision possible in order to be reasonable.\n\nCornelius, 473 U.S. at 808.        Still, the MBTA's judgment that these\n\nadvertisements will foster illegal activity by minors is, in\n\ncontext, entirely unreasonable.            See Kokinda, 497 U.S. at 734;\n\nHuminski v. Corsones, 386 F.3d 116, 155 (2d Cir. 2004) (finding\n\nparticular restriction on speech in non-public forum unreasonable).\n\nThe reasons stated above, which show the lack of fit between the\n\nrejection of these three advertisements and the protection of\n\nchildren, are sufficient for our conclusion.\n\n           We reverse the judgment of the district court as to all\n\nthree advertisements proposed by Change the Climate, and direct\n\n                                        -50-\n\fentry     of    declaratory     judgment    that     the   rejection     of    these\n\nadvertisements violated the First Amendment.               At this point, there\n\nis no reason to think that injunctive relief is also required.\n\nB.      Ridley: Viewpoint Discrimination and Unreasonableness\n\n               Unlike in Change the Climate, we conclude that the MBTA\n\nhas not engaged in viewpoint discrimination in Ridley, either in\n\nthe facial validity of its guidelines or the guidelines as applied\n\nto Ridley's advertisement. The guidelines prohibiting demeaning or\n\ndisparaging ads are themselves viewpoint neutral.                  That is also\n\ntrue of the application of the guidelines to Ridley's ad on the\n\nfacts here.\n\n               As   to   the   guideline   itself,    we   note   that   the    2003\n\nrevision to the guidelines continued to prohibit demeaning or\n\ndisparaging ads, but did so in more general terms, not tied only to\n\ncertain categories such as race, religion, and gender. Most likely\n\nthat revision was made in light of R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 392, and\n\nlater case law.11        The current regulation simply prohibits the use\n\n\n     11\n       The MBTA's two earlier policies, in their singling out of\ncertain specific groups, could, dubitante, be thought to be like\nthe hate speech law at issue in R.A.V., which banned the placing of\ncertain symbols or objects on property when \"one knows or has\nreasonable grounds to know [that such placement] arouses anger,\nalarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed,\nreligion or gender.\" R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 380. In dicta, the Court\nnoted:\n           In its practical operation . . . the ordinance\n           goes even beyond mere content discrimination\n           to actual viewpoint discrimination. Displays\n           containing some words--odious racial epithets,\n\n                                       -51-\n\fof advertisements that \"demean[] or disparage[] an individual or\n\ngroup of individuals,\" without listing any particular protected\n\n\n\n          for example--would be prohibited to proponents\n          of all views.    But \"fighting words\" that do\n          not themselves invoke race, color, creed,\n          religion,   or    gender--aspersions   upon   a\n          person's mother, for example--would seemingly\n          be usable ad libitum in the placards of those\n          arguing in favor of racial, color, etc.,\n          tolerance and equality, but could not be used\n          by those speakers' opponents. One could hold\n          up a sign saying . . . that all \"anti-Catholic\n          bigots\" are misbegotten; but not that all\n          \"papists\" are, for that would insult and\n          provoke violence \"on the basis of religion.\"\n          St. Paul has no such authority to license one\n          side of a debate to fight freestyle, while\n          requiring the other to follow Marquis of\n          Queensberry rules.\nId. at 391-92.\n     The ability to use certain linguistic tools in the course of\nargument, in other words, cannot in certain settings be statutorily\nmonopolized by only one side of a debate, even if the other side\nhad other, possibly less effective, ways to get its message out.\nUnder the MBTA's first and second guidelines, as in the statute in\nR.A.V., this sort of tilted playing field would potentially have\nbeen possible. The criminal statute at issue in R.A.V. and the\nregulation of advertising by the government as a commercial\nenterprise at issue are quite different contexts, and thus R.A.V.\nmay have no applicability here.\n     Further, the type of problem identified in R.A.V. is not a\nproblem for an advertiser in Good News's position. Good News is a\nreligion; its rejected advertisement was fairly understood as an\nattempt to demean other religions. Any attempt to demean Good News\nor its stance on the falsity of other religions would doubtlessly\nbe denigration \"on the basis of . . . religion\" and thus would be\nprohibited even by the initial two sets of regulations. The R.A.V.\nproblem only exists where the individual or group that is prevented\nfrom speaking is not itself an object of protection under the\nclassifications given in a statute or regulation (for example,\nbigots were not a protected group under the statute in R.A.V.).\n     Ridley also cannot challenge these earlier regulations on\ntheir face, as part of an overbreadth challenge. Such a challenge\nwas not made to us, and it is waived.\n\n                               -52-\n\fgroups.      In this context, the guideline is just a ground rule:\n\nthere is no viewpoint discrimination in the guideline because the\n\nstate is not attempting to give one group an advantage over another\n\nin the marketplace of ideas.       See Elena Kagan, \"Regulation of Hate\n\nSpeech and Pornography after R.A.V.,\" 60 U. Chi. L. Rev. 873, 889\n\n(1993) (suggesting, based on the court's language, that the problem\n\nwith the statute in R.A.V. could have been avoided by drafting a\n\nstatute that did not single out any specific groups for protected\n\nstatus).12\n\n             Similarly,    under   the   MBTA's    current   guideline,   all\n\nadvertisers on all sides of all questions are allowed to positively\n\npromote their own perspective and even to criticize other positions\n\nso long as they do not use demeaning speech in their attacks.              No\n\nadvertiser     can   use   demeaning     speech:     atheists   cannot    use\n\ndisparaging language to describe the beliefs of Christians, nor can\n\nChristians use disparaging language to describe the beliefs of\n\natheists.      Both sides, however, can use positive language to\n\ndescribe their own organizations, beliefs, and values.           Some kinds\n\n\n\n     12\n      This guideline at issue here is somewhat like the regulation\nat issue in Cogswell v. City of Seattle, 347 F.3d 809 (9th Cir.\n2003). In Cogswell, the plaintiff challenged a regulation that\nallowed each candidate to promote herself in a city-printed\n\"voters' pamphlet,\" but forbade a candidate from discussing her\nopponents in the pamphlet. The court upheld this regulation as a\ncontent restriction that did not lead to viewpoint discrimination:\nsuch a \"ground rule\" that is \"equally applicable to all candidates\"\ndid not create a tilted playing field for speech. Id. at 816.\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\fof    content     (demeaning      and   disparaging   remarks)     are   being\n\ndisfavored, but no viewpoint is being preferred over another.                The\n\n\"reasonable person\" referenced in the MBTA's guidelines of course\n\ndoes not belong to any particular religious group, and would\n\nprotect minority, as well as majority, religious beliefs from\n\nlanguage that would \"demean or disparage\" them. The MBTA's current\n\nguideline neither intends nor has as a significant effect the\n\ntilting of the playing field for speech.\n\n               Ridley argues that because the MBTA accepted the first\n\ntwo ads it must accept the third.              We reject the argument that\n\nbecause a government commercial enterprise has opened up discussion\n\non one particular \"topic\" (say, religion), it must allow any and\n\nall discussion on that topic.           Reasonable ground rules, so long as\n\nthey are not intended to give one side an advantage over another,\n\ncan be set without falling prey to viewpoint discrimination. It is\n\npossible that the effect of these guidelines will fall more heavily\n\non some messages than others in certain contexts, but this does not\n\nitself make the guidelines viewpoint discriminatory; the intent and\n\nchief impact of the non-demeaning requirement is merely to ensure\n\na    certain    minimum   level    of   discourse   that   is   applicable    to\n\neveryone.\n\n               The MBTA could reasonably conclude that the earlier two\n\nadvertisements did not demean or disparage other religions, but\n\nthat the third advertisement did.              The first ad questioned the\n\n                                        -54-\n\fwaywardness of today's Christians; the second issued a condemnation\n\nof other religions.   By contrast, the third advertisement went a\n\nvitriolic further step and directly demeaned a number of religions,\n\nby calling them false.   It told the adherents of those religions\n\nthat their ways are ungodly, they are \"going to hell.\"           In\n\naddition, those demeaned religions are likely to be the shared\n\nreligions of a number of the MBTA riders.   That the MBTA chose not\n\nto ban the earlier two ads (the first under threat of suit) does\n\nnot mean it was required to accept the third ad.   This is true even\n\nhad the MBTA made a mistake under its guidelines in accepting the\n\nfirst two ads.\n\n          Ridley argues that even if the third advertisement is\n\ndemeaning to other religions, the government still may not reject\n\nthe ad because the subject matter is the protected one of religion.\n\nThe government may not, Ridley argues, \"attempt to protect citizens\n\nfrom being exposed to religious views they might find offensive,\"\n\nciting Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495 (1952), which\n\ninvalidated a statute that set up a censorship board which refused\n\nlicenses for \"sacrilegious\" films.    The case is inapposite, as the\n\nMBTA is not censoring religious speech here at all.   The statute in\n\nWilson acted as a prior restraint preventing the showing of a film\n\ndeemed sacrilegious by the censors in any public place in the\n\nstate.   Id. at 497, 503.    The guidelines at issue here merely\n\nprevent advertisements from being put up in the MBTA's own system.\n\n\n                               -55-\n\fMoreover, the statute in Wilson was aimed only at religious speech,\n\nand the language made it clear that its goal was to \"suppress real\n\nor imagined attacks on a particular religious doctrine.\"                             Id. at\n\n505.    The goal of the MBTA's guidelines here has nothing to do with\n\ncensoring religious beliefs; the purpose instead is to maintain a\n\ncertain minimal level of decorum in all advertisements.\n\n            The second advertisement and the third advertisement\n\nshare the same basic viewpoint, yet the MBTA approved the second\n\nadvertisement even though it rejected the third.                           This is further\n\nevidence that      the        MBTA's    actions       here    were       not   motivated   by\n\ndistaste for Ridley's particular viewpoint.                         She has presented no\n\nevidence    that        the     MBTA     ever       allowed        any    other     specific\n\nadvertisement that would suggest viewpoint discrimination towards\n\nher.    For example, there is no evidence in the record that other\n\nadvertisements,     religious           or   otherwise,        were      accepted    despite\n\ncontaining demeaning or disparaging content.\n\n            The    two-week            delay     in    approving          Ridley's    first\n\nadvertisement      is    surely        not   a   basis       for   inferring      viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination.         Nor is the saga connected with the placement of\n\nher second advertisement -- this shows merely that the MBTA was\n\nhoning its guidelines throughout this period and was working out\n\nits enforcement of various issues connected with the guidelines.13\n\n\n       13\n      It is true, as the parties stipulated, that the word\n\"denigration\" in the MBTA's first set of guidelines, under which\n\n                                             -56-\n\f             While    the   MBTA's     guideline     and   decision   to reject\n\nRidley's advertisement are viewpoint neutral, the regulatory scheme\n\nstill must be \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the\n\nforum\" in order to be upheld.            Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806.          The\n\nregulatory scheme at issue here is eminently reasonable.                      The\n\nMBTA's stated purposes in running its advertising program include\n\n\"maximiz[ing] revenue\" by making money through advertisements while\n\nnot    reducing       ridership      through    offensive      advertisements,\n\n\"maintaining a safe and welcoming environment\" for its riders\n\n(including children), and avoiding its identification with the ads\n\nit displays.         A guideline preventing demeaning or disparaging\n\nadvertisements is likely to serve these purposes well and is\n\nconsistent with the MBTA's own \"Courtesy Counts\" program.\n\nC.    Facial Validity of Guidelines: Vagueness and Vesting of\n\n      Discretion\n\n             Change the Climate argues that the guidelines must fail,\n\nin    any   event,    because   they    are    not   sufficiently     clear   and\n\nobjective.      Change the Climate and Ridley also challenge the\n\n\nRidley's second advertisement was initially rejected, means\nvirtually the same thing as the words \"demean[] or disparage[]\" in\nthe MBTA's second set of guidelines, under which Ridley's second\nadvertisement was eventually accepted.     But the second set of\nguidelines also adopted a new policy determining that a website\nlisted on an advertisement should not be considered unless the\nadvertisement itself has an unclear message. This new policy was\ndirectly applicable to Ridley's second advertisement, which\nreferenced a website containing additional and potentially\n\"demeaning\" content (the same kind of list of \"false\" religions\nstated in the third advertisement).\n\n                                       -57-\n\fregulatory scheme on the ground that it is too vague and vests too\n\nmuch discretion in MBTA officials.    In its Ridley opinion, the\n\ndistrict court did not address the claim.   In Change the Climate,\n\nhowever, the district court found that the guideline prohibiting\n\ndemeaning or disparaging material was \"somewhat vague\" on its face\n\nand \"still leaves too much room for arbitrary decisions.\"\n\n          In any event, the record is adequate to address this kind\n\nof facial challenge to the guidelines. Since, as well, the parties\n\nhave thoroughly briefed this issue, there are no facts in dispute,\n\nand the issue raises important questions regarding the application\n\nof the First Amendment to the MBTA, we will address this challenge.\n\nSee, e.g., In re Keeper of Records, 348 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(appellate consideration of an issue raised but not ruled upon by\n\nthe court below is proper where \"[t]he parties have briefed [an]\n\nissue, the facts pertaining to it are essentially uncontradicted,\n\nand an adjudication will expedite matters.\"); AIDS Action Comm. of\n\nMassachusetts v. MBTA, 42 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"[S]o long as\n\nthe record is adequately developed, we will not hesitate to resolve\n\na mixed fact/law issue involving a core First Amendment concern\n\neven though the district court did not address it in the first\n\ninstance.\").\n\n          The vagueness inquiry, to the extent it applies here at\n\nall, incorporates two basic concerns: 1) concerns about fair\n\nnotice, and about the related danger of chilling expression, and 2)\n\n\n                               -58-\n\fconcerns about excessive discretion being invested in administering\n\nand enforcing officials. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.\n\n104, 108-09 (1972).         The mere fact that a regulation requires\n\ninterpretation does not make it vague.           McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S.\n\n93, 169 n.64 (2003); Rose v. Locke, 423 U.S. 48, 49-50 (1975).\n\n              First Amendment analysis is particularly prone to words\n\nand phrases being taken out of context.           Concerns about vagueness\n\nand   about    excessive    discretion   arise    most   strongly   in   other\n\ncontexts. The void-for-vagueness argument classically arises where\n\nthe government imposes criminal sanctions for conduct or speech.\n\nSee United States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 56-59 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nAnd the concern over subjective decision making has most effect in\n\ngovernment licensing schemes.        Neither is the situation here.\n\n              Here, there is no serious concern about either notice or\n\nchilling effects, where there are no consequences for submitting a\n\nnon-conforming advertisement and having it rejected.                See Nat'l\n\nEndowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 588-89 (1998) (no\n\nserious concern that people will \"steer too far clear\" and be\n\nchilled in the context of a regulation that is not criminal or\n\nquasi-criminal      and    merely   establishes    criteria   for    grants);\n\nChildren of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix, 154 F.3d 972, 983 (9th\n\nCir. 1998) (relaxing the vagueness standard in the context of a\n\ncity transportation system's advertising policy because \"[t]his\n\n\n\n\n                                     -59-\n\fclaim is unlike the usual vagueness challenge involving a fine or\n\nother sanction that has the potential to chill conduct.\").\n\n            Thus the inquiry reduces to an investigation into whether\n\nthe discretion given to MBTA administrators under the scheme is\n\nunconstitutionally excessive.           The void-for-vagueness doctrine and\n\nthe excessive delegation doctrine are technically \"analytically\n\ndistinct,\" Griffin v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 288 F.3d 1309,\n\n1329 (Fed. Cir. 2002), but overlap on the facts here.                 Virtually\n\nall of the Supreme Court cases to determine excessive discretion\n\nchallenges have dealt with traditional public            fora.      See Griffin,\n\n288 F.3d at 1321-22.        The danger of excessive discretion in this\n\ncase is that it could lead to viewpoint-discriminatory decisions in\n\npractice even under a facially neutral regulation. We have already\n\nconcluded there was no viewpoint discrimination in Ridley, and that\n\nthe viewpoint discrimination in Change the Climate did not result\n\nfrom the face of those guidelines.\n\n            The cases that Change the Climate and Ridley cite all\n\ndeal with licensing schemes regulating the exercise of speech in\n\ntraditional public fora. The dissent similarly relies on cases and\n\nstandards     that   are    out    of   context    because   they    deal   with\n\ntraditional    public      fora.   See,    e.g.,   Forsyth   County,     Ga.   v.\n\nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 130-33 (1992) (striking down\n\npermit scheme for demonstration on courthouse steps); Shuttlesworth\n\nv. City of Birmingham, Ala., 394 U.S. 147, 150-51 (1969) (striking\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\fdown permit requirement for protest on city streets).             In these\n\nsituations, it is true, delegations of authority to grant licenses\n\nfor speech may operate as prior restraints.                As such, those\n\ndelegations must meet the stringent standard of containing \"narrow,\n\nobjective,    and   definite   standards   to     guide     the   licensing\n\nauthority.\"   Shuttlesworth, 394 U.S. at 150-51.           The settings for\n\nthose cases are unarguably public fora open to everybody and to all\n\ntypes of speech; the very limited obstructions permitted by the\n\nlicensing requirement are allowed primarily so that the state can\n\nmaintain basic order.\n\n          The regulatory scheme at issue here is not a licensing\n\nscheme, and the MBTA advertising program is neither a traditional\n\nnor a designated public forum.    See, e.g., Kokinda, 497 U.S. at 725\n\n(government   holds   as   proprietor,   and    not   as    licensor,   when\n\noperating a non-public forum).    Excessive discretion and vagueness\n\ninquiries under the First Amendment are not static inquiries,\n\nimpervious to context.      See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 871-72\n\n(1997) (the vagueness inquiry is most rigorous in a criminal\n\ncontext, where there is a high risk speech will be chilled);\n\nFinley, 524 U.S. at 581-83, 588-89 (requirements that might be\n\nvague in other contexts, like a criminal statute, were not vague\n\nwhen used as criteria for a grant process that was subjective by\n\nnature); Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,\n\nInc., 455 U.S. 489, 498 (1982)(\"The degree of vagueness that the\n\n\n                                 -61-\n\fConstitution tolerates--as well as the relative importance of fair\n\nnotice and fair enforcement--depends in part on the nature of the\n\nenactment.\").\n\n             Our view is that a grant of discretion to exercise\n\njudgment in a non-public forum must be upheld so long as it is\n\n\"reasonable in light of the characteristic nature and function\" of\n\nthat forum.     Griffin, 288 F.3d at 1323; see also Finley, 524 U.S.\n\nat 589-590 (approving broad discretion to take into consideration\n\n\"general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs\n\nand values of the American public\" in NEA grant process, given the\n\ninherently     subjective    nature     of    these    types   of   selection\n\nprocesses).       \"[S]electivity\"      and    \"discretionary    access\"   are\n\ndefining characteristics of non-public fora, which unlike public\n\nfora are not intended to be open to all speech.             See Griffin, 288\n\nF.3d at 1323.\n\n             The MBTA's regulatory guidelines, which in Ridley reject\n\nany advertisement that \"demeans or disparages an individual or\n\ngroup   of    individuals\"   and      which    use    \"prevailing   community\n\nstandards\" to determine whether advertisements fall afoul of this\n\nstandard, are not unreasonably vague or overbroad, given the nature\n\nof the MBTA's advertising program and its chief purpose of raising\n\nrevenue without losing ridership.             Some kinds of advertisements\n\nthat will be consistent with this purpose may be difficult to\n\npinpoint with exact precision; some degree of interpretation, and\n\n\n                                    -62-\n\fsome reliance on concepts like \"prevailing community standards,\" is\n\ninevitable.        In    Griffin,     the     court     found   that   considerable\n\ndiscretion left in the hands of the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nwas acceptable to ensure the preservation of the commemorative\n\nfunctions of national cemeteries; the MBTA is also entitled to some\n\ndiscretion    in    determining       which    advertisements       are   likely   to\n\nalienate ridership and cost it revenue.                 These decisions also \"may\n\ndefy    objective       description    and     .   .    .   vary   with   individual\n\ncircumstances.\"         Griffin, 288 F.3d at 1325.\n\n             In any event, for purposes of the acceptance or rejection\n\nof advertising, words like \"demean\" or \"disparage\" have reasonably\n\nclear meanings. We recognize that several courts have struck down,\n\non   vagueness     grounds,    school       speech      codes   that   incorporated\n\nsomewhat similar terms.          See Dambrot v. Central Mich. Univ., 55\n\nF.3d 1177, 1183-84 (6th Cir. 1995); UWM Post, Inc. v. Board of\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Wis. Sys., 774 F. Supp. 1163, 1178-81 (E.D.\n\nWis. 1991); Doe v. Univ. of Mich., 721 F. Supp. 852, 866-67 (E.D.\n\nMich. 1989).       But cf. UWM Post, 774 F. Supp. at 1179-80 (In the\n\ncontext of a university hate speech regulation, the word \"demean\"\n\nis not \"unduly vague,\" since it has a \"reasonably clear\" meaning:\n\n\"to debase in dignity or stature.\").14                 These decisions come out of\n\n\n       14\n      The changes in position by the MBTA in this case do not show\nthat the standard is too vague. We decline to use the MBTA's past\nchanges in its guidelines against it; what is important is that the\nMBTA's rules are now reasonably clear.\n\n\n                                        -63-\n\fa very different context: vagueness concerns are more pressing when\n\nthere are sanctions (such as expulsion) attached to violations of\n\na challenged regulation.\n\n              Further, we acknowledge that two courts considered public\n\ntransportation       advertising   policies       that    gave    their    systems\n\ndiscretion      to   reject   \"controversial\"          advertisements       to   be\n\nunconstitutional.       See United Food & Commercial Workers Union,\n\nLocal 1099 v. Southwest Ohio Reg'l Transit Auth., 163 F.3d 341,\n\n358-60 (6th Cir. 1998); Nat'l Abortion Fed'n v. Metro. Atlanta\n\nRapid Transit Auth., 112 F. Supp.2d 1320, 1327-28 (N.D. Ga. 2000).\n\nThe cases are distinguishable.       In both, a public forum was found.\n\nFurther, a regulation asking whether something is \"controversial\"\n\nis a less precise inquiry, and has the potential to strike down\n\nmany   more     advertisements,    than    a    regulation       asking    whether\n\nadvertisements \"demean[] or disparage[]\" someone.\n\n                                    III.\n\nAttorney's Fees\n\n           Change the Climate appealed from the district court's\n\ndenial of attorney's fees.          Change the Climate argued it was\n\nentitled to attorney's fees on the findings that the guidelines\n\nwere constitutionally flawed.        The basis for the argument is now\n\ngone, as we uphold the guidelines against any facial challenge.\n\n              Nonetheless,    Change           the       Climate's        viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination argument has prevailed.               See 42 U.S.C. § 1988.       We\n\n\n                                    -64-\n\fremand to the district court for further proceedings on attorney's\n\nfees.\n\n                                   IV.\n\nConclusion\n\n          The decision of the district court in the Ridley case\n\ngranting judgment to the MBTA on the ground there was no viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination is affirmed.       The decision in Ridley, which was\n\nentered in the district court's Change the Climate judgment, is\n\nreversed as to the finding that the \"demeaning or disparaging\"\n\nguideline is constitutionally flawed and as to the retention of\n\njurisdiction over this issue.       Entry of declaratory judgment is\n\nawarded to the MBTA as to the facial validity of the sets of\n\nguidelines at issue in both Ridley and Change the Climate.             The\n\ndistrict court's decision in Change the Climate on viewpoint\n\ndiscrimination    grounds   is   reversed   with   directions   to   enter\n\ndeclaratory judgment for Change the Climate on those grounds.           We\n\nremand to the district court for entry of judgment consistent with\n\nthis opinion and for determination of the issue of attorney's fees\n\nfor Change the Climate.     Since each side has prevailed on portions\n\nof this case, no costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n             (Concurring and dissenting opinion follows.)\n\n\n\n\n                                  -65-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in part, Dissenting\n\nin part). Since the majority agrees with me in Case No. 03-2285\n\n(\"Change the Climate\") that the MBTA engaged in unconstitutional\n\nviewpoint discrimination by rejecting all three of Change the\n\nClimate's advertisements, it is appropriate that I concur in the\n\noutcome of that appeal.    Unfortunately, I can neither join the\n\nopinion of my learned colleagues on the remainder of its analysis,\n\nnor join in the outcome of Case No. 03-1970 (\"Ridley\").      In my\n\nview, regardless of the nature of the forum involved, the MBTA's\n\nrejection of Ridley's third proposed advertisement was unreasonable\n\nand constitutes viewpoint discrimination, abuses made possible by\n\nthe vague and subjective nature of the MBTA's \"demean[ing] or\n\ndisparag[ing]\" standard.   Consequently, it is unnecessary for this\n\ncourt to forge into the murky waters of forum analysis -- an issue,\n\nit is worth noting, irrelevant to the outcome in Change the Climate\n\nand not even raised by the plaintiff in Ridley.    See AIDS Action\n\nComm. of Mass., Inc. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 42 F.3d 1, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (finding forum analysis unnecessary when restriction\n\nviolates prohibition on viewpoint discrimination, and undesirable\n\non a record not fully developed by plaintiff-appellant); see also\n\nLaurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-24, at 988 (2d\n\ned. 1988) (deeming \"public forum classifications . . . unnecessary\n\n\n\n\n                               -66-\n\fand unhelpful\" in challenges to content-based restrictions).1                If,\n\nhowever, the nature of the forum created by the MBTA's opening its\n\nfacilities to commercial and non-commercial advertisers must be\n\ndecided, we cannot allow ourselves to be led astray by the MBTA's\n\nhollow protestations that it did not intend to open its facilities\n\nto free expression.        Accordingly, I would find that the MBTA has\n\ncreated a public forum for the expression of ideas such as those\n\ncontained in Ridley's third advertisement.\n\n                I.     Rejection of Ridley's advertisement\n\n            I need not repeat much of the background already provided\n\nby the majority. Suffice it to say, the offending guideline allows\n\nthe MBTA to refuse any advertisement that \"contains material that\n\ndemeans or disparages an individual or group of individuals.\"                The\n\nguideline     states    that   the    MBTA    will   determine   whether     the\n\nadvertising    contains     such     offending   language   by   reference    to\n\n\"whether a reasonably prudent person, knowledgeable of the MBTA's\n\nridership and using prevailing community standards, would believe\n\n\n     1\n      Indeed, the majority's insistence on delving into forum\nanalysis is perplexing, given its recognition that \"[p]ublic forum\nanalysis itself has been criticized as unhelpful in many contexts,\nand particularly this one where the government is operating a\ncommercial enterprise earning income from advertising.\" Maj. op.\nat 15-16 (citing Tribe, supra, at § 2-24, at 922 (\"[W]hether or not\na given place is deemed a 'public forum' is ordinarily less\nsignificant than the nature of the speech restriction--despite the\nCourt's rhetoric.\"); Frederick Schauer, Principles, Institutions,\nand the First Amendment, 112 Harv. L. Rev. 84, 97 (1998) (\"Of all\nof the paths down which the Court might go in dealing with the\ngovernment enterprise cases, the so-called 'forum doctrine' appears\nleast satisfactory.\")).\n\n                                       -67-\n\fthat the advertisement contains material that ridicules or mocks,\n\nis abusive or hostile to, or debases the dignity or stature of, an\n\nindividual or group of individuals.\"\n\n          Regardless of how the MBTA's forum should be classified,\n\nthe MBTA's content-based restrictions must (1) be \"reasonable in\n\nlight of the purpose served by the forum,\" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal\n\nDef. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985), (2) not discriminate\n\non the basis of viewpoint, see id. at 800 (\"Access to a non-public\n\nforum . . . can be restricted as long as the restrictions are\n\n'reasonable and [are] not an effort to suppress expression merely\n\nbecause public officials oppose the speaker's view.'\" (quoting\n\nPerry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46\n\n(1983)), and (3) not be so vague as to lead to arbitrary or\n\ndiscriminatory application, see, e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford,\n\n408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972) (\"[I]f arbitrary and discriminatory\n\nenforcement   is   to   be   prevented,   laws    must   provide   explicit\n\nstandards for those who apply them.\").           See also AIDS Action, 42\n\nF.3d at 13 (\"[The MBTA] will, at the least, need to act according\n\nto neutral standards, and it will need to apply these standards in\n\nsuch a way that there is no appearance that 'the [government] is\n\nseeking to handicap the expression of particular ideas.'\" (quoting\n\nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 394 (1992)).          The\n\nMBTA's rejection of Ridley's proposed advertisement fails on all of\n\nthese points.\n\n\n                                  -68-\n\f          As   indicated     in   appellant's   brief,   the      \"prevailing\n\ncommunity standards\" language contained in the offending MBTA rule\n\nis the MBTA's attempt to breathe validity into its regulation by\n\ninterjecting   one   prong   of   the   three-prong   test   in    Miller v.\n\nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973), for determining whether speech\n\nis obscene.    One out of three prongs, however, is insufficient to\n\ncure the guideline's defect.      \"Just because a definition including\n\nthree limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of\n\nthose limitations, standing by itself, is not vague.\"                Reno v.\n\nACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 873 (1997) (holding that the Communications\n\nDecency Act, which used a \"contemporary community standards\" test\n\nto regulate obscene speech on the Internet, offended the First\n\nAmendment because it was unconstitutionally vague).\n\n          Indeed, the very idea that the MBTA considers that there\n\nis such a thing as a \"prevailing community standard\" for demeaning\n\nor disparaging expression is itself ridiculous.          How would such a\n\nrule be discerned?    What evidence is there in the record that the\n\nthird advertisement violated this standard, other than the MBTA's\n\nsubjective and conclusory assertion that it did?         To the contrary,\n\na religious message such as the advertisement in question does not\n\ndisparage its targets, but rather alerts them to a (perceived) fact\n\nconcerning their eternal salvation.2        This is not a case of a hate\n\n\n     2\n      In this way, Ridley's advertisement would be analogous to a\npublic service announcement stating: \"Kids who smoke think they\nlook cool, but really it makes them look stupid.\"     It would be\n\n                                    -69-\n\fgroup defaming the followers of Judaism, Catholicism, or another\n\nreligion      as   having     some    intrinsic   individual      flaw.     Rather,\n\nRidley's advertisement attempts to convert these people to her\n\nreligion.      Telling people they are risking going to hell is, like\n\nit or not, a key component of explaining why religious choices are\n\nso important, and reasonable minds could most certainly disagree\n\nwith the conclusion that such a statement in any way demeans or\n\ndisparages the very people it aims to save.               That such a statement\n\nwas considered \"hostile,\" \"mock[ing],\" or \"demean[ing]\" highlights\n\nthe ambiguity and unreasonableness of the MBTA's guideline.                        The\n\n\"prevailing community standard\" formulation does not rescue the\n\nMBTA's     guideline        from     vagueness;   rather,    it     permits    MBTA\n\nauthorities -- even if they have the best of intentions -- to make\n\nsubjective,        ad   hoc   determinations      about   speech    that    appears\n\ncontroversial because it endorses a minority viewpoint.                            Cf.\n\nKeyishian v. Bd. of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967) (stating that\n\nthe   First    Amendment      protects     against   an   oppressive       \"pall   of\n\northodoxy\" in schools).              The guideline, therefore, is void for\n\nvagueness.3\n\n\ndifficult to imagine the MBTA rejecting such an advertisement on\nthe basis that it ridicules or demeans adolescent smokers.\n      3\n      The majority's suggestion, Maj. op. at 59-62, that the\nvagueness inquiry is not important in this case because it does not\ninvolve a licensing scheme in a traditional public forum is\nunconvincing. Even if the majority is correct that this is not a\ntraditional public forum in the legal sense, the MBTA transit\nsystem serves as its functional equivalent in today's society. 2.5\n\n                                         -70-\n\f              The MBTA has permitted religious advertising in its\n\nfacilities, but discriminates among religious messages on the basis\n\nof    their   content.     The    majority   claims   that   this   content\n\ndiscrimination does not amount to viewpoint discrimination because\n\nall   religions    \"are   allowed   to   positively   promote   their   own\n\nperspective and even to criticize other positions so long as they\n\ndo not use demeaning speech in their attacks.\"           Maj. op. at 54.\n\nThis conclusion assumes that a statement like \"all good Catholics\n\ngo to heaven\" is sufficiently rebutted by replying \"all good\n\nBuddhists go to heaven.\"         From this dialogue, we could draw the\n\nheartwarming conclusion that \"all good Catholics and Buddhists\" go\n\nto heaven.      Good or bad, however, this is simply not the type of\n\nmessage that most religions espouse.         Especially for small groups\n\nlike Ridley's, an essential part of proselytizing is explaining\n\nthat in their view and the view of their prophet, \"all good\n\nCatholics, Buddhists, etc. are not going to heaven; rather, they\n\nare going to hell.\"       This belief is central to their message of\n\n\nmillion people use its facilities on a daily basis, and it contains\napproximately 40,000 advertising spaces. In effect, the MBTA is in\na position to control the dissemination of information to a large\nsegment of the public which, in a practical sense, is obliged to be\nexposed to whatever advertising the MBTA chooses to permit in its\nfacilities. Consequently, the \"danger of excessive discretion . .\n. lead[ing] to viewpoint-discriminatory decisions,\" id. at 60, is\nquite serious. Further, while the majority indicates that concern\nabout vagueness is at its zenith in licensing schemes for\ntraditional public fora, I am aware of no precedent that would\npermit vagueness in regulations outside of this context, especially\nwhen the potential ramifications of unconstitutional implementation\nhave a similar practical effect.\n\n                                    -71-\n\fconversion.        It    is    the    clearest     statement   of   the   (eternal)\n\nconsequences for those who do not convert, and it is undoubtedly a\n\nfact that they are hoping will propel the message's viewers to go\n\nto their website and learn more about their beliefs.\n\n            Further,          while    the    majority      concludes     that    an\n\nadvertisement may criticize other religions as long as it does so\n\nin a non-demeaning way, it is apparent from the rejection of\n\nRidley's third advertisement that even a text-based criticism about\n\nreligion4   will    be    more       likely   to   strike   MBTA    authorities   as\n\n\"hostile,\" \"mocking,\" or \"demeaning,\" simply because it names that\n\nreligion.     Indeed, the third advertisement did not say anything\n\nthat was not implicit in the second advertisement, which declared\n\nthat there were over 1,000 (unnamed) false religions.                       If the\n\nguidelines permit the second advertisement, they cannot reasonably\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The rejected advertisement stated that \"[t]here are no\nscriptures in the Bible that teach that God set up the Catholic\nreligion, the Baptist religion, the Pentecostal religion, the\nJehovah's Witness religion or the Muslim religion. These religions\nare false.\"\n\n                                          -72-\n\fbe applied to forbid the third.5                Thus, the MBTA's position is\n\nintrinsically viewpoint oriented.\n\n            The religious nature of Ridley's advertisement increases\n\nthe   MBTA's     burden,   for   religious       advertising   is    a   \"form   of\n\nreligious activity [that] occupies the same high estate under the\n\nFirst Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from\n\nthe pulpits.\"      Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 109 (1943);\n\nsee also Jews for Jesus, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 984 F.2d\n\n1319,     1324   (1st   Cir.     1993)     (prohibiting   ban       on   religious\n\nleafletting at MBTA stations).           \"The principle that government may\n\nnot enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice [merely\n\nbecause it is unorthodox] is so well understood that few violations\n\nare recorded in our opinions.\"             Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,\n\nInc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 523 (1993) (striking down\n\nattempted suppression of religious rites that included animal\n\nsacrifices).\n\n            Simply put, the First Amendment does not recognize state\n\nauthority to regulate religious expression merely because it might\n\n\n\n      5\n      The majority insists that MBTA ought not be bound to permit\nexpressions analogous to those it mistakenly permitted in the past.\nThis might be so in an isolated case. However, one cannot ignore\nthe MBTA's haphazard and unpredictable pattern of enforcement with\nregard not only to Ridley's three ads, but also to earlier ads,\nsuch as those at issue in AIDS Action, 42 F.3d at 1. This suggests\nthat it was no mere oversight or misunderstanding that led to the\nacceptance of Ridley's second advertisement. We must not allow the\nMBTA to change its standards or its enforcement thereof every time\nits application of the guidelines is challenged.\n\n                                         -73-\n\foffend other persons.          \"It is firmly settled that . . . the public\n\nexpression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas\n\nare themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\"                            Hustler\n\nMagazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 56 (1988) (quoting Street v. New\n\nYork, 394 U.S. 576, 592 (1969)).               Religious speech -- especially\n\nthat of a proselytizing nature most often found in mass advertising\n\nby religious organizations -- is intended to strike at the core of\n\npeople's     strongest    beliefs;      in    that    sense,     it   is    inevitably\n\n\"hostile\" to those beliefs.            Placing the government in a position\n\nof deciding whether to allow the expression of those beliefs\n\ndepending on whether they are \"hostile\" or \"demeaning\"                         to the\n\ncommunity     strikes     at     the    heart    of    the       First     Amendment's\n\nprohibitions against state regulation of speech. Texas v. Johnson,\n\n491   U.S.   397,   414   (1989)       (\"If   there    is    a   bedrock     principle\n\nunderlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not\n\nprohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the\n\nidea itself offensive or disagreeable.\").                    Any religious speech\n\nwill be viewed as \"hostile\" by at least some, if not all, of those\n\nwho do not share the belief it proclaims.               See Gitlow v. New York,\n\n268 U.S. 652, 673 (Holmes, J., dissenting) (\"Every idea is an\n\nincitement.\").\n\n             Religious    belief       is     quintessentially        a    matter   of\n\nviewpoint.      The government cannot allow dissemination of one\n\nviewpoint that it finds inoffensive or bland, and prohibit the\n\n\n                                        -74-\n\fdissemination of another viewpoint that it finds offensive or\n\n\"demeaning,\" because the \"point of all speech protection . . . is\n\nto shield just those choices of content that in someone's eyes are\n\nmisguided, or even hurtful.\" Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian, and\n\nBisexual Group, 515 U.S. 557, 574 (1995).       Such distinctions are\n\nviewpoint based, not merely reasonable content restrictions.\n\n           By its very nature, a prohibition against ads that are\n\n\"hostile\" to an individual or a group of individuals is viewpoint\n\nbased.      The   guideline   would    permit   ads   from   Catholics,\n\nPentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and others stating their\n\nbeliefs -- their \"viewpoints\" -- that their religions were \"set up\"\n\nby God.6   The MBTA, however, refuses to permit Ridley to state the\n\n\n     6\n      Claims of a unique holy charter and exclusive salvation are\ncommonplace in western religion.     The examples below are not\ndissimilar from the position espoused by Ridley in her third\nadvertisement:\n\n     The Roman Catholic Church:      \"This is the sole Church of\nChrist, which in the Creed we profess to be one, holy, catholic and\napostolic.\" Catechism of the Catholic Church #811. \"There is but\none holy Catholic and apostolic church, outside of which there is\nno salvation . . . it is altogether necessary for salvation for\nevery creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\" 1 Vatican\nCouncil II 364-65 (Austin Flannery, O.P., ed.).\n\n     Jehovah's Witnesses: \"Consider too, the fact that Jehovah's\norganization alone, in all the earth, is directed by God's holy\nspirit or active force.\" The Watchtower, July 1, 1973, at 402.\n\n     Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon): \"This\nis not just another Church.     This is not just one family of\nChristian churches. This is the Church and the kingdom of God, the\nonly true Church upon the face of the earth, according to the\nLord's own words.\" Ezra Taft Benson, The Teaching of Ezra Taft\nBenson 164-5 (1988). \"Behold there are save two churches only; the\n\n                                -75-\n\fopposite viewpoint: her belief that these religions were not \"set\n\nup\" by God, but are \"false,\" and that only her belief is correct.\n\nThis is unquestionably viewpoint discrimination, as \"[t]he essence\n\nof viewpoint-based discrimination is the state's decision to pick\n\nand choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or\n\nsuppress a particular ideology or outlook.\"    Berner v. Delahanty,\n\n129 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          The MBTA's justification for censoring Ridley's religious\n\nexpressions in the third advertisement is the suggestion that some\n\nriders might take offense to its content.   This is not a sufficient\n\nreason to stifle speech protected by the First Amendment.       See\n\nPlanned Parenthood Ass'n/Chicago Area v. Chicago Transit Auth., 767\n\nF.2d 1225, 1230 (7th Cir. 1985) (\"We question whether a regulation\n\nof speech that has as its touchstone a government official's\n\nsubjective view that the speech is 'controversial' could ever pass\n\n\n\none is the Church of the Lamb of God and the other is the churches\nof the devil; wherefore who so belongeth not to the church of the\nlamb of god belongeth to that great church; which is the mother of\nabominations; and she is the whore of all the earth\".

This mandate would have to\nbe rejected as offensive to non-Judeo-Christians because it is\n\"hostile\" to and \"disparages\" believers in deities other than the\nJudeo-Christian god.\n\n                               -76-\n\fconstitutional muster.\"); see also Penthouse Int'l, Ltd. v.

What the MBTA fails to understand is that \"[z]ealots have\n\nFirst Amendment rights too.\"    Pinette v. Capitol Square Review and\n\nAdvisory Bd., 30 F.3d 675, 680 (6th Cr. 1994), aff'd on other\n\ngrounds, 515 U.S. 753, 760 (1995).      I invite the majority to take\n\nnote of that principle and conclude, as I do, that the MBTA engaged\n\nin viewpoint discrimination in refusing Ridley's third submission.\n\n                       II.     Forum analysis\n\n          Although I find it unnecessary and ill-advised to engage\n\nin forum analysis in these cases, it is appropriate that I comment\n\non the majority's conclusions that the MBTA has not created a\n\ndesignated public forum by opening its facilities to advertisers\n\nexpressing a broad range of commercial and non-commercial views.\n\nLike the Second and Third Circuits, I find that this kind of\n\nadvertising program on public transportation facilities converts\n\nthem into a designated public forum.      See N.Y. Magazine v. Metro.\n\nTransp. Auth., 136 F.3d 123, 129-30 (2d Cir. 1998) (concluding that\n\nadvertising space on outside of city buses was a designated public\n\nforum); Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. S.E. Pa. Transp. Auth.,\n\n148 F.3d 242, 252-55 (3d Cir. 1998) (finding that transportation\n\nauthority had created a designated public forum by accepting a\n\nvariety of advertisements, despite its rejection of a few such\n\n\n                                 -77-\n\fadvertisements based on their content), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1068\n\n(1999); see also AIDS Action Committee v. MBTA, 849 F. Supp. 79, 83\n\n(D. Mass. 1994) (finding that MBTA's advertising space in subway\n\nand trolley cars is a public forum), aff'd on other grounds, 42\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           A designated public forum may be \"created by government\n\ndesignation of a place or channel of communication for use by the\n\npublic at large for assembly and speech, for use by certain\n\nspeakers, or for the discussion of certain subjects.\"      Cornelius,\n\n473 U.S. at 802 (citing Perry, 460 U.S. at 45, 46 n.7).      Even if\n\nthe government was not obligated to open the designated public\n\nforum or to retain its open character indefinitely, as long as the\n\nforum is generally open \"it is bound by the same standards as apply\n\nin a traditional public forum.\"   Perry, 460 U.S. at 46.\n\n           As discussed by the majority, the key inquiry is whether\n\nthe MBTA intended to designate its advertising space as a public\n\nforum, a question we must answer by considering (1) the MBTA's\n\npolicy and practice regarding its advertising space, and (2) the\n\nnature of the MBTA's advertising space and its compatibility with\n\nexpressive activity.   Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802.\n\nA.   The MBTA's Policy and Practice\n\n           For the government's policy and practice to create a\n\ndesignated public forum, \"the government must intend to make the\n\nproperty 'generally available' to a class of speakers.\" Ark. Educ.\n\n\n                               -78-\n\fTelevision Comm'n v. Forbes (\"AETC\"), 523 U.S. 666, 678 (1998)\n\n(quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 264 (1981)).              Change the\n\nClimate asserts7 that the MBTA's policy and practice have made its\n\nadvertising space generally available to commercial and non-profit\n\norganizations for the expression of views by anyone willing to pay\n\nits   advertising   fees.      The   MBTA   does   not    dispute    that   any\n\ncommercial or non-commercial advertiser may submit advertisements\n\nunder its policy, and that it has intentionally facilitated access\n\nfor all non-profit organizations by offering them a half-price\n\ndiscount on the fees charged to commercial advertisers.\n\n            As a preliminary matter, it is appropriate to state that\n\nthe fact that the MBTA has chosen to include in its guidelines an\n\nassertion to the effect that it \"intends that its facilities\n\nconstitute nonpublic forums\" should not be determinative of that\n\nissue.    Otherwise, such a self-serving approach would allow the\n\ngovernment to simply declare property a non-public forum whenever\n\nconflicts   of   this   sort   arose.       See   Int'l   Soc.   for   Krishna\n\nConsciousness v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 695 (1992) (Kennedy, J.,\n\nconcurring).     Similarly, the fact that a particular category of\n\nspeech, such as that regarding tobacco sales, is excluded from a\n\nforum does not preclude the designation of a public forum.                  New\n\nYork Magazine, 136 F.3d at 129-30 (\"[I]t cannot be true that if the\n\n\n      7\n      I again note that Ridley has never argued forum analysis.\nSuch discussion is irrelevant to Ridley's viewpoint and vagueness\narguments, with which I fully agree.\n\n                                     -79-\n\fgovernment excludes any category of speech from a forum . . . that\n\nforum becomes ipso facto a non-public forum.\").           Nor does the fact\n\nthat the MBTA charges a fee for the use of its advertising space\n\npreclude   the    creation   of   a    designated   public   forum,   because\n\n\"[d]espite     the   existence    of     a   fee,   the   [government]   may\n\nnevertheless have allowed indiscriminate use\" of the forum by\n\n\"anyone willing to pay.\"      Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v. Dep't of\n\nAviation of the City of Chicago, 45 F.3d 1144, 1155 (7th Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n             Furthermore, I believe it is worthwhile to consider the\n\nsituation today within the context of the MBTA's advertising\n\npolicies in the years leading up to the events at issue in this\n\nlitigation.      I begin by noting that in 1994, in AIDS Action, we\n\nfound that the advertising policy promulgated by the MBTA was\n\n\"scarcely coherent, [and] invite[d] the very discrimination that\n\noccurred in [that] case, and was properly enjoined.\"             42 F.3d at\n\n12.   In the period between AIDS Action and the present litigation,\n\nfrom 1995 to at least 1999, the MBTA required that:\n\n           [a]ll advertisements at any time inserted or\n           placed by the Contractor in or upon any\n           locations or display devices shall be of a\n           reputable character, and the appearance of all\n           advertisements shall be acceptable to and in\n           accordance with the [MBTA's] Standards for\n           Character and Appearance of Advertisements.\n           No    libelous,   slanderous,    or    obscene\n           advertisements, may be accepted by the\n           Contractor for display in or upon the\n           Authority's       transit       facilities.\n           Advertisements shall be submitted in advance\n\n                                      -80-\n\f          to the Authority for review at the Authority's\n          request or whenever the Contractor reasonably\n          believes    such   advertisements     may   be\n          objectionable within the meaning of this\n          Article.\n\nThis policy was supplemented by an April 21, 1995 letter from the\n\nMBTA Interim General Manager, Robert Mabardy, which contained\n\nadditional guidelines:\n\n          The MBTA will refuse any advertisement that is\n          indecent to child viewers, or is of a nature\n          to frighten children, either emotionally or\n          physically.\n\n          . . .\n\n          These guidelines shall not be deemed to\n          prohibit indecent or frightening language that\n          could be considered double entendre, provided\n          that, if a child asked an adult the meaning of\n          such indecent or frightful language, the adult\n          could give a reasonable and truthful answer\n          without reference to indecent or frightening\n          activities or language.\n\n           In 1999, the MBTA formulated new bid specifications for\n\ntransit   advertising,    which   contained   a   new   version   of   the\n\nadvertising policy.      The 1999 bid specifications prohibited the\n\ndisplay of advertisements for tobacco products and echoed the 1992\n\nbid specifications, with the following provisions added:\n\n           The MBTA will not accept advertisements\n           containing violent criminal content, firearms,\n           profane content, promotional materials that is\n           harmful to juveniles, and advertisements that\n           denigrate groups based on gender, religion,\n           race, ethnic or political affiliation.\n\n           Subsequently, the MBTA went through two more revisions of\n\nits guidelines, as described in the majority opinion.       A new set of\n\n                                  -81-\n\f\"Interim Guidelines Regulating MBTA Advertising,\" promulgated on\n\nApril 12, 2002, provided that the MBTA \"shall not display or\n\nmaintain any advertisement\" that is:\n\n            Demeaning or disparaging. The advertisement\n            contains material that demeans or disparages\n            an individual or group of individuals on the\n            basis of race, color, religion, national\n            origin, ancestry, gender, age, disability,\n            ethnicity, or sexual orientation.\n\nOn January 17, 2003, the MBTA issued yet another revision of its\n\nguidelines, removing the language concerning race, color, etc., and\n\nadding the \"prevailing community standards\" metric for determining\n\nwhether material is demeaning or disparaging.\n\n            As a general rule, \"the more restrictive the criteria for\n\nadmission and the more administrative control over access, the less\n\nlikely a forum will be deemed public.\"           Hopper v. City of Pasco,\n\n241 F.3d 1067, 1078 (9th Cir. 2001).           Over the years, the MBTA's\n\ncriteria for admission have been confusing at best, and it has\n\nalways left the initial determinations of whether advertisements\n\nmay   run   afoul   of   the    advertising    policy   to   the   subjective\n\nevaluation of a private contractor.           Those advertisements sent to\n\nthe MBTA for review have received a similarly subjective evaluation\n\nfrom MBTA employees.           Thus, the subjective standards in these\n\npolicies create a potential for abuse, specifically the potential\n\nfor viewpoint discrimination.        See Hopper, 241 F.3d at 1079 (\"The\n\npotential for abuse of such unbounded discretion is heightened by\n\nthe inherently subjective nature of the standard itself.\").\n\n                                     -82-\n\f             I emphasize that\n\n             [t]he government may not 'create' a policy to\n             implement its newly-discovered desire to\n             suppress a particular message.    Neither may\n             the government invoke an otherwise unenforced\n             policy    to   justify    that   suppression.\n             Therefore, the government's stated policy,\n             without more, is not dispositive with respect\n             to the government's intent in a given forum.\n\nAir   Line   Pilots,   45    F.3d    at   1153   (citations   omitted).      In\n\ndetermining whether the MBTA has designated its advertising space\n\nas a public forum, then, one cannot rely on recent attempts by the\n\nMBTA to revise its advertising policy during the course of this\n\nlitigation to indicate its prior intent on the nature of its\n\nadvertising space as a forum.\n\n             Similarly,     the     MBTA's    written   policies    cannot   be\n\nconsidered without reference to their application in the years\n\npreceding this action.       In determining whether the government has\n\ndesignated property to be a public forum, we have previously stated\n\nthat \"actual practice speaks louder than words.\"                   Grace Bible\n\nFellowship, Inc. v. Maine Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 5, 941 F.2d 45, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).    \"[C]onsistency in application is the hallmark of\n\nany policy designed to preserve the non-public status of a forum.\n\nA policy purporting to keep a forum closed (or open to expression\n\nonly on certain subjects) is no policy at all for purposes of\n\npublic forum analysis if, in practice, it is not enforced or if\n\nexceptions are haphazardly permitted.\"            Hopper, 241 F.3d at 1076.\n\nIn AIDS Action, we admonished the MBTA that if it were to be\n\n                                       -83-\n\fallowed to restrict speech, \"it will, at the least, need to act\n\naccording to neutral standards, and it will need to apply these\n\nstandards in such a way that there is no appearance that 'the\n\n[government] is seeking to handicap the expression of particular\n\nideas.'\"   42 F.3d at 13 (quoting R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 394).    In\n\npractice, the MBTA has not restricted access to its advertising\n\nspace in a manner sufficient to indicate an intent to maintain it\n\nas a non-public or limited public forum.\n\n           When we decided AIDS Action, we found that \"despite the\n\nMBTA's attempts to present itself as a vigilant gatekeeper, the\n\nonly ads other than the 1993 [AIDS awareness] ads that we know the\n\nMBTA recently rejected are certain Calvin Klein ads which somehow\n\nmight have been misconstrued as endorsing the Ku Klux Klan, and an\n\nanimal rights advertisement featuring a photograph of a maimed\n\ndog.\"   Id. at 9.    In reviewing the MBTA's application of its\n\nadvertising policies since AIDS Action, I find that little has\n\nchanged.   During the five years preceding Change the Climate's\n\nfirst interactions with PTD, between 1995 and 1999, the MBTA\n\nrefused to post only fifteen advertisements.   Examples include an\n\nadvertisement for the movie Psycho, which featured an image of a\n\nnude woman in a shower with blood at the bottom, rejected because\n\nit was \"in conflict with the MBTA's dignity in the workplace and\n\nthe Commonwealth's domestic violence programs,\" neither of which\n\ncriteria are set forth in the MBTA's advertising policy. Rejection\n\n\n                               -84-\n\fof ads also appears to have occurred on an ad hoc, subjective\n\nbasis. For example, MBTA refused to post an advertisement from the\n\nconservation organization Surfriders, aimed at discouraging people\n\nfrom leaving cigarette butts on the beach, apparently because it\n\nincluded images of people smoking.               The MBTA posted, however,\n\nadvertisements for Al Italia airline that featured a woman holding\n\na cigarette with the caption, \"Create a buzz.\"                Thus, the ad hoc\n\nrejection of a handful of ads over the past decade cannot serve as\n\nthe basis for concluding that MBTA intended its advertising space\n\nas a non-public forum.\n\nB.   The Nature of the Forum and Its Compatibility with Expression\n\n            It is also necessary to examine \"the nature of the\n\nproperty and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern\n\nthe government's intent.\"         Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802 (citations\n\nomitted).     This    inquiry     involves   examining    \"the    relationship\n\nbetween the reasons for any restriction on access and the forum's\n\npurpose.\"   United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 1099 v.\n\nSouthwest Ohio Reg'l Transit Auth., 163 F.3d 341, 351 (6th Cir.\n\n1998).   The district court in Change the Climate found that \"[t]he\n\nprincipal   purpose    of   the   MBTA   using    some   of   this   space   for\n\nadvertising is to earn revenue in support of the MBTA's goal of\n\nproviding transportation.\"          214 F. Supp. 2d 125, 132 (D. Mass.\n\n2002).   In general, \"the courts will infer an intent on the part of\n\nthe government to create a public forum where the government's\n\n\n                                     -85-\n\fjustification for the exclusion of certain expressive conduct is\n\nunrelated to the forum's purpose, even when speakers must obtain\n\npermission to use the forum.\"      United Food, 163 F.3d at 351.      Forum\n\nanalysis must therefore \"involve a careful scrutiny of whether the\n\ngovernment-imposed restriction on access to public property is\n\ntruly part of 'the process of limiting a nonpublic forum to\n\nactivities compatible with the intended purpose of the property.'\"\n\nId. at 351-52 (quoting Perry, 460 U.S. at 49).            Courts will hold\n\n\"that the government did not create a public forum only when its\n\nstandards for inclusion and exclusion are clear and are designed to\n\nprevent interference with the forum's designated purpose.\"            Id.\n\n          The Supreme Court has indicated that \"[i]n cases where\n\nthe principal function of the property would be disrupted by\n\nexpressive activity, the Court [has been] particularly reluctant to\n\nhold that the government intended to designate a public forum.\"\n\nCornelius, 473 U.S. at 804.        The MBTA can hardly argue that its\n\nadvertising   space   is    generally      incompatible   with   expressive\n\nactivity, or that the MBTA's principal function of providing\n\ntransportation   would     be   disrupted   by   the   expressive   activity\n\nproposed by Change the Climate or Ridley, since it has routinely\n\nmade its advertising space available to both commercial and public-\n\nissue advertising on a wide range of issues without any disruption.\n\nSee, e.g., Planned Parenthood, 767 F.2d at 1232 (\"[S]ince CTA\n\nalready permits its facilities to be used for public-issue and\n\n\n                                    -86-\n\fpolitical    advertising,     it   cannot       argue   that   such       use   is\n\nincompatible with the primary use of the facilities.\").                    It is\n\nclear that the MBTA \"created a forum that is suitable for the\n\nspeech in question . . . .\"        Christ's Bride, 148 F.3d at 252.\n\n            The majority wrongly emphasizes the MBTA's proprietary\n\nrole with regard to its advertising space.                 In an early case\n\naddressing advertising on public transit systems, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that because \"the city is engaged in commerce,\" and \"[t]he car\n\ncard   space,   although    incidental     to    the    provision    of    public\n\ntransportation, is a part of the commercial venture,\" \"a city\n\ntransit system has discretion to develop and make reasonable\n\nchoices concerning the type of advertising that may be displayed in\n\nits vehicles.\"   Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 303\n\n(1974).     Since   Lehman,    public    forum     analysis    has    developed\n\nconsiderably but has continued to find that \"[w]here the government\n\nis acting as a proprietor, managing its internal operations, rather\n\nthan acting as lawmaker with the power to regulate or license, its\n\naction will not be subjected to the heightened review to which its\n\nactions as a lawmaker may be subject.\"           Lee, 505 U.S. at 678.          The\n\ndistrict court's finding that \"[t]he principal purpose of the MBTA\n\nusing some of this space for advertising is to earn revenue in\n\nsupport of the MBTA's goal of providing transportation,\" Change the\n\nClimate, 214 F. Supp. 2d at 132, would suggest that the MBTA is\n\nacting as a proprietor.       In Lee, however, it was \"the commercial\n\n\n                                    -87-\n\fand restricted nature of an airport concourse which suggested that\n\nthe government did not intend the concourse to be primarily a forum\n\nfor expression.\"      Christ's Bride, 148 F.3d at 250 (\"We do not read\n\nLee . . . to mean that every time the government runs a commercial\n\nenterprise it has, by definition, decided not to create an open\n\nforum.\").      While the primary purpose of the MBTA's advertising\n\nspace may be to generate revenue, it is clear that the MBTA's\n\npolicy   of    allowing   and,   in   fact,    encouraging   non-commercial\n\nadvertising (by offering a discount) demonstrates its judgment that\n\nsuch advertising does not conflict with its proprietary interests.\n\nAir Line Pilots, 45 F.3d at 1157 (finding no \"indication that\n\npermitting public interest groups to advertise would threaten the\n\nvitality of the City's commercial interests in deriving revenue\n\nfrom the advertising displays.\").            Having opened its advertising\n\nspace for non-commercial discourse, the MBTA now wishes to act as\n\na lawmaker, and not as a proprietor, in attempting to regulate the\n\ncontent of that discourse, which indicates that it has designated\n\nits advertising space a public forum.          New York Magazine, 136 F.3d\n\nat 129 (\"Where the government acted for the purpose of benefitting\n\nthe public, . . . the Court has found a public forum.\").\n\n              In some contexts, however, limiting advertising space has\n\nbeen found consistent with a proprietary purpose.            In Uptown Pawn\n\n& Jewelry, Inc. v. City of Hollywood, 337 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th\n\nCir. 2003), discussed by the majority, Maj. op. at 28, the Eleventh\n\n\n                                      -88-\n\fCircuit      concluded    that      the   City's       prohibition       on    pawn   shop\n\nadvertising on park benches \"evidences an intent, not to create a\n\npublic forum, but to act in a proprietary capacity to manage a\n\ncommercial venture.\"           Id. at 1281.        Here, however, there is no\n\nevidence      that    posting        Change      the     Climate's        or    Ridley's\n\nadvertisements would have any adverse effect on the MBTA's ability\n\nto generate revenue through its advertising space, regardless of\n\nwhether their messages are controversial. As previously described,\n\nthe   MBTA    has    posted    a    range   of    commercial       and    public-issue\n\nadvertising that would undermine any argument that advertisements\n\nlike those now proposed could be excluded in the interests of\n\nprotecting     the    revenue-generating         capacity     of    its       advertising\n\nspace. Here, then, \"the purpose of the forum does not suggest that\n\nit is closed, and the breadth of permitted speech points in the\n\nopposite direction.\"          Christ's Bride, 148 F.3d at 253.\n\n              Moreover,       the    Supreme      Court     has      considered        the\n\ngovernment's practice of excluding speech from a forum \"not because\n\nthe exclusion of categories of speech creates a non-public forum,\n\nbut because the nature of the excluded categories sheds light on\n\nwhether the government was acting as a proprietor or a regulator.\"\n\nNew York Magazine, 136 F.3d at 130; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 805\n\n(\"The decision of the [g]overnment to limit access to the [forum]\n\nis not dispositive in itself; instead, it is relevant for what it\n\nsuggests about the [g]overnment's intent in creating the forum.\").\n\n\n                                          -89-\n\fIn Lehman, the Court found that the 26-year, consistently enforced\n\nban   on    non-commercial     advertising    was     consistent     with    the\n\ngovernment's role as a proprietor, because \"[r]evenue earned from\n\nlong-term     commercial    advertising    could    be   jeopardized        by   a\n\nrequirement      that      short-term     candidacy      or     issue-oriented\n\nadvertisements be displayed.\"       418 U.S. at 304.          Other courts have\n\nfollowed Lehman to hold that a total ban on non-commercial speech\n\nmay be consistent with the government acting in a proprietary\n\ncapacity and have found transportation advertising spaces to be\n\nnon-public fora when the government \"consistently promulgates and\n\nenforces policies restricting advertising . . . to commercial\n\nadvertising.\"    Children of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix, 154 F.3d\n\n982, 978 (9th Cir. 1998); Lebron v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.\n\n(AMTRAK), 69 F.3d 650, 656 (2d Cir. 1995).             When the advertising\n\nspace has been opened to non-commercial speech, however, courts\n\nhave distinguished the advertising space in question from the total\n\nban on non-commercial speech present in Lehman.\n\n            Disallowing political speech, and allowing\n            commercial speech only, indicates that making\n            money is the main goal.    Allowing political\n            speech, conversely, evidences a general intent\n            to open a space for discourse, and a\n            deliberate acceptance of the possibility of\n            clashes of opinion and controversy that the\n            Court in Lehman recognized as inconsistent\n            with sound commercial practice.\n\nNew York Magazine, 136 F.3d at 130; Lebron v. Washington Metro.\n\nArea Transit Auth., 749 F.2d 893, 896 (D.C. Cir. 1984)(\"There is no\n\n\n                                    -90-\n\f. . . question that WMATA has converted its subway stations into\n\npublic fora by accepting . . . political advertising.\").               The MBTA\n\nhas    no    longstanding      policy     of    prohibiting       public-issue\n\nadvertisements like Change the Climate's or Ridley's.                    While\n\nexcluding political campaign speech from its advertising space, the\n\nMBTA   has   allowed   and    intentionally     encouraged    non-commercial\n\nadvertising, including public-issue advertising regarding social\n\nissues like drugs, crime, violence, abortion, AIDS, suicide, and\n\nreligion.\n\n             The provisions of the MBTA's Revised Interim Guidelines\n\nunder which it refused to post Change the Climate's advertisements\n\nalso indicate that it is acting as a regulator/lawmaker and not as\n\na   proprietor.     The      guidelines   prohibit    the    posting    of   any\n\nadvertisement that \"promotes or encourages, or appears to promote\n\nor encourage, the use or possession of unlawful or illegal goods or\n\nservices,\" or unlawful conduct.            The MBTA has not offered any\n\ncommercial     justification      for     its   interest     in    prohibiting\n\nadvertisements containing such material, and we see \"no commercial\n\nreason why [the MBTA] has any special interest in [preventing\n\nunlawful conduct]; [the MBTA's] interest is only the interest in\n\nupholding the law because it is the law.\"            New York Magazine, 136\n\nF.3d at 130.    This is certainly a regulatory and not a proprietary\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -91-\n\f          Other courts have similarly found the advertising spaces\n\nof various urban transportation systems to be a designated public\n\nforum   when   the   government   has    allowed   \"a    wide    variety   of\n\ncommercial,    public-service,    public-issue,    and     political   ads,\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood, 767 F.2d at 1232, \"political and other non-\n\ncommercial advertising generally,\" New York Magazine, 136 F.3d at\n\n130, or \"public-service, public-issue, and political advertisements\n\nin addition to traditional commercial advertisements.\"                 United\n\nFood, 163 F.3d at 346.     In these cases, contrary to the majority's\n\nassertions, the agency's control over public issue advertising was\n\nnot unlike that exercised by the MBTA in practice.\n\n          In    Christ's    Bride,      the   Southeastern      Pennsylvania\n\nTransportation Authority (SEPTA) was deemed a designated public\n\nforum because, while SEPTA asserted its right to refuse advertising\n\ndeemed \"objectionable for any reason,\" SEPTA had the \"practice of\n\npermitting virtually unlimited access to the forum.\"             148 F.3d at\n\n251-52.    The Third Circuit found that in practice \"SEPTA has\n\nexercised control over only three ads, two of which had graphics to\n\nwhich SEPTA objected, and one of which solicited personal injury\n\ncases that could be directed against SEPTA.\"            Id. at 252.\n\n          In United Food, the Southwest Regional Transit Authority\n\n(SORTA) had rejected an advertisement under a provision of its\n\nadvertising policy that prohibited \"[a]dvertising of controversial\n\npublic issues that may adversely affect SORTA's ability to attract\n\n\n                                  -92-\n\fand maintain ridership.\" 163 F.3d at 352.           The Sixth Circuit\n\nconcluded that \"the lack of definitive standards guiding the\n\napplication of SORTA's advertising policy permits SORTA, like\n\nSEPTA, to reject a proposed advertisement deemed objectionable for\n\nany reason.\"   163 F.3d at 354.      Under these circumstances, the\n\ntransportation authorities' contention that the advertising at\n\nissue was incompatible with the nature of the forum created by\n\ntheir advertising   spaces   could   not   be   sustained.   The   Sixth\n\nCircuit's reasoning is instructive:\n\n          We also find that SORTA's stated purpose for\n          limiting advertising on buses only tenuously\n          related, at best, to the greater forum's\n          intended use.   This is not a situation like\n          that in Cornelius, where the government\n          established a controlled solicitation process\n          to prevent disruption in the workplace, or\n          [AETC], where a public broadcasting system\n          logistically could not possibly accommodate\n          all political candidates, or even [Perry],\n          where a high school had a direct interest in\n          controlling access to its internal mail\n          system. Here there is no established causal\n          link between SORTA's goal of enhancing the\n          environment for its riders, enhancing SORTA's\n          standing in the community, and enabling SORTA\n          to attract and maintain its ridership, and its\n          broad-based     discretion      to    exclude\n          advertisements that are too controversial or\n          not   aesthetically   pleasing.       Although\n          political and public-issue speech is often\n          contentious, it does not follow that such\n          speech will necessarily frustrate SORTA's\n          commercial interests. Rather, it may be the\n          case that only in rare circumstances will the\n          controversial    nature    of   such    speech\n          sufficiently interfere with the provision of\n          Metro bus services so as to warrant excluding\n          a political or public-issue advertisement.\n\n\n                                -93-\n\fUnited Food, 163 F.3d at 354.\n\n             Admittedly, the MBTA has not opened its advertising space\n\nto   all    public-issue     advertising      except   that   which   it   deems\n\n\"objectionable for any reason,\" id., but has instead promulgated\n\nwritten advertising policies and exercised control over a handful\n\nof advertisements in the five years prior to the events at issue\n\nhere.      Still, the incoherent written policies and the occasional,\n\nsubjective exercise of control are insufficient to demonstrate an\n\nintent by the MBTA to close its advertising space as a public forum\n\nwhen it routinely posts public-issue advertisements on all manner\n\nof social issues.\n\n              Thus,   the   MBTA's   policy    and   practice   regarding    its\n\nadvertising space, and the nature of that space as created and\n\nmanaged by the MBTA, demonstrates an intent by the MBTA to create\n\na designated public forum.\n\n              Finally, I must note that, while not a sidewalk or city\n\npark, the MBTA's facilities are the modern analogue to these\n\ntraditional public fora. As mentioned above, 2.5 million people in\n\nthe Greater Boston area use the MBTA's facilities, and its 170 bus\n\nand trolley routes, 4 subway lines, and 13-branch commuter rail\n\nnetwork transit at some point of their routes through or across\n\ntraditional public fora.        In addition to the car cards at issue in\n\nthis case, the MBTA allows advertising on the outside of its\n\nvehicles, which are obviously displayed as they transit through the\n\n\n                                      -94-\n\fpublic streets.      Some of the cars on some of the subway lines that\n\ntravel above ground are even painted in such a way that the whole\n\nexterior of the car constitutes, in effect, an advertisement.                  The\n\nMBTA also allows advertising on the walls of the numerous bus and\n\ntrolley shelters that sit on the public sidewalks and can be seen\n\nfrom the public thoroughfare.         Thus, in addition to the traveling\n\npublic, the MBTA's advertising influence reaches into those on the\n\ntraditional public fora -- the streets and sidewalks of Greater\n\nBoston.   As stated above, this means that the MBTA is in a position\n\nto control 40,000 advertising spaces for the dissemination of\n\ninformation to a large segment of the region's population.                 It is\n\ndisquieting, to say the least, that the majority would allow the\n\ngovernment to control the content of the information to which the\n\npublic is exposed through these advertising spaces.                   The MBTA's\n\nadvertising   system    is   indeed    a     powerful   tool   with    which    to\n\ninfluence   public    opinion,   one    which    should   be   opened    to    the\n\ncrucible of competing viewpoints to the largest extent possible.\n\n                             III.     Conclusion\n\n            Although I concur with the majority's conclusion that the\n\nMBTA engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it rejected Change\n\nthe Climate's proposed advertisements, I dissent from its failure\n\nto   recognize   similar     discrimination      with   regard   to     Ridley's\n\nadvertisements.      I further dissent from the majority's decision to\n\nengage in forum analysis, and from the outcome thereof.\n\n\n                                      -95-\n\f      Appendix\n\nTo be posted shortly.\n\n\n\n\n        -96-\n\f",

MBTA,</i> No. 03-2285, the MBTA rejected three advertisements designed to raise questions about marijuana laws on the stated ground that the ads would promote illegal use of marijuana among children. The other case, <i>Ridley v. MBTA,</i> No. 03-1970, involves the rejection of one advertisement from a religious group on the grounds that the ad violated the MBTA's guidelines prohibiting advertisements which demean or disparage an individual or group of individuals. Several First Amendment doctrines are at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate brought suit in federal court on May 18, 2000. The lead argument is that the MBTA advertising space is a designated public forum and so the rejection of the advertisements is unconstitutional. Change the Climate strongly urges the court to decide the forum issue, arguing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining the nature of the \"forum\" at issue is a mandatory first step in deciding a First Amendment case such as the present one because \"[t]he extent to which the government can control access depends on the nature of the relevant forum.\" <i>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educ. Fund,</i> 473 U.S. 788, 800 [105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567] (1985). Both the protection provided for the plaintiff's First Amendment expression and the government's ability to restrict the plaintiff's speech vary according to the forum in which the speech is proposed. <i>Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n,</i> 460 U.S. 37, 44-46 [103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794] (1983). A reviewing court's first action, therefore, must be to conduct a \"deliberate analysis, <i>e.g., Chicago Acorn v. Metro. Pier &amp; Expo. Auth.,</i> 150 F.3d 695, 702 (7th Cir.1998)\" and determine \"the nature of the forum first.\" <i>New Eng. Reg'l Council of Carpenters v. Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d 9, 20 n. 4 (1st Cir.2002). In <i>Kinton,</i> this Court specifically rejected as \"awkward\" skipping this crucial forum analysis as a first step \"because it requires a reviewing tribunal to know the results of a test before knowing which test applies.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the MBTA has created a designated public forum, it argues, \"a content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest,\" and the MBTA has violated these standards. In addition, Change the Climate argues, no matter what the nature of the forum, the MBTA's rejection of its ads constitutes viewpoint discrimination. It also argues that the guidelines under which the ads were rejected must be narrow and objective and cannot leave excessive discretion in state officials, and the MBTA guidelines do not comply. Finally, Change the Climate argues the district court erred in not awarding it attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lischen Ridley filed suit in state court on January 8, 2002, on behalf of herself and other members of the Church with the Good News (\"Good News\"). The MBTA removed the <i>Ridley</i> action to federal court. The suit alleged that the MBTA lacked compelling reasons to reject the advertisement, that the rejection of the advertisement was the product of viewpoint discrimination, and that the MBTA's guideline involved was not narrowly tailored and was too vague to withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Ridley did not discuss the forum issue in her brief, the brief did note that the outcome of the forum issue in <i>Change the Climate</i> would govern the <i>Ridley</i> case. Ridley's reply brief also argued the public forum line of cases and expressly challenged the MBTA's assertion that the restrictions were reasonable, a standard of review which applies if the forum was not a public forum. And at oral argument, in response to multiple questions from the court as to the relationship of Ridley's claims to the forum analysis issue, counsel for Ridley argued that the forum analysis was relevant to Ridley's claims and could be dispositive of those claims. For example, Ridley argued that if the MBTA had created a public forum as argued in <i>Change the Climate,</i> she would be entitled to judgment on that ground. Further, counsel for both Ridley and Change the Climate moved to consolidate the appeals on the grounds that common issues of fact and law were present and the same lawyers represent both plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied all forms of relief to Ridley on June 5, 2003. The court assumed that the MBTA advertising program constituted a non-public forum and held that the rejections of Ridley's advertisements were not based on viewpoint discrimination, but rather on a valid \"content restriction prohibiting demeaning or disparaging content.\" The trial court held that the factual record based on the stipulation was insufficiently clear for it to grant the relief Ridley requested on whether the guidelines were viewpoint discriminatory on their face or whether they were too vague and gave MBTA administrators too much discretion. Nonetheless, the court revisited the <i>Ridley</i> guideline question when it issued its <i>Change the Climate</i> opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2003, the district court also found for the MBTA in <i>Change the Climate,</i> again avoiding the forum issue. However, consistent with the law on non-public fora, the court reviewed the MBTA's guidelines and its decision to reject these ads under a reasonableness test. The court found that each of the three advertisements provided misleading messages about the legality of marijuana, and that two of the ads targeted minors. As such, the court held, the MBTA's rejection of the ads was reasonable and not viewpoint discriminatory. The district court also found that the MBTA guideline prohibiting materials which promote illegal activity was not viewpoint discriminatory on its face. Nonetheless, in its <i>Change the Climate</i> opinion, the court also said that the <i>Ridley</i> guideline prohibiting demeaning or disparaging material was \"somewhat vague\" on its face and \"still leaves too much room for arbitrary decisions.\" As a result, in its judgment, the district court ordered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court retains jurisdiction to consider any well supported motion for modification of the MBTA's amended guidelines and for modification of this Final Judgment grounded on some change of law or change of relevant factual circumstances occurring after the date of this judgment. The motion must be accompanied by a precise showing of the change of law or change of relevant factual circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also rejected Change the Climate's motion for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this opinion covering both cases, we address the parties' arguments about what type of \"forum\" the MBTA advertising program constitutes. We hold first that the MBTA did not create a public forum. Second, we address whether the MBTA's pertinent guidelines and its decisions to reject both parties' advertising are unlawful as a form of viewpoint discrimination or as an unreasonable use of the forum. We hold that the guidelines on their face are viewpoint neutral and reasonable, and that the decision to reject the Ridley ad was neither viewpoint discriminatory nor unreasonable. However, we hold that the rejection of the three Change the Climate ads constituted viewpoint discrimination and was unreasonable. Finally, we consider the challenge that the guidelines at issue in both cases are vague and delegate too much discretion to the MBTA's employees. We hold that the pertinent guidelines are not facially unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no disputed facts in this case, only disputes as to what conclusions are to be drawn from those facts. Although only the present 2003 MBTA advertising policy is at issue, we recount the history of dealing between the parties, which is pertinent both to the public forum claim and to other claims. Some facts are reserved for discussion as to the particular party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Facts as to the MBTA</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA is a quasi-governmental organization whose purpose is to provide public transportation in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, &#167; 5. The MBTA provides transportation to 1.2 million customers daily and to 2.5 million people in the Greater Boston area. For many riders, the MBTA is the only transportation option available. The MBTA operates approximately 170 bus routes, four subway lines, a 13-branch commuter rail network, and six ferry service routes. The MBTA has partnered with the Boston School Department to provide transportation to up to 60,000 Boston public school students annually. The MBTA distributed approximately 15,000 to 20,000 passes to Boston students, the vast majority of whom were in high school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal purpose of the MBTA advertising program is to generate and maximize revenue. The MBTA has statutory directives both to \"maximize and increase total fare revenue and ridership,\" as well as to \"establish and implement policies that provide for the maximization of nontransportation revenues from all sources.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, &#167; 11. The advertising program effectuates this second purpose. The MBTA has about 40,000 advertising spaces, including interior \"car card\" displays in buses, trains, and trolleys, king size and tail-light exterior displays on buses, and station and platform displays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through a private advertising contractor, Viacom Outdoor of Braintree (\"Viacom\"), the MBTA attempts to sell all of its advertising space at the usual commercial rates. If all space is not sold at those rates, the MBTA policy is first that it may, without cost to itself, \"display advertisements or announcements calculated (i) to increase its revenue, public travel, or goodwill or (ii) as compensation to companies which provide beneficial services to the Authority or (iii) to be otherwise in the public interest.\" Only if there then remains advertising space unsold does the MBTA, as a third choice, sell advertisements at a reduced rate to nonprofit, tax-exempt public charities or governmental agencies to fill the remaining space. The MBTA charges a fee of 50% of the full commercial advertising rate to those nonprofit organizations. The advertisements at issue in both cases here fall into this last category. All advertisements, of whatever type, are subject to guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA recognizes that its two statutory directives, maximizing fare revenue and ridership and maximizing non-transportation revenue, can at times be at odds. In numerous instances over the years, the MBTA has received significant complaints from its customers about particular advertisements. The MBTA management was concerned such complaints would threaten ridership and fare revenue. Often those ads had been placed by the MBTA's advertising contractor without seeking prior MBTA approval. The MBTA then reviewed the advertisements; usually the contractor had violated the guidelines by accepting the advertisements. The MBTA has, accordingly, from the inception of its advertising program in 1992, adopted both substantive and procedural guidelines, described below, to limit the types of advertisements it would accept. Indeed, in attempting to increase ridership, the MBTA initiated a Courtesy Counts program and distributes a brochure that says: \"We're committed to courtesy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Facts as to Plaintiffs' Advertisements</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Change the Climate</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate, a not-for-profit group, conducts provocative advertising campaigns in order to generate debate about the laws criminalizing the use of marijuana. It has conducted such advertising campaigns in Washington, D.C., in part using advertising on the Metro transit system. It sought to do the same in Boston, starting in 1999, by submitting three advertisements designed to catch people's attention and make them rethink the wisdom of the drug laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first advertisement, (the \"Teen Ad\"), is a color photograph of a teenage girl with a baseball cap on backwards, with a caption saying: \"Smoking pot is not cool, but we're not stupid, ya know. Marijuana is <i>NOT</i> cocaine or heroin. Tell <i>us</i> the truth ...\" Change the Climate sought to place this advertisement on poster cards on the inside of buses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second advertisement, (the \"Mother Ad\"), contains a picture of an adult female who is writing on a white board, saying: \"I've got three great kids. I love them more than anything. I don't want them to smoke pot. But I know jail is a lot more dangerous than smoking pot.\" Change the Climate sought to place this advertisement in MBTA subway stations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third advertisement, (the \"Police Ad\"), is a color photograph of two policemen standing in front of an American flag, with text stating: \"Police are too important ... too valuable ... too good ... to waste on arresting people for marijuana when <i>real</i> criminals are on the loose.\" Change the Climate sought to run this ad on the exterior of buses, as it had done earlier in the Washington, D.C. transit system. All three advertisements also contain the web site address, www.changetheclimate.org.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's marketing director, Lucy Shorter, rejected the ads in January 2000. The reasons stated were that (1) the three ads promote the use of marijuana, and (2) the three ads were really \"reform\" ads as part of an effort to legalize marijuana and as such were in conflict with the MBTA's policies on drugs and alcohol. She attached to her rejection letter the MBTA's workplace rules on drug and alcohol use, the advertising guidelines, and the prohibition on advertising tobacco products. It appears the MBTA's \"policies\" on drugs to which she referred were internal MBTA workplace rules. There were no advertising guidelines dealing specifically with marijuana or other drugs. The MBTA continued to reject the ads for different stated reasons at later times, as discussed below. In sum, the MBTA's 2003 revised guidelines prohibit advertisements which promote the use of illegal goods or services or unlawful conduct. The MBTA has stated that each of the ads promoted illegal use of marijuana by juveniles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Ridley</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Good News has advertised in the past on the radio, in the Yellow Pages, in the newspaper, and via posted messages on vehicles, including a motor home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2001, Ridley submitted the first of what would be three advertisements to the MBTA's advertising representative, Viacom.

The advertisement was displayed at the Park Street and Downtown Crossing MBTA stations, two major stations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 26, 2001, Ridley asked the MBTA to change the content of the advertisement that was posted in the MBTA system for the last two weeks of her existing contract.

The district court denied the request on January 28, 2002, and Ridley filed an interlocutory appeal with this court. As recounted below, that appeal was mooted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA promulgated a new set of \"Interim Guidelines Regulating MBTA Advertising\" on April 12, 2002. One of the 2002 guidelines provided that the MBTA \"shall not display or maintain any advertisement\" that is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Demeaning or disparaging.</i> The advertisement contains material that demeans or disparages an individual or group of individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The revised 2002 guidelines also reflected the results of an MBTA internal debate over when the MBTA would look at the contents of a website listed in an advertisement. The MBTA had considered the listed website when initially rejecting Ridley's second advertisement. Under the 2002 guidelines, the contents of a referenced website would only be considered and judged under the guidelines when \"the message or sponsorship of the advertisement cannot reasonably be determined without reference\" to that website. The 2002 guidelines formalized a more comprehensive review procedure with four different layers of scrutiny (by Viacom, the MBTA Contract Administrator, the MBTA General Counsel, and the MBTA General Manager) before any advertisement could be rejected based on the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA told Ridley on April 25, 2002, that under these new guidelines, it would accept her second advertisement. Based on this change of stance, this court dismissed Ridley's appeal as moot on July 26, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By this time, Ridley no longer wanted to post her second advertisement. On June 13, 2002, she submitted a third advertisement to the MBTA, the one now at issue. The ad stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bible teaches that there is only one religion.

For purposes of determining whether an advertisement contains such material, the MBTA will determine whether a reasonably prudent person, knowledgeable of the MBTA's ridership and using prevailing community standards, would believe that the advertisement contains material that ridicules or mocks, is abusive or hostile to, or debases the dignity or stature of, an individual or group of individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA concluded that the third advertisement did not comply with the 2003 guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2003 guidelines explicitly articulated other prohibitions as well: the MBTA will not accept advertisements for tobacco products or ads containing a depiction of firearms or graphic violence, or ads that promote use of illegal goods or services or unlawful conduct. The guidelines also prohibit ads containing profanity, obscene or sexually prurient material or nude images (as those terms are defined in state law), false or misleading commercial speech, libelous speech, or copyright infringing speech. The guidelines further prohibit \"political campaign speech,\" defined as: \"speech that (1) refers to a specific ballot question, initiative, petition, or referendum, or (2) refers to any candidate for public office.\" Finally, the 2003 guidelines prohibit any advertisement that contains, implies, or declares an endorsement by the MBTA or the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We engage in de novo review of ultimate conclusions of law and mixed questions of law and fact in First Amendment cases. <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 567, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995); <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 501, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate argues that the MBTA has created a designated public forum and thus its decision to reject any advertising must meet strict scrutiny standards. Public forum analysis itself has been criticized as unhelpful in many contexts, and particularly this one where the government is operating a commercial enterprise earning income from permitting advertising. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Laurence H. Tribe, <i>American Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 12-24, at 992 (2d ed. 1988) (\"[W]hether or not a given place is deemed a `public forum' is ordinarily less significant than the nature of the speech restriction &#8212; despite the Court's rhetoric.\"); Frederick Schauer, <i>Principles, Institutions, and the First Amendment,</i> 112 Harv. L.Rev. 84, 97 (1998) (\"Of all of the paths down which the Court might go in dealing with the government enterprise cases, the so-called `forum doctrine' appears least satisfactory.\"). Change the Climate relies heavily on the public forum argument and requests that the issue be decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has discussed different types of fora: traditional public fora, designated public fora, and non-public fora. <i>See discussion in</i> Gerald Gunther, <i>Constitutional Law</i> 1292-94 (12th ed.1991); Tribe, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 12-24, at 986-97. Change the Climate argues that the standard of review for speech restrictions in a designated public forum is strict scrutiny. Ridley admits that a non-public forum (sometimes called a limited public forum) usually results in application of a lesser \"reasonableness\" standard. We accept arguendo<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> these premises that strict scrutiny applies to a public forum's exclusion of speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that while the MBTA's advertising program is not a traditional public forum, the MBTA effectively has created a designated public forum for the expression of ideas because it has accepted a range of advertisements on its vehicles and in its stations. The MBTA says it has not created a public forum at all. If it has, the MBTA insists that it is at most a limited public forum,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which is the equivalent of a non-public forum, and that its rejection of the advertisements is within the limits appropriate to a non-public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Forum Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government must have an <i>affirmative intent</i> to create a public forum in order for a designated public forum to arise. \"The government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439. To determine that intent, courts must consider both explicit expressions about intent and \"the policy and practice of the government to ascertain whether it intended to designate a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum.\" <i>Id.</i> We also \"examine[] the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern the government's intent.\" <i>Id.</i> As to the nature of the property, the MBTA does run advertisements and so there is nothing inherent in the property which precludes its use for <i>some</i> expressive activity. That nonetheless leaves the issue of whether particular expressive activity may be inconsistent with the nature of the property. The MBTA has determined that some types of expressive activity are not consistent with the commercial enterprise it runs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 2003 advertising guidelines, the MBTA states expressly that \"[t]he MBTA intends that its facilities constitute nonpublic forums that are subject to the viewpoint-neutral restrictions set forth below.\" Nonetheless, a statement of intent contradicted by consistent actual policy and practice would not be enough to support the MBTA's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate argues that we should give little weight to this express statement of intent: paying it heed would allow a government the opportunity impermissibly to censor merely by newly labeling the forum in question a non-public forum. The past history of characterization of a forum may well be relevant; but that does not mean a present characterization about a forum may be disregarded. The government is free to change the nature of any nontraditional forum as it wishes. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Thus, even if MBTA's previous intent was to maintain a designated public forum, it would be free to decide <i>in good faith</i> to close the forum at any time. There is no evidence that the 2003 changes were adopted as a mere pretext to reject plaintiff's advertisements. To the contrary, the MBTA acted in response to expressed constitutional concerns about its prior guidelines, and cannot be faulted for trying to adhere more closely to the constitutional line. And if the MBTA revised a guideline merely as a ruse for impermissible viewpoint discrimination, that would be found unconstitutional regardless of the type of forum created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' argument assumes that before January 2003, the MBTA had created a designated public forum. That is unlikely: the MBTA has consistently had both significant substantive content limitations and procedural limitations on the advertisements it would accept, and there is little evidence the MBTA affirmatively intended to create a public forum. Even so, the MBTA has not created a public forum in its advertising program under its 2003 guidelines, which are at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1992, the MBTA has had substantive guidelines prohibiting all tobacco ads, and all libelous, slanderous, or obscene ads. Procedurally, it required all advertisers to submit an application to the MBTA's advertising contractor, which had instructions to send any ads potentially in conflict with the guidelines to the MBTA for review, and the MBTA reserved the right to reject any ad it wished. In <i>AIDS Action Comm. of Massachusetts v. MBTA,</i> 42 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.1994), this court noted that these early guidelines left a lot to be desired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995 the MBTA further prohibited ads which were indecent to, or designed to frighten, child viewers. Then in 1999, the MBTA created new guidelines which, in addition, prohibited ads containing depictions of violent criminal conduct, firearms, profanity, ads harmful to children, and ads that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race, ethnic, or political affiliation. These prohibitions are not the indicia of an intent to create a public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 2003 guidelines intensify both the substantive and procedural limitations and protections used by the MBTA. The January 2003 guidelines better define the substantive limitations and further ban ads that promote or appear to promote the use of unlawful goods or services or the commission of unlawful conduct, as well as political campaign ads. Procedurally, the 2003 guidelines also create more stringent mechanisms for MBTA review of potentially prohibited ads. Given the litany of limitations on advertisements from the inception of its program, and the strengthening of those limitations in 2003, the MBTA has, at least by 2003, through its policy expressed an intent <i>not</i> to open its advertising space to all persons and organizations for public dissemination of their views on all topics without limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's practice of enforcing its policy further shows that it intended <i>not</i> to create such a forum. In the five years preceding these litigations, the MBTA rejected at least seventeen advertisements that were not in conformance with different aspects of its policy. Various advertisements were rejected for violating, among other grounds, the prohibitions on ads depicting violence, indecency, profanity, denigration of women, and for containing tobacco products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate points to one example of a seemingly contradictory enforcement of the policy with respect to ads containing tobacco in an attempt to argue that the MBTA has erratically enforced its written policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> One or more instances of erratic enforcement of a policy does not itself defeat the government's intent not to create a public forum. <i>See New England Reg'l Council of Carpenters v. Kinton,</i> 284 F.3d 9, 22 (1st Cir.2002) (no government intent to create a designated forum exists \"even if [government's] policy of restricted access is erratically enforced\"). By consistently limiting ads it saw as in violation of its policy, even if doing so imperfectly, the MBTA evidenced its intent not to create a designated public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the relevant Supreme Court case law compels the conclusion that the MBTA has not created a designated public forum. The only Supreme Court case directly on point, the plurality opinion in <i>Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights,</i> 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974), found that where a city banned all \"political\" (i.e., candidate and issues) advertising on its transit system, while accepting commercial as well as religious, civic, and public-service oriented advertisements, the city had not created a designated public forum. <i>Id.</i> at 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714. The opinion found that \"[i]n much the same way that a newspaper or periodical, or even a radio or television station, need not accept every proffer of advertising from the general public, a city transit system has discretion to develop and make reasonable choices concerning the type of advertising that may be displayed in its vehicles.\" <i>Id.</i> at 303, 94 S.Ct. 2714. <i>Lehman</i> is indistinguishable from the instant case. As in <i>Lehman,</i> the MBTA bans political candidate and some overtly political advertising. As here, the transit system in <i>Lehman</i> did not merely accept ads from commercial entities, but also accepted ads from \"churches, and civic and public-service oriented groups.\" <i>Id.</i> at 300, 94 S.Ct. 2714. In <i>Lehman,</i> the claimant, as here, was denied access to both exterior and interior advertising space. <i>Id.</i> at 320 n. 12, 94 S.Ct. 2714 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The transit system, as is true of the MBTA here, had written guidelines which were managed by a third party entity, and which involved some exercise of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 298-300, 94 S.Ct. 2714.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lehman's</i> rationale that a government instrumentality does not become a public forum simply because it is used for communication of ideas has since been reinforced by later Supreme Court cases. <i>See Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n,</i> 460 U.S. 37, 49 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983); <i>United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Ass'ns,</i> 453 U.S. 114, 129, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981). <i>Lehman</i> was cited favorably in <i>R.A.V. v.

Kokinda,</i> 497 U.S. 720, 725-26, 110 S.Ct. 3115, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990) (plurality opinion). Indeed, in <i>International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee,</i> 505 U.S. 672, 112 S.Ct. 2701, 120 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992), the court, citing <i>Lehman,</i> reiterated that a lower level of scrutiny usually applies when the government acts as proprietor. <i>Id.</i> at 678, 112 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only Supreme Court case to which plaintiff points is <i>Widmar v.

First, the purpose of the forum created in <i>Widmar</i> was to encourage expressive activities by student groups. <i>Id.</i> at 265, 102 S.Ct. 269. To implement this purpose, the campus facilities were made generally available to all student groups, without restriction, and so the groups received a form of subsidy from the government. <i>Id.</i> Unlike <i>Widmar,</i> the primary purpose of the MBTA advertising program is not to facilitate expression; rather it is to generate revenue. Further, the restrictions upon use of the MBTA advertising, including the requirement of an application, payment, and the MBTA's extensive policy of limitation, are far greater than in <i>Widmar.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Widmar,</i> we know of no analogous Supreme Court case applying the forum analysis which has found that the government had created a designated public forum. <i>See, e.g., Arkansas Educ. Television Com'n v. Forbes,</i> 523 U.S. 666, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875 (1998); <i>Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia,</i> 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), <i>Lamb's Chapel v. Ctr. Moriches Union Free Sch.

Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez,</i> 531 U.S. 533, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001). In each of these cases, the Court assessed the challenged government restrictions only under the reasonableness/viewpoint neutrality test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Court has recognized that deference to government intent in determining the nature of the forum may promote, rather than hinder, First Amendment principles: [W]e encourage the government to open its property to some expressive activity in cases where, if faced with an all-or-nothing choice, it might not open the property at all. That this distinction turns on governmental intent does not render it unprotective of speech. Rather, it reflects the reality that, with the exception of traditional public fora, the government retains the choice of whether to designate its property as a forum for specified classes of speakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Arkansas Educ.

Although the district court had concluded that the MBTA was a public forum, this court declined to reach the issue. <i>Id.</i> at 9. Instead we held that the MBTA had engaged in dissimilar treatment of advertisements containing sexual content and innuendo, by allowing a rather explicit movie advertisement while rejecting advertisements featuring condoms from an anti-AIDS group. <i>Id.</i> at 10-11. That amounted to the type of content discrimination that \"gave rise to an appearance of viewpoint discrimination\" which had not been adequately explained. <i>Id.</i> at 11. The decision in <i>AIDS Action</i> does not assist plaintiffs on the claim that the MBTA has created a public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Children of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix,</i> 154 F.3d 972 (9th Cir.1998), then-retired Associate Justice White similarly found that the Phoenix transit system did not create a designated public forum by accepting advertising on exterior panels on buses. <i>Id.</i> at 976. Like the MBTA, the system did not accept advertising from political candidates. The system primarily ran commercial advertising, but did run a small number of non-commercial public service advertisements, excluding political and religious advertising. <i>Id.</i> The case did not, though, address the further issue, which we do, of a transit system which accepts what is apparently more non-commercial advertising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, one circuit, relying on <i>Lehman,</i> has recently held that advertising space in bus benches was a non-public forum. <i>Uptown Pawn and Jewelry, Inc. v. City of Hollywood,</i> 337 F.3d 1275, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2003). Although the city had previously accepted ads from pawnbrokers, it adopted a new policy prohibiting those ads.

Nonetheless, we discuss briefly circuit opinions on which Change the Climate relies. Without suggesting we agree with the reasoning in each, each is distinguishable on its facts. In each of these cases, unlike here, the system accepted explicitly political advertising, an important (but not dispositive) factor in forum analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth.,</i> 148 F.3d 242 (3d Cir.1998), a transit system's advertising space was held to be a designated public forum where the system had an affirmative program to use its space to promote \"awareness of social issues\" and provide \"a catalyst for change.\" <i>Id.</i> at 249-52. Under that program, the advertising manager picked issues of public concern for free advertising. <i>Id.</i> at 249. Further, the plaintiff's advertisements had in fact been approved and had run, and were refused only after they had sparked controversy. <i>Id.</i> at 245-46. SEPTA had no guidelines<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> similar to those of the MBTA. SEPTA also had a practice of \"virtually permitting unlimited access,\" having requested modifications of advertisements only three times. <i>Id.</i> at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> in <i>Planned Parenthood Ass'n/Chicago Area v. Chicago Transit Auth.,</i> 767 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir.1985), the court found the CTA had created a public forum where it had accepted a wide range of public-issue advertising, claimed to have a policy of excluding controversial advertisements, but in fact had no such policy, had no written guidelines, had accepted controversial advertisements, and was found to have come up with such a policy solely to defend its decision to reject plaintiff's advertising. <i>Id.</i> at 1232-33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>New York Magazine v. Metro. Transp. Auth.,</i> 136 F.3d 123 (2d Cir.1998), the court held that the MTA had created a public forum in the advertising space outside of its buses when it accepted a magazine's advertisements using the Mayor's name under written guidelines which imposed no restriction on political speech, then removed the advertisements when the Mayor objected. <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate's additional arguments on the forum issue are equally unpersuasive. It argues that the MBTA made an \"affirmative\" decision to continue to allow non-commercial advertising, despite being advised that potential disputes could be avoided by simply eliminating non-commercial advertising altogether. This argument suffers from several flaws. As a matter of law, under <i>Lehman,</i> the dividing line between a public forum and a non-public forum is not the dividing line between commercial advertisements and paid advertisements from non-profit groups. And under <i>Arkansas Educ. Television Comm'n,</i> the MBTA is not to be put to an \"all-or-nothing choice.\" 523 U.S. at 680, 118 S.Ct. 1633.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, as a matter of fact, General Manager Robert Mulhern testified that he rejected a potential solution of removing all non-commercial advertising, because:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that there's a lot of people out there who rely on that information, that some times that &#8212; that's the only practical access to government they have from time to time. For people who live in the inner city that are made aware of important programs or important social services, [I believe] that we truly are performing a public service in another flavor rather than transportation service. We're letting them know about government services or social services or not-for-profit services that might have a direct impact on their quality of life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By refusing to limit the advertising program solely to commercial advertising, the MBTA was, thus, not evidencing an intent to open the forum to <i>all</i> public discourse. Nor was the MBTA adopting its own program to inform the public about issues, as in <i>Christ's Bride,</i> 148 F.3d 242. The MBTA's decision is not inconsistent with a desire not to create a public forum, nor is it inconsistent with the MBTA's role as a market actor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs argue that, because prior to this litigation the MBTA did not limit advertisements \"in a constitutionally permissible manner,\" the court should find that it created a designated public forum. This reasoning fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the forum analysis. The focus is on whether the government has intentionally decided to create a public forum. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439. If it has not, then erratic enforcement of a policy would not matter. Further, even if the government had limited ads \"in a constitutionally impermissible manner\" by engaging in viewpoint discrimination, that would not create a public forum where none was intended. The MBTA's policy clearly evidenced an intent to maintain control over the forum, and thus the MBTA did not create a designated public forum. As a result, the standard of review is not strict scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Viewpoint Discrimination and Unreasonableness Claims in Both Change the Climate and Ridley</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the MBTA advertising program is neither a traditional public forum nor a designated public forum, regulations are still unconstitutional under the First Amendment if the distinctions drawn are viewpoint based or if they are unreasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bedrock principle of viewpoint neutrality demands that the state not suppress speech where the real rationale for the restriction is disagreement with the underlying ideology or perspective that the speech expresses. <i>See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</i> 515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995); <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 386 F.3d 45, 62 (1st Cir.2004) (\"The essence of a viewpoint discrimination claim is that the government has preferred the message of one speaker over another.\"). A distinction is viewpoint based if it \"denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439. The essence of viewpoint discrimination is not that the government incidentally prevents certain viewpoints from being heard in the course of suppressing certain general topics of speech, rather, it is a governmental intent to intervene in a way that prefers one particular viewpoint in speech over other perspectives on the same topic. <i>See, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch.,</i> 533 U.S. 98, 107-09, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (school that has opened its resources after school for the teaching of moral values cannot exclude religious group that wishes to teach about those values from a religious perspective without engaging in viewpoint discrimination); <i>Rosenberger,</i> 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700; <i>Lamb's Chapel v.

He found the Teen Ad to be \"geared towards young people, telling them that marijuana is not cocaine or heroin, so it's the lesser of two evils, but it's okay to smoke it.\" Prince did not view the ad as sending a message that juveniles should be told the truth about drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prince thought that the Mother Ad was also harmful to juveniles, because the ad implies \"that it's okay to smoke marijuana, which is against the law.\" Prince said the words meant \"that `I don't want my children to smoke pot, but I know jail is... more dangerous, so therefore I'm going to overlook the fact that they are allowed to break the law.'\" Prince said that some people could have the legitimate viewpoint that jail is more harmful to a child than marijuana smoking, but that was not a viewpoint he would allow to be displayed on the MBTA because \"[i]t allows [children] to think it's okay to break the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Police Ad, Prince stated: \"It's telling them that the police are not going to take marijuana smoking very seriously, that there are real criminals on the loose, and it's okay to break the law.\" He further stated that the ad \"says that smoking marijuana will not be looked upon as a criminal act.\" When asked whether he agreed that the ad expressed a viewpoint about how police should be used, Prince replied: \"I know this ad tells young people that they should commit a criminal act.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael Mulhern, acting General Manager of the MBTA and the person with final authority to accept or reject advertisements, testified that he would reject all three ads under the current 2003 guidelines. The Teen Ad promoted marijuana use, he thought, by implying that cocaine and heroin were really harmful but marijuana use was not. He held these worries although the ad states explicitly that \"[s]moking pot is not cool.\" Further, he was concerned that the ad was targeted at juveniles, based on the picture of the teenage girl and the fact that the language is written in terms (\"cool,\" \"ya know\") that juveniles would generally use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulhern testified that the Mother Ad also promoted marijuana use, and while it was \"not as clear\" as the Teen Ad, the Mother Ad could also <i>in part</i> be targeted at children. He testified that by depicting a mother stating that she is less concerned about her children smoking pot, the ad sends the message to children that they \"can smoke [pot] and still be great kids.\" Mulhern testified that he would permit Change the Climate to post an ad advocating the opposite viewpoint, saying: \"I've got three great kids. I love them more than anything. I don't want them to smoke pot. But if my kids smoke pot, they should go to jail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulhern testified that the Police Ad was rejected because \"it suggests that smoking marijuana is not a real crime,\" and so promotes an illegal activity. He disagreed with the view that \"police resources should not be used for marijuana prosecutions.\" He said he would allow an ad to be posted if it expressed the opposite viewpoint, saying: \"Police are important, valuable, good. Police should be used for arresting people for marijuana crimes.\" Mulhern conceded that the ad did not target children specifically, but stated that he thought that children were more susceptible to receiving the message that marijuana is not a real crime than were other people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA also introduced testimony of Cornelia Kelley, the head of the Boston Latin School, a public exam school for grades seven through twelve, which uses the MBTA for transporting more than 2,100 of its 2,400 students. Kelley had the following concern about the Teen Ad: \"There is a message there that marijuana is okay; it's not as bad as cocaine or heroin. And the message, to my mind, that's a very confusing message for young people. There is a sense there that marijuana is acceptable.\" When asked, despite the fact that the ad says that \"Smoking pot is not cool,\" why it would lead students to think that smoking marijuana is okay, Kelley replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you look at that ad, that's a real mixed message to young people. And the students with whom I deal get a great deal of stimulation in different ways. And what you're looking at there is not a clear-cut message. And when children ... are that age, we try and see to it that they understand clearly what's legal and what's not legal. And that really says marijuana is not cocaine or heroin. It takes marijuana out of the realm of cocaine and heroin, where we consistently tell young people that marijuana is an illegal drug and you will be expelled for it or you will be arrested for it....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley conceded that a student would not be disciplined for expressing the view: \"Tell us the truth. Marijuana is not cocaine or heroin,\" but stated that she did not think the ad was appropriate to run on the MBTA because it sends a mixed message to students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley testified that she was particularly concerned about the Mother Ad because it appeared to depict a teacher at a chalkboard. She felt that by stating that jail is more dangerous than smoking pot, the ad does not give a clear message to young people that smoking pot is illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley also expressed concern that the Police Ad \"conveys that police countenance the use of marijuana.\" When asked how, she replied that it implies that one will not be arrested for marijuana which is \"another mixed message to young people.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Kelley conceded that her students could easily be exposed to similar ads while walking in the city. The difference was that she considered the MBTA to be an extension of the school house. But even so, she conceded that there had been discussion encouraged in classrooms at the school about the issue of legalizing marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate also introduced evidence of two different types of ads: other ads accepted by the MBTA which could be seen as promoting illegal activity among juveniles and ads which encourage compliance with drug laws. It argues this second set of ads expresses the view that the drug laws are sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate introduced several different ads for alcoholic beverages accepted by the MBTA in the past. One is an ad for Trinity Oaks Wine, which contains a picture of a woman in a backless dress being hugged by a man. It states: \"Trinity Oaks. It's not a soap opera. But it is provocative.\" At the bottom, the ad states: \"Remember the wine,\" and has a picture of a wine bottle. Prince testified that this ad was not harmful to juveniles because the ad was addressed to adults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another ad, for Doc Otis Hard Lemonade, depicts a woman's mouth eating an ice cube, and states \"DO IT ON THE ROCKS.\" In the corner there is a bottle of \"Doc Otis Hard Lemonade,\" an alcoholic lemonade beverage, being poured into a glass of ice, with the slogan: \"The perfect way to break the ice.\" When questioned as to whether ads such as this were harmful to juveniles, Mulhern conceded that alcohol use was illegal for juveniles, but found that alcohol ads did not fall under this guideline because the ads did not specifically target juveniles. Prince was also asked about this ad and testified that it was not harmful to juveniles because the ad was not addressed to young people, but to adults. When asked how he could tell this ad was \"geared towards somebody who's 22 and not somebody who's 20,\" Prince responded: \"Because alcohol for anybody under that age is illegal.\" Prince conceded that nothing in the ad protected young people from its influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley testified that she was also concerned about the advertisements for alcoholic beverages that her students see on the MBTA. The distinction she saw was that alcohol was legal at a certain age but use of marijuana was not legal at any age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate also introduced testimony that the MBTA has run numerous advertisements that discourage drug use. At trial, the MBTA stipulated to having run four such ads. One was headlined: \"TALK IS BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS THAN DRUGS... SO TALK!\" It has a cartoon picture of \"McGruff, the Crime Dog,\" as well as 8 pointers for talking to one's children about drugs, such as: \"Tell your kids you don't approve of the stuff\" and \"Tell them to say no ... and that you know they know the difference between right and wrong.\" The advertisement finishes by stating: \"Follow these steps and you'll be helpin' yourself, your kids and me ... take a bite out of crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second advertisement, sponsored by Drug Free America, contains a picture of two children at a playground, with the headline: \"Everyday after school, my kid likes to __________. If you can't fill in this blank, you need to start asking. It's a proven way to steer kids clear of drugs. It's not pestering. It's parenting. Ask: Who? What? When? Where? Questions. The Anti-Drug.\" A third advertisement, sponsored by Partnership for a Drug-Free New England and America, as well as the Office of National Drug Control Policy, states simply: \"Are You Waiting for Your Kids to Talk to You About Pot?\" And the fourth advertisement, sponsored by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, contains a pair of dice, one with a skull on one side, and states: \"Just because you survived drugs, doesn't mean your children will.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's position under the current guidelines is that it would still reject Change the Climate's three ads because each ad targets children and encourages the use of illegal drugs. The present guidelines do not prohibit ads \"harmful\" to children. The MBTA also takes the position that it would permit ads which expressed <i>to adults</i> the viewpoint that the marijuana laws should be rethought so long as the ads said that use of marijuana is illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it should be emphasized that the MBTA's guideline itself, which allows rejection of advertisements that promote illegal activity, particularly among children, is constitutional. It clearly serves a viewpoint-neutral purpose, and it is surely reasonable given the characteristics of the MBTA's advertising program. It is indisputable that the MBTA has a legitimate, viewpoint-neutral interest in not being used as a messenger to convey messages promoting illegal conduct among juveniles. It is also legitimate for the MBTA to consider that it has juveniles among its passengers. Further, as a vendor, the MBTA has a legitimate interest in not offending riders so that they stop their patronage. All of these are reasons why the guideline itself is constitutional against a viewpoint-discrimination attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we focus on instead are the specific decisions of the MBTA to reject the three Change the Climate advertisements. The MBTA's mere recitation of viewpoint-neutral rationales (or the presentation of a viewpoint-neutral guideline) for its decisions to reject the three advertisements does not immunize those decisions from scrutiny. The recitation of viewpoint-neutral grounds may be a mere pretext for an invidious motive. <i>See Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 811-13, 105 S.Ct. 3439. In practical terms, the government rarely flatly admits it is engaging in viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suspicion that viewpoint discrimination is afoot is at its zenith when the speech restricted is speech critical of the government, because there is a strong risk that the government will act to censor ideas that oppose its own. <i>See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 411-17, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (striking down criminal flag desecration statute); flag-burner's action expressed \"dissatisfaction with the policies of this country,\" expression which was \"situated at the core of our First Amendment values,\" and state had no power to \"prescribe what shall be orthodox\" (quoting <i>W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because Change the Climate's advertisements here reflect core political speech that is critical of existing governmental policy, we are especially wary of viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, as well, has been particularly leery of justifications for quashing speech to adults that rest on the purported protection of children. While the protection of children is a compelling state interest, <i>see Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium v. FCC,</i> 518 U.S. 727, 755, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996), the Court has carefully examined regulations purporting to rest on this ground, often finding that they sweep more broadly than their goal requires or that they do not serve their goal of child protection at all. <i>See Reno v. ACLU,</i> 521 U.S. 844, 875-79, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) (\"[T]he mere fact that a statutory regulation of speech was enacted for the important purpose of protecting children ... does not foreclose inquiry into its validity.\"); <i>Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium,</i> 518 U.S. at 755-60, 116 S.Ct. 2374; <i>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC,</i> 492 U.S. 115, 126-27, 130-31, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989); <i>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp.,</i> 463 U.S. 60, 73-75, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983); <i>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville,</i> 422 U.S. 205, 212-14, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost fifty years ago, Justice Frankfurter found unconstitutional a Michigan obscenity statute; he emphasized that the statute swept too broadly to carry out its asserted aim of protecting children from sexually explicit material. In <i>Butler v. Michigan,</i> 352 U.S. 380, 383, 77 S.Ct. 524, 1 L.Ed.2d 412 (1957), Justice Frankfurter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State insists that, by thus quarantining the general reading public against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general welfare. Surely, this is to burn the house to roast the pig.... The incidence of this enactment is to reduce the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 383, 77 S.Ct. 524.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context of these cases is admittedly not an exact fit. Our case does not involve a criminal prohibition, but only a refusal to accept advertising. The context in <i>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium</i> is closest: there the issue was the FCC's ability to control certain sexually explicit content on cable television. 518 U.S. at 734-36, 116 S.Ct. 2374. In both <i>Denver Area</i> and the other cases, the question was whether statutes or regulations had been drafted narrowly enough. Our focus is particular decisions to exclude advertisements, not the facial validity of the guideline. Finally, all of these cases involved the regulation of sexually explicit (but non-obscene) speech; sexual speech is not involved in this case. Still, these differences do not weaken the general principle that a purported justification for excluding speech to adults on the grounds of protecting children will be examined closely to see if the decisions reasonably do protect children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are various situations which will lead a court to conclude that, despite the seemingly neutral justifications offered by the government, nonetheless the decision to exclude speech is a form of impermissible discrimination. Three are relevant here. First, statements by government officials on the reasons for an action can indicate an improper motive. <i>See, e.g., Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp.,</i> 429 U.S. 252, 268, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). Second, where the government states that it rejects something because of a certain characteristic, but other things possessing the same characteristic are accepted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> this sort of underinclusiveness raises a suspicion that the stated neutral ground for action is meant to shield an impermissible motive. <i>See, e.g., Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 812, 105 S.Ct. 3439; <i>AIDS Action,</i> 42 F.3d at 10-12 (where MBTA claimed to be excluding condom-promotion advertisements because they were sexually explicit and patently offensive, but MBTA allowed other sorts of sexually explicit advertisements, such as movie advertisements, \"unrebutted appearance of viewpoint discrimination\" is found). Third, suspicion arises where the viewpoint-neutral ground is not actually served very well by the specific governmental action at issue; where, in other words, the fit between means and ends is loose or nonexistent. This situation comes up in a variety of legal settings. <i>See, e.g., Purkett v. Elem,</i> 514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (judges may sometimes find pretext in race-based equal protection challenge to peremptory strikes where prosecutor's justifications for challenges are \"implausible or fantastic\"); <i>Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 259, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (employer's misjudgments of the qualifications of job applicants may be relevant to whether the employer's neutral, merit-based reasons for hiring are pretexts for discrimination under Title VII). All three factors lead us to conclude that the reasons given by the MBTA in this case are insufficient to avoid a conclusion of viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inherent in the MBTA's position is its recognition that save for the risk of inducing juveniles to smoke marijuana, the refusal to run these advertisements for an adult audience would be viewpoint discrimination. That conclusion is essentially conceded in the MBTA's briefs. We find the purported justification of protecting children to be undermined for two basic reasons. First, there is direct evidence, through statements by MBTA officials, that the reason for rejecting the advertisements was actually distaste for Change the Climate's viewpoint. Second, there is evidence that the MBTA's rejection of these advertisements does not actually serve the alleged purpose of protecting children, and so the MBTA cannot offset the direct evidence against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's initial statement of reasons for rejecting the three ads was, in part, that the ads were part of Change the Climate's effort to \"reform marijuana [laws]\" in an \"effort to legalize.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This was a direct statement of viewpoint discrimination. It was reinforced by later evidence under the 2003 guidelines. The MBTA General Manager said he would publish the Mother and Police Ads if they came to the opposite conclusion &#8212; one with which he agreed &#8212; expressing viewpoints which reinforced compliance with, but did not question, existing laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supporting the direct evidence is our conclusion that the MBTA's rejection of these advertisements does not reasonably serve its purported justification. Dealing first with the Mother Ad and the Police Ad, it is clear that they are not targeted at children, nor can they reasonably be construed to promote illegal marijuana use among juveniles. The ads do not advocate illegal drug use. Rather, these two ads make a sophisticated argument that the criminalization of marijuana imposes worse consequences on society than would alternatives. The risk posed by the Mother Ad and Police Ad of inducing juveniles to engage in illegal marijuana activity is remarkably minimal and, indeed, probably nonexistent. The MBTA is certainly correct to evaluate individually each ad as to its compliance with the guidelines. Its judgments must be reasonable and it would not be reasonable to think that juveniles were exposed to no other information about drugs. Indeed, the MBTA has itself a long history of running ads stressing that drug use is illegal and that drug laws should be obeyed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA has sought to allay any suspicions of viewpoint discrimination by representing that it would run advertisements saying in bold text that the drug laws should be changed, provided the ads at the same time acknowledge that marijuana use is illegal. This, it says, removes any concern about viewpoint discrimination because it proves that the same message could be run if a different manner of expression were used. But that is not so. The MBTA's concession means simply that it will run advertisements which do not attract attention but will exercise its veto power over advertisements which are designed to be effective in delivering a message. Viewpoint discrimination concerns arise when the government intentionally tilts the playing field for speech; reducing the effectiveness of a message, as opposed to repressing it entirely, thus may be an alternative form of viewpoint discrimination. <i>See R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S. at 392, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (It is viewpoint discriminatory for the government to \"license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.\"); <i>see also Cohen v. California,</i> 403 U.S. 15, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971) (the emotive impact of a particular means of expression is often more important than the underlying cognitive impact of a message, and this emotive impact is also protected by the Constitution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suspicion of viewpoint discrimination is deepened by the fact that the MBTA has run a number of ads promoting alcohol that are clearly more appealing to juveniles than the ads here. It is true that there is a distinction: alcohol, like marijuana, cannot legally be sold to minors but can be sold to adults, and marijuana may not, in general, legally be used by either adults or minors. That cannot be the dividing line if the argument is that the MBTA is trying to avoid inducing illegal conduct: the MBTA has correctly not defended on the basis that the ads will induce illegal marijuana use by adults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult issue concerns the first advertisement &#8212; the Teen Ad. It certainly may reasonably be viewed as directed to attract the attention of teenagers. What is far more questionable is the reasonableness of the contention that the ad would induce teenagers to smoke marijuana. The ad itself says nothing of the sort. Indeed, it says the opposite &#8212; that \"smoking pot is not cool.\" The ad then implies that marijuana should not be seen as equivalent to heroin or cocaine. The clearest message is that marijuana usage should be decriminalized, while heroin and cocaine usage should remain criminal. The targeting of teenagers does not remove the ad from the realm of political speech. Many of those who are teenagers are either voters or will soon be voters, and the ad is also aimed at adults. The MBTA cannot put a thumb on the scale to preclude Change the Climate from effectively communicating a message about changing the laws to a likely responsive group of voters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's own evidence fails to support its argument. Headmaster Kelley's point was not that the Teen Ad would induce drug use, but the rather different point that the Ad presented a \"mixed message.\" The mixed nature of the message was about which drugs were legal and which were not; thus her concern was that the ad would promote confusion about whether marijuana use was illegal. The MBTA's conclusion, however, requires an additional step &#8212; that the ads would not only confuse teenagers about marijuana's illegal status, but that this confusion would then lead teenagers to smoke marijuana. Neither step in the reasoning is supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Teen Ad must be evaluated in context. The MBTA has run numerous ads that discourage drug use and encourage respect for and adherence to the current drug laws. Some of these ads are sponsored by government agencies, such as the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose goal is to further the current drug laws and aid in their enforcement. Juveniles are exposed frequently to anti-drug messages in a variety of settings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> including in schools. Indeed, schools may be the very place where students, in class, debate the wisdom of certain laws, as at Boston Latin. That this one at best ambiguous advertisement would lead teenagers to believe that marijuana is legal, against a barrage of contrary information, is unlikely. Yet the MBTA's argument requires even a further step. That one advertisement, which on its face says use of marijuana is \"not cool,\" would actually induce juveniles to smoke marijuana strikes us as thin to the point of implausibility. The MBTA's justifications for not running these advertisements are sufficiently implausible that on the totality of the evidence we conclude that the MBTA has engaged in viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the rejection of the three ads would fail to pass muster under the other prong of analysis laid out in <i>Cornelius,</i> which requires that any restriction be reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum, because their rejection is, in context, unreasonable. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439; <i>see also Perry Educ. Ass'n,</i> 460 U.S. at 49-54, 103 S.Ct. 948 (\"The touchstone for evaluating [] distinctions [in a non-public forum] is whether they are reasonable in light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.\"). The reasonableness standard is not a particularly high hurdle; there can be more than one reasonable decision, and an action need not be the most reasonable decision possible in order to be reasonable. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 808, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Still, the MBTA's judgment that these advertisements will foster illegal activity by minors is, in context, entirely unreasonable. <i>See Kokinda,</i> 497 U.S. at 734, 110 S.Ct. 3115; <i>Huminski v. Corsones,</i> 386 F.3d 116, 155 (2d Cir.2004) (finding particular restriction on speech in non-public forum unreasonable). The reasons stated above, which show the lack of fit between the rejection of these three advertisements and the protection of children, are sufficient for our conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the judgment of the district court as to all three advertisements proposed by Change the Climate, and direct entry of declaratory judgment that the rejection of these advertisements violated the First Amendment. At this point, there is no reason to think that injunctive relief is also required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Ridley: Viewpoint Discrimination and Unreasonableness</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike in <i>Change the Climate,</i> we conclude that the MBTA has not engaged in viewpoint discrimination in <i>Ridley,</i> either in the facial validity of its guidelines or the guidelines as applied to Ridley's advertisement. The guidelines prohibiting demeaning or disparaging ads are themselves viewpoint neutral. That is also true of the application of the guidelines to Ridley's ad on the facts here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the guideline itself, we note that the 2003 revision to the guidelines continued to prohibit demeaning or disparaging ads, but did so in more general terms, not tied only to certain categories such as race, religion, and gender. Most likely that revision was made in light of <i>R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S. at 392, 112 S.Ct. 2538, and later case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The current regulation simply prohibits the use of advertisements that \"demean[ ] or disparage [ ] an individual or group of individuals,\" without listing any particular protected groups. In this context, the guideline is just a ground rule: there is no viewpoint discrimination in the guideline because the state is not attempting to give one group an advantage over another in the marketplace of ideas. <i>See</i> Elena Kagan, \"Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography after R.A.V.,\" 60 U. Chi. L.Rev. 873, 889 (1993) (suggesting, based on the court's language, that the problem with the statute in <i>R.A.V.</i> could have been avoided by drafting a statute that did not single out any specific groups for protected status).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, under the MBTA's current guideline, all advertisers on all sides of all questions are allowed to positively promote their own perspective and even to criticize other positions so long as they do not use demeaning speech in their attacks. No advertiser can use demeaning speech: atheists cannot use disparaging language to describe the beliefs of Christians, nor can Christians use disparaging language to describe the beliefs of atheists. Both sides, however, can use positive language to describe their own organizations, beliefs, and values. Some kinds of content (demeaning and disparaging remarks) are being disfavored, but no viewpoint is being preferred over another. The \"reasonable person\" referenced in the MBTA's guidelines of course does not belong to any particular religious group, and would protect minority, as well as majority, religious beliefs from language that would \"demean or disparage\" them. The MBTA's current guideline neither intends nor has as a significant effect the tilting of the playing field for speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ridley argues that because the MBTA accepted the first two ads it must accept the third. We reject the argument that because a government commercial enterprise has opened up discussion on one particular \"topic\" (say, religion), it must allow any and all discussion on that topic. Reasonable ground rules, so long as they are not intended to give one side an advantage over another, can be set without falling prey to viewpoint discrimination. It is possible that the effect of these guidelines will fall more heavily on some messages than others in certain contexts, but this does not itself make the guidelines viewpoint discriminatory; the intent and chief impact of the non-demeaning requirement is merely to ensure a certain minimum level of discourse that is applicable to everyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA could reasonably conclude that the earlier two advertisements did not demean or disparage other religions, but that the third advertisement did. The first ad questioned the waywardness of today's Christians; the second issued a condemnation of other religions. By contrast, the third advertisement went a vitriolic further step and directly demeaned a number of religions, by calling them false. It told the adherents of those religions that their ways are ungodly, they are \"going to hell.\" In addition, those demeaned religions are likely to be the shared religions of a number of the MBTA riders. That the MBTA chose not to ban the earlier two ads (the first under threat of suit) does not mean it was required to accept the third ad. This is true even had the MBTA made a mistake under its guidelines in accepting the first two ads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ridley argues that even if the third advertisement is demeaning to other religions, the government still may not reject the ad because the subject matter is the protected one of religion. The government may not, Ridley argues, \"attempt to protect citizens from being exposed to religious views they might find offensive,\" citing <i>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson,</i> 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952), which invalidated a statute that set up a censorship board which refused licenses for \"sacrilegious\" films. The case is inapposite, as the MBTA is not censoring religious speech here at all. The statute in <i>Wilson</i> acted as a prior restraint preventing the showing of a film deemed sacrilegious by the censors in any public place in the state. <i>Id.</i> at 497, 503, 72 S.Ct. 777. The guidelines at issue here merely prevent advertisements from being put up in the MBTA's own system. Moreover, the statute in <i>Wilson</i> was aimed only at religious speech, and the language made it clear that its goal was to \"suppress real or imagined attacks on a particular religious doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 505, 72 S.Ct. 777. The goal of the MBTA's guidelines here has nothing to do with censoring religious beliefs; the purpose instead is to maintain a certain minimal level of decorum in all advertisements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second advertisement and the third advertisement share the same basic viewpoint, yet the MBTA approved the second advertisement even though it rejected the third. This is further evidence that the MBTA's actions here were not motivated by distaste for Ridley's particular viewpoint. She has presented no evidence that the MBTA ever allowed any other specific advertisement that would suggest viewpoint discrimination towards her. For example, there is no evidence in the record that other advertisements, religious or otherwise, were accepted despite containing demeaning or disparaging content.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two-week delay in approving Ridley's first advertisement is surely not a basis for inferring viewpoint discrimination. Nor is the saga connected with the placement of her second advertisement &#8212; this shows merely that the MBTA was honing its guidelines throughout this period and was working out its enforcement of various issues connected with the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the MBTA's guideline and decision to reject Ridley's advertisement are viewpoint neutral, the regulatory scheme still must be \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum\" in order to be upheld. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439. The regulatory scheme at issue here is eminently reasonable. The MBTA's stated purposes in running its advertising program include \"maximiz[ing] revenue\" by making money through advertisements while not reducing ridership through offensive advertisements, \"maintaining a safe and welcoming environment\" for its riders (including children), and avoiding its identification with the ads it displays. A guideline preventing demeaning or disparaging advertisements is likely to serve these purposes well and is consistent with the MBTA's own \"Courtesy Counts\" program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Facial Validity of Guidelines: Vagueness and Vesting of Discretion</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate argues that the guidelines must fail, in any event, because they are not sufficiently clear and objective. Change the Climate and Ridley also challenge the regulatory scheme on the ground that it is too vague and vests too much discretion in MBTA officials. In its <i>Ridley</i> opinion, the district court did not address the claim. In <i>Change the Climate,</i> however, the district court found that the guideline prohibiting demeaning or disparaging material was \"somewhat vague\" on its face and \"still leaves too much room for arbitrary decisions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the record is adequate to address this kind of facial challenge to the guidelines. Since, as well, the parties have thoroughly briefed this issue, there are no facts in dispute, and the issue raises important questions regarding the application of the First Amendment to the MBTA, we will address this challenge. <i>See, e.g., In re Keeper of Records,</i> 348 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir.2003) (appellate consideration of an issue raised but not ruled upon by the court below is proper where \"[t]he parties have briefed [an] issue, the facts pertaining to it are essentially uncontradicted, and an adjudication will expedite matters.\"); <i>AIDS Action Comm. of Massachusetts v. MBTA,</i> 42 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[S]o long as the record is adequately developed, we will not hesitate to resolve a mixed fact/law issue involving a core First Amendment concern even though the district court did not address it in the first instance.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vagueness inquiry, to the extent it applies here at all, incorporates two basic concerns: 1) concerns about fair notice, and about the related danger of chilling expression, and 2) concerns about excessive discretion being invested in administering and enforcing officials. <i>See Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). The mere fact that a regulation requires interpretation does not make it vague. <i>McConnell v.

Concerns about vagueness and about excessive discretion arise most strongly in other contexts. The void-for-vagueness argument classically arises where the government imposes criminal sanctions for conduct or speech. <i>See United States v. Lachman,</i> 387 F.3d 42, 56-59 (1st Cir.2004). And the concern over subjective decision making has most effect in government licensing schemes. Neither is the situation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is no serious concern about either notice or chilling effects, where there are no consequences for submitting a non-conforming advertisement and having it rejected. <i>See Nat'l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley,</i> 524 U.S. 569, 588-89, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998) (no serious concern that people will \"steer too far clear\" and be chilled in the context of a regulation that is not criminal or quasi-criminal and merely establishes criteria for grants); <i>Children of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix,</i> 154 F.3d 972, 983 (9th Cir.1998) (relaxing the vagueness standard in the context of a city transportation system's advertising policy because \"[t]his claim is unlike the usual vagueness challenge involving a fine or other sanction that has the potential to chill conduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the inquiry reduces to an investigation into whether the discretion given to MBTA administrators under the scheme is unconstitutionally excessive. The void-for-vagueness doctrine and the excessive delegation doctrine are technically \"analytically distinct,\" <i>Griffin v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs,</i> 288 F.3d 1309, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2002), but overlap on the facts here. Virtually all of the Supreme Court cases to determine excessive discretion challenges have dealt with traditional public fora. <i>See Griffin,</i> 288 F.3d at 1321-22. The danger of excessive discretion in this case is that it could lead to viewpoint-discriminatory decisions in practice even under a facially neutral regulation. We have already concluded there was no viewpoint discrimination in <i>Ridley,</i> and that the viewpoint discrimination in <i>Change the Climate</i> did not result from the face of those guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases that Change the Climate and Ridley cite all deal with licensing schemes regulating the exercise of speech in traditional public fora. The dissent similarly relies on cases and standards that are out of context because they deal with traditional public fora. <i>See, e.g., Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nationalist Movement,</i> 505 U.S. 123, 130-33, 112 S.Ct. 2395, 120 L.Ed.2d 101 (1992) (striking down permit scheme for demonstration on courthouse steps); <i>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, Ala.,</i> 394 U.S. 147, 150-51, 89 S.Ct. 935, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969) (striking down permit requirement for protest on city streets). In these situations, it is true, delegations of authority to grant licenses for speech may operate as prior restraints. As such, those delegations must meet the stringent standard of containing \"narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority.\" <i>Shuttlesworth,</i> 394 U.S. at 150-51, 89 S.Ct. 935. The settings for those cases are unarguably public fora open to everybody and to all types of speech; the very limited obstructions permitted by the licensing requirement are allowed primarily so that the state can maintain basic order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulatory scheme at issue here is not a licensing scheme, and the MBTA advertising program is neither a traditional nor a designated public forum. <i>See, e.g., Kokinda,</i> 497 U.S. at 725, 110 S.Ct. 3115 (government holds as proprietor, and not as licensor, when operating a non-public forum). Excessive discretion and vagueness inquiries under the First Amendment are not static inquiries, impervious to context. <i>See Reno v. ACLU,</i> 521 U.S. 844, 871-72, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) (the vagueness inquiry is most rigorous in a criminal context, where there is a high risk speech will be chilled); <i>Finley,</i> 524 U.S. at 581-83, 588-89, 118 S.Ct. 2168 (requirements that might be vague in other contexts, like a criminal statute, were not vague when used as criteria for a grant process that was subjective by nature); <i>Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982)(\"The degree of vagueness that the Constitution tolerates &#8212; as well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair enforcement &#8212; depends in part on the nature of the enactment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our view is that a grant of discretion to exercise judgment in a non-public forum must be upheld so long as it is \"reasonable in light of the characteristic nature and function\" of that forum. <i>Griffin,</i> 288 F.3d at 1323; <i>see also Finley,</i> 524 U.S. at 589-590, 118 S.Ct. 2168 (approving broad discretion to take into consideration \"general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public\" in NEA grant process, given the inherently subjective nature of these types of selection processes). \"[S]electivity\" and \"discretionary access\" are defining characteristics of non-public fora, which unlike public fora are not intended to be open to all speech. <i>See Griffin,</i> 288 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's regulatory guidelines, which in <i>Ridley</i> reject any advertisement that \"demeans or disparages an individual or group of individuals\" and which use \"prevailing community standards\" to determine whether advertisements fall afoul of this standard, are not unreasonably vague or overbroad, given the nature of the MBTA's advertising program and its chief purpose of raising revenue without losing ridership. Some kinds of advertisements that will be consistent with this purpose may be difficult to pinpoint with exact precision; some degree of interpretation, and some reliance on concepts like \"prevailing community standards,\" is inevitable. In <i>Griffin,</i> the court found that considerable discretion left in the hands of the Department of Veterans Affairs was acceptable to ensure the preservation of the commemorative functions of national cemeteries; the MBTA is also entitled to some discretion in determining which advertisements are likely to alienate ridership and cost it revenue. These decisions also \"may defy objective description and ... vary with individual circumstances.\" <i>Griffin,</i> 288 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, for purposes of the acceptance or rejection of advertising, words like \"demean\" or \"disparage\" have reasonably clear meanings. We recognize that several courts have struck down, on vagueness grounds, school speech codes that incorporated somewhat similar terms. <i>See Dambrot v. Central Mich. Univ.,</i> 55 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (6th Cir.1995); <i>UWM Post, Inc. v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Wis. Sys.,</i> 774 F.Supp. 1163, 1178-81 (E.D.Wis.1991); <i>Doe v. Univ. of Mich.,</i> 721 F.Supp. 852, 866-67 (E.D.Mich.1989). <i>But cf. UWM Post,</i> 774 F.Supp. at 1179-80 (In the context of a university hate speech regulation, the word \"demean\" is not \"unduly vague,\" since it has a \"reasonably clear\" meaning: \"to debase in dignity or stature.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> These decisions come out of a very different context: vagueness concerns are more pressing when there are sanctions (such as expulsion) attached to violations of a challenged regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we acknowledge that two courts considered public transportation advertising policies that gave their systems discretion to reject \"controversial\" advertisements to be unconstitutional. <i>See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 1099 v. Southwest Ohio Reg'l Transit Auth.,</i> 163 F.3d 341, 358-60 (6th Cir.1998); <i>Nat'l Abortion Fed'n v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth.,</i> 112 F.Supp.2d 1320, 1327-28 (N.D.Ga.2000). The cases are distinguishable. In both, a public forum was found. Further, a regulation asking whether something is \"controversial\" is a less precise inquiry, and has the potential to strike down many more advertisements, than a regulation asking whether advertisements \"demean[ ] or disparage[ ]\" someone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Attorney's Fees</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate appealed from the district court's denial of attorney's fees.

But \"fighting words\" that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender &#8212; aspersions upon a person's mother, for example &#8212; would seemingly be usable <i>ad libitum</i> in the placards of those arguing <i>in favor</i> of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but could not be used by those speakers' opponents. One could hold up a sign saying... that all \"anti-Catholic bigots\" are misbegotten; but not that all \"papists\" are, for that would insult and provoke violence \"on the basis of religion.\" St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 391-92, 112 S.Ct. 2538.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The ability to use certain linguistic tools in the course of argument, in other words, cannot in certain settings be statutorily monopolized by only one side of a debate, even if the other side had other, possibly less effective, ways to get its message out. Under the MBTA's first and second guidelines, as in the statute in <i>R.A.V.,</i> this sort of tilted playing field would potentially have been possible. The criminal statute at issue in <i>R.A.V.</i> and the regulation of advertising by the government as a commercial enterprise at issue are quite different contexts, and thus <i>R.A.V.</i> may have no applicability here.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Further, the type of problem identified in <i>R.A.V.</i> is not a problem for an advertiser in Good News's position. Good News is a religion; its rejected advertisement was fairly understood as an attempt to demean other religions. Any attempt to demean Good News or its stance on the falsity of other religions would doubtlessly be denigration \"on the basis of ... religion\" and thus would be prohibited even by the initial two sets of regulations. The <i>R.A.V.</i> problem only exists where the individual or group that is prevented from speaking is not itself an object of protection under the classifications given in a statute or regulation (for example, bigots were not a protected group under the statute in <i>R.A.V.</i>).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Ridley also cannot challenge these earlier regulations on their face, as part of an overbreadth challenge.

But the second set of guidelines also adopted a new policy determining that a website listed on an advertisement should not be considered unless the advertisement itself has an unclear message.

Unfortunately, I can neither join the opinion of my learned colleagues on the remainder of its analysis, nor join in the outcome of Case No. 03-1970 (\"<i>Ridley</i>\"). In my view, regardless of the nature of the forum involved, the MBTA's rejection of Ridley's third proposed advertisement was unreasonable and constitutes viewpoint discrimination, abuses made possible by the vague and subjective nature of the MBTA's \"demean[ing] or disparag[ing]\" standard. Consequently, it is unnecessary for this court to forge into the murky waters of forum analysis &#8212; an issue, it is worth noting, irrelevant to the outcome in <i>Change the Climate</i> and not even raised by the plaintiff in <i>Ridley.

City of St. Paul, Minn.,</i> 505 U.S. 377, 394, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992)). The MBTA's rejection of Ridley's proposed advertisement fails on all of these points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated in appellant's brief, the \"prevailing community standards\" language contained in the offending MBTA rule is the MBTA's attempt to breathe validity into its regulation by interjecting one prong of the three-prong test in <i>Miller v. California,</i> 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), for determining whether speech is obscene. One out of three prongs, however, is insufficient to cure the guideline's defect. \"Just because a definition including three limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of those limitations, standing by itself, is not vague.\" <i>Reno v. ACLU,</i> 521 U.S. 844, 873, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) (holding that the Communications Decency Act, which used a \"contemporary community standards\" test to regulate obscene speech on the Internet, offended the First Amendment because it was unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the very idea that the MBTA considers that there is such a thing as a \"prevailing community standard\" for demeaning or disparaging expression is itself ridiculous. How would such a rule be discerned? What evidence is there in the record that the third advertisement violated this standard, other than the MBTA's subjective and conclusory assertion that it did? To the contrary, a religious message such as the advertisement in question does not disparage its targets, but rather alerts them to a (perceived) fact concerning their eternal salvation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> This is not a case of a hate group defaming the followers of Judaism, Catholicism, or another religion as having some intrinsic individual flaw. Rather, Ridley's advertisement attempts to convert these people to her religion. Telling people they are risking going to hell is, like it or not, a key component of explaining why religious choices are so important, and reasonable minds could most certainly disagree with the conclusion that such a statement in any way demeans or disparages the very people it aims to save. That such a statement was considered \"hostile,\" \"mock [ing],\" or \"demean[ing]\" highlights the ambiguity and unreasonableness of the MBTA's guideline. The \"prevailing community standard\" formulation does not rescue the MBTA's guideline from vagueness; rather, it permits MBTA authorities &#8212; even if they have the best of intentions &#8212; to make subjective, ad hoc determinations about speech that appears controversial because it endorses a minority viewpoint. <i>Cf. Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents,</i> 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) (stating that the First Amendment protects against an oppressive \"pall of orthodoxy\" in schools). The guideline, therefore, is void for vagueness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA has permitted religious advertising in its facilities, but discriminates among religious messages on the basis of their content. The majority claims that this content discrimination does not amount to viewpoint discrimination because all religions \"are allowed to positively promote their own perspective and even to criticize other positions so long as they do not use demeaning speech in their attacks.\" Maj. op. at 91. This conclusion assumes that a statement like \"all good Catholics go to heaven\" is sufficiently rebutted by replying \"all good Buddhists go to heaven.\" From this dialogue, we could draw the heartwarming conclusion that \"all good Catholics and Buddhists\" go to heaven. Good or bad, however, this is simply not the type of message that most religions espouse. Especially for small groups like Ridley's, an essential part of proselytizing is explaining that in their view and the view of their prophet, \"all good Catholics, Buddhists, etc. are not going to heaven; rather, they are going to hell.\" This belief is central to their message of conversion. It is the clearest statement of the (eternal) consequences for those who do not convert, and it is undoubtedly a fact that they are hoping will propel the message's viewers to go to their website and learn more about their beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, while the majority concludes that an advertisement may criticize other religions as long as it does so in a non-demeaning way, it is apparent from the rejection of Ridley's third advertisement that even a text-based criticism about religion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> will be more likely to strike MBTA authorities as \"hostile,\" \"mocking,\" or \"demeaning,\" simply because it names that religion. Indeed, the third advertisement did not say anything that was not implicit in the second advertisement, which declared that there were over 1,000 (unnamed) false religions. If the guidelines permit the second advertisement, they cannot reasonably be applied to forbid the third.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> Thus, the MBTA's position is intrinsically viewpoint oriented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The religious nature of Ridley's advertisement increases the MBTA's burden, for religious advertising is a \"form of religious activity [that] occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.\" <i>Murdock v. Pennsylvania,</i> 319 U.S. 105, 109, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943); <i>see also Jews for Jesus, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 984 F.2d 1319, 1324 (1st Cir.1993) (prohibiting ban on religious leafletting at MBTA stations). \"The principle that government may not enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice [merely because it is unorthodox] is so well understood that few violations are recorded in our opinions.\" <i>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of</i> <i>Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 523, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (striking down attempted suppression of religious rites that included animal sacrifices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, the First Amendment does not recognize state authority to regulate religious expression merely because it might offend other persons. \"It is firmly settled that ... the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\" <i>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell,</i> 485 U.S. 46, 56, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988) (quoting <i>Street v. New York,</i> 394 U.S. 576, 592, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969)). Religious speech &#8212; especially that of a proselytizing nature most often found in mass advertising by religious organizations &#8212; is intended to strike at the core of people's strongest beliefs; in that sense, it is inevitably \"hostile\" to those beliefs. Placing the government in a position of deciding whether to allow the expression of those beliefs depending on whether they are \"hostile\" or \"demeaning\" to the community strikes at the heart of the First Amendment's prohibitions against state regulation of speech. <i>Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 414, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989) (\"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\"). Any religious speech will be viewed as \"hostile\" by at least some, if not all, of those who do not share the belief it proclaims. <i>See Gitlow v. New York,</i> 268 U.S. 652, 673, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (Holmes, J., dissenting) (\"Every idea is an incitement.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Religious belief is quintessentially a matter of viewpoint. The government cannot allow dissemination of one viewpoint that it finds inoffensive or bland, and prohibit the dissemination of another viewpoint that it finds offensive or \"demeaning,\" because the \"point of all speech protection ... is to shield just those choices of content that in someone's eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\" <i>Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 574, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995). Such distinctions are viewpoint based, not merely reasonable content restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its very nature, a prohibition against ads that are \"hostile\" to an individual or a group of individuals is viewpoint based. The guideline would permit ads from Catholics, Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and others stating their beliefs &#8212; their \"viewpoints\" &#8212; that their religions <i>were</i>\"set up\" by God.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> The MBTA, however, refuses to permit Ridley to state the <i>opposite</i> viewpoint: her belief that these religions <i>were not</i>\"set up\" by God, but are \"false,\" and that only her belief is correct. This is unquestionably viewpoint discrimination, as \"[t]he essence of viewpoint-based discrimination is the state's decision to pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.\" <i>Berner v. Delahanty,</i> 129 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's justification for censoring Ridley's religious expressions in the third advertisement is the suggestion that some riders might take offense to its content. This is not a sufficient reason to stifle speech protected by the First Amendment. <i>See Planned Parenthood Ass'n/Chicago Area v. Chicago Transit Auth.,</i> 767 F.2d 1225, 1230 (7th Cir.1985) (\"We question whether a regulation of speech that has as its touchstone a government official's subjective view that the speech is `controversial' could ever pass constitutional muster.\"); <i>see also Penthouse Int'l, Ltd. v. Koch,</i> 599 F.Supp. 1338, 1349-50 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (poster cannot be prohibited in subway stations because its content is offensive to some). What the MBTA fails to understand is that \"[z]ealots have First Amendment rights too.\" <i>Pinette v. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.,</i> 30 F.3d 675, 680 (6th Cir.1994), <i>aff'd on other grounds,</i> 515 U.S. 753, 760, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 132 L.Ed.2d 650 (1995). I invite the majority to take note of that principle and conclude, as I do, that the MBTA engaged in viewpoint discrimination in refusing Ridley's third submission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Forum analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I find it unnecessary and ill-advised to engage in forum analysis in these cases, it is appropriate that I comment on the majority's conclusions that the MBTA has not created a designated public forum by opening its facilities to advertisers expressing a broad range of commercial and non-commercial views. Like the Second and Third Circuits, I find that this kind of advertising program on public transportation facilities converts them into a designated public forum. <i>See N.Y. Magazine v. Metro. Transp. Auth.,</i> 136 F.3d 123, 129-30 (2d Cir.1998) (concluding that advertising space on outside of city buses was a designated public forum); <i>Christ's Bride Ministries, Inc. v. S.E. Pa.

Even if the government was not obligated to open the designated public forum or to retain its open character indefinitely, as long as the forum is generally open \"it is bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional public forum.\" <i>Perry,</i> 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. 948.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed by the majority, the key inquiry is whether the MBTA intended to designate its advertising space as a public forum, a question we must answer by considering (1) the MBTA's policy and practice regarding its advertising space, and (2) the nature of the MBTA's advertising space and its compatibility with expressive activity. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The MBTA's Policy and Practice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the government's policy and practice to create a designated public forum, \"the government must intend to make the property `generally available' to a class of speakers.\" <i>Ark.

Vincent,</i> 454 U.S. 263, 264, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981)). Change the Climate asserts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> that the MBTA's policy and practice have made its advertising space generally available to commercial and non-profit organizations for the expression of views by anyone willing to pay its advertising fees. The MBTA does not dispute that any commercial or non-commercial advertiser may submit advertisements under its policy, and that it has intentionally facilitated access for all non-profit organizations by offering them a half-price discount on the fees charged to commercial advertisers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter, it is appropriate to state that the fact that the MBTA has chosen to include in its guidelines an assertion to the effect that it \"intends that its facilities constitute nonpublic forums\" should not be determinative of that issue. Otherwise, such a self-serving approach would allow the government to simply declare property a non-public forum whenever conflicts of this sort arose. <i>See Int'l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness v. Lee,</i> 505 U.S. 672, 695 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Similarly, the fact that a particular category of speech, such as that regarding tobacco sales, is excluded from a forum does not preclude the designation of a public forum. <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 129-30 (\"[I]t cannot be true that if the government excludes any category of speech from a forum ... that forum becomes ipso facto a non-public forum.\"). Nor does the fact that the MBTA charges a fee for the use of its advertising space preclude the creation of a designated public forum, because \"[d]espite the existence of a fee, the [government] may nevertheless have allowed indiscriminate use\" of the forum by \"anyone willing to pay.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v. Dep't of Aviation of the City of Chicago,</i> 45 F.3d 1144, 1155 (7th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, I believe it is worthwhile to consider the situation today within the context of the MBTA's advertising policies in the years leading up to the events at issue in this litigation. I begin by noting that in 1994, in <i>AIDS Action,</i> we found that the advertising policy promulgated by the MBTA was \"scarcely coherent, [and] invite[d] the very discrimination that occurred in [that] case, and was properly enjoined.\" 42 F.3d at 12. In the period between <i>AIDS Action</i> and the present litigation, from 1995 to at least 1999, the MBTA required that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ll advertisements at any time inserted or placed by the Contractor in or upon any locations or display devices shall be of a reputable character, and the appearance of all advertisements shall be acceptable to and in accordance with the [MBTA's] Standards for Character and Appearance of Advertisements. No libelous, slanderous, or obscene advertisements, may be accepted by the Contractor for display in or upon the Authority's transit facilities. Advertisements shall be submitted in advance to the Authority for review at the Authority's request or whenever the Contractor reasonably believes such advertisements may be objectionable within the meaning of this Article.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This policy was supplemented by an April 21, 1995 letter from the MBTA Interim General Manager, Robert Mabardy, which contained additional guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA will refuse any advertisement that is indecent to child viewers, or is of a nature to frighten children, either emotionally or physically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These guidelines shall not be deemed to prohibit indecent or frightening language that could be considered double entendre, provided that, if a child asked an adult the meaning of such indecent or frightful language, the adult could give a reasonable and truthful answer without reference to indecent or frightening activities or language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, the MBTA formulated new bid specifications for transit advertising, which contained a new version of the advertising policy. The 1999 bid specifications prohibited the display of advertisements for tobacco products and echoed the 1992 bid specifications, with the following provisions added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA will not accept advertisements containing violent criminal content, firearms, profane content, promotional materials that is harmful to juveniles, and advertisements that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race, ethnic or political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the MBTA went through two more revisions of its guidelines, as described in the majority opinion. A new set of \"Interim Guidelines Regulating MBTA Advertising,\" promulgated on April 12, 2002, provided that the MBTA \"shall not display or maintain any advertisement\" that is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Demeaning or disparaging.</i> The advertisement contains material that demeans or disparages an individual or group of individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2003, the MBTA issued yet another revision of its guidelines, removing the language concerning race, color, etc., and adding the \"prevailing community standards\" metric for determining whether material is demeaning or disparaging.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, \"the more restrictive the criteria for admission and the more administrative control over access, the less likely a forum will be deemed public.\" <i>Hopper v. City of Pasco,</i> 241 F.3d 1067, 1078 (9th Cir.2001). Over the years, the MBTA's criteria for admission have been confusing at best, and it has always left the initial determinations of whether advertisements may run afoul of the advertising policy to the subjective evaluation of a private contractor. Those advertisements sent to the MBTA for review have received a similarly subjective evaluation from MBTA employees. Thus, the subjective standards in these policies create a potential for abuse, specifically the potential for viewpoint discrimination. <i>See Hopper,</i> 241 F.3d at 1079 (\"The potential for abuse of such unbounded discretion is heightened by the inherently subjective nature of the standard itself.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I emphasize that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he government may not `create' a policy to implement its newly-discovered desire to suppress a particular message. Neither may the government invoke an otherwise unenforced policy to justify that suppression. Therefore, the government's stated policy, without more, is not dispositive with respect to the government's intent in a given forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Air Line Pilots,</i> 45 F.3d at 1153 (citations omitted). In determining whether the MBTA has designated its advertising space as a public forum, then, one cannot rely on recent attempts by the MBTA to revise its advertising policy during the course of this litigation to indicate its prior intent on the nature of its advertising space as a forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the MBTA's written policies cannot be considered without reference to their application in the years preceding this action. In determining whether the government has designated property to be a public forum, we have previously stated that \"actual practice speaks louder than words.\" <i>Grace Bible Fellowship, Inc. v. Maine Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 5,</i> 941 F.2d 45, 47 (1st Cir.1991). \"[C]onsistency in application is the hallmark of any policy designed to preserve the non-public status of a forum. A policy purporting to keep a forum closed (or open to expression only on certain subjects) is no policy at all for purposes of public forum analysis if, in practice, it is not enforced or if exceptions are haphazardly permitted.\" <i>Hopper,</i> 241 F.3d at 1076. In <i>AIDS Action,</i> we admonished the MBTA that if it were to be allowed to restrict speech, \"it will, at the least, need to act according to neutral standards, and it will need to apply these standards in such a way that there is no appearance that `the [government] is seeking to handicap the expression of particular ideas.' \"42 F.3d at 13 (quoting <i>R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S. at 394, 112 S.Ct. 2538). In practice, the MBTA has not restricted access to its advertising space in a manner sufficient to indicate an intent to maintain it as a non-public or limited public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we decided <i>AIDS Action,</i> we found that \"despite the MBTA's attempts to present itself as a vigilant gatekeeper, the only ads other than the 1993 [AIDS awareness] ads that we know the MBTA recently rejected are certain Calvin Klein ads which somehow might have been misconstrued as endorsing the Ku Klux Klan, and an animal rights advertisement featuring a photograph of a maimed dog.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9. In reviewing the MBTA's application of its advertising policies since <i>AIDS Action,</i> I find that little has changed. During the five years preceding Change the Climate's first interactions with PTD, between 1995 and 1999, the MBTA refused to post only fifteen advertisements. Examples include an advertisement for the movie Psycho, which featured an image of a nude woman in a shower with blood at the bottom, rejected because it was \"in conflict with the MBTA's dignity in the workplace and the Commonwealth's domestic violence programs,\" neither of which criteria are set forth in the MBTA's advertising policy. Rejection of ads also appears to have occurred on an <i>ad hoc,</i> subjective basis. For example, MBTA refused to post an advertisement from the conservation organization Surfriders, aimed at discouraging people from leaving cigarette butts on the beach, apparently because it included images of people smoking. The MBTA posted, however, advertisements for Al Italia airline that featured a woman holding a cigarette with the caption, \"Create a buzz.\" Thus, the <i>ad hoc</i> rejection of a handful of ads over the past decade cannot serve as the basis for concluding that MBTA intended its advertising space as a non-public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Nature of the Forum and Its Compatibility with Expression</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also necessary to examine \"the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern the government's intent.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439 (citations omitted). This inquiry involves examining \"the relationship between the reasons for any restriction on access and the forum's purpose.\" <i>United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 1099 v. Southwest Ohio Reg'l Transit Auth.,</i> 163 F.3d 341, 351 (6th Cir.1998). The district court in <i>Change the Climate</i> found that \"[t]he principal purpose of the MBTA using some of this space for advertising is to earn revenue in support of the MBTA's goal of providing transportation.\" 214 F.Supp.2d 125, 132 (D.Mass.2002). In general, \"the courts will infer an intent on the part of the government to create a public forum where the government's justification for the exclusion of certain expressive conduct is unrelated to the forum's purpose, even when speakers must obtain permission to use the forum.\" <i>United Food,</i> 163 F.3d at 351. Forum analysis must therefore \"involve a careful scrutiny of whether the government-imposed restriction on access to public property is truly part of `the process of limiting a nonpublic forum to activities compatible with the intended purpose of the property.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 351-52 (quoting <i>Perry,</i> 460 U.S. at 49, 103 S.Ct. 948). Courts will hold \"that the government did not create a public forum only when its standards for inclusion and exclusion are clear and are designed to prevent interference with the forum's designated purpose.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has indicated that \"[i]n cases where the principal function of the property would be disrupted by expressive activity, the Court [has been] particularly reluctant to hold that the government intended to designate a public forum.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 804, 105 S.Ct. 3439. The MBTA can hardly argue that its advertising space is generally incompatible with expressive activity, or that the MBTA's principal function of providing transportation would be disrupted by the expressive activity proposed by Change the Climate or Ridley, since it has routinely made its advertising space available to both commercial and public-issue advertising on a wide range of issues without any disruption. <i>See, e.g., Planned Parenthood,</i> 767 F.2d at 1232 (\"[S]ince CTA already permits its facilities to be used for public-issue and political advertising, it cannot argue that such use is incompatible with the primary use of the facilities.\"). It is clear that the MBTA \"created a forum that is suitable for the speech in question....\" <i>Christ's Bride,</i> 148 F.3d at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority wrongly emphasizes the MBTA's proprietary role with regard to its advertising space. In an early case addressing advertising on public transit systems, the Supreme Court held that because \"the city is engaged in commerce,\" and \"[t]he car card space, although incidental to the provision of public transportation, is a part of the commercial venture,\" \"a city transit system has discretion to develop and make reasonable choices concerning the type of advertising that may be displayed in its vehicles.\" <i>Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights,</i> 418 U.S. 298, 303, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974). Since <i>Lehman,</i> public forum analysis has developed considerably but has continued to find that \"[w]here the government is acting as a proprietor, managing its internal operations, rather than acting as lawmaker with the power to regulate or license, its action will not be subjected to the heightened review to which its actions as a lawmaker may be subject.\" <i>Lee,</i> 505 U.S. at 678, 112 S.Ct. 2701. The district court's finding that \"[t]he principal purpose of the MBTA using some of this space for advertising is to earn revenue in support of the MBTA's goal of providing transportation,\" <i>Change the Climate,</i> 214 F.Supp.2d at 132, would suggest that the MBTA is acting as a proprietor. In <i>Lee,</i> however, it was \"the commercial and restricted nature of an airport concourse which suggested that the government did not intend the concourse to be primarily a forum for expression.\" <i>Christ's Bride,</i> 148 F.3d at 250 (\"We do not read <i>Lee</i> ... to mean that every time the government runs a commercial enterprise it has, by definition, decided not to create an open forum.\"). While the primary purpose of the MBTA's advertising space may be to generate revenue, it is clear that the MBTA's policy of allowing and, in fact, encouraging non-commercial advertising (by offering a discount) demonstrates its judgment that such advertising does not conflict with its proprietary interests. <i>Air Line Pilots,</i> 45 F.3d at 1157 (finding no \"indication that permitting public interest groups to advertise would threaten the vitality of the City's commercial interests in deriving revenue from the advertising displays.\"). Having opened its advertising space for non-commercial discourse, the MBTA now wishes to act as a lawmaker, and not as a proprietor, in attempting to regulate the content of that discourse, which indicates that it has designated its advertising space a public forum. <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 129 (\"Where the government acted for the purpose of benefitting the public, ... the Court has found a public forum.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some contexts, however, limiting advertising space has been found consistent with a proprietary purpose. In <i>Uptown Pawn &amp; Jewelry, Inc. v. City of Hollywood,</i> 337 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir.2003), discussed by the majority, Maj. op. at 80, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the City's prohibition on pawn shop advertising on park benches \"evidences an intent, not to create a public forum, but to act in a proprietary capacity to manage a commercial venture.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1281. Here, however, there is no evidence that posting Change the Climate's or Ridley's advertisements would have any adverse effect on the MBTA's ability to generate revenue through its advertising space, regardless of whether their messages are controversial. As previously described, the MBTA has posted a range of commercial and public-issue advertising that would undermine any argument that advertisements like those now proposed could be excluded in the interests of protecting the revenue-generating capacity of its advertising space. Here, then, \"the purpose of the forum does not suggest that it is closed, and the breadth of permitted speech points in the opposite direction.\" <i>Christ's Bride,</i> 148 F.3d at 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has considered the government's practice of excluding speech from a forum \"not because the exclusion of categories of speech creates a non-public forum, but because the <i>nature</i> of the excluded categories sheds light on whether the government was acting as a proprietor or a regulator.\" <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130; <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 805, 105 S.Ct. 3439 (\"The decision of the [g]overnment to limit access to the [forum] is not dispositive in itself; instead, it is relevant for what it suggests about the [g]overnment's intent in creating the forum.\"). In <i>Lehman,</i> the Court found that the 26-year, consistently enforced ban on non-commercial advertising was consistent with the government's role as a proprietor, because \"[r]evenue earned from long-term commercial advertising could be jeopardized by a requirement that short-term candidacy or issue-oriented advertisements be displayed.\" 418 U.S. at 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714. Other courts have followed <i>Lehman</i> to hold that a total ban on non-commercial speech may be consistent with the government acting in a proprietary capacity and have found transportation advertising spaces to be non-public fora when the government \"consistently promulgates and enforces policies restricting advertising ... to commercial advertising.\" <i>Children of the Rosary v. City of Phoenix,</i> 154 F.3d 972, 978 (9th Cir.1998); <i>Lebron v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. (Amtrak),</i> 69 F.3d 650, 656 (2d Cir.1995). When the advertising space has been opened to non-commercial speech, however, courts have distinguished the advertising space in question from the total ban on non-commercial speech present in <i>Lehman.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disallowing political speech, and allowing commercial speech only, indicates that making money is the main goal. Allowing political speech, conversely, evidences a general intent to open a space for discourse, and a deliberate acceptance of the possibility of clashes of opinion and controversy that the Court in <i>Lehman</i> recognized as inconsistent with sound commercial practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130; <i>Lebron v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,</i> 749 F.2d 893, 896 (D.C.Cir.1984)(\"There is no ... question that WMATA has converted its subway stations into public fora by accepting ... political advertising.\"). The MBTA has no longstanding policy of prohibiting public-issue advertisements like Change the Climate's or Ridley's. While excluding political campaign speech from its advertising space, the MBTA has allowed and intentionally encouraged non-commercial advertising, including public-issue advertising regarding social issues like drugs, crime, violence, abortion, AIDS, suicide, and religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of the MBTA's Revised Interim Guidelines under which it refused to post Change the Climate's advertisements also indicate that it is acting as a regulator/lawmaker and not as a proprietor. The guidelines prohibit the posting of any advertisement that \"promotes or encourages, or appears to promote or encourage, the use or possession of unlawful or illegal goods or services,\" or unlawful conduct. The MBTA has not offered any commercial justification for its interest in prohibiting advertisements containing such material, and we see \"no commercial reason why [the MBTA] has any special interest in [preventing unlawful conduct]; [the MBTA's] interest is only the interest in upholding the law because it is the law.\" <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130. This is certainly a regulatory and not a proprietary interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have similarly found the advertising spaces of various urban transportation systems to be a designated public forum when the government has allowed \"a wide variety of commercial, public-service, public-issue, and political ads,\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 767 F.2d at 1232, \"political and other non-commercial advertising generally,\" <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130, or \"public-service, public-issue, and political advertisements in addition to traditional commercial advertisements.\" <i>United Food,</i> 163 F.3d at 346. In these cases, contrary to the majority's assertions, the agency's control over public issue advertising was not unlike that exercised by the MBTA in practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Christ's Bride,</i> the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) was deemed a designated public forum because, while SEPTA asserted its right to refuse advertising deemed \"objectionable for any reason,\" SEPTA had the \"practice of permitting virtually unlimited access to the forum.\" 148 F.3d at 251-52. The Third Circuit found that in practice \"SEPTA has exercised control over only three ads, two of which had graphics to which SEPTA objected, and one of which solicited personal injury cases that could be directed against SEPTA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United Food,</i> the Southwest Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) had rejected an advertisement under a provision of its advertising policy that prohibited \"[a]dvertising of controversial public issues that may adversely affect SORTA's ability to attract and maintain ridership.\" 163 F.3d at 352. The Sixth Circuit concluded that \"the lack of definitive standards guiding the application of SORTA's advertising policy permits SORTA, like SEPTA, to reject a proposed advertisement deemed objectionable for any reason.\" 163 F.3d at 354. Under these circumstances, the transportation authorities' contention that the advertising at issue was incompatible with the nature of the forum created by their advertising spaces could not be sustained. The Sixth Circuit's reasoning is instructive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find that SORTA's stated purpose for limiting advertising on buses only tenuously related, at best, to the greater forum's intended use. This is not a situation like that in <i>Cornelius,</i> where the government established a controlled solicitation process to prevent disruption in the workplace, or [<i>AETC</i>], where a public broadcasting system logistically could not possibly accommodate all political candidates, or even [<i>Perry</i>], where a high school had a direct interest in controlling access to its internal mail system. Here there is no established causal link between SORTA's goal of enhancing the environment for its riders, enhancing SORTA's standing in the community, and enabling SORTA to attract and maintain its ridership, and its broad-based discretion to exclude advertisements that are too controversial or not aesthetically pleasing. Although political and public-issue speech is often contentious, it does not follow that such speech will necessarily frustrate SORTA's commercial interests. Rather, it may be the case that only in rare circumstances will the controversial nature of such speech sufficiently interfere with the provision of Metro bus services so as to warrant excluding a political or public-issue advertisement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United Food,</i> 163 F.3d at 354.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the MBTA has not opened its advertising space to all public-issue advertising except that which it deems \"objectionable for any reason,\" id., but has instead promulgated written advertising policies and exercised control over a handful of advertisements in the five years prior to the events at issue here. Still, the incoherent written policies and the occasional, subjective exercise of control are insufficient to demonstrate an intent by the MBTA to close its advertising space as a public forum when it routinely posts public-issue advertisements on all manner of social issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the MBTA's policy and practice regarding its advertising space, and the nature of that space as created and managed by the MBTA, demonstrates an intent by the MBTA to create a designated public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I must note that, while not a sidewalk or city park, the MBTA's facilities are the modern analogue to these traditional public fora. As mentioned above, 2.5 million people in the Greater Boston area use the MBTA's facilities, and its 170 bus and trolley routes, 4 subway lines, and 13-branch commuter rail network transit at some point of their routes through or across traditional public fora. In addition to the car cards at issue in this case, the MBTA allows advertising on the outside of its vehicles, which are obviously displayed as they transit through the public streets. Some of the cars on some of the subway lines that travel above ground are even painted in such a way that the whole exterior of the car constitutes, in effect, an advertisement. The MBTA also allows advertising on the walls of the numerous bus and trolley shelters that sit on the public sidewalks and can be seen from the public thoroughfare. Thus, in addition to the traveling public, the MBTA's advertising influence reaches into those on the traditional public fora &#8212; the streets and sidewalks of Greater Boston. As stated above, this means that the MBTA is in a position to control 40,000 advertising spaces for the dissemination of information to a large segment of the region's population. It is disquieting, to say the least, that the majority would allow the government to control the content of the information to which the public is exposed through these advertising spaces. The MBTA's advertising system is indeed a powerful tool with which to influence public opinion, one which should be opened to the crucible of competing viewpoints to the largest extent possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I concur with the majority's conclusion that the MBTA engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it rejected Change the Climate's proposed advertisements, I dissent from its failure to recognize similar discrimination with regard to Ridley's advertisements. I further dissent from the majority's decision to engage in forum analysis, and from the outcome thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the majority's insistence on delving into forum analysis is perplexing, given its recognition that \"[p]ublic forum analysis itself has been criticized as unhelpful in many contexts, and particularly this one where the government is operating a commercial enterprise earning income from advertising.\" Maj. op. at 75 (<i>citing</i> Tribe, <i>supra,</i> at &#167; 2-24, at 922 (\"[W]hether or not a given place is deemed a `public forum' is ordinarily less significant than the nature of the speech restriction &#8212; despite the Court's rhetoric.\"); Frederick Schauer, <i>Principles, Institutions, and the First Amendment,</i> 112 Harv. L.Rev. 84, 97 (1998) (\"Of all of the paths down which the Court might go in dealing with the government enterprise cases, the so-called `forum doctrine' appears least satisfactory.\")).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In this way, Ridley's advertisement would be analogous to a public service announcement stating: \"Kids who smoke think they look cool, but really it makes them look stupid.\" It would be difficult to imagine the MBTA rejecting such an advertisement on the basis that it ridicules or demeans adolescent smokers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The majority's suggestion, Maj. op. at 93-95, that the vagueness inquiry is not important in this case because it does not involve a licensing scheme in a traditional public forum is unconvincing. Even if the majority is correct that this is not a traditional public forum in the legal sense, the MBTA transit system serves as its functional equivalent in today's society. 2.5 million people use its facilities on a daily basis, and it contains approximately 40,000 advertising spaces. In effect, the MBTA is in a position to control the dissemination of information to a large segment of the public which, in a practical sense, is obliged to be exposed to whatever advertising the MBTA chooses to permit in its facilities. Consequently, the \"danger of excessive discretion ... lead [ing] to viewpoint-discriminatory decisions,\"<i>id.</i> at 94, is quite serious. Further, while the majority indicates that concern about vagueness is at its zenith in licensing schemes for traditional public fora, I am aware of no precedent that would permit vagueness in regulations outside of this context, especially when the potential ramifications of unconstitutional implementation have a similar practical effect.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The rejected advertisement stated that \"[t]here are no scriptures in the Bible that teach that God set up the Catholic religion, the Baptist religion, the Pentecostal religion, the Jehovah's Witness religion or the Muslim religion.

This might be so in an isolated case. However, one cannot ignore the MBTA's haphazard and unpredictable pattern of enforcement with regard not only to Ridley's three ads, but also to earlier ads, such as those at issue in<i>AIDS Action,</i> 42 F.3d at 1. This suggests that it was no mere oversight or misunderstanding that led to the acceptance of Ridley's second advertisement. We must not allow the MBTA to change its standards or its enforcement thereof every time its application of the guidelines is challenged.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Claims of a unique holy charter and exclusive salvation are commonplace in western religion.

In addition, Change the Climate argues, no matter what the nature of the forum, the MBTA's rejection of its ads constitutes viewpoint discrimination. It also argues that the guidelines under which the ads were rejected must be narrow and objective and cannot leave excessive discretion in state officials, and the MBTA guidelines do not comply. Finally, Change the Climate argues the district court erred in not awarding it attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lischen Ridley filed suit in state court on January 8, 2002, on behalf of herself and other members of the Church with the Good News (\"Good News\"). The MBTA removed the <i>Ridley</i> action to federal court. The suit alleged that the MBTA lacked compelling reasons to reject the advertisement, that the rejection of the advertisement was the product of viewpoint discrimination, and that the MBTA's guideline involved was not narrowly tailored and was too vague to withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Ridley did not discuss the forum issue in her brief, the brief did note that the outcome of the forum issue in <i>Change the Climate</i> would govern the <i>Ridley</i> case. Ridley's reply brief also argued the public forum line of cases and expressly challenged the MBTA's assertion that the restrictions were reasonable, a standard of review which applies if the forum was not a public forum. And at oral argument, in response to multiple questions from the court as to the relationship of Ridley's claims to the forum analysis issue, counsel for Ridley argued that the forum analysis was relevant to Ridley's claims and could be dispositive of those claims. For example, Ridley argued that if the MBTA had created a public forum as argued in <i>Change the Climate,</i> she would be entitled to judgment on that ground. Further, counsel for both Ridley and Change the Climate moved to consolidate the appeals on the grounds that common issues of fact and law were present and the same lawyers represent both plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied all forms of relief to Ridley on June 5, 2003. The court assumed that the MBTA advertising program constituted a non-public forum and held that the rejections of Ridley's advertisements were not based on viewpoint discrimination, but rather on a valid \"content restriction prohibiting demeaning or disparaging content.\" The trial court held that the factual record based on the stipulation was insufficiently clear for it to grant the relief Ridley requested on whether the guidelines were viewpoint discriminatory on their face or whether they were too vague and gave MBTA administrators too much discretion. Nonetheless, the court revisited the <i>Ridley</i> guideline question when it issued its <i>Change the Climate</i> opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 2003, the district court also found for the MBTA in <i>Change the Climate,</i> again avoiding the forum issue. However, consistent with the law on non-public fora, the court reviewed the MBTA's guidelines and its decision to reject these ads under a reasonableness test. The court found that each of the three advertisements provided misleading messages about the legality of marijuana, and that two of the ads targeted minors. As such, the court held, the MBTA's rejection of the ads was reasonable and not viewpoint discriminatory. The district court also found that the MBTA guideline prohibiting materials which promote illegal activity was not viewpoint discriminatory on its face. Nonetheless, in its <i>Change the Climate</i> opinion, the court also said that the <i>Ridley</i> guideline prohibiting demeaning or disparaging material was \"somewhat vague\" on its face and \"still leaves too much room for arbitrary decisions.\" As a result, in its judgment, the district court ordered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court retains jurisdiction to consider any well supported motion for modification of the MBTA's amended guidelines and for modification of this Final Judgment grounded on some change of law or change of relevant factual circumstances occurring after the date of this judgment.

We hold first that the MBTA did not create a public forum. Second, we address whether the MBTA's pertinent guidelines and its decisions to reject both parties' advertising are unlawful as a form of viewpoint discrimination or as an unreasonable use of the forum. We hold that the guidelines on their face are viewpoint neutral and reasonable, and that the decision to reject the Ridley ad was neither viewpoint discriminatory nor unreasonable. However, we hold that the rejection of the three Change the Climate ads constituted viewpoint discrimination and was unreasonable. Finally, we consider the challenge that the guidelines at issue in both cases are vague and delegate too much discretion to the MBTA's employees. We hold that the pertinent guidelines are not facially unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no disputed facts in this case, only disputes as to what conclusions are to be drawn from those facts. Although only the present 2003 MBTA advertising policy is at issue, we recount the history of dealing between the parties, which is pertinent both to the public forum claim and to other claims. Some facts are reserved for discussion as to the particular party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Facts as to the MBTA</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA is a quasi-governmental organization whose purpose is to provide public transportation in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, &#167; 5. The MBTA provides transportation to 1.2 million customers daily and to 2.5 million people in the Greater Boston area. For many riders, the MBTA is the only transportation option available. The MBTA operates approximately 170 bus routes, four subway lines, a 13-branch commuter rail network, and six ferry service routes. The MBTA has partnered with the Boston School Department to provide transportation to up to 60,000 Boston public school students annually. The MBTA distributed approximately 15,000 to 20,000 passes to Boston students, the vast majority of whom were in high school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal purpose of the MBTA advertising program is to generate and maximize revenue. The MBTA has statutory directives both to \"maximize and increase total fare revenue and ridership,\" as well as to \"establish and implement policies that provide for the maximization of nontransportation revenues from all sources.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, &#167; 11. The advertising program effectuates this second purpose. The MBTA has about 40,000 advertising spaces, including interior \"car card\" displays in buses, trains, and trolleys, king size and tail-light exterior displays on buses, and station and platform displays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through a private advertising contractor, Viacom Outdoor of Braintree (\"Viacom\"), the MBTA attempts to sell all of its advertising space at the usual commercial rates. If all space is not sold at those rates, the MBTA policy is first that it may, without cost to itself, \"display advertisements or announcements calculated (i) to increase its revenue, public travel, or goodwill or (ii) as compensation to companies which provide beneficial services to the Authority or (iii) to be otherwise in the public interest.\" Only if there then remains advertising space unsold does the MBTA, as a third choice, sell advertisements at a reduced rate to nonprofit, tax-exempt public charities or governmental agencies to fill the remaining space. The MBTA charges a fee of 50% of the full commercial advertising rate to those nonprofit organizations. The advertisements at issue in both cases here fall into this last category. All advertisements, of whatever type, are subject to guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA recognizes that its two statutory directives, maximizing fare revenue and ridership and maximizing non-transportation revenue, can at times be at odds. In numerous instances over the years, the MBTA has received significant complaints from its customers about particular advertisements. The MBTA management was concerned such complaints would threaten ridership and fare revenue. Often those ads had been placed by the MBTA's advertising contractor without seeking prior MBTA approval. The MBTA then reviewed the advertisements; usually the contractor had violated the guidelines by accepting the advertisements. The MBTA has, accordingly, from the inception of its advertising program in 1992, adopted both substantive and procedural guidelines, described below, to limit the types of advertisements it would accept. Indeed, in attempting to increase ridership, the MBTA initiated a Courtesy Counts program and distributes a brochure that says: \"We're committed to courtesy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Facts as to Plaintiffs' Advertisements</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Change the Climate</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate, a not-for-profit group, conducts provocative advertising campaigns in order to generate debate about the laws criminalizing the use of marijuana. It has conducted such advertising campaigns in Washington, D.C., in part using advertising on the Metro transit system. It sought to do the same in Boston, starting in 1999, by submitting three advertisements designed to catch people's attention and make them rethink the wisdom of the drug laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first advertisement, (the \"Teen Ad\"), is a color photograph of a teenage girl with a baseball cap on backwards, with a caption saying: \"Smoking pot is not cool, but we're not stupid, ya know. Marijuana is <i>NOT</i> cocaine or heroin. Tell <i>us</i> the truth ...\" Change the Climate sought to place this advertisement on poster cards on the inside of buses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second advertisement, (the \"Mother Ad\"), contains a picture of an adult female who is writing on a white board, saying: \"I've got three great kids. I love them more than anything. I don't want them to smoke pot. But I know jail is a lot more dangerous than smoking pot.\" Change the Climate sought to place this advertisement in MBTA subway stations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third advertisement, (the \"Police Ad\"), is a color photograph of two policemen standing in front of an American flag, with text stating: \"Police are too important ... too valuable ... too good ... to waste on arresting people for marijuana when <i>real</i> criminals are on the loose.\" Change the Climate sought to run this ad on the exterior of buses, as it had done earlier in the Washington, D.C. transit system. All three advertisements also contain the web site address, www.changetheclimate.org.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's marketing director, Lucy Shorter, rejected the ads in January 2000. The reasons stated were that (1) the three ads promote the use of marijuana, and (2) the three ads were really \"reform\" ads as part of an effort to legalize marijuana and as such were in conflict with the MBTA's policies on drugs and alcohol. She attached to her rejection letter the MBTA's workplace rules on drug and alcohol use, the advertising guidelines, and the prohibition on advertising tobacco products. It appears the MBTA's \"policies\" on drugs to which she referred were internal MBTA workplace rules. There were no advertising guidelines dealing specifically with marijuana or other drugs. The MBTA continued to reject the ads for different stated reasons at later times, as discussed below. In sum, the MBTA's 2003 revised guidelines prohibit advertisements which promote the use of illegal goods or services or unlawful conduct. The MBTA has stated that each of the ads promoted illegal use of marijuana by juveniles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Ridley</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Good News has advertised in the past on the radio, in the Yellow Pages, in the newspaper, and via posted messages on vehicles, including a motor home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2001, Ridley submitted the first of what would be three advertisements to the MBTA's advertising representative, Viacom.

The advertisement was displayed at the Park Street and Downtown Crossing MBTA stations, two major stations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 26, 2001, Ridley asked the MBTA to change the content of the advertisement that was posted in the MBTA system for the last two weeks of her existing contract. The new copy stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bible says in Rev 12:9 \"And Satan which deceiveth the whole world.\" Yes, Satan set up over a thousand false religions in the world causing wars, racism and hatred in the world.

The district court denied the request on January 28, 2002, and Ridley filed an interlocutory appeal with this court. As recounted below, that appeal was mooted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA promulgated a new set of \"Interim Guidelines Regulating MBTA Advertising\" on April 12, 2002. One of the 2002 guidelines provided that the MBTA \"shall not display or maintain any advertisement\" that is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Demeaning or disparaging.</i> The advertisement contains material that demeans or disparages an individual or group of individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The revised 2002 guidelines also reflected the results of an MBTA internal debate over when the MBTA would look at the contents of a website listed in an advertisement. The MBTA had considered the listed website when initially rejecting Ridley's second advertisement. Under the 2002 guidelines, the contents of a referenced website would only be considered and judged under the guidelines when \"the message or sponsorship of the advertisement cannot reasonably be determined without reference\" to that website. The 2002 guidelines formalized a more comprehensive review procedure with four different layers of scrutiny (by Viacom, the MBTA Contract Administrator, the MBTA General Counsel, and the MBTA General Manager) before any advertisement could be rejected based on the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA told Ridley on April 25, 2002, that under these new guidelines, it would accept her second advertisement. Based on this change of stance, this court dismissed Ridley's appeal as moot on July 26, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By this time, Ridley no longer wanted to post her second advertisement. On June 13, 2002, she submitted a third advertisement to the MBTA, the one now at issue. The ad stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bible teaches that there is only one religion. There are no scriptures in the Bible that teach that God set up the Catholic religion, the Baptist religion, the Pentecostal religion, the Jehovah's Witness religion or the Muslim religion.

The guidelines also prohibit ads containing profanity, obscene or sexually prurient material or nude images (as those terms are defined in state law), false or misleading commercial speech, libelous speech, or copyright infringing speech. The guidelines further prohibit \"political campaign speech,\" defined as: \"speech that (1) refers to a specific ballot question, initiative, petition, or referendum, or (2) refers to any candidate for public office.\" Finally, the 2003 guidelines prohibit any advertisement that contains, implies, or declares an endorsement by the MBTA or the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We engage in de novo review of ultimate conclusions of law and mixed questions of law and fact in First Amendment cases. <i>Hurley v.

Public forum analysis itself has been criticized as unhelpful in many contexts, and particularly this one where the government is operating a commercial enterprise earning income from permitting advertising. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Laurence H.

Change the Climate argues that the standard of review for speech restrictions in a designated public forum is strict scrutiny. Ridley admits that a non-public forum (sometimes called a limited public forum) usually results in application of a lesser \"reasonableness\" standard. We accept arguendo<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> these premises that strict scrutiny applies to a public forum's exclusion of speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that while the MBTA's advertising program is not a traditional public forum, the MBTA effectively has created a designated public forum for the expression of ideas because it has accepted a range of advertisements on its vehicles and in its stations. The MBTA says it has not created a public forum at all. If it has, the MBTA insists that it is at most a limited public forum,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which is the equivalent of a non-public forum, and that its rejection of the advertisements is within the limits appropriate to a non-public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Forum Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government must have an <i>affirmative intent</i> to create a public forum in order for a designated public forum to arise. \"The government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3439</span></a></span>. To determine that intent, courts must consider both explicit expressions about intent and \"the policy and practice of the government to ascertain whether it intended to designate a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum.\" <i>Id.</i> We also \"examine[] the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern the government's intent.\" <i>Id.</i> As to the nature of the property, the MBTA does run advertisements and so there is nothing inherent in the property which precludes its use for <i>some</i> expressive activity. That nonetheless leaves the issue of whether particular expressive activity may be inconsistent with the nature of the property. The MBTA has determined that some types of expressive activity are not consistent with the commercial enterprise it runs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 2003 advertising guidelines, the MBTA states expressly that \"[t]he MBTA intends that its facilities constitute nonpublic forums that are subject to the viewpoint-neutral restrictions set forth below.\" Nonetheless, a statement of intent contradicted by consistent actual policy and practice would not be enough to support the MBTA's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate argues that we should give little weight to this express statement of intent: paying it heed would allow a government the opportunity impermissibly to censor merely by newly labeling the forum in question a non-public forum. The past history of characterization of a forum may well be relevant; but that does not mean a present characterization about a forum may be disregarded. The government is free to change the nature of any nontraditional forum as it wishes. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3439</span></a></span>. Thus, even if MBTA's previous intent was to maintain a designated public forum, it would be free to decide <i>in good faith</i> to close the forum at any time. There is no evidence that the 2003 changes were adopted as a mere pretext to reject plaintiff's advertisements. To the contrary, the MBTA acted in response to expressed constitutional concerns about its prior guidelines, and cannot be faulted for trying to adhere more closely to the constitutional line. And if the MBTA revised a guideline merely as a ruse for impermissible viewpoint discrimination, that would be found unconstitutional regardless of the type of forum created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' argument assumes that before January 2003, the MBTA had created a designated public forum. That is unlikely: the MBTA has consistently had both significant substantive content limitations and procedural limitations on the advertisements it would accept, and there is little evidence the MBTA affirmatively intended to create a public forum. Even so, the MBTA has not created a public forum in its advertising program under its 2003 guidelines, which are at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1992, the MBTA has had substantive guidelines prohibiting all tobacco ads, and all libelous, slanderous, or obscene ads. Procedurally, it required all advertisers to submit an application to the MBTA's advertising contractor, which had instructions to send any ads potentially in conflict with the guidelines to the MBTA for review, and the MBTA reserved the right to reject any ad it wished. In <i>AIDS Action Comm. of Massachusetts v. MBTA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684073\"><a href=\"/opinion/684073/aids-action-committee-of-massachusetts-inc-v-massachusetts-bay/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1994), this court noted that these early guidelines left a lot to be desired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995 the MBTA further prohibited ads which were indecent to, or designed to frighten, child viewers. Then in 1999, the MBTA created new guidelines which, in addition, prohibited ads containing depictions of violent criminal conduct, firearms, profanity, ads harmful to children, and ads that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race, ethnic, or political affiliation. These prohibitions are not the indicia of an intent to create a public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 2003 guidelines intensify both the substantive and procedural limitations and protections used by the MBTA. The January 2003 guidelines better define the substantive limitations and further ban ads that promote or appear to promote the use of unlawful goods or services or the commission of unlawful conduct, as well as political campaign ads. Procedurally, the 2003 guidelines also create more stringent mechanisms for MBTA review of potentially prohibited ads. Given the litany of limitations on advertisements from the inception of its program, and the strengthening of those limitations in 2003, the MBTA has, at least by 2003, through its policy expressed an intent <i>not</i> to open its advertising space to all persons and organizations for public dissemination of their views on all topics without limitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's practice of enforcing its policy further shows that it intended <i>not</i> to create such a forum. In the five years preceding these litigations, the MBTA rejected at least seventeen advertisements that were not in conformance with different aspects of its policy. Various advertisements were rejected for violating, among other grounds, the prohibitions on ads depicting violence, indecency, profanity, denigration of women, and for containing tobacco products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate points to one example of a seemingly contradictory enforcement of the policy with respect to ads containing tobacco in an attempt to argue that the MBTA has erratically enforced its written policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> One or more instances of erratic enforcement of a policy does not itself defeat the government's intent not to create a public forum. <i>See New England Reg'l Council of Carpenters v. Kinton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776976\"><a href=\"/opinion/776976/new-england-regional-council-of-carpenters-v-thomas-j-kinton-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2002) (no government intent to create a designated forum exists \"even if [government's] policy of restricted access is erratically enforced\"). By consistently limiting ads it saw as in violation of its policy, even if doing so imperfectly, the MBTA evidenced its intent not to create a designated public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the relevant Supreme Court case law compels the conclusion that the MBTA has not created a designated public forum.

The opinion found that \"[i]n much the same way that a newspaper or periodical, or even a radio or television station, need not accept every proffer of advertising from the general public, a city transit system has discretion to develop and make reasonable choices concerning the type of advertising that may be displayed in its vehicles.\" <i>Id.</i> at 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109090\"><a href=\"/opinion/109090/lehman-v-shaker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That amounted to the type of content discrimination that \"gave rise to an appearance of viewpoint discrimination\" which had not been adequately explained. <i>Id.</i> at 11.

The system primarily ran commercial advertising, but did run a small number of non-commercial public service advertisements, excluding political and religious advertising. <i>Id.</i> The case did not, though, address the further issue, which we do, of a transit system which accepts what is apparently more non-commercial advertising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, one circuit, relying on <i>Lehman,</i> has recently held that advertising space in bus benches was a non-public forum. <i>Uptown Pawn and Jewelry, Inc. v.

This argument suffers from several flaws. As a matter of law, under <i>Lehman,</i> the dividing line between a public forum and a non-public forum is not the dividing line between commercial advertisements and paid advertisements from non-profit groups. And under <i>Arkansas Educ.

Nor was the MBTA adopting its own program to inform the public about issues, as in <i>Christ's Bride,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755567\"><a href=\"/opinion/755567/christs-bride-ministries-inc-v-southeastern-pennsylvania-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>.

This reasoning fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the forum analysis. The focus is on whether the government has intentionally decided to create a public forum. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, even if the government had limited ads \"in a constitutionally impermissible manner\" by engaging in viewpoint discrimination, that would not create a public forum where none was intended. The MBTA's policy clearly evidenced an intent to maintain control over the forum, and thus the MBTA did not create a designated public forum.

He found the Teen Ad to be \"geared towards young people, telling them that marijuana is not cocaine or heroin, so it's the lesser of two evils, but it's okay to smoke it.\" Prince did not view the ad as sending a message that juveniles should be told the truth about drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prince thought that the Mother Ad was also harmful to juveniles, because the ad implies \"that it's okay to smoke marijuana, which is against the law.\" Prince said the words meant \"that `I don't want my children to smoke pot, but I know jail is... more dangerous, so therefore I'm going to overlook the fact that they are allowed to break the law.'\" Prince said that some people could have the legitimate viewpoint that jail is more harmful to a child than marijuana smoking, but that was not a viewpoint he would allow to be displayed on the MBTA because \"[i]t allows [children] to think it's okay to break the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Police Ad, Prince stated: \"It's telling them that the police are not going to take marijuana smoking very seriously, that there are real criminals on the loose, and it's okay to break the law.\" He further stated that the ad \"says that smoking marijuana will not be looked upon as a criminal act.\" When asked whether he agreed that the ad expressed a viewpoint about how police should be used, Prince replied: \"I know this ad tells young people that they should commit a criminal act.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael Mulhern, acting General Manager of the MBTA and the person with final authority to accept or reject advertisements, testified that he would reject all three ads under the current 2003 guidelines. The Teen Ad promoted marijuana use, he thought, by implying that cocaine and heroin were really harmful but marijuana use was not. He held these worries although the ad states explicitly that \"[s]moking pot is not cool.\" Further, he was concerned that the ad was targeted at juveniles, based on the picture of the teenage girl and the fact that the language is written in terms (\"cool,\" \"ya know\") that juveniles would generally use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mulhern testified that the Mother Ad also promoted marijuana use, and while it was \"not as clear\" as the Teen Ad, the Mother Ad could also <i>in part</i> be targeted at children. He testified that by depicting a mother stating that she is less concerned about her children smoking pot, the ad sends the message to children that they \"can smoke [pot] and still be great kids.\" Mulhern testified that he would permit Change the Climate to post an ad advocating the opposite viewpoint, saying: \"I've got three great kids.

He disagreed with the view that \"police resources should not be used for marijuana prosecutions.\" He said he would allow an ad to be posted if it expressed the opposite viewpoint, saying: \"Police are important, valuable, good. Police should be used for arresting people for marijuana crimes.\" Mulhern conceded that the ad did not target children specifically, but stated that he thought that children were more susceptible to receiving the message that marijuana is not a real crime than were other people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA also introduced testimony of Cornelia Kelley, the head of the Boston Latin School, a public exam school for grades seven through twelve, which uses the MBTA for transporting more than 2,100 of its 2,400 students. Kelley had the following concern about the Teen Ad: \"There is a message there that marijuana is okay; it's not as bad as cocaine or heroin. And the message, to my mind, that's a very confusing message for young people. There is a sense there that marijuana is acceptable.\" When asked, despite the fact that the ad says that \"Smoking pot is not cool,\" why it would lead students to think that smoking marijuana is okay, Kelley replied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you look at that ad, that's a real mixed message to young people. And the students with whom I deal get a great deal of stimulation in different ways. And what you're looking at there is not a clear-cut message. And when children ... are that age, we try and see to it that they understand clearly what's legal and what's not legal. And that really says marijuana is not cocaine or heroin. It takes marijuana out of the realm of cocaine and heroin, where we consistently tell young people that marijuana is an illegal drug and you will be expelled for it or you will be arrested for it....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley conceded that a student would not be disciplined for expressing the view: \"Tell us the truth.

One is an ad for Trinity Oaks Wine, which contains a picture of a woman in a backless dress being hugged by a man. It states: \"Trinity Oaks. It's not a soap opera. But it is provocative.\" At the bottom, the ad states: \"Remember the wine,\" and has a picture of a wine bottle. Prince testified that this ad was not harmful to juveniles because the ad was addressed to adults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another ad, for Doc Otis Hard Lemonade, depicts a woman's mouth eating an ice cube, and states \"DO IT ON THE ROCKS.\" In the corner there is a bottle of \"Doc Otis Hard Lemonade,\" an alcoholic lemonade beverage, being poured into a glass of ice, with the slogan: \"The perfect way to break the ice.\" When questioned as to whether ads such as this were harmful to juveniles, Mulhern conceded that alcohol use was illegal for juveniles, but found that alcohol ads did not fall under this guideline because the ads did not specifically target juveniles. Prince was also asked about this ad and testified that it was not harmful to juveniles because the ad was not addressed to young people, but to adults. When asked how he could tell this ad was \"geared towards somebody who's 22 and not somebody who's 20,\" Prince responded: \"Because alcohol for anybody under that age is illegal.\" Prince conceded that nothing in the ad protected young people from its influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley testified that she was also concerned about the advertisements for alcoholic beverages that her students see on the MBTA. The distinction she saw was that alcohol was legal at a certain age but use of marijuana was not legal at any age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate also introduced testimony that the MBTA has run numerous advertisements that discourage drug use. At trial, the MBTA stipulated to having run four such ads. One was headlined: \"TALK IS BETTER FOR YOUR KIDS THAN DRUGS... SO TALK!\" It has a cartoon picture of \"McGruff, the Crime Dog,\" as well as 8 pointers for talking to one's children about drugs, such as: \"Tell your kids you don't approve of the stuff\" and \"Tell them to say no ... and that you know they know the difference between right and wrong.\" The advertisement finishes by stating: \"Follow these steps and you'll be helpin' yourself, your kids and me ... take a bite out of crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second advertisement, sponsored by Drug Free America, contains a picture of two children at a playground, with the headline: \"Everyday after school, my kid likes to __________. If you can't fill in this blank, you need to start asking. It's a proven way to steer kids clear of drugs. It's not pestering. It's parenting. Ask: Who? What? When? Where? Questions. The Anti-Drug.\" A third advertisement, sponsored by Partnership for a Drug-Free New England and America, as well as the Office of National Drug Control Policy, states simply: \"Are You Waiting for Your Kids to Talk to You About Pot?\" And the fourth advertisement, sponsored by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, contains a pair of dice, one with a skull on one side, and states: \"Just because you survived drugs, doesn't mean your children will.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's position under the current guidelines is that it would still reject Change the Climate's three ads because each ad targets children and encourages the use of illegal drugs. The present guidelines do not prohibit ads \"harmful\" to children. The MBTA also takes the position that it would permit ads which expressed <i>to adults</i> the viewpoint that the marijuana laws should be rethought so long as the ads said that use of marijuana is illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it should be emphasized that the MBTA's guideline itself, which allows rejection of advertisements that promote illegal activity, particularly among children, is constitutional. It clearly serves a viewpoint-neutral purpose, and it is surely reasonable given the characteristics of the MBTA's advertising program. It is indisputable that the MBTA has a legitimate, viewpoint-neutral interest in not being used as a messenger to convey messages promoting illegal conduct among juveniles. It is also legitimate for the MBTA to consider that it has juveniles among its passengers. Further, as a vendor, the MBTA has a legitimate interest in not offending riders so that they stop their patronage. All of these are reasons why the guideline itself is constitutional against a viewpoint-discrimination attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we focus on instead are the specific decisions of the MBTA to reject the three Change the Climate advertisements. The MBTA's mere recitation of viewpoint-neutral rationales (or the presentation of a viewpoint-neutral guideline) for its decisions to reject the three advertisements does not immunize those decisions from scrutiny. The recitation of viewpoint-neutral grounds may be a mere pretext for an invidious motive. <i>See Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 811-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Our case does not involve a criminal prohibition, but only a refusal to accept advertising. The context in <i>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium</i> is closest: there the issue was the FCC's ability to control certain sexually explicit content on cable television. 518 U.S. at 734-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118061\"><a href=\"/opinion/118061/denver-area-ed-telecommunications-consortium-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2374</span></a></span>. In both <i>Denver Area</i> and the other cases, the question was whether statutes or regulations had been drafted narrowly enough. Our focus is particular decisions to exclude advertisements, not the facial validity of the guideline. Finally, all of these cases involved the regulation of sexually explicit (but non-obscene) speech; sexual speech is not involved in this case. Still, these differences do not weaken the general principle that a purported justification for excluding speech to adults on the grounds of protecting children will be examined closely to see if the decisions reasonably do protect children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are various situations which will lead a court to conclude that, despite the seemingly neutral justifications offered by the government, nonetheless the decision to exclude speech is a form of impermissible discrimination. Three are relevant here. First, statements by government officials on the reasons for an action can indicate an improper motive. <i>See, e.g., Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 268, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span> (1977). Second, where the government states that it rejects something because of a certain characteristic, but other things possessing the same characteristic are accepted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> this sort of underinclusiveness raises a suspicion that the stated neutral ground for action is meant to shield an impermissible motive. <i>See, e.g., Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 812, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Third, suspicion arises where the viewpoint-neutral ground is not actually served very well by the specific governmental action at issue; where, in other words, the fit between means and ends is loose or nonexistent. This situation comes up in a variety of legal settings. <i>See, e.g., Purkett v. Elem,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117934\"><a href=\"/opinion/117934/purkett-v-elem/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 768, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117934\"><a href=\"/opinion/117934/purkett-v-elem/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

All three factors lead us to conclude that the reasons given by the MBTA in this case are insufficient to avoid a conclusion of viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inherent in the MBTA's position is its recognition that save for the risk of inducing juveniles to smoke marijuana, the refusal to run these advertisements for an adult audience would be viewpoint discrimination. That conclusion is essentially conceded in the MBTA's briefs. We find the purported justification of protecting children to be undermined for two basic reasons. First, there is direct evidence, through statements by MBTA officials, that the reason for rejecting the advertisements was actually distaste for Change the Climate's viewpoint. Second, there is evidence that the MBTA's rejection of these advertisements does not actually serve the alleged purpose of protecting children, and so the MBTA cannot offset the direct evidence against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's initial statement of reasons for rejecting the three ads was, in part, that the ads were part of Change the Climate's effort to \"reform marijuana [laws]\" in an \"effort to legalize.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This was a direct statement of viewpoint discrimination. It was reinforced by later evidence under the 2003 guidelines. The MBTA General Manager said he would publish the Mother and Police Ads if they came to the opposite conclusion &#8212; one with which he agreed &#8212; expressing viewpoints which reinforced compliance with, but did not question, existing laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supporting the direct evidence is our conclusion that the MBTA's rejection of these advertisements does not reasonably serve its purported justification. Dealing first with the Mother Ad and the Police Ad, it is clear that they are not targeted at children, nor can they reasonably be construed to promote illegal marijuana use among juveniles. The ads do not advocate illegal drug use. Rather, these two ads make a sophisticated argument that the criminalization of marijuana imposes worse consequences on society than would alternatives. The risk posed by the Mother Ad and Police Ad of inducing juveniles to engage in illegal marijuana activity is remarkably minimal and, indeed, probably nonexistent. The MBTA is certainly correct to evaluate individually each ad as to its compliance with the guidelines. Its judgments must be reasonable and it would not be reasonable to think that juveniles were exposed to no other information about drugs. Indeed, the MBTA has itself a long history of running ads stressing that drug use is illegal and that drug laws should be obeyed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA has sought to allay any suspicions of viewpoint discrimination by representing that it would run advertisements saying in bold text that the drug laws should be changed, provided the ads at the same time acknowledge that marijuana use is illegal. This, it says, removes any concern about viewpoint discrimination because it proves that the same message could be run if a different manner of expression were used. But that is not so. The MBTA's concession means simply that it will run advertisements which do not attract attention but will exercise its veto power over advertisements which are designed to be effective in delivering a message. Viewpoint discrimination concerns arise when the government intentionally tilts the playing field for speech; reducing the effectiveness of a message, as opposed to repressing it entirely, thus may be an alternative form of viewpoint discrimination. <i>See R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S. at 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is true that there is a distinction: alcohol, like marijuana, cannot legally be sold to minors but can be sold to adults, and marijuana may not, in general, legally be used by either adults or minors. That cannot be the dividing line if the argument is that the MBTA is trying to avoid inducing illegal conduct: the MBTA has correctly not defended on the basis that the ads will induce illegal marijuana use by adults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult issue concerns the first advertisement &#8212; the Teen Ad. It certainly may reasonably be viewed as directed to attract the attention of teenagers. What is far more questionable is the reasonableness of the contention that the ad would induce teenagers to smoke marijuana. The ad itself says nothing of the sort. Indeed, it says the opposite &#8212; that \"smoking pot is not cool.\" The ad then implies that marijuana should not be seen as equivalent to heroin or cocaine. The clearest message is that marijuana usage should be decriminalized, while heroin and cocaine usage should remain criminal. The targeting of teenagers does not remove the ad from the realm of political speech. Many of those who are teenagers are either voters or will soon be voters, and the ad is also aimed at adults. The MBTA cannot put a thumb on the scale to preclude Change the Climate from effectively communicating a message about changing the laws to a likely responsive group of voters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA's own evidence fails to support its argument. Headmaster Kelley's point was not that the Teen Ad would induce drug use, but the rather different point that the Ad presented a \"mixed message.\" The mixed nature of the message was about which drugs were legal and which were not; thus her concern was that the ad would promote confusion about whether marijuana use was illegal. The MBTA's conclusion, however, requires an additional step &#8212; that the ads would not only confuse teenagers about marijuana's illegal status, but that this confusion would then lead teenagers to smoke marijuana. Neither step in the reasoning is supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Teen Ad must be evaluated in context. The MBTA has run numerous ads that discourage drug use and encourage respect for and adherence to the current drug laws. Some of these ads are sponsored by government agencies, such as the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose goal is to further the current drug laws and aid in their enforcement. Juveniles are exposed frequently to anti-drug messages in a variety of settings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> including in schools. Indeed, schools may be the very place where students, in class, debate the wisdom of certain laws, as at Boston Latin. That this one at best ambiguous advertisement would lead teenagers to believe that marijuana is legal, against a barrage of contrary information, is unlikely. Yet the MBTA's argument requires even a further step. That one advertisement, which on its face says use of marijuana is \"not cool,\" would actually induce juveniles to smoke marijuana strikes us as thin to the point of implausibility. The MBTA's justifications for not running these advertisements are sufficiently implausible that on the totality of the evidence we conclude that the MBTA has engaged in viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the rejection of the three ads would fail to pass muster under the other prong of analysis laid out in <i>Cornelius,</i> which requires that any restriction be reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum, because their rejection is, in context, unreasonable. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 806, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The guidelines prohibiting demeaning or disparaging ads are themselves viewpoint neutral. That is also true of the application of the guidelines to Ridley's ad on the facts here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the guideline itself, we note that the 2003 revision to the guidelines continued to prohibit demeaning or disparaging ads, but did so in more general terms, not tied only to certain categories such as race, religion, and gender. Most likely that revision was made in light of <i>R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S. at 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2538</span></a></span>, and later case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The current regulation simply prohibits the use of advertisements that \"demean[ ] or disparage [ ] an individual or group of individuals,\" without listing any particular protected groups. In this context, the guideline is just a ground rule: there is no viewpoint discrimination in the guideline because the state is not attempting to give one group an advantage over another in the marketplace of ideas. <i>See</i> Elena Kagan, \"Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography after R.A.V.,\" 60 U. Chi. L.Rev. 873, 889 (1993) (suggesting, based on the court's language, that the problem with the statute in <i>R.A.V.</i> could have been avoided by drafting a statute that did not single out any specific groups for protected status).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, under the MBTA's current guideline, all advertisers on all sides of all questions are allowed to positively promote their own perspective and even to criticize other positions so long as they do not use demeaning speech in their attacks. No advertiser can use demeaning speech: atheists cannot use disparaging language to describe the beliefs of Christians, nor can Christians use disparaging language to describe the beliefs of atheists. Both sides, however, can use positive language to describe their own organizations, beliefs, and values. Some kinds of content (demeaning and disparaging remarks) are being disfavored, but no viewpoint is being preferred over another. The \"reasonable person\" referenced in the MBTA's guidelines of course does not belong to any particular religious group, and would protect minority, as well as majority, religious beliefs from language that would \"demean or disparage\" them. The MBTA's current guideline neither intends nor has as a significant effect the tilting of the playing field for speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ridley argues that because the MBTA accepted the first two ads it must accept the third. We reject the argument that because a government commercial enterprise has opened up discussion on one particular \"topic\" (say, religion), it must allow any and all discussion on that topic. Reasonable ground rules, so long as they are not intended to give one side an advantage over another, can be set without falling prey to viewpoint discrimination. It is possible that the effect of these guidelines will fall more heavily on some messages than others in certain contexts, but this does not itself make the guidelines viewpoint discriminatory; the intent and chief impact of the non-demeaning requirement is merely to ensure a certain minimum level of discourse that is applicable to everyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA could reasonably conclude that the earlier two advertisements did not demean or disparage other religions, but that the third advertisement did. The first ad questioned the waywardness of today's Christians; the second issued a condemnation of other religions. By contrast, the third advertisement went a vitriolic further step and directly demeaned a number of religions, by calling them false. It told the adherents of those religions that their ways are ungodly, they are \"going to hell.\" In addition, those demeaned religions are likely to be the shared religions of a number of the MBTA riders. That the MBTA chose not to ban the earlier two ads (the first under threat of suit) does not mean it was required to accept the third ad. This is true even had the MBTA made a mistake under its guidelines in accepting the first two ads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ridley argues that even if the third advertisement is demeaning to other religions, the government still may not reject the ad because the subject matter is the protected one of religion. The government may not, Ridley argues, \"attempt to protect citizens from being exposed to religious views they might find offensive,\" citing <i>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105014\"><a href=\"/opinion/105014/joseph-burstyn-inc-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105014\"><a href=\"/opinion/105014/joseph-burstyn-inc-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span> (1952), which invalidated a statute that set up a censorship board which refused licenses for \"sacrilegious\" films. The case is inapposite, as the MBTA is not censoring religious speech here at all. The statute in <i>Wilson</i> acted as a prior restraint preventing the showing of a film deemed sacrilegious by the censors in any public place in the state. <i>Id.</i> at 497, 503, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105014\"><a href=\"/opinion/105014/joseph-burstyn-inc-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, the statute in <i>Wilson</i> was aimed only at religious speech, and the language made it clear that its goal was to \"suppress real or imagined attacks on a particular religious doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 505, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105014\"><a href=\"/opinion/105014/joseph-burstyn-inc-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is further evidence that the MBTA's actions here were not motivated by distaste for Ridley's particular viewpoint. She has presented no evidence that the MBTA ever allowed any other specific advertisement that would suggest viewpoint discrimination towards her. For example, there is no evidence in the record that other advertisements, religious or otherwise, were accepted despite containing demeaning or disparaging content.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two-week delay in approving Ridley's first advertisement is surely not a basis for inferring viewpoint discrimination. Nor is the saga connected with the placement of her second advertisement &#8212; this shows merely that the MBTA was honing its guidelines throughout this period and was working out its enforcement of various issues connected with the guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the MBTA's guideline and decision to reject Ridley's advertisement are viewpoint neutral, the regulatory scheme still must be \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum\" in order to be upheld. <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 806, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The MBTA's stated purposes in running its advertising program include \"maximiz[ing] revenue\" by making money through advertisements while not reducing ridership through offensive advertisements, \"maintaining a safe and welcoming environment\" for its riders (including children), and avoiding its identification with the ads it displays. A guideline preventing demeaning or disparaging advertisements is likely to serve these purposes well and is consistent with the MBTA's own \"Courtesy Counts\" program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Facial Validity of Guidelines: Vagueness and Vesting of Discretion</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Change the Climate argues that the guidelines must fail, in any event, because they are not sufficiently clear and objective. Change the Climate and Ridley also challenge the regulatory scheme on the ground that it is too vague and vests too much discretion in MBTA officials. In its <i>Ridley</i> opinion, the district court did not address the claim.

One could hold up a sign saying... that all \"anti-Catholic bigots\" are misbegotten; but not that all \"papists\" are, for that would insult and provoke violence \"on the basis of religion.\" St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 391-92, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under the MBTA's first and second guidelines, as in the statute in <i>R.A.V.,</i> this sort of tilted playing field would potentially have been possible. The criminal statute at issue in <i>R.A.V.</i> and the regulation of advertising by the government as a commercial enterprise at issue are quite different contexts, and thus <i>R.A.V.</i> may have no applicability here.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Further, the type of problem identified in <i>R.A.V.</i> is not a problem for an advertiser in Good News's position. Good News is a religion; its rejected advertisement was fairly understood as an attempt to demean other religions. Any attempt to demean Good News or its stance on the falsity of other religions would doubtlessly be denigration \"on the basis of ... religion\" and thus would be prohibited even by the initial two sets of regulations. The <i>R.A.V.</i> problem only exists where the individual or group that is prevented from speaking is not itself an object of protection under the classifications given in a statute or regulation (for example, bigots were not a protected group under the statute in <i>R.A.V.</i>).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Ridley also cannot challenge these earlier regulations on their face, as part of an overbreadth challenge. Such a challenge was not made to us, and it is waived.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> This guideline at issue here is somewhat like the regulation at issue in<i>Cogswell v.

In <i>Cogswell,</i> the plaintiff challenged a regulation that allowed each candidate to promote herself in a city-printed \"voters' pamphlet,\" but forbade a candidate from discussing her opponents in the pamphlet. The court upheld this regulation as a content restriction that did not lead to viewpoint discrimination: such a \"ground rule\" that is \"equally applicable to all candidates\" did not create a tilted playing field for speech. <i>Id.</i> at 816.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> It is true, as the parties stipulated, that the word \"denigration\" in the MBTA's first set of guidelines, under which Ridley's second advertisement was initially rejected, means virtually the same thing as the words \"demean[ ] or disparage[ ]\" in the MBTA's second set of guidelines, under which Ridley's second advertisement was eventually accepted. But the second set of guidelines also adopted a new policy determining that a website listed on an advertisement should not be considered unless the advertisement itself has an unclear message. This new policy was directly applicable to Ridley's second advertisement, which referenced a website containing additional and potentially \"demeaning\" content (the same kind of list of \"false\" religions stated in the third advertisement)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The changes in position by the MBTA in this case do not show that the standard is too vague.

Consequently, it is unnecessary for this court to forge into the murky waters of forum analysis &#8212; an issue, it is worth noting, irrelevant to the outcome in <i>Change the Climate</i> and not even raised by the plaintiff in <i>Ridley.

How would such a rule be discerned? What evidence is there in the record that the third advertisement violated this standard, other than the MBTA's subjective and conclusory assertion that it did? To the contrary, a religious message such as the advertisement in question does not disparage its targets, but rather alerts them to a (perceived) fact concerning their eternal salvation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> This is not a case of a hate group defaming the followers of Judaism, Catholicism, or another religion as having some intrinsic individual flaw. Rather, Ridley's advertisement attempts to convert these people to her religion. Telling people they are risking going to hell is, like it or not, a key component of explaining why religious choices are so important, and reasonable minds could most certainly disagree with the conclusion that such a statement in any way demeans or disparages the very people it aims to save. That such a statement was considered \"hostile,\" \"mock [ing],\" or \"demean[ing]\" highlights the ambiguity and unreasonableness of the MBTA's guideline. The \"prevailing community standard\" formulation does not rescue the MBTA's guideline from vagueness; rather, it permits MBTA authorities &#8212; even if they have the best of intentions &#8212; to make subjective, ad hoc determinations about speech that appears controversial because it endorses a minority viewpoint. <i>Cf.

The majority claims that this content discrimination does not amount to viewpoint discrimination because all religions \"are allowed to positively promote their own perspective and even to criticize other positions so long as they do not use demeaning speech in their attacks.\" Maj. op. at 91. This conclusion assumes that a statement like \"all good Catholics go to heaven\" is sufficiently rebutted by replying \"all good Buddhists go to heaven.\" From this dialogue, we could draw the heartwarming conclusion that \"all good Catholics and Buddhists\" go to heaven. Good or bad, however, this is simply not the type of message that most religions espouse. Especially for small groups like Ridley's, an essential part of proselytizing is explaining that in their view and the view of their prophet, \"all good Catholics, Buddhists, etc. are not going to heaven; rather, they are going to hell.\" This belief is central to their message of conversion. It is the clearest statement of the (eternal) consequences for those who do not convert, and it is undoubtedly a fact that they are hoping will propel the message's viewers to go to their website and learn more about their beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, while the majority concludes that an advertisement may criticize other religions as long as it does so in a non-demeaning way, it is apparent from the rejection of Ridley's third advertisement that even a text-based criticism about religion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> will be more likely to strike MBTA authorities as \"hostile,\" \"mocking,\" or \"demeaning,\" simply because it names that religion. Indeed, the third advertisement did not say anything that was not implicit in the second advertisement, which declared that there were over 1,000 (unnamed) false religions. If the guidelines permit the second advertisement, they cannot reasonably be applied to forbid the third.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> Thus, the MBTA's position is intrinsically viewpoint oriented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The religious nature of Ridley's advertisement increases the MBTA's burden, for religious advertising is a \"form of religious activity [that] occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.\" <i>Murdock v.

Change the Climate asserts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> that the MBTA's policy and practice have made its advertising space generally available to commercial and non-profit organizations for the expression of views by anyone willing to pay its advertising fees.

Otherwise, such a self-serving approach would allow the government to simply declare property a non-public forum whenever conflicts of this sort arose. <i>See Int'l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness v.

Similarly, the fact that a particular category of speech, such as that regarding tobacco sales, is excluded from a forum does not preclude the designation of a public forum. <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 129-30 (\"[I]t cannot be true that if the government excludes any category of speech from a forum ... that forum becomes ipso facto a non-public forum.\"). Nor does the fact that the MBTA charges a fee for the use of its advertising space preclude the creation of a designated public forum, because \"[d]espite the existence of a fee, the [government] may nevertheless have allowed indiscriminate use\" of the forum by \"anyone willing to pay.\" <i>Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v.

I begin by noting that in 1994, in <i>AIDS Action,</i> we found that the advertising policy promulgated by the MBTA was \"scarcely coherent, [and] invite[d] the very discrimination that occurred in [that] case, and was properly enjoined.\" 42 F.3d at 12. In the period between <i>AIDS Action</i> and the present litigation, from 1995 to at least 1999, the MBTA required that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ll advertisements at any time inserted or placed by the Contractor in or upon any locations or display devices shall be of a reputable character, and the appearance of all advertisements shall be acceptable to and in accordance with the [MBTA's] Standards for Character and Appearance of Advertisements. No libelous, slanderous, or obscene advertisements, may be accepted by the Contractor for display in or upon the Authority's transit facilities.

The 1999 bid specifications prohibited the display of advertisements for tobacco products and echoed the 1992 bid specifications, with the following provisions added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MBTA will not accept advertisements containing violent criminal content, firearms, profane content, promotional materials that is harmful to juveniles, and advertisements that denigrate groups based on gender, religion, race, ethnic or political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the MBTA went through two more revisions of its guidelines, as described in the majority opinion. A new set of \"Interim Guidelines Regulating MBTA Advertising,\" promulgated on April 12, 2002, provided that the MBTA \"shall not display or maintain any advertisement\" that is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Demeaning or disparaging.</i> The advertisement contains material that demeans or disparages an individual or group of individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2003, the MBTA issued yet another revision of its guidelines, removing the language concerning race, color, etc., and adding the \"prevailing community standards\" metric for determining whether material is demeaning or disparaging.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, \"the more restrictive the criteria for admission and the more administrative control over access, the less likely a forum will be deemed public.\" <i>Hopper v.

Over the years, the MBTA's criteria for admission have been confusing at best, and it has always left the initial determinations of whether advertisements may run afoul of the advertising policy to the subjective evaluation of a private contractor. Those advertisements sent to the MBTA for review have received a similarly subjective evaluation from MBTA employees. Thus, the subjective standards in these policies create a potential for abuse, specifically the potential for viewpoint discrimination. <i>See Hopper,</i> 241 F.3d at 1079 (\"The potential for abuse of such unbounded discretion is heightened by the inherently subjective nature of the standard itself.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I emphasize that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he government may not `create' a policy to implement its newly-discovered desire to suppress a particular message.

In determining whether the MBTA has designated its advertising space as a public forum, then, one cannot rely on recent attempts by the MBTA to revise its advertising policy during the course of this litigation to indicate its prior intent on the nature of its advertising space as a forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the MBTA's written policies cannot be considered without reference to their application in the years preceding this action. In determining whether the government has designated property to be a public forum, we have previously stated that \"actual practice speaks louder than words.\" <i>Grace Bible Fellowship, Inc. v. Maine Sch. Admin. Dist.

A policy purporting to keep a forum closed (or open to expression only on certain subjects) is no policy at all for purposes of public forum analysis if, in practice, it is not enforced or if exceptions are haphazardly permitted.\" <i>Hopper,</i> 241 F.3d at 1076. In <i>AIDS Action,</i> we admonished the MBTA that if it were to be allowed to restrict speech, \"it will, at the least, need to act according to neutral standards, and it will need to apply these standards in such a way that there is no appearance that `the [government] is seeking to handicap the expression of particular ideas.' \"42 F.3d at 13 (quoting <i>R.A.V.,</i> 505 U.S. at 394, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In practice, the MBTA has not restricted access to its advertising space in a manner sufficient to indicate an intent to maintain it as a non-public or limited public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we decided <i>AIDS Action,</i> we found that \"despite the MBTA's attempts to present itself as a vigilant gatekeeper, the only ads other than the 1993 [AIDS awareness] ads that we know the MBTA recently rejected are certain Calvin Klein ads which somehow might have been misconstrued as endorsing the Ku Klux Klan, and an animal rights advertisement featuring a photograph of a maimed dog.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9. In reviewing the MBTA's application of its advertising policies since <i>AIDS Action,</i> I find that little has changed. During the five years preceding Change the Climate's first interactions with PTD, between 1995 and 1999, the MBTA refused to post only fifteen advertisements. Examples include an advertisement for the movie Psycho, which featured an image of a nude woman in a shower with blood at the bottom, rejected because it was \"in conflict with the MBTA's dignity in the workplace and the Commonwealth's domestic violence programs,\" neither of which criteria are set forth in the MBTA's advertising policy. Rejection of ads also appears to have occurred on an <i>ad hoc,</i> subjective basis. For example, MBTA refused to post an advertisement from the conservation organization Surfriders, aimed at discouraging people from leaving cigarette butts on the beach, apparently because it included images of people smoking. The MBTA posted, however, advertisements for Al Italia airline that featured a woman holding a cigarette with the caption, \"Create a buzz.\" Thus, the <i>ad hoc</i> rejection of a handful of ads over the past decade cannot serve as the basis for concluding that MBTA intended its advertising space as a non-public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Nature of the Forum and Its Compatibility with Expression</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also necessary to examine \"the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern the government's intent.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The MBTA can hardly argue that its advertising space is generally incompatible with expressive activity, or that the MBTA's principal function of providing transportation would be disrupted by the expressive activity proposed by Change the Climate or Ridley, since it has routinely made its advertising space available to both commercial and public-issue advertising on a wide range of issues without any disruption. <i>See, e.g., Planned Parenthood,</i> 767 F.2d at 1232 (\"[S]ince CTA already permits its facilities to be used for public-issue and political advertising, it cannot argue that such use is incompatible with the primary use of the facilities.\").

While the primary purpose of the MBTA's advertising space may be to generate revenue, it is clear that the MBTA's policy of allowing and, in fact, encouraging non-commercial advertising (by offering a discount) demonstrates its judgment that such advertising does not conflict with its proprietary interests. <i>Air Line Pilots,</i> 45 F.3d at 1157 (finding no \"indication that permitting public interest groups to advertise would threaten the vitality of the City's commercial interests in deriving revenue from the advertising displays.\"). Having opened its advertising space for non-commercial discourse, the MBTA now wishes to act as a lawmaker, and not as a proprietor, in attempting to regulate the content of that discourse, which indicates that it has designated its advertising space a public forum. <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 129 (\"Where the government acted for the purpose of benefitting the public, ... the Court has found a public forum.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some contexts, however, limiting advertising space has been found consistent with a proprietary purpose. In <i>Uptown Pawn &amp; Jewelry, Inc. v.

Here, however, there is no evidence that posting Change the Climate's or Ridley's advertisements would have any adverse effect on the MBTA's ability to generate revenue through its advertising space, regardless of whether their messages are controversial. As previously described, the MBTA has posted a range of commercial and public-issue advertising that would undermine any argument that advertisements like those now proposed could be excluded in the interests of protecting the revenue-generating capacity of its advertising space. Here, then, \"the purpose of the forum does not suggest that it is closed, and the breadth of permitted speech points in the opposite direction.\" <i>Christ's Bride,</i> 148 F.3d at 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has considered the government's practice of excluding speech from a forum \"not because the exclusion of categories of speech creates a non-public forum, but because the <i>nature</i> of the excluded categories sheds light on whether the government was acting as a proprietor or a regulator.\" <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130; <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 805, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Lehman,</i> the Court found that the 26-year, consistently enforced ban on non-commercial advertising was consistent with the government's role as a proprietor, because \"[r]evenue earned from long-term commercial advertising could be jeopardized by a requirement that short-term candidacy or issue-oriented advertisements be displayed.\" 418 U.S. at 304, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109090\"><a href=\"/opinion/109090/lehman-v-shaker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Other courts have followed <i>Lehman</i> to hold that a total ban on non-commercial speech may be consistent with the government acting in a proprietary capacity and have found transportation advertising spaces to be non-public fora when the government \"consistently promulgates and enforces policies restricting advertising ... to commercial advertising.\" <i>Children of the Rosary v.

Allowing political speech, conversely, evidences a general intent to open a space for discourse, and a deliberate acceptance of the possibility of clashes of opinion and controversy that the Court in <i>Lehman</i> recognized as inconsistent with sound commercial practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130; <i>Lebron v.

The MBTA has no longstanding policy of prohibiting public-issue advertisements like Change the Climate's or Ridley's. While excluding political campaign speech from its advertising space, the MBTA has allowed and intentionally encouraged non-commercial advertising, including public-issue advertising regarding social issues like drugs, crime, violence, abortion, AIDS, suicide, and religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of the MBTA's Revised Interim Guidelines under which it refused to post Change the Climate's advertisements also indicate that it is acting as a regulator/lawmaker and not as a proprietor. The guidelines prohibit the posting of any advertisement that \"promotes or encourages, or appears to promote or encourage, the use or possession of unlawful or illegal goods or services,\" or unlawful conduct. The MBTA has not offered any commercial justification for its interest in prohibiting advertisements containing such material, and we see \"no commercial reason why [the MBTA] has any special interest in [preventing unlawful conduct]; [the MBTA's] interest is only the interest in upholding the law because it is the law.\" <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130. This is certainly a regulatory and not a proprietary interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have similarly found the advertising spaces of various urban transportation systems to be a designated public forum when the government has allowed \"a wide variety of commercial, public-service, public-issue, and political ads,\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 767 F.2d at 1232, \"political and other non-commercial advertising generally,\" <i>New York Magazine,</i> 136 F.3d at 130, or \"public-service, public-issue, and political advertisements in addition to traditional commercial advertisements.\" <i>United Food,</i> 163 F.3d at 346. In these cases, contrary to the majority's assertions, the agency's control over public issue advertising was not unlike that exercised by the MBTA in practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Christ's Bride,</i> the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) was deemed a designated public forum because, while SEPTA asserted its right to refuse advertising deemed \"objectionable for any reason,\" SEPTA had the \"practice of permitting virtually unlimited access to the forum.\" 148 F.3d at 251-52. The Third Circuit found that in practice \"SEPTA has exercised control over only three ads, two of which had graphics to which SEPTA objected, and one of which solicited personal injury cases that could be directed against SEPTA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United Food,</i> the Southwest Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) had rejected an advertisement under a provision of its advertising policy that prohibited \"[a]dvertising of controversial public issues that may adversely affect SORTA's ability to attract and maintain ridership.\" 163 F.3d at 352. The Sixth Circuit concluded that \"the lack of definitive standards guiding the application of SORTA's advertising policy permits SORTA, like SEPTA, to reject a proposed advertisement deemed objectionable for any reason.\" 163 F.3d at 354. Under these circumstances, the transportation authorities' contention that the advertising at issue was incompatible with the nature of the forum created by their advertising spaces could not be sustained. The Sixth Circuit's reasoning is instructive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find that SORTA's stated purpose for limiting advertising on buses only tenuously related, at best, to the greater forum's intended use. This is not a situation like that in <i>Cornelius,</i> where the government established a controlled solicitation process to prevent disruption in the workplace, or [<i>AETC</i>], where a public broadcasting system logistically could not possibly accommodate all political candidates, or even [<i>Perry</i>], where a high school had a direct interest in controlling access to its internal mail system. Here there is no established causal link between SORTA's goal of enhancing the environment for its riders, enhancing SORTA's standing in the community, and enabling SORTA to attract and maintain its ridership, and its broad-based discretion to exclude advertisements that are too controversial or not aesthetically pleasing. Although political and public-issue speech is often contentious, it does not follow that such speech will necessarily frustrate SORTA's commercial interests. Rather, it may be the case that only in rare circumstances will the controversial nature of such speech sufficiently interfere with the provision of Metro bus services so as to warrant excluding a political or public-issue advertisement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United Food,</i> 163 F.3d at 354.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the MBTA has not opened its advertising space to all public-issue advertising except that which it deems \"objectionable for any reason,\" id., but has instead promulgated written advertising policies and exercised control over a handful of advertisements in the five years prior to the events at issue here. Still, the incoherent written policies and the occasional, subjective exercise of control are insufficient to demonstrate an intent by the MBTA to close its advertising space as a public forum when it routinely posts public-issue advertisements on all manner of social issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the MBTA's policy and practice regarding its advertising space, and the nature of that space as created and managed by the MBTA, demonstrates an intent by the MBTA to create a designated public forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, I must note that, while not a sidewalk or city park, the MBTA's facilities are the modern analogue to these traditional public fora. As mentioned above, 2.5 million people in the Greater Boston area use the MBTA's facilities, and its 170 bus and trolley routes, 4 subway lines, and 13-branch commuter rail network transit at some point of their routes through or across traditional public fora. In addition to the car cards at issue in this case, the MBTA allows advertising on the outside of its vehicles, which are obviously displayed as they transit through the public streets. Some of the cars on some of the subway lines that travel above ground are even painted in such a way that the whole exterior of the car constitutes, in effect, an advertisement. The MBTA also allows advertising on the walls of the numerous bus and trolley shelters that sit on the public sidewalks and can be seen from the public thoroughfare. Thus, in addition to the traveling public, the MBTA's advertising influence reaches into those on the traditional public fora &#8212; the streets and sidewalks of Greater Boston. As stated above, this means that the MBTA is in a position to control 40,000 advertising spaces for the dissemination of information to a large segment of the region's population. It is disquieting, to say the least, that the majority would allow the government to control the content of the information to which the public is exposed through these advertising spaces. The MBTA's advertising system is indeed a powerful tool with which to influence public opinion, one which should be opened to the crucible of competing viewpoints to the largest extent possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I concur with the majority's conclusion that the MBTA engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it rejected Change the Climate's proposed advertisements, I dissent from its failure to recognize similar discrimination with regard to Ridley's advertisements. I further dissent from the majority's decision to engage in forum analysis, and from the outcome thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINING TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the majority's insistence on delving into forum analysis is perplexing, given its recognition that \"[p]ublic forum analysis itself has been criticized as unhelpful in many contexts, and particularly this one where the government is operating a commercial enterprise earning income from advertising.\" Maj. op. at 75 (<i>citing</i> Tribe, <i>supra,</i> at &#167; 2-24, at 922 (\"[W]hether or not a given place is deemed a `public forum' is ordinarily less significant than the nature of the speech restriction &#8212; despite the Court's rhetoric.\"); Frederick Schauer, <i>Principles, Institutions, and the First Amendment,</i> 112 Harv. L.Rev. 84, 97 (1998) (\"Of all of the paths down which the Court might go in dealing with the government enterprise cases, the so-called `forum doctrine' appears least satisfactory.\")).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In this way, Ridley's advertisement would be analogous to a public service announcement stating: \"Kids who smoke think they look cool, but really it makes them look stupid.\" It would be difficult to imagine the MBTA rejecting such an advertisement on the basis that it ridicules or demeans adolescent smokers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The majority's suggestion, Maj. op. at 93-95, that the vagueness inquiry is not important in this case because it does not involve a licensing scheme in a traditional public forum is unconvincing. Even if the majority is correct that this is not a traditional public forum in the legal sense, the MBTA transit system serves as its functional equivalent in today's society. 2.5 million people use its facilities on a daily basis, and it contains approximately 40,000 advertising spaces. In effect, the MBTA is in a position to control the dissemination of information to a large segment of the public which, in a practical sense, is obliged to be exposed to whatever advertising the MBTA chooses to permit in its facilities. Consequently, the \"danger of excessive discretion ... lead [ing] to viewpoint-discriminatory decisions,\"<i>id.</i> at 94, is quite serious. Further, while the majority indicates that concern about vagueness is at its zenith in licensing schemes for traditional public fora, I am aware of no precedent that would permit vagueness in regulations outside of this context, especially when the potential ramifications of unconstitutional implementation have a similar practical effect.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The rejected advertisement stated that \"[t]here are no scriptures in the Bible that teach that God set up the Catholic religion, the Baptist religion, the Pentecostal religion, the Jehovah's Witness religion or the Muslim religion.

This might be so in an isolated case. However, one cannot ignore the MBTA's haphazard and unpredictable pattern of enforcement with regard not only to Ridley's three ads, but also to earlier ads, such as those at issue in<i>AIDS Action,</i> 42 F.3d at 1. This suggests that it was no mere oversight or misunderstanding that led to the acceptance of Ridley's second advertisement. We must not allow the MBTA to change its standards or its enforcement thereof every time its application of the guidelines is challenged.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Claims of a unique holy charter and exclusive salvation are commonplace in western religion. The examples below are not dissimilar from the position espoused by Ridley in her third advertisement:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Roman Catholic Church:</i>\"This is the sole Church of Christ, which in the Creed we profess to be one, holy, catholic and apostolic.\" <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> # 811. \"There is but one holy Catholic and apostolic church, outside of which there is no salvation ... it is altogether necessary for salvation for every creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\" 1 <i>Vatican Council II</i> 364-65 (Austin Flannery, O.P., ed.).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Jehovah's Witnesses:</i>\"Consider too, the fact that Jehovah's organization alone, in all the earth, is directed by God's holy spirit or active force.\" <i>The Watchtower,</i> July 1, 1973, at 402.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon</i>): \"This is not just another Church.

This is the Church and the kingdom of God, the only true Church upon the face of the earth, according to the Lord's own words.\" Ezra Taft Benson, <i>The Teaching of Ezra Taft Benson</i> 164-5 (1988). \"Behold there are save two churches only; the one is the Church of the Lamb of God and the other is the churches of the devil; wherefore who so belongeth not to the church of the lamb of god belongeth to that great church; which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth\". <i>Book of Mormon,</i> 1 Nephi 14:10.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Islam:</i>\"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah) never will It be accepted of Him.\" <i>Qur'aan,</i> Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the MBTA guideline would prohibit even expression of the First Commandment, which admonishes believers: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" Exodus 20:3. This mandate would have to be rejected as offensive to non-Judeo-Christians because it is \"hostile\" to and \"disparages\" believers in deities other than the Judeo-Christian god.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> I again note that Ridley has<i>never</i> argued forum analysis.
