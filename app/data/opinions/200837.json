Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Harry Anduze Montaño with whom Noelma Colon-Cordoves was on\nbrief, for appellants.\n     Jose Luis González Castañer with whom Roberto Ariel Fernández,\nGonzález Castañer & Morales Cordero, Angel Muñoz Noya and Lespier,\nMuñoz Noya & Rivera were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         February 2, 2004\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          Plaintiffs-appellants Gloria\n\nGarcía and Juan Sifre appeal from a judgment dismissing their\n\nemployment discrimination lawsuit.           Questioning our jurisdiction,\n\nwe asked the parties to brief the timeliness of this appeal.            After\n\nreviewing the parties' submissions, we conclude that we lack\n\njurisdiction because the notice of appeal was untimely.\n\n                                        I.\n\n             On   March   6,   1997,    appellants    brought   this   lawsuit\n\nalleging   that     García     was   constructively   terminated    from   her\n\nemployment.       The complaint alleged that García’s employer, Frito\n\nLay Snacks Caribbean, and her supervisors, Jose Luis Prado and\n\nEnrique Niño, discriminated against her in violation of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, see 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.; the\n\nEqual Pay Act, see 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1); and the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (the “ADA”),           42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.1         On\n\nSeptember 4, 1997, the district court entered a partial judgment\n\ndismissing the suit against the supervisors because the federal\n\nanti-discrimination       statutes     do    not   provide   for   individual\n\nliability.    On March 24, 2000, after the conclusion of discovery,\n\nthe court entered a second partial judgment dismissing all of the\n\nfederal claims against Frito Lay except for appellants' ADA claim.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The complaint also alleged several claims under Puerto Rico\nstatutory and constitutional law.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            On July 12, 2001, Frito Lay filed a memorandum of law\n\nalerting    the    court   that,    in   its   view,   two    recent   appellate\n\ndecisions compelled the           dismissal of appellants' ADA claim.           On\n\nAugust 22, 2001, the court instructed Frito Lay and appellants to\n\nbrief the effect of these new decisions on the pending ADA claim.\n\nThe court treated this briefing as another motion for summary\n\njudgment.   See García v. Frito Lay Caribbean, Inc., 181 F. Supp. 2d\n\n38, 40 n.1 (D.P.R. 2001).          On December 28, 2001, the court granted\n\nFrito Lay’s motion and entered a final judgment dismissing the ADA\n\nclaim and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\n\nPuerto Rico       law   claims.     Id. at     48.     On    January   16,   2002,\n\nappellants filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, see Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 59(e), which the court denied on June 26, 2002.                     The\n\nnext day, June 27, 2002, appellants filed a notice of appeal, which\n\nwe shall assume was sufficiently specific to challenge the December\n\n28, 2001 judgment and the June 26, 2002 order denying the Rule\n\n59(e) motion.       See In re Spookyworld, 346 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n                                         II.\n\n            In every case, we are required to satisfy ourselves of\n\njurisdiction.      See Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d\n\n576, 580 (1st Cir. 1994).          As we shall explain, the jurisdictional\n\nquestion here is whether appellants' June 27, 2002 notice of appeal\n\nwas timely as to the December 28, 2001 judgment.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                 A private party in a civil case generally must file his\n\nor her notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the order\n\nor judgment from which he or she appeals.                   See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a). Compliance with this rule is \"mandatory and jurisdictional.\"\n\nBrowder v. Ill. Dep't of Corr., 434 U.S. 257, 264 (1978) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).                 However, Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(4)(A) tolls the running of this thirty-day period until after\n\nthe disposition of certain \"timely filed\" post-judgment motions,\n\nincluding a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).                    Id. (emphasis\n\nsupplied). An untimely motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e)\n\nwill       not   toll   the   running   of   the   notice    of   appeal   period.\n\nSee Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).                   Because\n\nappellants filed their notice of appeal approximately six months\n\nafter the December 28, 2001 judgment, appellate jurisdiction exists\n\nonly if the notice of appeal period was tolled by the Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion.\n\n                 Rule 59(e) provides an aggrieved party with ten days\n\nafter the entry of judgment to file a motion to alter or amend the\n\njudgment.          This ten-day period does not include intermediate\n\nweekends and \"legal holidays.\"               See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a).2         As\n\n\n       2\n           Under Rule 6(a), a \"legal holiday\" is defined as:\n\n                 New Year's Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King,\n                 Jr.,   Washington's  Birthday,   Memorial  Day,\n                 Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus      Day,\n                 Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day,\n                 and any other day appointed as a holiday by the\n\n                                         -4-\n\fnoted above, the district court entered judgment on December 28,\n\n2001.     Excluding the weekends and holidays mentioned in Rule 6(a)\n\nthat occurred during this period results in the motion being due on\n\nJanuary 15, 2002, the day before appellants filed their Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion.    The motion was therefore untimely.\n\n            Appellants do not dispute this line of analysis but\n\ncontend that New Year's Eve also should be counted as a \"legal\n\nholiday\" under Rule 6(a) because the clerk's office was closed for\n\nbusiness by order of the Chief Judge.        We disagree.   New Year's Eve\n\nis not listed in Rule 6(a), see supra at 4 n.2, and there is no\n\nrecord evidence that it was appointed a holiday by the President or\n\nCongress, or by the Governor or Legislature of Puerto Rico.          See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 6103; 1 L.P.R.A. § 71.\n\n            Appellants urge us to read Rule 6(a) to encompass days in\n\nwhich the clerk's office is closed for business by order of the\n\nChief Judge.      But the plain language of the Rule precludes such a\n\nreading.    The Rule, on its face, refers to a \"legal holiday\" as a\n\nday appointed by the President, Congress, or the relevant state.\n\nIt does not grant this power to the federal judiciary.\n\n            Our view of the matter is supported by the case law.      The\n\nTenth   Circuit    has   interpreted   the   identical   \"legal   holiday\"\n\ndefinition in Fed. R. App. P. 26 not to encompass the day after\n\n\n            President or the Congress of the United States or\n            by the state in which the district court is held.\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fThanksgiving because, even though the Kansas state courts were\n\nclosed pursuant to an order issued by the Chief Justice of Kansas,\n\nit was not a \"legal holiday\" in Kansas.   See In re Cascade Oil Co.,\n\n848 F.2d 1062, 1064 (10th Cir. 1988) (per curiam);   see also Kirby\n\nv. Gen. Elec. Co., 2000 WL 33917974, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Feb. 9, 2000),\n\naff'd, 2001 WL 1187957 (4th Cir. Oct. 9, 2001) (holding that\n\nChristmas Eve and New Year's Eve were not \"legal holidays\" under\n\nRule 6(a) even though the district court was closed pursuant to\n\nadministrative order on both days); cf. Reyes-Cardona v. J.C. Penny\n\nCo., 690 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982) (holding that day honoring Eugenio\n\nMaría de Hostos is \"legal holiday\" under Rule 6(a) because it is\n\ndeclared a holiday under the statutes of Puerto Rico) (per curiam).\n\nOur conclusion is also supported by the fact that jurisdictions\n\nwishing to count the days on which the clerk's office is closed as\n\nlegal holidays have enacted local rules to this effect.         For\n\nexample, instead of relying on the \"legal holiday\" definition\n\ncontained in the Federal Rules, the Federal Circuit has adopted a\n\nlocal rule stating that \"[l]egal holiday also means a day on which\n\nthe clerk's office is closed by order of the court or the chief\n\njudge.\"   See Fed. Cir. L.R. 26(a) (emphasis supplied).\n\n          Appellants make two additional arguments in an attempt to\n\nsave their appeal.   First, they claim that their Rule 59(e) motion\n\nshould be treated as timely because they spoke with an unnamed\n\nindividual in the clerk's office who told them that New Year's Eve\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fwas a holiday.    Second, they contend that we should ignore the late\n\nnotice of appeal because the district court addressed the Rule\n\n59(e) motion on its merits.               We are not persuaded by either\n\nargument.\n\n            In making their first argument, appellants invoke the\n\ndoctrine of \"unique circumstances.\"             This judge-made doctrine\n\npermits the court to entertain a late-filed appeal in certain\n\ncases.   See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation,\n\nInc., 26 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir. 1994).              The doctrine was first\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court in Thompson v. INS, 375 U.S. 384\n\n(1964)   (per    curiam),     but   its    continuing   vitality      has    been\n\nquestioned,     see Davignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (citing cases).         In any event, this Circuit continues to\n\napply the doctrine, but only in rare situations.               See Scola v.\n\nBeaulieu, 131 F.3d 1073, 1074-75 (1st Cir. 1997); Air Line Pilots,\n\n26 F.3d at 225; United States v. Heller, 957 F.2d 26, 28-29 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).\n\n            To the extent it remains viable, the doctrine \"applies\n\nonly where a party has performed an act which, if properly done,\n\nwould postpone     the   deadline    for    filing   [the]   appeal    and    has\n\nreceived specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has\n\nbeen properly done.\"        Osterneck v. Ernst & Whitney, 489 U.S. 169,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f179 (1989).3    Under this standard, appellants' contention that we\n\ncould entertain their appeal because \"the person who answered the\n\nphone [in the clerk's office] advised that December 31, 2001 would\n\nbe a holiday” fails for two reasons.\n\n          First, appellants were never told that, because December\n\n31, 2001, was a holiday, the time for filing their Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion would be extended.     They were told only that the clerk's\n\noffice was closed for New Year's Eve.       Thus, appellants never\n\nreceived the required \"specific assurance\" that their motion would\n\nbe timely if filed on January 16, 2002.   See Osterneck, 489 U.S. at\n\n178-79 (rejecting unique circumstances claim where court never\n\naffirmatively represented to plaintiffs that their appeal was\n\ntimely filed); Heller, 957 F.2d at 29 (stating that courts apply\n\nunique circumstances doctrine \"only where a court has affirmatively\n\nassured a party that [its motion] will be timely\").         Second,\n\nappellants did not receive any \"assurance\" from a judicial officer.\n\nSee Heller, 957 F.2d at 29 (the unique circumstances doctrine\n\nrequires that the assurance be made by \"a judge, not an employee in\n\nthe office of the clerk”). Thus, the unique circumstances doctrine\n\nsimply does not apply.    Id. at 31.\n\n               In presenting their second argument, appellants ask\n\n\n\n     3\n       The court's actions or statements also must have occurred at\na point when, had the party not been led astray, it would have been\nable to file a timely notice of appeal. See Airline Pilots, 26\nF.3d at 225; Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 20.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthat we follow City of Hartford v. Chase, 942 F.2d 130, 134 (2d\n\nCir. 1991) (\"[B]ecause the district court entertained the [Rule\n\n59(e)] motion and ruled on its merits, the time for appeal may\n\nbegin to run anew from the date on which the court disposed of the\n\nuntimely application.\") (internal quotations marks omitted).    We\n\ndecline to follow Chase for several reasons.\n\n          First is the Supreme Court's decision in Browder. There,\n\nthe Court held that a late-filed motion under Rule 59(e) did not\n\ntoll the running of the notice of appeal period even though the\n\ndistrict court adjudicated the motion on its merits.   See Browder,\n\n434 U.S. at 262. Second, Chase is inconsistent with our precedent.\n\nWe have held that \"an untimely motion for reconsideration . . .\n\n[is] a nullity and [will] not toll the time in which to appeal even\n\nthough the court considered and denied the motion on its merits.\"\n\nFeinstein, 951 F.2d at 18 (quoting Flint v. Howard, 464 F.2d 1084,\n\n1086 (1st Cir. 1972)).    Third, Chase has been criticized by a\n\nleading treatise as representing \"an unusually casual view\" of the\n\nrule that notices of appeal must be timely filed.       Charles A.\n\nWright, Arthur R. Miller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 3950.4 at 177 n.11 (1999). Finally, the Second Circuit\n\nhas disavowed the broad language in Chase and has declined to\n\nextend it beyond its particular facts.     See Camacho v. City of\n\nYonkers, 236 F.3d 112, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f                                      III.\n\n                While we lack jurisdiction over the appeal from the\n\nDecember 28, 2001, judgment, we have jurisdiction over the appeal\n\nfrom the June 26, 2002 order denying appellants' Rule 59(e) motion.\n\nSee Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 21.          But, as we have just explained,\n\nthat motion was untimely.       Because the district court lacked the\n\npower to grant this motion, see Vargas v. Gonzalez, 975 F.2d 916,\n\n917 (1st Cir. 1992), appellants' challenge to the denial of the\n\nmotion is doomed.      See, e.g., Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez, 22\n\nF.3d 384, 390 (1st Cir. 1994); Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 21; Rodriguez-\n\nAntuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).4\n\n                                      IV.\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we dismiss appellants'\n\nappeal from the district court’s December 28, 2001, judgment and\n\naffirm    the    district   court's     June   26,   2002,   order   denying\n\nappellants’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We are, of course, free to affirm the district court’s order\non any reason supported by the record. Feinstein, 951 F.2d at 21\nn.6 (citing Rodriguez-Antuna, 871 F.2d at 3).\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

We disagree. New Year's Eve is not listed in Rule 6(a), <i>see supra</i> at 4 n. 2, and there is no record evidence that it was appointed a holiday by the President or Congress, or by the Governor or Legislature of Puerto Rico. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 6103; 1 L.P.R.A. &#167; 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants urge us to read Rule 6(a) to encompass days in which the clerk's office is closed for business by order of the Chief Judge.

The Tenth Circuit has interpreted the identical \"legal holiday\" definition in Fed. R.App. P. 26 not to encompass the day after Thanksgiving because, even though the Kansas state courts were closed pursuant to an order issued by the Chief Justice of Kansas, it was not a \"legal holiday\" in Kansas. <i>See In re Cascade Oil Co.,</i> 848 F.2d 1062, 1064 (10th Cir.1988) (per curiam); <i>see also Kirby v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 2000 WL 33917974, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Feb.9, 2000), <i>aff'd,</i> 2001 WL 1187957 (4th Cir. Oct.9, 2001) (holding that Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve were not \"legal holidays\" under Rule 6(a) even though the district court was closed pursuant to administrative order on both days); <i>cf. Reyes-Cardona v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 690 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1982) (holding that day honoring Eugenio Mar&#237;a de Hostos is \"legal holiday\" under Rule 6(a) because it is declared a holiday under the statutes of Puerto Rico) (per curiam). Our conclusion is also supported by the fact that jurisdictions wishing to count the days on which the clerk's office is closed as legal holidays have enacted local rules to this effect. For example, instead of relying on the \"legal holiday\" definition contained in the Federal Rules, the Federal Circuit has adopted a local rule stating that \"[l]egal holiday <i>also</i> means a day on which the clerk's office is closed by order of the court or the chief judge.\" <i>See</i> Fed. Cir. L.R. 26(a) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make two additional arguments in an attempt to save their appeal. First, they claim that their Rule 59(e) motion should be treated as timely because they spoke with an unnamed individual in the clerk's office who told them that New Year's Eve was a holiday. Second, they contend that we should ignore the late notice of appeal because the district court addressed the Rule 59(e) motion on its merits. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making their first argument, appellants invoke the doctrine of \"unique circumstances.\" This judge-made doctrine permits the court to entertain a late-filed appeal in certain cases. <i>See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,</i> 26 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir.1994). The doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court in <i>Thompson v. INS,</i> 375 U.S. 384, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964) (per curiam), but its continuing vitality has been questioned, <i>see Davignon v. Clemmey,</i> 322 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003) (citing cases). In any event, this Circuit continues to apply the doctrine, but only in rare situations. <i>See Scola v. Beaulieu,</i> 131 F.3d 1073, 1074-75 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Air Line Pilots,</i> 26 F.3d at 225; <i>United States v. Heller,</i> 957 F.2d 26, 28-29 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent it remains viable, the doctrine \"applies only where a party has performed an act which, if properly done, would postpone the deadline for filing [the] appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done.\" <i>Osterneck v. Ernst &amp; Whitney,</i> 489 U.S. 169, 179, 109 S.Ct. 987, 103 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Under this standard, appellants' contention that we could entertain their appeal because \"the person who answered the phone [in the clerk's office] advised that December 31, 2001 would be a holiday\" fails for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellants were never told that, because December 31, 2001, was a holiday, the time for filing their Rule 59(e) motion would be extended. They were told only that the clerk's office was closed for New Year's Eve. Thus, appellants never received the required \"specific assurance\" that their motion would be timely if filed on January 16, 2002. <i>See Osterneck,</i> 489 U.S. at 178-79, 109 S.Ct. 987 (rejecting unique circumstances claim where court never affirmatively represented to plaintiffs that their appeal was timely filed); <i>Heller,</i> 957 F.2d at 29 (stating that courts apply unique circumstances doctrine \"only where a court has affirmatively assured a party that [its motion] will be timely\"). Second, appellants did not receive any \"assurance\" from a judicial officer. <i>See Heller,</i> 957 F.2d at 29 (the unique circumstances doctrine requires that the assurance be made by \"a judge, not an employee in the office of the clerk\"). Thus, the unique circumstances doctrine simply does not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In presenting their second argument, appellants ask that we follow <i>City of Hartford v. Chase,</i> 942 F.2d 130, 134 (2d Cir.1991) (\"[B]ecause the district court entertained the [Rule 59(e)] motion and ruled on its merits, the time for appeal may begin to run anew from the date on which the court disposed of the untimely application.\") (internal quotations marks omitted). We decline to follow <i>Chase</i> for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First is the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Browder.</i> There, the Court held that a late-filed motion under Rule 59(e) did not toll the running of the notice of appeal period even though the district court adjudicated the motion on its merits. <i>See Browder,</i> 434 U.S. at 262, 98 S.Ct. 556. Second, <i>Chase</i> is inconsistent with our precedent. We have held that \"an untimely motion for reconsideration ... [is] a nullity and [will] not toll the time in which to appeal even though the court considered and denied the motion on its merits.\" <i>Feinstein,</i> 951 F.2d at 18 (quoting <i>Flint v. Howard,</i> 464 F.2d 1084, 1086 (1st Cir. 1972)). Third, <i>Chase</i> has been criticized by a leading treatise as representing \"an unusually casual view\" of the rule that notices of appeal must be timely filed. 16A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3950.4 at 177 n. 11 (1999). Finally, the Second Circuit has disavowed the broad language in <i>Chase</i> and has declined to extend it beyond its particular facts. <i>See Camacho v. City of Yonkers,</i> 236 F.3d 112, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we lack jurisdiction over the appeal from the December 28, 2001, judgment, we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the June 26, 2002 order denying appellants' Rule 59(e) motion. <i>See Feinstein,</i> 951 F.2d at 21. But, as we have just explained, that motion was untimely. Because the district court lacked the power to grant this motion, <i>see Vargas v. Gonzalez,</i> 975 F.2d 916, 917 (1st Cir.1992), appellants' challenge to the denial of the motion is doomed. <i>See, e.g., Acevedo-Villalobos v.

Oct.9, 2001) (holding that Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve were not \"legal holidays\" under Rule 6(a) even though the district court was closed pursuant to administrative order on both days); <i>cf. Reyes-Cardona v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span> (1st Cir.1982) (holding that day honoring Eugenio Mar&#237;a de Hostos is \"legal holiday\" under Rule 6(a) because it is declared a holiday under the statutes of Puerto Rico) (per curiam). Our conclusion is also supported by the fact that jurisdictions wishing to count the days on which the clerk's office is closed as legal holidays have enacted local rules to this effect. For example, instead of relying on the \"legal holiday\" definition contained in the Federal Rules, the Federal Circuit has adopted a local rule stating that \"[l]egal holiday <i>also</i> means a day on which the clerk's office is closed by order of the court or the chief judge.\" <i>See</i> Fed. Cir. L.R. 26(a) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make two additional arguments in an attempt to save their appeal. First, they claim that their Rule 59(e) motion should be treated as timely because they spoke with an unnamed individual in the clerk's office who told them that New Year's Eve was a holiday. Second, they contend that we should ignore the late notice of appeal because the district court addressed the Rule 59(e) motion on its merits. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making their first argument, appellants invoke the doctrine of \"unique circumstances.\" This judge-made doctrine permits the court to entertain a late-filed appeal in certain cases. <i>See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672031\"><a href=\"/opinion/672031/air-line-pilots-association-v-precision-valley-aviation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1994).

In any event, this Circuit continues to apply the doctrine, but only in rare situations. <i>See Scola v.

They were told only that the clerk's office was closed for New Year's Eve. Thus, appellants never received the required \"specific assurance\" that their motion would be timely if filed on January 16, 2002. <i>See Osterneck,</i> 489 U.S. at 178-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112200\"><a href=\"/opinion/112200/osterneck-v-ernst-whinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span> (rejecting unique circumstances claim where court never affirmatively represented to plaintiffs that their appeal was timely filed); <i>Heller,</i> 957 F.2d at 29 (stating that courts apply unique circumstances doctrine \"only where a court has affirmatively assured a party that [its motion] will be timely\"). Second, appellants did not receive any \"assurance\" from a judicial officer. <i>See Heller,</i> 957 F.2d at 29 (the unique circumstances doctrine requires that the assurance be made by \"a judge, not an employee in the office of the clerk\"). Thus, the unique circumstances doctrine simply does not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In presenting their second argument, appellants ask that we follow <i>City of Hartford v. Chase,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566811\"><a href=\"/opinion/566811/city-of-hartford-v-david-t-chase-chase-family-partnership-one-corporate/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 134 (2d Cir.1991) (\"[B]ecause the district court entertained the [Rule 59(e)] motion and ruled on its merits, the time for appeal may begin to run anew from the date on which the court disposed of the untimely application.\") (internal quotations marks omitted). We decline to follow <i>Chase</i> for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First is the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Browder.</i> There, the Court held that a late-filed motion under Rule 59(e) did not toll the running of the notice of appeal period even though the district court adjudicated the motion on its merits. <i>See Browder,</i> 434 U.S. at 262, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109761\"><a href=\"/opinion/109761/browder-v-director-dept-of-corrections-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span>. Second, <i>Chase</i> is inconsistent with our precedent. We have held that \"an untimely motion for reconsideration ... [is] a nullity and [will] not toll the time in which to appeal even though the court considered and denied the motion on its merits.\" <i>Feinstein,</i> 951 F.2d at 18 (quoting <i>Flint v. Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304971\"><a href=\"/opinion/304971/robert-w-flint-jr-v-francis-howard-warden-adult-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span>, 1086 (1st Cir. 1972)). Third, <i>Chase</i> has been criticized by a leading treatise as representing \"an unusually casual view\" of the rule that notices of appeal must be timely filed. 16A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3950.4 at 177 n. 11 (1999). Finally, the Second Circuit has disavowed the broad language in <i>Chase</i> and has declined to extend it beyond its particular facts. <i>See Camacho v. City of Yonkers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771575\"><a href=\"/opinion/771575/martin-camacho-v-city-of-yonkers-new-york-symra-d-brandon-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we lack jurisdiction over the appeal from the December 28, 2001, judgment, we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the June 26, 2002 order denying appellants' Rule 59(e) motion. <i>See Feinstein,</i> 951 F.2d at 21. But, as we have just explained, that motion was untimely. Because the district court lacked the power to grant this motion, <i>see Vargas v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591125\"><a href=\"/opinion/591125/pedro-c-vargas-v-leonardo-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span>, 917 (1st Cir.1992), appellants' challenge to the denial of the motion is doomed. <i>See, e.g., Acevedo-Villalobos v.
