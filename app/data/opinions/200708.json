Miguel Rosa-Ortiz pleaded guilty\n\nin federal court to conspiracy to violate the Federal Escape Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 751(a), which criminalizes escape and attempted escape\n\nby persons who are in federal custody under specified conditions --\n\nincluding, as the statute pertains to this case, persons in custody\n\n\"by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any\n\noffense.\"       But no court of appeals may uphold a plea of guilty to\n\nconduct that is not within the crime charged.               On appeal, Rosa-\n\nOrtiz says that § 751(a) does not prohibit the conduct alleged in\n\nthe indictment.        We agree.\n\n               The conspiracy charge was based on evidence that Rosa-\n\nOrtiz       helped   his   co-defendant,     Maximiliano   Amparo-Concepción,\n\nattempt to escape from federal prison in Puerto Rico.             Yet not all\n\nescapes from federal custody violate § 751(a).              We conclude that\n\nAmparo-Concepción was not in federal custody \"by virtue of an\n\narrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any offense\"\n\n(whether state or federal), but instead solely by virtue of his\n\ndetention on a federal material witness warrant.               Cf. 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3144.        By its own terms, the Federal Escape Act does not\n\nproscribe escapes under such circumstances,1 which means that Rosa-\n\n\n\n\n        1\n       For this reason, we also vacate today Amparo-Concepción's\nconspiracy conviction following his guilty plea in the companion\ncase to this appeal, United States v. Amparo-Concepción, No. 02-\n1935.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fOrtiz    cannot   be   guilty   of   conspiring   to   violate   that   Act.2\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand with\n\ninstructions to dismiss the indictment.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            On February 7, 2001, a federal grand jury returned an\n\nindictment against Rosa-Ortiz and four co-conspirators, including\n\nAmparo-Concepción, for conspiracy to violate § 751(a).3           According\n\nto the government's summary of the facts, which was attached to the\n\nplea agreement and acknowledged by Rosa-Ortiz in writing, the\n\ndefendants plotted to free Amparo-Concepción from the federal\n\nMetropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Puerto Rico.              The escape\n\nplan involved smuggling a bar-cutting tool into the MDC, meeting\n\nAmparo-Concepción outside the prison with a getaway car and a\n\nchange of clothes, and then fleeing to the Dominican Republic.\n\nRosa-Ortiz's role was to obtain the getaway car, recruit others to\n\nhelp, handle funds sent from the Dominican Republic to finance the\n\nescape, and coordinate an advance trip to the perimeter of the MDC\n\nso that Amparo-Concepción could identify the chosen getaway car.\n\nRosa-Ortiz did in fact act on most of these plans, including\n\n\n\n     2\n      This does not mean that Rosa-Ortiz's conduct did not violate\nsome other federal statute. We hold only that the indictment did\nnot validly allege a conspiracy to violate § 751(a).\n     3\n        The indictment also charged Rosa-Ortiz and three co-\ndefendants with aiding and abetting escape under 18 U.S.C. §§\n752(a) and 2, but that count was later dismissed against Rosa-Ortiz\npursuant to his plea agreement.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdriving the getaway car to the perimeter of the MDC on February 3,\n\n2001.    The FBI foiled the plot.\n\n              At the time of the escape attempt, Amparo-Concepción was\n\nbeing held at the MDC pursuant to a material witness warrant issued\n\non December 7, 2000 by the federal district court in Puerto Rico.\n\nCf. § 3144 (authorizing, in limited circumstances, the detention of\n\na witness whose testimony is material to a criminal proceeding).\n\nUntil that time, Amparo-Concepción had been serving a sentence in\n\na Puerto Rico jail for bank fraud, a felony under Puerto Rico law.\n\nWhile    in   the   custody   of   the   Commonwealth,       Amparo-Concepción\n\nvoluntarily      contacted    federal        authorities    with    information\n\nconcerning a scheme among his fellow inmates to use fraudulent\n\nimmigration documents and faked Supreme Court orders to obtain\n\npremature release. Federal investigators became interested in this\n\ninformation and obtained the material witness warrant for Amparo-\n\nConcepción's transfer to federal custody.4              It was on that basis\n\nalone that Amparo-Concepción was moved from the Commonwealth jail\n\nto the MDC; the government does not contend that any other ground\n\nexisted for Amparo-Concepción's detention by federal authorities.\n\n              On April 17, 2002, Rosa-Ortiz pleaded guilty to the\n\ncharged conspiracy      to    violate    §    751(a).      The   district   court\n\n\n\n     4\n       The record does not reveal why federal authorities preferred\nto have Amparo-Concepción in federal custody, rather than allow him\nto remain incarcerated in the Puerto Rico system until his\ntestimony became necessary.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsentenced him to fifteen months in prison, plus a supervised\n\nrelease term of three years and a special monetary assessment of\n\n$100.     On appeal, Rosa-Ortiz contends that § 751(a) does not\n\nprohibit escape or attempted escape from federal material witness\n\ndetention.      If Amparo-Concepción's escape attempt did not violate\n\n§ 751(a), then Rosa-Ortiz did not conspire to \"commit [that]\n\noffense against the United States,\" 18 U.S.C. § 371, and his\n\nconviction cannot stand.5\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.    Waiver\n\n             The merits of Rosa-Ortiz's appeal are properly before us.\n\nIn its brief, the United States contended that Rosa-Ortiz waived\n\nhis     right   to   challenge   the    indictment   when   he   entered   an\n\nunconditional plea of guilty. See United States v. Lujan, 324 F.3d\n\n27, 30 (1st Cir. 2003) (a guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional\n\nchallenges to a criminal conviction).         At oral argument, however,\n\nthe government correctly acknowledged that Rosa-Ortiz's guilty plea\n\ndoes not preclude him from arguing on appeal that the statute of\n\nconviction does not actually proscribe the conduct charged in the\n\nindictment.      As this court has explained, \"a federal court has\n\njurisdiction to try criminal cases only when the information or\n\n\n      5\n         Rosa-Ortiz   also   challenges   the    district   court's\ninterpretation of U.S.S.G. § 2P1.1(a), which governs sentencing for\nescape offenses. Because we hold that Rosa-Ortiz's conduct was not\na crime within the statute of conviction, however, we do not reach\nthe sentencing issue.\n\n                                       -5-\n\findictment alleges a violation of a valid federal law.\"                      United\n\nStates v. Saade, 652 F.2d 1126, 1134 (1st Cir. 1981).                     A federal\n\ncourt    similarly    lacks    jurisdiction        to   enter    a    judgment   of\n\nconviction when the indictment charges no offense under federal law\n\nwhatsoever.    See United States v. Peter, 310 F.3d 709, 713 (11th\n\nCir. 2002) (\"[A] district court is without jurisdiction to accept\n\na guilty plea to a 'non-offense.'\"); United States v. Andrade, 83\n\nF.3d 729, 731 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (same).\n\n            Because jurisdictional challenges to an indictment may be\n\nraised at any time, Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B), including for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292,\n\n309 (1st Cir. 2000), Rosa-Ortiz's guilty plea did not waive his\n\nright to argue that he has been imprisoned for conduct that\n\nCongress did not proscribe in the crime charged.6\n\nB.   Interpretation of § 751(a)\n\n            This     case     presents   a     pure      issue       of   statutory\n\ninterpretation, which we review de novo.                United States v. Molak,\n\n276 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            As in any matter of statutory interpretation, the text of\n\nthe statute is our starting point.           Id.   In relevant part, § 751(a)\n\nprovides:\n\n\n\n     6\n       Cf. Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61, 63 n.2 (1975) (per\ncuriam) (\"[A] plea of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim\nthat –- judged on its face –- the charge is one which the State may\nnot constitutionally prosecute.\").\n\n                                     -6-\n\f     Whoever escapes or attempts to escape from the custody of\n     the Attorney General or his authorized representative, or\n     from any institution or facility in which he is confined\n     by direction of the Attorney General, or from any custody\n     under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws\n     of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate\n     judge, or from the custody of an officer or employee of\n     the United States pursuant to lawful arrest, shall, if\n     the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on\n     a charge of felony, or conviction of any offense, be\n     fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than\n     five years, or both . . . .\n\nThis circuit has never had occasion to consider the elements of an\n\noffense under § 751(a).\n\n          The broad preamble text, which purports to cover any\n\nperson who escapes \"from any custody under . . . any process issued\n\n. . . by any court,\" plainly would encompass Amparo-Concepción's\n\nescape from federal material witness detention.      The preamble,\n\nhowever, has consistently been held not to define all of the\n\nelements of the offense, and we agree.     Rather, because of the\n\nnarrower sentencing terms of the statute,7 the government must\n\n\n     7\n       Notwithstanding its sweeping preamble, § 751(a) creates two\ncategories of punishable offense, each defined by the legal basis\nfor the escapee's federal custody:\n\n     [The escapee] shall, [1] if the custody or confinement is\n     by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or\n     conviction of any offense, be fined under this title or\n     imprisoned not more than five years, or both; or [2] if\n     the custody or confinement is for extradition, or for\n     exclusion or expulsion proceedings under the immigration\n     laws, or by virtue of an arrest or charge of or for a\n     misdemeanor, and prior to conviction, be fined under this\n     title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\n§ 751(a) (emphasis added).   Only the first is involved in this\ncase. But because of the differing penalties, the indictment must\n\n                               -7-\n\fprove one    of   the   enumerated   bases   for   the   escapee's   federal\n\ncustody.    See United States v. Richardson, 687 F.2d 952, 954-62\n\n(7th Cir. 1982) (discussing § 751(a) and its history at length);\n\nsee also United States v. Patterson, 230 F.3d 1168, 1172 n.2 (9th\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Evans, 159 F.3d 908, 910 (4th Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Vanover, 888 F.2d 1117, 1121 (6th Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n            Accordingly,    courts   have    distilled    three   essential\n\nelements of the offense of escape under § 751(a):\n\n     (1)    escape or attempted escape;\n     (2)    from the custody of the Attorney General or his\n            appointed representative, or from a place where the\n            defendant is confined at the direction of the\n            Attorney General;\n     (3)    where the custody is by virtue of\n            (i)    arrest on a charge of felony; or\n            (ii)   conviction of any offense.8\n\nSee Evans, 159 F.3d at 910; Vanover, 888 F.2d at 1121; United\n\nStates v. Edrington, 726 F.2d 1029, 1031 (5th Cir. 1984).               The\n\ngovernment acknowledges these elements.        The dispute in this case\n\ninvolves only the third element.\n\n\n\n\nstate, and the government must prove, the basis for the escapee's\nfederal custody. United States v. Vanover, 888 F.2d 1117, 1121\n(6th Cir. 1989); United States v. Richardson, 687 F.2d 952, 954-62\n(7th Cir. 1982).\n     8\n       These are the elements of a § 751(a) offense bearing a\nstatutory maximum sentence of five years.   The elements of the\nlesser offense under § 751(a) are analogous, with the specified\nbases for federal custody, listed in the disjunctive, comprising\nthe third element.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           Whether   and   in    what   circumstances   §    751(a)   reaches\n\nescapes from material witness detention under 18 U.S.C. § 3144\n\nappears to be a question of first impression in the courts of\n\nappeals.    The United States concedes that Amparo-Concepción's\n\narrest on a material witness warrant did not, by itself, constitute\n\n\"an arrest on a charge of felony\" or a \"conviction of any offense.\"\n\nThe government argues, however, that because Amparo-Concepción had\n\nalready been convicted of a felony and incarcerated when he was\n\ntransferred to federal custody, he was in federal custody \"by\n\nvirtue of conviction of any offense\" and is therefore subject to\n\nprosecution under § 751(a).9            The conviction in question, the\n\ngovernment urges, need not be a federal conviction.\n\n           There are several flaws in the government's reasoning.\n\nFirst, even   assuming     the   government   is   correct    that    a   state\n\nconviction may satisfy the \"conviction of any offense\" clause of\n\n§ 751(a) in appropriate circumstances,10 the statute unequivocally\n\nrequires that the escapee be in federal custody \"by virtue of\" that\n\n\n     9\n       Section § 751 does not prohibit escapes by state prisoners\nfrom state custody. United States v. Depew, 977 F.2d 1412, 1413\n(10th Cir. 1992) (\"Section 751 was not intended by Congress to\napply to persons who merely escape from state custody.\"); United\nStates v. Howard, 654 F.2d 522, 525 (8th Cir. 1981) (similar).\n     10\n       We do not decide this issue. Compare Derengowski v. United\nStates, 404 F.2d 778, 781 (8th Cir. 1968) (\"We cannot reasonably\nfind that Congress intended 'any offense' to mean 'federal offense'\nonly.\"), with United States v. Edrington, 726 F.2d 1029, 1031 (5th\nCir. 1984) (indictment under § 751(a) must allege that the escapee\nwas held \"pursuant to conviction of an identified federal offense\"\n(emphasis added)).\n\n                                    -9-\n\fconviction.       §   751(a);   see   Richardson,    687     F.2d    at    966-67\n\n(reversing     escape   conviction    under   §   751(a)    for    insufficient\n\nevidence   that   the   defendant's     custody    was     \"by    virtue   of\"   a\n\nconviction of any offense).       The statutory phrase \"by virtue of,\"\n\nby its plain meaning, suggests a but-for causation test.                      See\n\nWebster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 307 (defining \"by virtue of\"\n\nto mean \"by reason of\" or \"as a result of\"); Black's Law Dictionary\n\n201 (6th ed. 1990) (\"By force of, by authority of, by reason of.\n\nBecause of, through, or in pursuance of\" (citations omitted)).\n\nCourts have applied the requirement in precisely this fashion.\n\nSee, e.g., Patterson, 230 F.3d at 1171 (holding that supervised\n\nrelease constitutes custody \"by virtue of\" the original conviction\n\nbecause the defendant would not have been on supervised release\n\n\"but for\" the underlying conviction); Evans, 159 F.3d at 913\n\n(similar); Derengowski v. United States, 404 F.2d 778, 781-82 (8th\n\nCir. 1968)     (federal custody was \"by virtue of\" defendant's arrest\n\non   federal    criminal    charges     because    \"but      for    defendant's\n\narrest . . . he would never have been in federal custody\").\n\n             Amparo-Concepción was not in federal custody \"by virtue\n\nof\" his Puerto Rico felony conviction.            The United States cannot\n\nand does not claim that but for Amparo-Concepción's conviction\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, he would not have been detained as a\n\nmaterial witness.       The material witness statute does not require\n\nthat the detained witness have an antecedent state conviction.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f§ 3144.   Further, the United States makes no argument that there is\n\na logical nexus between Amparo-Concepción's bank fraud conviction\n\nin the Puerto Rico courts and the material witness warrant for his\n\narrest -- indeed, the government conceded at oral argument that the\n\ntwo are unrelated.        According to the uncontroverted facts recited\n\nby defense counsel at Rosa-Ortiz's sentencing, Amparo-Concepción\n\nvoluntarily contacted federal authorities to offer information\n\nregarding    the   use     of   fraudulent      immigration    documents   in,\n\nironically, prison escape schemes.            The federal government became\n\ninterested    in   this    information    and    ordered   Amparo-Concepción\n\ndetained to ensure that his testimony would remain available as the\n\ninvestigation proceeded.          The fact that Amparo-Concepción was\n\nalready in a Puerto Rico jail at the time did not logically or\n\nlegally enable his federal arrest –- it merely made him easier to\n\nlocate.     The material witness warrant could just as easily have\n\nissued on the same application if Amparo-Concepción had been free\n\non the streets of San Juan; indeed, there was less reason for the\n\nfederal court to issue the warrant here because Amparo-Concepción\n\nwas already detained by local authorities.             Accordingly, Amparo-\n\nConcepción was not in federal custody \"by virtue of\" a conviction\n\nof any offense, and his attempted escape from that custody did not\n\nviolate § 751(a).\n\n            This   explains      why    the     government's    reliance   on\n\nDerengowski is misplaced.          In Derengowski, the defendant was\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconvicted of armed robbery in state court and imprisoned in a state\n\nfacility.   404 F.2d at 779.    Two years later, while still in state\n\ncustody, he was indicted on federal charges and transferred to\n\nfederal    court   for   arraignment.     The   federal    indictment    was\n\nsubsequently   dismissed.      While    awaiting   his    return   to   state\n\ncustody, the defendant attempted to escape.        Id.    In upholding his\n\nconviction under § 751, the Eighth Circuit emphasized that although\n\nthe federal charges had been dismissed before the defendant tried\n\nto escape, the defendant was nevertheless in federal custody \"'by\n\nvirtue of an arrest on a charge of felony' within the provisions of\n\n§ 751 (i.e., but for defendant's arrest on the federal felony\n\ncharges he would never have been in federal custody).\"         Id. at 781-\n\n82.   The same simply cannot be said of Amparo-Concepción:               his\n\nPuerto Rico conviction was not a but-for cause of his federal\n\ndetention.11\n\n            Moreover, the government's interpretation of § 751 would\n\nrequire us to conclude that Congress outlawed escapes from material\n\n\n\n      11\n         The dissent would rely on Derengowski nonetheless,\ncharacterizing the Eighth Circuit's interpretation of the \"by\nvirtue of\" language in § 751 as \"dicta\" and an \"alternative\nholding.\"   This objection does not address the merits of our\ninterpretation of the \"by virtue of\" clause. Nor does the primary\nholding of Derengowski help the dissent. Derengowski held that the\n\"conviction of any offense\" language in § 751 may be satisfied by\nstate convictions. See 404 F.2d at 781. We do not decide that\nquestion today. See supra note 10. Even assuming that Derengowski\nis correct, though, the federal custody must still be \"by virtue\nof\" the state conviction. Nothing in Derengowski obviates that\nstatutory requirement.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fwitness detention by persons transferred from state prison, but not\n\nescapes    from    material      witness    detention     by     persons    otherwise\n\ndetained. Such a distinction would not be irrational; we simply do\n\nnot find it in the language of the statute.                         Section 751(a)\n\ncontains no reference to \"transfers\" between state and federal\n\ncustody.    As the government itself points out, the text of the\n\nstatute draws no distinction between state and federal offenses or\n\nconvictions.        In    short,    there    is    no   textual     basis    for    the\n\ngovernment's interpretation of § 751(a).\n\n            Absent a textual basis for the government's argument,\n\nconcerns for lenity and due process compel us to reject it.                         See\n\nDowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 214 (1985) (\"[W]hen choice\n\nhas to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has\n\nmade a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher\n\nalternative,      to   require     that    Congress      should    have    spoken    in\n\nlanguage that is clear and definite.\"); see also Bryan v. United\n\nStates,    524    U.S.    184,     205    (1998)    (Scalia,      J.,     dissenting)\n\n(\"[A]mbiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be\n\nresolved in       favor   of   lenity.\").          We   reject    the   government's\n\nargument and hold that § 751(a), by its terms, does not apply to\n\npersons held in federal custody solely by virtue of a material\n\nwitness warrant.\n\n            The dissent would grant this conclusion but hold that\n\nAmparo-Concepción was actually in federal custody \"by virtue of\"\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fhis Puerto Rico conviction.       The dissent reaches this conclusion\n\nbased on an argument never raised by the government:              that but for\n\nhis Puerto Rico conviction, Amparo-Concepción would have been\n\n\"entitled\" to release under 18 U.S.C. § 3142, the statute governing\n\npretrial release of criminal defendants.           See § 3144 (authorizing\n\na judicial officer to \"order the arrest of [a material witness] and\n\ntreat the person in accordance with section 3142 of this title\").\n\nImplicit in   this   argument     is    the   assumption   that    if   Amparo-\n\nConcepción had been so released, he would no longer have been in\n\nfederal custody within the meaning of § 751.\n\n          We will assume arguendo that § 3142 applies with full\n\nforce to material witnesses.       But cf. In re Application of United\n\nStates for Material Witness Warrant, 213 F. Supp. 2d 287, 295\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 2002) (noting aspects of § 3142 that are apparently\n\ninapplicable to material witnesses).              Even so, the dissent's\n\nargument is flawed, for several reasons.                First, the factual\n\npremise is wrong.     Nothing in § 3142 would \"entitle[]\" Amparo-\n\nConcepción to release absent his Puerto Rico conviction.                    The\n\nSupreme Court has expressly rejected the notion that § 3142 offers\n\na guarantee of release to any defendant.             See United States v.\n\nMontalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 720 (1990) (\"Automatic release\n\ncontravenes   the   object   of   the   statute,   to   provide     fair   bail\n\nprocedures while protecting the safety of the public and assuring\n\nthe appearance at trial of defendants found likely to flee.\").\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fIndeed, given that the FBI was interested in Amparo-Concepción\n\nbecause of   his   knowledge   of   escape    schemes,   the    court   could\n\nconceivably have ordered him detained without bail on the ground\n\nthat he presented a risk of flight.        See United States v. Dillon,\n\n938 F.2d 1412, 1416 (1st Cir. 1991) (upholding denial of bail based\n\non risk of flight); United States v. Nai, 949 F. Supp. 42, 45\n\n(D.Mass. 1996) (material witness may be detained under § 3142 if\n\ngovernment establishes risk of flight by preponderance of the\n\nevidence). Nor is it true that the Puerto Rico conviction required\n\nthe district court to order Amparo-Concepción held without bail.\n\nSection 3142 incorporates no such bright-line rule.            In short, the\n\ndissent's conclusion that \"[i]t was the Commonwealth's conviction\n\nthat retained Amparo-Concepción in federal custody\" is hardly a\n\nnecessary one.\n\n           Second, the dissent is incorrect to assume that if\n\nAmparo-Concepción had been released under § 3142, he would no\n\nlonger have been in federal custody for purposes of § 751.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Vaughn, 446 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (defendant\n\nwho fled   while   on   pretrial    release   was   validly    convicted   of\n\nescape); United States v. Keller, 912 F.2d 1058, 1059-61 (9th Cir.\n\n1990) (escape violation occurred when defendant failed to report to\n\ncorrectional facility to begin his sentence); United States v.\n\nCoggins, 398 F.2d 668 (4th Cir. 1968) (affirming escape conviction\n\nof defendant who failed to return from furlough).\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            Also, even if it were true that Amparo-Concepción's\n\nPuerto Rico conviction ensured that he was denied bail, that does\n\nnot   change   the   legal   basis    for   Amparo-Concepción's   federal\n\ndetention.     Section 3142 only applies to defendants in federal\n\ncustody on some legal basis.     Amparo-Concepción was not in federal\n\ncustody because he committed a state offense.         He was in federal\n\ncustody because, and only because, he was arrested as a material\n\nwitness.    That fact is dispositive of this appeal, because we hold\n\nthat § 751 does not apply to persons in federal custody solely on\n\nthe basis of § 3144.\n\n             This conclusion is not reached lightly, and we have\n\ncarefully considered potential objections to our reading of § 751.\n\nAt first blush, perhaps the strongest such objection arises from\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.       The guideline applicable to escape\n\noffenses, U.S.S.G. § 2P1.1(a), states that the base offense level\n\nfor a violation of § 751(a) shall be\n\n      (1)    13, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of\n             an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of\n             any offense;\n\n      (2)    8, otherwise.\n\nThe \"otherwise\" clause could conceivably be read to suggest that\n\nthe Sentencing Commission, and derivatively Congress, understood\n\n§ 751 to apply to any and all forms of federal custody, including\n\nmaterial witness detention.      The original text of the guideline\n\ncould be said to reinforce this inference:        rather than simply say\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f\"otherwise,\" the 1987 text of § 2P1.1(a)(2) explicitly mentioned\n\nescapes \"from lawful custody awaiting extradition, pursuant to\n\ndesignation as a recalcitrant witness or as a result of a lawful\n\narrest for a misdemeanor.\" U.S.S.G. § 2P.1.1(a)(2) (1987) (amended\n\n1989)      (emphasis     added).     As    Rosa-Ortiz's      counsel   argued   at\n\nsentencing, material witness detention is similar to recalcitrant\n\nwitness detention.12          The guideline anticipated punishment for the\n\nlatter,      so   the    question   is    whether    that    fact   suggests    the\n\nSentencing Commission and Congress understood § 751 to reach the\n\nformer.\n\n              The answer is no.      The recalcitrant witness statute, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1826, deserved mention in the original version of § 2P1.1\n\nnot   because     §     751   punishes    escape    from   recalcitrant   witness\n\ndetention, but because another statute does: § 1826 defines its own\n\ncrime of escape.         See § 1826(c) (escape from recalcitrant witness\n\ndetention punishable by up to three years in prison); see also\n\nU.S.S.G. App. A (designating § 2P1.1 as the guideline applicable to\n\nconvictions under 28 U.S.C. § 1826(c)).                    Section 1826(c) also\n\nproscribes escape from confinement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4243,\n\nwhich authorizes involuntary hospitalization pursuant to a judgment\n\n\n      12\n       A recalcitrant witness is a witness before any federal court\nor grand jury who refuses, without just cause shown, to comply with\nan order to testify or produce documents or other information. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1826(a). A material witness, by contrast, is a person\nwhose testimony is material to a criminal proceeding and whose\npresence at the proceeding cannot practicably be secured by\nsubpoena. See 18 U.S.C. § 3144.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fof not guilty by reason of insanity.         This not only explains why\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines anticipate escape offenses from \"other[]\"\n\nspecies of federal detention,13 but also underscores our conclusion\n\nregarding the relationship between § 751(a) and the material\n\nwitness statute.      Congress, it is evident, has corrected potential\n\ndeficiencies in the scope of § 751(a) by enacting other statutes to\n\nprohibit escape from particular categories of federal custody. Yet\n\nnone of these statutes addresses escape from material witness\n\ndetention, and the material witness statute itself lacks an escape\n\nprohibition analogous to § 1826(c).        See § 3144.    This is not the\n\nfirst time that a gap has been identified in the sweep of § 751.\n\nSee 134 Cong. Rec. S17360, S17370 (Nov. 10, 1988) (acknowledging,\n\nin amending § 751(a) to proscribe escape from detention pending\n\ndeportation or extradition, that the original failure of the\n\nstatute to prohibit such conduct was an \"apparent oversight\" and a\n\n\"seemingly inadvertent omission\").\n\n           We   are    certain   that   Congress   did   not   intend   that\n\nattempted escapes by material witnesses in federal custody should\n\nbear no consequences.     The government stated at oral argument that\n\nthe defendants' conduct may at least constitute obstruction of\n\njustice.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1503(a).         But that was not the crime\n\ncharged here. For whatever reason, the government chose instead to\n\n\n     13\n       Of course, the \"otherwise\" clause in U.S.S.G. § 2P1.1(a)(2)\nalso governs sentencing in prosecutions under the misdemeanor\nescape provisions of § 751(a). See supra note 7.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fcharge a conspiracy to violate § 751(a).             The plain text of that\n\nstatute does not support the indictment in this case, and \"due\n\nprocess    bars   courts   from   applying   a     novel   construction   of   a\n\ncriminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior\n\njudicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope.\"\n\nUnited States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997).                Rosa-Ortiz's\n\nconviction cannot stand.\n\n            Before concluding, we will comment on one theme raised by\n\nthe defense.       Rosa-Ortiz points out that the language of the\n\nindictment effectively obscured the existence of the legal issue we\n\nhave just resolved.        The indictment charged that Rosa-Ortiz and\n\nothers \"conspired to obtain the unlawful release of MAXIMILIANO\n\nAMPARO-CONCEPCIÓN, who was lawfully confined at the direction of\n\nthe Attorney General by virtue of a court order issued on December\n\n7, 2000 by the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico . . . at which time [Amparo-Concepción] was serving a\n\nsentence for a felony conviction of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.\"    The indictment does not mention that the \"court order\" in\n\nquestion was a material witness warrant, and its phrasing arguably\n\nencourages the erroneous inference that Amparo-Concepción's federal\n\ndetention was related to his Puerto Rico felony conviction.                    If\n\nthis was purposeful obfuscation to hide potential defects in the\n\nindictment, we would have significant concerns.               But we are not\n\nprepared    to    conclude,   without      more,    that    the   government's\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fcircumlocution was purposefully done to hide the issue. Though the\n\n§ 751(a) issue was obscured on the face of the indictment, defense\n\ncounsel informed the court both at the change of plea hearing and\n\nat sentencing that Amparo-Concepción was in federal custody only\n\npursuant    to   a   material    witness    warrant.        Regrettably,    the\n\nprosecutor did not disclose this fact to the court; she merely did\n\nnot deny defense counsel's assertion.             Still, during the trial\n\nstage of this case neither defense counsel nor the court noticed\n\nthe issue we have just resolved, and the same may have been true of\n\nthe government.      Nonetheless, the form of the indictment was, at\n\nbest, unfortunate: this appeal might never had occurred had the\n\ngovernment paid closer attention to this issue from the outset.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            For these reasons, we conclude that 18 U.S.C. § 751(a)\n\ndoes not prohibit attempted escapes from detention under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3144.    Rosa-Ortiz's       guilty   plea   must   be   vacated   and   the\n\nindictment must be dismissed.        So ordered.\n\n\n\n                      Dissenting opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f              SILER,    Circuit   Judge    (dissenting).         I   respectfully\n\ndissent.      I would uphold the conviction of Rosa-Ortiz because he\n\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 751(a), which\n\nis a federal offense under the language of the indictment.\n\n              The co-defendant, Amparo-Concepción, was imprisoned by\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for a felony offense.                     Thus, his\n\nconfinement was “by virtue of [a] conviction of [an] offense,” 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   751(a),    even   though    it   was   not    a   federal    offense.\n\nCertainly, he was in federal custody pursuant to a material witness\n\nwarrant under 18 U.S.C. § 3144.           However, if there had not been the\n\nunderlying Commonwealth conviction and custody, Amparo-Concepción\n\nwould have been entitled to possible release pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3142. It was the Commonwealth’s conviction that retained Amparo-\n\nConcepción in federal custody.\n\n              I would follow the decision in Derengowski v. United\n\nStates, 404 F.2d 778, 781 (8th Cir. 1968), that “any offense under\n\n§   751   includes      state   offenses.”       Like      Derengowski,     Amparo-\n\nConcepción’s custody was “by virtue of his conviction of any\n\noffense.” The majority opinion emphasizes the dicta or alternative\n\nholding in Derengowski that his custody was by virtue of an arrest\n\non a charge of a felony.          He was in federal custody pursuant to a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to answer charges in federal\n\ncourt.     However, before he escaped, the federal charges had been\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fdismissed.   Nevertheless, that alternative holding is dictum that\n\nneed not govern our resolution of this issue.\n\n           I agree with the majority that the material witness\n\nwarrant   could   just   as   easily   have   been   issued   on   the   same\n\napplication if Amparo-Concepción had been free on the streets.             In\n\nthat case, his escape could not have been prosecuted in violation\n\nof § 751, because there was no underlying offense.            Our situation\n\nis obviously different.       I would affirm the conviction below for\n\nthese reasons stated.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f",

Miguel Rosa-Ortiz pleaded guilty\n\nin federal court to conspiracy to violate the Federal Escape Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 751(a), which criminalizes escape and attempted escape\n\nby persons who are in federal custody under specified conditions --\n\nincluding, as the statute pertains to this case, persons in custody\n\n\"by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any\n\noffense.\"       But no court of appeals may uphold a plea of guilty to\n\nconduct that is not within the crime charged.               On appeal, Rosa-\n\nOrtiz says that § 751(a) does not prohibit the conduct alleged in\n\nthe indictment.        We agree.\n\n               The conspiracy charge was based on evidence that Rosa-\n\nOrtiz       helped   his   co-defendant,     Maximiliano   Amparo-Concepción,\n\nattempt to escape from federal prison in Puerto Rico.             Yet not all\n\nescapes from federal custody violate § 751(a).              We conclude that\n\nAmparo-Concepción was not in federal custody \"by virtue of an\n\narrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any offense\"\n\n(whether state or federal), but instead solely by virtue of his\n\ndetention on a federal material witness warrant.               Cf. 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3144.        By its own terms, the Federal Escape Act does not\n\nproscribe escapes under such circumstances,1 which means that Rosa-\n\n\n\n\n        1\n       For this reason, we also vacate today Amparo-Concepción's\nconspiracy conviction following his guilty plea in the companion\ncase to this appeal, United States v. Amparo-Concepción, No. 02-\n1935.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fOrtiz    cannot   be   guilty   of   conspiring   to   violate   that   Act.2\n\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand with\n\ninstructions to dismiss the indictment.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            On February 7, 2001, a federal grand jury returned an\n\nindictment against Rosa-Ortiz and four co-conspirators, including\n\nAmparo-Concepción, for conspiracy to violate § 751(a).3           According\n\nto the government's summary of the facts, which was attached to the\n\nplea agreement and acknowledged by Rosa-Ortiz in writing, the\n\ndefendants plotted to free Amparo-Concepción from the federal\n\nMetropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Puerto Rico.              The escape\n\nplan involved smuggling a bar-cutting tool into the MDC, meeting\n\nAmparo-Concepción outside the prison with a getaway car and a\n\nchange of clothes, and then fleeing to the Dominican Republic.\n\nRosa-Ortiz's role was to obtain the getaway car, recruit others to\n\nhelp, handle funds sent from the Dominican Republic to finance the\n\nescape, and coordinate an advance trip to the perimeter of the MDC\n\nso that Amparo-Concepción could identify the chosen getaway car.\n\nRosa-Ortiz did in fact act on most of these plans, including\n\n\n\n     2\n      This does not mean that Rosa-Ortiz's conduct did not violate\nsome other federal statute. We hold only that the indictment did\nnot validly allege a conspiracy to violate § 751(a).\n     3\n        The indictment also charged Rosa-Ortiz and three co-\ndefendants with aiding and abetting escape under 18 U.S.C. §§\n752(a) and 2, but that count was later dismissed against Rosa-Ortiz\npursuant to his plea agreement.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdriving the getaway car to the perimeter of the MDC on February 3,\n\n2001.    The FBI foiled the plot.\n\n              At the time of the escape attempt, Amparo-Concepción was\n\nbeing held at the MDC pursuant to a material witness warrant issued\n\non December 7, 2000 by the federal district court in Puerto Rico.\n\nCf. § 3144 (authorizing, in limited circumstances, the detention of\n\na witness whose testimony is material to a criminal proceeding).\n\nUntil that time, Amparo-Concepción had been serving a sentence in\n\na Puerto Rico jail for bank fraud, a felony under Puerto Rico law.\n\nWhile    in   the   custody   of   the   Commonwealth,       Amparo-Concepción\n\nvoluntarily      contacted    federal        authorities    with    information\n\nconcerning a scheme among his fellow inmates to use fraudulent\n\nimmigration documents and faked Supreme Court orders to obtain\n\npremature release. Federal investigators became interested in this\n\ninformation and obtained the material witness warrant for Amparo-\n\nConcepción's transfer to federal custody.4              It was on that basis\n\nalone that Amparo-Concepción was moved from the Commonwealth jail\n\nto the MDC; the government does not contend that any other ground\n\nexisted for Amparo-Concepción's detention by federal authorities.\n\n              On April 17, 2002, Rosa-Ortiz pleaded guilty to the\n\ncharged conspiracy      to    violate    §    751(a).      The   district   court\n\n\n\n     4\n       The record does not reveal why federal authorities preferred\nto have Amparo-Concepción in federal custody, rather than allow him\nto remain incarcerated in the Puerto Rico system until his\ntestimony became necessary.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fsentenced him to fifteen months in prison, plus a supervised\n\nrelease term of three years and a special monetary assessment of\n\n$100.     On appeal, Rosa-Ortiz contends that § 751(a) does not\n\nprohibit escape or attempted escape from federal material witness\n\ndetention.      If Amparo-Concepción's escape attempt did not violate\n\n§ 751(a), then Rosa-Ortiz did not conspire to \"commit [that]\n\noffense against the United States,\" 18 U.S.C. § 371, and his\n\nconviction cannot stand.5\n\n                                       II.\n\nA.    Waiver\n\n             The merits of Rosa-Ortiz's appeal are properly before us.\n\nIn its brief, the United States contended that Rosa-Ortiz waived\n\nhis     right   to   challenge   the    indictment   when   he   entered   an\n\nunconditional plea of guilty.

Rather, because of the\n\nnarrower sentencing terms of the statute,7 the government must\n\n\n     7\n       Notwithstanding its sweeping preamble, § 751(a) creates two\ncategories of punishable offense, each defined by the legal basis\nfor the escapee's federal custody:\n\n     [The escapee] shall, [1] if the custody or confinement is\n     by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or\n     conviction of any offense, be fined under this title or\n     imprisoned not more than five years, or both; or [2] if\n     the custody or confinement is for extradition, or for\n     exclusion or expulsion proceedings under the immigration\n     laws, or by virtue of an arrest or charge of or for a\n     misdemeanor, and prior to conviction, be fined under this\n     title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\n§ 751(a) (emphasis added).

The United States concedes that Amparo-Concepción's\n\narrest on a material witness warrant did not, by itself, constitute\n\n\"an arrest on a charge of felony\" or a \"conviction of any offense.\"\n\nThe government argues, however, that because Amparo-Concepción had\n\nalready been convicted of a felony and incarcerated when he was\n\ntransferred to federal custody, he was in federal custody \"by\n\nvirtue of conviction of any offense\" and is therefore subject to\n\nprosecution under § 751(a).9            The conviction in question, the\n\ngovernment urges, need not be a federal conviction.\n\n           There are several flaws in the government's reasoning.\n\nFirst, even   assuming     the   government   is   correct    that    a   state\n\nconviction may satisfy the \"conviction of any offense\" clause of\n\n§ 751(a) in appropriate circumstances,10 the statute unequivocally\n\nrequires that the escapee be in federal custody \"by virtue of\" that\n\n\n     9\n       Section § 751 does not prohibit escapes by state prisoners\nfrom state custody.

The United States cannot\n\nand does not claim that but for Amparo-Concepción's conviction\n\nunder Puerto Rico law, he would not have been detained as a\n\nmaterial witness.       The material witness statute does not require\n\nthat the detained witness have an antecedent state conviction.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f§ 3144.   Further, the United States makes no argument that there is\n\na logical nexus between Amparo-Concepción's bank fraud conviction\n\nin the Puerto Rico courts and the material witness warrant for his\n\narrest -- indeed, the government conceded at oral argument that the\n\ntwo are unrelated.        According to the uncontroverted facts recited\n\nby defense counsel at Rosa-Ortiz's sentencing, Amparo-Concepción\n\nvoluntarily contacted federal authorities to offer information\n\nregarding    the   use     of   fraudulent      immigration    documents   in,\n\nironically, prison escape schemes.            The federal government became\n\ninterested    in   this    information    and    ordered   Amparo-Concepción\n\ndetained to ensure that his testimony would remain available as the\n\ninvestigation proceeded.          The fact that Amparo-Concepción was\n\nalready in a Puerto Rico jail at the time did not logically or\n\nlegally enable his federal arrest –- it merely made him easier to\n\nlocate.     The material witness warrant could just as easily have\n\nissued on the same application if Amparo-Concepción had been free\n\non the streets of San Juan; indeed, there was less reason for the\n\nfederal court to issue the warrant here because Amparo-Concepción\n\nwas already detained by local authorities.             Accordingly, Amparo-\n\nConcepción was not in federal custody \"by virtue of\" a conviction\n\nof any offense, and his attempted escape from that custody did not\n\nviolate § 751(a).\n\n            This   explains      why    the     government's    reliance   on\n\nDerengowski is misplaced.          In Derengowski, the defendant was\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconvicted of armed robbery in state court and imprisoned in a state\n\nfacility.   404 F.2d at 779.    Two years later, while still in state\n\ncustody, he was indicted on federal charges and transferred to\n\nfederal    court   for   arraignment.     The   federal    indictment    was\n\nsubsequently   dismissed.      While    awaiting   his    return   to   state\n\ncustody, the defendant attempted to escape.        Id.    In upholding his\n\nconviction under § 751, the Eighth Circuit emphasized that although\n\nthe federal charges had been dismissed before the defendant tried\n\nto escape, the defendant was nevertheless in federal custody \"'by\n\nvirtue of an arrest on a charge of felony' within the provisions of\n\n§ 751 (i.e., but for defendant's arrest on the federal felony\n\ncharges he would never have been in federal custody).\"         Id. at 781-\n\n82.   The same simply cannot be said of Amparo-Concepción:               his\n\nPuerto Rico conviction was not a but-for cause of his federal\n\ndetention.11\n\n            Moreover, the government's interpretation of § 751 would\n\nrequire us to conclude that Congress outlawed escapes from material\n\n\n\n      11\n         The dissent would rely on Derengowski nonetheless,\ncharacterizing the Eighth Circuit's interpretation of the \"by\nvirtue of\" language in § 751 as \"dicta\" and an \"alternative\nholding.\"   This objection does not address the merits of our\ninterpretation of the \"by virtue of\" clause. Nor does the primary\nholding of Derengowski help the dissent. Derengowski held that the\n\"conviction of any offense\" language in § 751 may be satisfied by\nstate convictions. See 404 F.2d at 781. We do not decide that\nquestion today. See supra note 10. Even assuming that Derengowski\nis correct, though, the federal custody must still be \"by virtue\nof\" the state conviction. Nothing in Derengowski obviates that\nstatutory requirement.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fwitness detention by persons transferred from state prison, but not\n\nescapes    from    material      witness    detention     by     persons    otherwise\n\ndetained. Such a distinction would not be irrational; we simply do\n\nnot find it in the language of the statute.                         Section 751(a)\n\ncontains no reference to \"transfers\" between state and federal\n\ncustody.    As the government itself points out, the text of the\n\nstatute draws no distinction between state and federal offenses or\n\nconvictions.        In    short,    there    is    no   textual     basis    for    the\n\ngovernment's interpretation of § 751(a).\n\n            Absent a textual basis for the government's argument,\n\nconcerns for lenity and due process compel us to reject it.

Section 3142 only applies to defendants in federal\n\ncustody on some legal basis.     Amparo-Concepción was not in federal\n\ncustody because he committed a state offense.         He was in federal\n\ncustody because, and only because, he was arrested as a material\n\nwitness.    That fact is dispositive of this appeal, because we hold\n\nthat § 751 does not apply to persons in federal custody solely on\n\nthe basis of § 3144.\n\n             This conclusion is not reached lightly, and we have\n\ncarefully considered potential objections to our reading of § 751.\n\nAt first blush, perhaps the strongest such objection arises from\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.       The guideline applicable to escape\n\noffenses, U.S.S.G. § 2P1.1(a), states that the base offense level\n\nfor a violation of § 751(a) shall be\n\n      (1)    13, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of\n             an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of\n             any offense;\n\n      (2)    8, otherwise.\n\nThe \"otherwise\" clause could conceivably be read to suggest that\n\nthe Sentencing Commission, and derivatively Congress, understood\n\n§ 751 to apply to any and all forms of federal custody, including\n\nmaterial witness detention.      The original text of the guideline\n\ncould be said to reinforce this inference:        rather than simply say\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f\"otherwise,\" the 1987 text of § 2P1.1(a)(2) explicitly mentioned\n\nescapes \"from lawful custody awaiting extradition, pursuant to\n\ndesignation as a recalcitrant witness or as a result of a lawful\n\narrest for a misdemeanor.\" U.S.S.G. § 2P.1.1(a)(2) (1987) (amended\n\n1989)      (emphasis     added).     As    Rosa-Ortiz's      counsel   argued   at\n\nsentencing, material witness detention is similar to recalcitrant\n\nwitness detention.12          The guideline anticipated punishment for the\n\nlatter,      so   the    question   is    whether    that    fact   suggests    the\n\nSentencing Commission and Congress understood § 751 to reach the\n\nformer.\n\n              The answer is no.      The recalcitrant witness statute, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1826, deserved mention in the original version of § 2P1.1\n\nnot   because     §     751   punishes    escape    from   recalcitrant   witness\n\ndetention, but because another statute does: § 1826 defines its own\n\ncrime of escape.         See § 1826(c) (escape from recalcitrant witness\n\ndetention punishable by up to three years in prison); see also\n\nU.S.S.G. App. A (designating § 2P1.1 as the guideline applicable to\n\nconvictions under 28 U.S.C. § 1826(c)).                    Section 1826(c) also\n\nproscribes escape from confinement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4243,\n\nwhich authorizes involuntary hospitalization pursuant to a judgment\n\n\n      12\n       A recalcitrant witness is a witness before any federal court\nor grand jury who refuses, without just cause shown, to comply with\nan order to testify or produce documents or other information. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1826(a). A material witness, by contrast, is a person\nwhose testimony is material to a criminal proceeding and whose\npresence at the proceeding cannot practicably be secured by\nsubpoena. See 18 U.S.C. § 3144.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fof not guilty by reason of insanity.         This not only explains why\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines anticipate escape offenses from \"other[]\"\n\nspecies of federal detention,13 but also underscores our conclusion\n\nregarding the relationship between § 751(a) and the material\n\nwitness statute.      Congress, it is evident, has corrected potential\n\ndeficiencies in the scope of § 751(a) by enacting other statutes to\n\nprohibit escape from particular categories of federal custody. Yet\n\nnone of these statutes addresses escape from material witness\n\ndetention, and the material witness statute itself lacks an escape\n\nprohibition analogous to § 1826(c).        See § 3144.    This is not the\n\nfirst time that a gap has been identified in the sweep of § 751.\n\nSee 134 Cong. Rec. S17360, S17370 (Nov. 10, 1988) (acknowledging,\n\nin amending § 751(a) to proscribe escape from detention pending\n\ndeportation or extradition, that the original failure of the\n\nstatute to prohibit such conduct was an \"apparent oversight\" and a\n\n\"seemingly inadvertent omission\").\n\n           We   are    certain   that   Congress   did   not   intend   that\n\nattempted escapes by material witnesses in federal custody should\n\nbear no consequences.     The government stated at oral argument that\n\nthe defendants' conduct may at least constitute obstruction of\n\njustice.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1503(a).         But that was not the crime\n\ncharged here. For whatever reason, the government chose instead to\n\n\n     13\n       Of course, the \"otherwise\" clause in U.S.S.G. § 2P1.1(a)(2)\nalso governs sentencing in prosecutions under the misdemeanor\nescape provisions of § 751(a).

Rosa-Ortiz's\n\nconviction cannot stand.\n\n            Before concluding, we will comment on one theme raised by\n\nthe defense.       Rosa-Ortiz points out that the language of the\n\nindictment effectively obscured the existence of the legal issue we\n\nhave just resolved.        The indictment charged that Rosa-Ortiz and\n\nothers \"conspired to obtain the unlawful release of MAXIMILIANO\n\nAMPARO-CONCEPCIÓN, who was lawfully confined at the direction of\n\nthe Attorney General by virtue of a court order issued on December\n\n7, 2000 by the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico . . . at which time [Amparo-Concepción] was serving a\n\nsentence for a felony conviction of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico.\"    The indictment does not mention that the \"court order\" in\n\nquestion was a material witness warrant, and its phrasing arguably\n\nencourages the erroneous inference that Amparo-Concepción's federal\n\ndetention was related to his Puerto Rico felony conviction.                    If\n\nthis was purposeful obfuscation to hide potential defects in the\n\nindictment, we would have significant concerns.               But we are not\n\nprepared    to    conclude,   without      more,    that    the   government's\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fcircumlocution was purposefully done to hide the issue. Though the\n\n§ 751(a) issue was obscured on the face of the indictment, defense\n\ncounsel informed the court both at the change of plea hearing and\n\nat sentencing that Amparo-Concepción was in federal custody only\n\npursuant    to   a   material    witness    warrant.        Regrettably,    the\n\nprosecutor did not disclose this fact to the court; she merely did\n\nnot deny defense counsel's assertion.             Still, during the trial\n\nstage of this case neither defense counsel nor the court noticed\n\nthe issue we have just resolved, and the same may have been true of\n\nthe government.      Nonetheless, the form of the indictment was, at\n\nbest, unfortunate: this appeal might never had occurred had the\n\ngovernment paid closer attention to this issue from the outset.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            For these reasons, we conclude that 18 U.S.C. § 751(a)\n\ndoes not prohibit attempted escapes from detention under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3144.    Rosa-Ortiz's       guilty   plea   must   be   vacated   and   the\n\nindictment must be dismissed.

I   respectfully\n\ndissent.      I would uphold the conviction of Rosa-Ortiz because he\n\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 751(a), which\n\nis a federal offense under the language of the indictment.\n\n              The co-defendant, Amparo-Concepción, was imprisoned by\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for a felony offense.                     Thus, his\n\nconfinement was “by virtue of [a] conviction of [an] offense,” 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   751(a),    even   though    it   was   not    a   federal    offense.\n\nCertainly, he was in federal custody pursuant to a material witness\n\nwarrant under 18 U.S.C. § 3144.           However, if there had not been the\n\nunderlying Commonwealth conviction and custody, Amparo-Concepción\n\nwould have been entitled to possible release pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3142. It was the Commonwealth’s conviction that retained Amparo-\n\nConcepción in federal custody.\n\n              I would follow the decision in Derengowski v.

He was in federal custody pursuant to a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to answer charges in federal\n\ncourt.     However, before he escaped, the federal charges had been\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fdismissed.   Nevertheless, that alternative holding is dictum that\n\nneed not govern our resolution of this issue.\n\n           I agree with the majority that the material witness\n\nwarrant   could   just   as   easily   have   been   issued   on   the   same\n\napplication if Amparo-Concepción had been free on the streets.             In\n\nthat case, his escape could not have been prosecuted in violation\n\nof § 751, because there was no underlying offense.            Our situation\n\nis obviously different.       I would affirm the conviction below for\n\nthese reasons stated.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f</pre>",
