GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.    Ryan T. Blumling\n\nappeals from the district court's entry of summary judgment against\n\nhim in favor of D. Bruce Wheeler, on Wheeler's claim for breach of\n\na guaranty agreement.    Blumling contends that he has two defenses\n\nto liability on the guaranty:       frustration of purpose of the\n\ncontract and modification of the guaranty by oral agreement.     We\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n          Blumling is a loan broker. In March 2004, Frank Zarrelli\n\nof Parsons 4E, LLC, contacted Blumling for help in finding a short-\n\nterm loan to supply money Parsons needed to buy a financial\n\nguaranty bond from Allianz, A.G. Parsons needed the bond to enable\n\nit to get bank financing for coal mining operations in Kentucky.\n\nBlumling went to work and located Wheeler as a possible lender for\n\nthe short-term loan.     The note was to be secured by a security\n\ninterest in various coal properties and by guaranties from the\n\nprincipals of Parsons, but Wheeler insisted on getting a guaranty\n\nfrom Blumling as well.   Blumling states that he told Wheeler,\n\n     I did not think that it was appropriate for me to\n     guarantee the Note, as I was merely a broker for the\n     loan, but Mr. Wheeler insisted that, unless I guaranteed\n     the loan, he would not lend to Parsons 4E . . . .\n\n     Without any alternative, and being under pressure to\n     perform quickly to satisfy the reported needs of Allianz,\n     I advised Mr. Wheeler that I would execute a guarantee,\n     provided that Mr. Wheeler understood and agreed that I\n     would not thereby become liable for an amount greater\n     than the principal amount loaned and that I would not be\n     called upon to pay any amounts before Mr. Wheeler had\n     exhausted   his   remedies   under  the   assignment   by\n     foreclosing on his security interest as stated in the\n\n                                 -2-\n\f     Collateral Assignment I had arranged. Mr. Wheeler agreed\n     . . . . In reliance on Mr. Wheeler's representations,\n     I signed the guaranty.\n\n\n            The note itself called for a rather breathtaking interest\n\nrate--the loan was for $625,000 to be disbursed on March 12, 2004,\n\nto be repaid with interest for a total of $1.4 million due on April\n\n24, 2004.    Though the parties dared not name the interest rate at\n\noral argument, we calculate it at over 1000% per annum.          The\n\nguaranty Blumling signed, however, did not make him liable for that\n\nrate of interest, but instead provided:\n\n     [I]n no event shall the amounts due Lender under this\n     Guaranty exceed the sum of $625,000 plus interest from\n     the date hereof until paid in full at 2% per month (or\n     such lesser amount as shall be the maximum amount allowed\n     by law) plus reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in\n     connection with enforcement of this Guaranty . . . .\n\n            There were several other clauses in the guaranty of\n\nparticular interest in this litigation:\n\n     (1) The guaranty recited that Blumling had a personal interest\n\nin the success of Parsons, that Wheeler would not make the desired\n\nloan to Parsons without Blumling's guaranty, and that the guaranty\n\nwas executed to induce Wheeler to make the Parsons loan.\n\n     (2) The guaranty also said that Wheeler might \"at [his]\n\noption, proceed against [Blumling] without ever commencing any\n\naction, or ever obtaining any judgment against [Parsons] or any\n\ncollateral for the obligations guaranteed hereunder.\"        A later\n\nclause similarly provided, \"This Guaranty . . . is in no way\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fconditioned upon any requirement that [Wheeler] first attempt to\n\ncollect or enforce any of the obligations under the Note from or by\n\n[Parsons] or any other party primarily or secondarily liable with\n\nrespect thereto, or resort to any security or other means of\n\nobtaining payment or satisfaction of any of the obligations of\n\n[Parsons] to [Wheeler]. . . .\"\n\n     (3) \"No provision of this Guaranty may be changed, waived or\n\ndischarged except by an instrument in writing signed by [Wheeler]\n\nand [Blumling] and expressly referring to the provision of this\n\nGuaranty to which such instrument relates . . . .\"\n\n     (4)    The   guaranty   stated    that    it   would   be   governed   and\n\nconstrued in accordance with the law of Kentucky.\n\n            Upon execution of the note and the guaranties, Wheeler\n\ndisbursed   the   $625,000   as   Parsons      directed,    including   wiring\n\n$562,500 directly to Parsons' bond broker Wayne Price, who was\n\nsupposed to be arranging the purchase of the bond from Allianz.\n\nBlumling states that although the \"Allianz bond was issued in April\n\n2004, . . . it was not financed . . . [and] Allianz and its\n\nsubsidiaries would not recognize it as a legitimate instrument\n\nissued by one or more of them.\"             Wayne Price and his associates\n\nwere indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of\n\nconspiracy and wire fraud.        In particular, they were accused of\n\nappropriating for themselves moneys their clients had paid to\n\nobtain bonds from a subsidiary of Allianz, A.G.                  Parsons tried\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwithout success to obtain the return of its premium.\n\n            As a result of its bond fiasco, Parsons defaulted on its\n\nobligation to pay Wheeler $1.4 million on April 24, 2004.                   In\n\nDecember    2004,    the    various    parties    and    guarantors    to   the\n\nParsons/Wheeler      note   executed    a    \"Forbearance    Agreement.\"     In\n\nexchange for an extension of time to pay, Parsons acknowledged its\n\nindebtedness on the note and, in Section 3 of the Forbearance\n\nAgreement, agreed to waive any possible defenses on the note or\n\ncounterclaims.       Although the body of the Forbearance Agreement\n\nrelated only to Parsons's obligations, Blumling signed an attached\n\nsignature page with the following statement: \"The undersigned\n\nconsents to the foregoing, joins in the release under Section 3\n\nabove, and agrees that his Guaranty remains in full force and\n\neffect.\"    Parsons did not make any of the payments in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.\n\n            Wheeler brought this suit against Parsons, the other\n\nguarantors,    and   Blumling.        Parsons    and   the   other   guarantors\n\nsettled, but Blumling did not.2        Wheeler moved for summary judgment\n\nagainst Blumling, which the district court granted.\n\n            We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.     Plumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 369 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n\n     2\n      Blumling stated, both in an affidavit and in his brief to\nthis court, that Wheeler has not executed in any way on the\njudgment he obtained against Parsons and the other guarantors.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           Blumling contends that under the applicable Kentucky law,\n\nhe should be excused from performing his obligations under the\n\nguaranty because the misappropriation of the proceeds by the bond\n\nbroker   frustrated   the   purpose   of   the   contract   or    rendered\n\nimpossible Blumling's performance. Blumling's argument is properly\n\ncharacterized as one of frustration of purpose rather than of\n\nimpossibility,3 for he argues that the value to him of the loan\n\nsecured by the guaranty was destroyed by the defalcations of the\n\nbond broker.\n\n           Actually, the value of the loaned money was not affected,\n\nbut the proceeds of the loan were lost by the borrower.          Suffice it\n\nto say, none of the authorities cited by Blumling stands for the\n\nrule that a borrower's (or his guarantor's) obligation to repay\n\nborrowed money depends on the success of the venture on which he\n\nspent the money.      The only precedential Kentucky case on which\n\nBlumling relies, Frazier v. Collins, 187 S.W.2d 816 (Ky. 1945),\n\n\n\n     3\n           The doctrine[s] of commercial frustration and\n           impracticability [i.e., impossibility] both\n           concern    the    effect     of    supervening\n           circumstances upon the rights and duties of\n           the   parties;   however,    with   commercial\n           frustration, performance remains possible, but\n           the expected value of performance to the party\n           seeking to be excused has been destroyed by\n           the fortuitous event which supervened to cause\n           an actual, but not literal, failure of\n           consideration.\n\n30 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 77.95, at 596 (4th ed.\n2004).\n\n                                  -6-\n\frejected the frustration defense in the case before it and held\n\nthat \"when a party engages without qualification to do an act, his\n\nperformance      is     not   excused    because       it    becomes   onerous     or\n\nunprofitable.         It is deemed his own fault if he does not expressly\n\nprovide     against         contingencies       and     exempt      himself      from\n\nresponsibility        in   certain    events.\"        Id.    at   818-19   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).             The district court did not err in\n\nrejecting Blumling's frustration of purpose defense.\n\n            Second,        Blumling   argues    that    he    and   Wheeler   orally\n\nmodified their contract, including the provision in the contract\n\nthat required modifications to be in writing. He contends that the\n\nmodified terms were that \"Blumling would not be liable on his\n\nguaranty until such time as Wheeler had executed against Parsons\n\n4E's assets\" and that \"in any event, Blumling would not be liable\n\nfor more than the principal amount that Wheeler had loaned to\n\nParsons.\"        The problem with this theory is that there is no\n\nevidence    of    a    modification     after    the   guaranty      was   executed.\n\nBlumling's own affidavit alleges that he negotiated these two\n\nconditions with Wheeler before executing the guaranty:\n\n     I advised Mr. Wheeler that I would execute a guarantee,\n     provided that Mr. Wheeler understood and agreed that I\n     would not thereby become liable for an amount greater\n     than the principal amount loaned and that I would not be\n     called upon to pay any amounts before Mr. Wheeler had\n     exhausted   his  remedies    under  the  assignment   by\n     foreclosing on his security interest as stated in the\n     Collateral Assignment I had arranged. Mr. Wheeler agreed\n     . . . . In reliance on Mr. Wheeler's representations, I\n     signed the guaranty.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fHowever, the guaranty as executed contradicts both the conditions,\n\nexpressly providing that Blumling's liability did not depend on\n\nWheeler first proceeding against the debtor, any other guarantor,\n\nor the collateral, and that Blumling would be liable for the\n\nprincipal     amount   plus   two    percent   interest     and     reasonable\n\nattorneys'    fees.     Blumling's     affidavit    says    that    he   later\n\n\"reconfirmed\" the two putative conditions with Wheeler's agent, but\n\nhe steadfastly contends that those were the terms negotiated before\n\nthe contract was memorialized, rather than being changes negotiated\n\nafterwards.       Moreover,    his   affidavit     only    states    that   he\n\n\"reconfirmed\" his understanding of the contract, not that Wheeler's\n\nagent agreed to any change.\n\n            Thus, Blumling's evidence does not support a modification\n\nof the agreement, but rather consists of assertions of prior oral\n\nnegotiations that contradict the written instrument he executed.\n\nThe parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law under which,\n\n     [w]here the parties put their engagement in writing             all\n     prior negotiations and agreements are merged in                 the\n     instrument, and each is bound by its terms unless               his\n     signature is obtained by fraud or the contract                   be\n     reformed on the ground of fraud or mutual mistake, or           the\n     contract is illegal.\n\nChilders & Venters, Inc. v. Sowards, 460 S.W.2d 343, 345 (Ky.\n\n1970).      Blumling does not argue that the whole contract was\n\nobtained by fraud or that the parties meant it as a sham contract;\n\ninstead, he only wants to contradict particular terms of a contract\n\nwhich has already been performed on Wheeler's side and of which\n\n                                     -8-\n\fBlumling has already enjoyed the benefits (fleeting though they\n\nwere).   This is exactly what the parol evidence rule forecloses.\n\nSee Lewis v. Owens, 338 F.2d 740, 742 (6th Cir. 1964) (Kentucky\n\nlaw).\n\n          Since   we   conclude    that   Blumling's   defenses   are\n\nunavailing, we need not consider the arguments regarding whether he\n\nwaived such defenses in the Forbearance Agreement.\n\n          We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

Parsons tried\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwithout success to obtain the return of its premium.\n\n            As a result of its bond fiasco, Parsons defaulted on its\n\nobligation to pay Wheeler $1.4 million on April 24, 2004.                   In\n\nDecember    2004,    the    various    parties    and    guarantors    to   the\n\nParsons/Wheeler      note   executed    a    \"Forbearance    Agreement.\"     In\n\nexchange for an extension of time to pay, Parsons acknowledged its\n\nindebtedness on the note and, in Section 3 of the Forbearance\n\nAgreement, agreed to waive any possible defenses on the note or\n\ncounterclaims.       Although the body of the Forbearance Agreement\n\nrelated only to Parsons's obligations, Blumling signed an attached\n\nsignature page with the following statement: \"The undersigned\n\nconsents to the foregoing, joins in the release under Section 3\n\nabove, and agrees that his Guaranty remains in full force and\n\neffect.\"    Parsons did not make any of the payments in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.\n\n            Wheeler brought this suit against Parsons, the other\n\nguarantors,    and   Blumling.        Parsons    and   the   other   guarantors\n\nsettled, but Blumling did not.2        Wheeler moved for summary judgment\n\nagainst Blumling, which the district court granted.\n\n            We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.

Blumling's argument is properly\n\ncharacterized as one of frustration of purpose rather than of\n\nimpossibility,3 for he argues that the value to him of the loan\n\nsecured by the guaranty was destroyed by the defalcations of the\n\nbond broker.\n\n           Actually, the value of the loaned money was not affected,\n\nbut the proceeds of the loan were lost by the borrower.          Suffice it\n\nto say, none of the authorities cited by Blumling stands for the\n\nrule that a borrower's (or his guarantor's) obligation to repay\n\nborrowed money depends on the success of the venture on which he\n\nspent the money.      The only precedential Kentucky case on which\n\nBlumling relies, Frazier v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. 1945),\n\n\n\n     3\n           The doctrine[s] of commercial frustration and\n           impracticability [i.e., impossibility] both\n           concern    the    effect     of    supervening\n           circumstances upon the rights and duties of\n           the   parties;   however,    with   commercial\n           frustration, performance remains possible, but\n           the expected value of performance to the party\n           seeking to be excused has been destroyed by\n           the fortuitous event which supervened to cause\n           an actual, but not literal, failure of\n           consideration.\n\n30 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 77.95, at 596 (4th ed.\n2004).\n\n                                  -6-\n\frejected the frustration defense in the case before it and held\n\nthat \"when a party engages without qualification to do an act, his\n\nperformance      is     not   excused    because       it    becomes   onerous     or\n\nunprofitable.         It is deemed his own fault if he does not expressly\n\nprovide     against         contingencies       and     exempt      himself      from\n\nresponsibility        in   certain    events.\"        Id.    at   818-19   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).             The district court did not err in\n\nrejecting Blumling's frustration of purpose defense.\n\n            Second,        Blumling   argues    that    he    and   Wheeler   orally\n\nmodified their contract, including the provision in the contract\n\nthat required modifications to be in writing. He contends that the\n\nmodified terms were that \"Blumling would not be liable on his\n\nguaranty until such time as Wheeler had executed against Parsons\n\n4E's assets\" and that \"in any event, Blumling would not be liable\n\nfor more than the principal amount that Wheeler had loaned to\n\nParsons.\"        The problem with this theory is that there is no\n\nevidence    of    a    modification     after    the   guaranty      was   executed.\n\nBlumling's own affidavit alleges that he negotiated these two\n\nconditions with Wheeler before executing the guaranty:\n\n     I advised Mr. Wheeler that I would execute a guarantee,\n     provided that Mr. Wheeler understood and agreed that I\n     would not thereby become liable for an amount greater\n     than the principal amount loaned and that I would not be\n     called upon to pay any amounts before Mr. Wheeler had\n     exhausted   his  remedies    under  the  assignment   by\n     foreclosing on his security interest as stated in the\n     Collateral Assignment I had arranged. Mr. Wheeler agreed\n     . . . . In reliance on Mr. Wheeler's representations, I\n     signed the guaranty.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fHowever, the guaranty as executed contradicts both the conditions,\n\nexpressly providing that Blumling's liability did not depend on\n\nWheeler first proceeding against the debtor, any other guarantor,\n\nor the collateral, and that Blumling would be liable for the\n\nprincipal     amount   plus   two    percent   interest     and     reasonable\n\nattorneys'    fees.     Blumling's     affidavit    says    that    he   later\n\n\"reconfirmed\" the two putative conditions with Wheeler's agent, but\n\nhe steadfastly contends that those were the terms negotiated before\n\nthe contract was memorialized, rather than being changes negotiated\n\nafterwards.       Moreover,    his   affidavit     only    states    that   he\n\n\"reconfirmed\" his understanding of the contract, not that Wheeler's\n\nagent agreed to any change.\n\n            Thus, Blumling's evidence does not support a modification\n\nof the agreement, but rather consists of assertions of prior oral\n\nnegotiations that contradict the written instrument he executed.\n\nThe parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law under which,\n\n     [w]here the parties put their engagement in writing             all\n     prior negotiations and agreements are merged in                 the\n     instrument, and each is bound by its terms unless               his\n     signature is obtained by fraud or the contract                   be\n     reformed on the ground of fraud or mutual mistake, or           the\n     contract is illegal.\n\nChilders & Venters, Inc. v.

Blumling does not argue that the whole contract was\n\nobtained by fraud or that the parties meant it as a sham contract;\n\ninstead, he only wants to contradict particular terms of a contract\n\nwhich has already been performed on Wheeler's side and of which\n\n                                     -8-\n\fBlumling has already enjoyed the benefits (fleeting though they\n\nwere).
