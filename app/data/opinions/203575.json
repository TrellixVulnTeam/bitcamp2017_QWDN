Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Boudin and Howard,\n\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William Gray Schaffer, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 26, 2008\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge. On February 16, 2005, around eight\n\np.m. Sergeant Duval of the Somersworth, New Hampshire, Police\n\nDepartment responded to a 911 call from the home of Carrie Davis.\n\nDavis told Duval that she had been threatened by three men--two\n\nblack, one white--who had arrived at the apartment looking for her\n\nboyfriend, Richard Post.   When told that Post was not there, one of\n\nthe black males, known to Davis as \"H,\" said that she knew what they\n\nwanted and exposed a black firearm in his waistband.      The white\n\nmale, whom she knew as \"Jose,\" was holding a tool with a blade which\n\nhe smacked on his hand.    Davis knew the other black male only as\n\n\"Q.\"\n\n          The three men, Post's sister told Duval, were looking for\n\nPost because he had been dealing drugs, including crack cocaine, and\n\nhad \"ripped off\" his suppliers.    Post's sister also gave Duval the\n\nlicense plate number of the pickup truck the three men were using,\n\nand Duval put out an alert for the truck.       Shortly thereafter,\n\nOfficer Gould of the Dover, New Hampshire, Police Department located\n\nthe truck, still warm, at a Dover motel just over the line from\n\nSomersworth. Duval and another Somersworth officer joined Gould and\n\nanother Dover officer at the motel.\n\n          The night clerk told the officers that three men matching\n\nDavis' description had entered the motel shortly before and had gone\n\nto Room 419, rented for cash by Kimberly Holland.    The clerk also\n\nsaid that Holland had previously rented rooms at the motel and that\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe clerk suspected the group members of drug dealing.         Arriving on\n\nthe fourth floor, the officers smelled marijuana coming from the\n\nroom.    Their knock produced the sound of movement and whispering\n\ninside the room, but no answer.\n\n            Gould then left to consult with a supervisor and Duval\n\nknocked again; a black male, Anthony Burnett, opened the door.            The\n\nother men in the room were later identified as Quenta Parker, a\n\nblack male, and Juan Feliciano, a light-skinned Hispanic.               Duval\n\nquestioned   the   men   while   waiting   for   Gould   to   return;    this\n\nquestioning lasted approximately ten to fifteen minutes.          Asked by\n\nDuval about the incident at Davis' home, Burnett said that they had\n\nbeen visiting a friend; the address he gave was quite near Davis'\n\nhouse.    In response to questions about the smell of marijuana,\n\nFeliciano admitted that he had \"smoked a joint, but it's all gone.\"\n\nAll refused the police request for consent to search the room.\n\n            Duval returned and one of the officers asked all four\n\noccupants (the men and Holland) for identification and to step\n\noutside the room.    Duval then spoke privately to Holland, viewing\n\nher as having authority to consent to a search.           This discussion\n\nlasted approximately ten minutes, during which Holland admitted to\n\nsmoking marijuana but asked to consult with her boyfriend, \"Q\"\n\n(Parker).    Parker then allegedly admitted that they had smoked\n\nmarijuana and that there was still some inside the room.            But he\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ftold Holland not to consent to a search, and she then denied\n\nconsent.\n\n            The occupants were held at the motel until around midnight\n\nwhen a search warrant was finally secured; this was roughly three to\n\nthree and a half hours after the decision was made to seek the\n\nwarrant.    A search of the room turned up a small safe--later found\n\nmarked with Parker's fingerprints--containing a black .32 caliber\n\nhandgun, two loaded magazines, a holster and ammunition pouch, two\n\nknives, several pills, $3000 cash, and approximately 550 grams of\n\ncrack cocaine.     More cash ($2750) was found in a leather jacket in\n\nthe room.    Parker and the two other men were then formally arrested.\n\n            A federal grand jury indicted Parker for conspiring with\n\nBurnett and others to distribute and to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2006), for possession\n\nwith intent to distribute crack cocaine, id. § 841(a)(1), and for\n\npossession    of   a   firearm   in   furtherance   of   a   crime   of   drug\n\ntrafficking, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (2006).        After an evidentiary\n\nhearing, Parker's request to suppress the physical evidence was\n\ndenied.    Parker then pled guilty on all counts, reserving his right\n\nto appeal from the denial of his suppression motion, and was\n\nsentenced to 195 months in prison.1\n\n\n    1\n      Parker was sentenced to 135 months for each of the two drug\ncounts (each carried a mandatory minimum term of ten years, see 21\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846), to be served concurrently, and to sixty\nmonths on the gun count to be served consecutively (the mandatory\nminimum, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            Parker's first claim on appeal is that requiring him to\n\nleave the hotel room was a seizure in violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment, \"the 'fruits' of which must be suppressed.\" The district\n\ncourt's findings on the denial of a suppression motion are reviewed\n\nfor clear error, but its legal determinations are reviewed de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Smith, 423 F.3d 25, 31 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005), cert.\n\ndenied, 126 S. Ct. 2287 (2006).     Here, asking Parker to step outside\n\nthe room was not unlawful; nor, had it been unlawful, would the\n\nitems seized in the room be suppressed as forbidden fruit.\n\n            The complication in this case is not the initial knock nor\n\nthe preliminary inquiries, see United States v. Cephas, 254 F.3d\n\n488, 493-94 (4th Cir. 2001), but rather the request to step outside\n\nthe room.     Such a situation is at the crossroads of two different\n\nFourth Amendment doctrines--one governing ordinary arrests and brief\n\ninvestigative stops; the other, entry into the home.       There is some\n\ntension between the approaches taken by the Supreme Court in these\n\nsituations.\n\n            Outside the home, the police can arrest without a warrant\n\nanyone who they have probable cause to believe committed a felony,\n\nsee, e.g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 156 (1925); see\n\nalso United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411 (1976); and, merely on\n\n\"reasonable    suspicion,\"   the   police   can   temporarily   detain   an\n\nindividual for an investigative inquiry called a Terry stop, Terry\n\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), whether the suspect is in a car or on\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\ffoot.   United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 881 (1975).\n\n           By contrast, the strong presumption is that a warrant\n\nbased on probable cause is required to justify police entrance into\n\nthe home or other private quarters, whether to seize property or\n\nperson.   Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 588-90 (1980); Stoner v.\n\nCalifornia, 376 U.S. 483, 490 (1964).           The discrepancy in doctrine\n\nas between street and home the is narrowed but not eliminated by\n\ncertain exceptions licensing entry without a warrant, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Samboy, 433 F.3d 154, 158 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied,\n\n126 S. Ct. 1926 (2006) (exigent circumstances);            United States v.\n\nLuciano, 329 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003) (consent).\n\n           The closest precedent in our circuit is             United States v.\n\nBeaudoin, 362 F.3d 60, 69-70 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 979\n\n(2004), vacated on other grounds sub. nom. Champagne v. United\n\nStates, 543 U.S. 1102 (2005).        In Beaudoin, we held (albeit by a\n\ndivided vote) that no warrant was required for a reasonable police\n\nrequest that the suspect step out of his hotel room.              We deemed the\n\nintrusion on privacy of such a direction to be real but modest,\n\nespecially when weighed against the risk to police officers, and\n\nstressed the analogy to the Terry stop cases allowing investigative\n\nstops on the street.\n\n           Here,   as   in   Beaudoin,    the   men   inside    the   room   were\n\nreasonably suspected of involvement in a felony (the threatening of\n\nDavis) and of possessing a gun.     Indeed, although the crime at issue\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwas less serious than in Beaudoin, the evidence pointing to Parker's\n\ninvolvement in it and the likelihood of his having a weapon were\n\nmuch stronger, as in Beaudoin police were acting merely on an\n\nanonymous tip.    Id. at 62.   Summoning Parker and the other men to\n\nstep outside the hotel room was thus justified as a means of\n\nprotecting the police while they pursued the investigation and of\n\nsecuring the weapon and other possible evidence when they decided to\n\nseek a warrant.\n\n          Having the men outside the room, the police could perhaps\n\nhave arrested them on the spot.   Davis' statement provided probable\n\ncause, not mere suspicion, to arrest the men who had threatened her;\n\nand the tracing of the truck to the motel and the desk clerk's\n\nidentification point to the men in Room 419 as the culprits.     But\n\nabsent exigent circumstances, Samboy, 433 F.3d at 158, or consent,\n\nLuciano, 329 F.3d at 7, the police still needed a warrant to search\n\nthe room for physical evidence.   So, reasonably enough they awaited\n\nthe warrant and the confirmation provided by the gun, drugs and\n\nmoney before making formal arrests.\n\n          Finally, even if Parker had been unlawfully seized, the\n\nlater seizure of the safe would still not have been suppressible\n\n\"fruits\" of Parker's seizure.   The warrant already in contemplation\n\nwould inevitably have led to the safe being seized and searched, Nix\n\nv. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 444, 446 (1984), there being probable\n\ncause for the warrant without regard to anything said by Parker.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fUnited States v. Ford, 22 F.3d 374, 379-80 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n513 U.S. 900 (1994).       While awaiting the warrant the police were\n\nentitled to prevent the safe's removal.        Illinois v. MacArthur, 531\n\nU.S. 326, 331-33 (2001).\n\n          Parker next argues that, quite apart from the seizure,\n\n\"[t]he failure to give [him and Holland] the warnings set forth in\n\nMiranda v. Arizona[, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)], prior to interrogating\n\nthem was unlawful, and thus requires that the information they\n\nprovided . . . as well as the 'fruits' thereof, be suppressed.\"             He\n\nthen contests the scope and duration of the initial encounter and\n\nthe voluntariness of anything he said.\n\n          The questioning of Parker was not unlawful.                 Parker's\n\nadmission to smoking a joint of marijuana occurred early in the\n\nperiod of detention and, under the Terry line of cases, it was not\n\nthe result of a custodial \"interrogation\" of the kind requiring\n\nMiranda protection.     United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79, 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).    Trueber holds that Miranda warnings are not required\n\nfor \"a brief period of detention\" during which the police seek \"by\n\nmeans of a moderate number of questions to determine [a suspect's]\n\nidentity and to obtain information confirming or dispelling their\n\nsuspicions.\"    Id.\n\n          In this case, the motel was a neutral environment, there\n\nwas no testimony that Parker was physically restrained, and the\n\nquestioning    was    limited,   being    prompted   in   part   by   Parker's\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fgirlfriend, who insisted that Parker be consulted before consent to\n\nsearch could be given. See generally United States v. Nishnianidze,\n\n342 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1132 (2004)\n\n(listing relevant factors in inquiry).                 Whether at some point the\n\nstop matured into a de facto arrest could perhaps be debated, but no\n\nfurther admission was secured from Parker.\n\n              As it happens, neither Parker's admission nor the smell of\n\nmarijuana was necessary to the warrant, which was amply supported by\n\nprobable cause based on the threatening of Davis and the tracing of\n\nthe   truck    to   the   motel.       And,    under    governing     Supreme      Court\n\nprecedent, the physical fruits of an otherwise voluntary statement\n\nare admissible against a defendant even if a Miranda warning was\n\nwrongly omitted.          United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630, 641-42\n\n(2004).   Miranda aside, Parker's statement was not \"involuntary\"\n\nunder conventional standards.\n\n                Parker      also   argues     that     the   search      warrant     was\n\nimpermissibly       broad    because    it    allowed    police     to    search     for\n\n\"weapon[s]\" and \"illicit drugs,\" but that there was only probable\n\ncause to support a search for marijuana and a single gun.                    In fact,\n\nDavis had said that two different potential weapons were displayed;\n\nthe third man could have had another weapon.                  In addition to the\n\nmarijuana smoke, there was reason to suspect that the male occupants\n\nmight be connected with unspecified illegal drugs.                       So there was\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f reason here to suppose that other weapons and drugs might well be\n\n found.\n\n             The    warrant    was   particularized--guns     and    drugs   are\n\n certainly   a     defined    class--and   far   broader   classes   have    been\n\n allowed.2   Further, specifying weapons and drugs rather than a gun\n\n and marijuana can hardly have enlarged the intrusiveness of the\n\n search.     Indeed, had the warrant referred only to a gun and\n\n marijuana, the officers would have been entitled to seize other guns\n\n and illegal drugs as suspected contraband if found in plain view in\n\n the course of the narrower search.           See Horton v. California, 496\n\n U.S. 128, 135 (1990).\n\n             Attacking his sentence, Parker says that he should not\n\n have received a consecutive five year mandatory minimum for carrying\n\n or using the gun because the statute so providing, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n 924(c)(1)(A), contains a qualifier that he says applies to him.\n\n Although he did not preserve the argument in the district court or\n\n present it to us in his briefs, it is useful (and does not prejudice\n\n the government) for us to address the claim on the merits.\n\n             The relevant part of section 924(c) states:\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      See, e.g., United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 535-36 (1st\nCir.), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1011 (1999) (warrant allowing search of\nall computer software, hardware, computer disks, or disk drives\nupheld); United States v. Morris, 977 F.2d 677, 680-81 (1st Cir.\n1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 988 (1993) (upholding part of warrant\nauthorizing search for \"all that is relating [sic] to drugs and\nnarcotics\").\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          Except to the extent that a greater minimum\n          sentence   is  otherwise   provided   by   this\n          subsection or by any other provision of law,\n          any person who, during and in relation to any\n          crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . .\n          . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in\n          furtherance of any such crime, possesses a\n          firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n          provided for such crime of violence or drug\n          trafficking crime--\n\n                 (i)   be  sentenced   to   a  term   of\n          imprisonment of not less than 5 years . . . .\n\nSubsections (ii) et seq. provide longer consecutive sentences for\n\nbrandishing or discharge of the gun or the use of certain especially\n\ndangerous weapons like automatic weapons.\n\n          Parker's argument, in expanded form, goes as follows. The\n\n\"except   clause\"    makes   the   five   year   consecutive   sentence\n\ninapplicable where \"a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided\n\nby this subsection or by any other provision of law\"; Parker, by\n\nvirtue of the amount of drugs recovered, was already subject to a\n\nmandatory minimum ten year sentence based on the drug convictions\n\n(actually, two mandatory minimums, served concurrently, see note 1,\n\nabove); and therefore, the consecutive five year sentence is not\n\napplicable to him.\n\n          Parker's reading is suspect on its face because section\n\n924(c)(1)(A)'s supplementary provision (quoted above)--by providing\n\na five year sentence \"in addition to the punishment\" for the\n\npredicate crime--self-evidently intends that one who carries a\n\nfirearm in connection with a serious drug offense should serve a\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f further consecutive sentence of five years.                Further, his reading\n\n would create very odd outcomes.3              A more careful reading defeats\n\n Parker's    suggestion   that    the    statutory    language     compels   such\n\n results.\n\n             The except clause in this case (\"Except to the extent that\n\n a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection\n\n or by any other provision of law\") does not say \"a greater minimum\n\n sentence\" for what; yet it has to have some understood referent to\n\n be intelligible.      Here, the referent could be \"any other crime\n\n related to this case\" or \"the underlying drug crime or crime of\n\n violence.\"    Either of those readings would help Parker; but they,\n\n like any other reading of the phrase, require reading into the\n\n clause a referent not literally expressed. Compare United States v.\n\n Rodriguez, 128 S. Ct. 1783 (2008).\n\n             An alternative (and more sensible) referent is obvious.\n\n Section 924(c) dictates an additional minimum sentence for an\n\n underlying offense because of the presence of the firearm; thus, if\n\n \"a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided\" on account of the\n\n firearm, then under the \"except clause\" that greater minimum might\n\n supercede    the   otherwise    applicable       section    924(c)   adjustment.\n\n\n\n     3\n      For example, Parker would avoid the extra five years here\nbecause the ten year drug sentence stemmed from a mandatory\nprovision; but he would serve the five years if given a ten year\nsentence--or even a higher one--for a drug offense or violent crime\nbased not on a mandatory minimum provision but merely on the\nguidelines and trial judge's exercise of judgment.\n\n                                        -12-\n\f Conceivably, Congress wished to avoid a double increment for the\n\n same firearm, so this is at least a plausible reading, while\n\n Parker's suggested readings are implausible based on the statutory\n\n purpose. See generally Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 315-16\n\n (1998).\n\n            That very double-counting danger was arguably present in\n\n United States v. Whitley, 529 F.3d 150 (2d Cir. 2008), on which\n\n Parker principally relies.      There the defendant was convicted and\n\n sentenced for Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, and also subject\n\n to a fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence because he possessed a\n\n firearm in the course of the robbery and had three prior convictions\n\n for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.               18 U.S.C. §§\n\n 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1).

Davis told Duval that she had been threatened by three mentwo black, one whitewho had arrived at the apartment looking for her boyfriend, Richard Post. When told that Post was not there, one of the black males, known to Davis as \"H,\" said that she knew what they wanted and exposed a black firearm in his waistband. The white male, whom she knew as \"Jose,\" was holding a tool with a blade which he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> smacked on his hand. Davis knew the other black male only as \"Q.\"</p>\n<p>The three men, Post's sister told Duval, were looking for Post because he had been dealing drugs, including crack cocaine, and had \"ripped off\" his suppliers. Post's sister also gave Duval the license plate number of the pickup truck the three men were using, and Duval put out an alert for the truck. Shortly thereafter, Officer Gould of the Dover, New Hampshire, Police Department located the truck, still warm, at a Dover motel just over the line from Somersworth. Duval and another Somersworth officer joined Gould and another Dover officer at the motel.</p>\n<p>The night clerk told the officers that three men matching Davis' description had entered the motel shortly before and had gone to Room 419, rented for cash by Kimberly Holland. The clerk also said that Holland had previously rented rooms at the motel and that the clerk suspected the group members of drug dealing. Arriving on the fourth floor, the officers smelled marijuana coming from the room. Their knock produced the sound of movement and whispering inside the room, but no answer.</p>\n<p>Gould then left to consult with a supervisor and Duval knocked again; a black male, Anthony Burnett, opened the door. The other men in the room were later identified as Quenta Parker, a black male, and Juan Feliciano, a light-skinned Hispanic. Duval questioned the men while waiting for Gould to return; this questioning lasted approximately ten to fifteen minutes. Asked by Duval about the incident at Davis' home, Burnett said that they had been visiting a friend; the address he gave was quite near Davis' house. In response to questions about the smell of marijuana, Feliciano admitted that he had \"smoked a joint, but it's all gone.\" All refused the police request for consent to search the room.</p>\n<p>Gould returned and one of the officers asked all four occupants (the men and Holland) for identification and to step outside the room. Gould then spoke privately to Holland, viewing her as having authority to consent to a search. This discussion lasted approximately ten minutes, during which Holland admitted to smoking marijuana but asked to consult with her boyfriend, \"Q\" (Parker). Parker then allegedly admitted that they had smoked marijuana and that there was still some inside the room. But he told Holland not to consent to a search, and she then denied consent.</p>\n<p>The occupants were held at the motel until around midnight when a search warrant was finally secured; this was roughly three to three and a half hours after the decision was made to seek the warrant. A search of the room turned up a small safelater found marked with Parker's fingerprintscontaining a black .32 caliber handgun, two loaded magazines, a holster and ammunition pouch, two knives, several pills, $3000 cash, and approximately 550 grams of crack cocaine. More cash ($2750) was found in a leather jacket in the room. Parker and the two other men were then formally arrested.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Parker for conspiring with Burnett and others to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2006), for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, <i>id.</i> § 841(a)(1), and for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of drug trafficking, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (2006). After an evidentiary hearing, Parker's request to suppress the physical evidence was denied. Parker then pled guilty on all counts, reserving his right to appeal from the denial of his suppression <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> motion, and was sentenced to 195 months in prison.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Parker's first claim on appeal is that requiring him to leave the hotel room was a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, \"the `fruits' of which must be suppressed.\" The district court's findings on the denial of a suppression motion are reviewed for clear error, but its legal determinations are reviewed <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 31 n. 4 (1st Cir.2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> 547 U.S. 1149, 126 S.Ct. 2287, 164 L.Ed.2d 817 (2006). Here, asking Parker to step outside the room was not unlawful; nor, had it been unlawful, would the items seized in the room be suppressed as forbidden fruit.</p>\n<p>The complication in this case is not the initial knock nor the preliminary inquiries, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Cephas,</i> 254 F.3d 488, 493-94 (4th Cir.2001), but rather the request to step outside the room. Such a situation is at the crossroads of two different Fourth Amendment doctrines-one governing ordinary arrests and brief investigative stops; the other, entry into the home. There is some tension between the approaches taken by the Supreme Court in these situations.</p>\n<p>Outside the home, the police can arrest without a warrant anyone who they have probable cause to believe committed a felony, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Carroll v. United States,</i> 267 U.S. 132, 156, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Watson,</i> 423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976); and, merely on \"reasonable suspicion,\" the police can temporarily detain an individual for an investigative inquiry called a <i>Terry</i> stop, <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), whether the suspect is in a car or on foot. <i>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce,</i> 422 U.S. 873, 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975).</p>\n<p>By contrast, the strong presumption is that a warrant based on probable cause is required to justify police entrance into the home or other private quarters, whether to seize property or person. <i>Payton v. New York,</i> 445 U.S. 573, 588-90, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980); <i>Stoner v. California,</i> 376 U.S. 483, 490, 84 S.Ct. 889, 11 L.Ed.2d 856 (1964). The discrepancy in doctrine as between street and home is narrowed but not eliminated by certain exceptions licensing entry without a warrant, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Samboy,</i> 433 F.3d 154, 158 (1st Cir.2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> 547 U.S. 1118, 126 S.Ct. 1926, 164 L.Ed.2d 676 (2006) (exigent circumstances); <i>United States v. Luciano,</i> 329 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2003) (consent).</p>\n<p>The closest precedent in our circuit is <i>United States v. Beaudoin,</i> 362 F.3d 60, 69-70 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 543 U.S. 979, 125 S.Ct. 484, 160 L.Ed.2d 357 (2004), <i>vacated on other grounds sub. nom. </i><i>Champagne v. United States,</i> 543 U.S. 1102, 125 S.Ct. 1025, 160 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2005). In <i>Beaudoin,</i> we held (albeit by a divided vote) that no warrant was required for a reasonable police request that the suspect step out of his hotel room. We deemed the intrusion on privacy of such a direction to be real but modest, especially when weighed against the risk to police officers, and stressed the analogy to the <i>Terry</i> stop cases allowing investigative stops on the street.</p>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Beaudoin,</i> the men inside the room were reasonably suspected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> of involvement in a felony (the threatening of Davis) and of possessing a gun. Indeed, although the crime at issue was less serious than in <i>Beaudoin,</i> the evidence pointing to Parker's involvement in it and the likelihood of his having a weapon were much stronger, as in <i>Beaudoin</i> police were acting merely on an anonymous tip. <i>Id.</i> at 62. Summoning Parker and the other men to step outside the hotel room was thus justified as a means of protecting the police while they pursued the investigation and of securing the weapon and other possible evidence when they decided to seek a warrant.</p>\n<p>Having the men outside the room, the police could perhaps have arrested them on the spot. Davis' statement provided probable cause, not mere suspicion, to arrest the men who had threatened her; and the tracing of the truck to the motel and the desk clerk's identification point to the men in Room 419 as the culprits. But absent exigent circumstances, <i>Samboy,</i> 433 F.3d at 158, or consent, <i>Luciano,</i> 329 F.3d at 7, the police still needed a warrant to search the room for physical evidence. So, reasonably enough they awaited the warrant and the confirmation provided by the gun, drugs and money before making formal arrests.</p>\n<p>Finally, even if Parker had been unlawfully seized, the later seizure of the safe would still not have been suppressible \"fruits\" of Parker's seizure. The warrant already in contemplation would inevitably have led to the safe being seized and searched, <i>Nix v. Williams,</i> 467 U.S. 431, 444, 446, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984), there being probable cause for the warrant without regard to anything said by Parker. <i>United States v. Ford,</i> 22 F.3d 374, 379-80 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 513 U.S. 900, 115 S.Ct. 257, 130 L.Ed.2d 177 (1994). While awaiting the warrant the police were entitled to prevent the safe's removal. <i>Illinois v. McArthur,</i> 531 U.S. 326, 331-33, 121 S.Ct. 946, 148 L.Ed.2d 838 (2001).</p>\n<p>Parker next argues that, quite apart from the seizure, \"[t]he failure to give [him and Holland] the warnings set forth in <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i> [, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)], prior to interrogating them was unlawful, and thus requires that the information they provided ... as well as the `fruits' thereof, be suppressed.\" He then contests the scope and duration of the initial encounter and the voluntariness of anything he said.</p>\n<p>The questioning of Parker was not unlawful. Parker's admission to smoking a joint of marijuana occurred early in the period of detention and, under the <i>Terry</i> line of cases, it was not the result of a custodial \"interrogation\" of the kind requiring <i>Miranda</i> protection. <i>United States v. Trueber,</i> 238 F.3d 79, 93 (1st Cir.2001). <i>Trueber</i> holds that <i>Miranda</i> warnings are not required for \"a brief period of detention\" during which the police seek \"by means of a moderate number of questions to determine [a suspect's] identity and to obtain information confirming or dispelling their suspicions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In this case, the motel was a neutral environment, there was no testimony that Parker was physically restrained, and the questioning was limited, being prompted in part by Parker's girlfriend, who insisted that Parker be consulted before consent to search could be given. <i>See generally </i><i>United States v. Nishnianidze,</i> 342 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1132, 124 S.Ct. 1107, 157 L.Ed.2d 936 (2004) (listing relevant factors in inquiry). Whether at some point the stop matured into a <i>de facto</i> arrest could perhaps be debated, but no further admission was secured from Parker.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> As it happens, neither Parker's admission nor the smell of marijuana was necessary to the warrant, which was amply supported by probable cause based on the threatening of Davis and the tracing of the truck to the motel. And, under governing Supreme Court precedent, the physical fruits of an otherwise voluntary statement <i>are</i> admissible against a defendant even if a <i>Miranda</i> warning was wrongly omitted. <i>United States v. Patane,</i> 542 U.S. 630, 641-42, 124 S.Ct. 2620, 159 L.Ed.2d 667 (2004). <i>Miranda</i> aside, Parker's statement was not \"involuntary\" under conventional standards.</p>\n<p>Parker also argues that the search warrant was impermissibly broad because it allowed police to search for \"weapon[s]\" and \"illicit drugs,\" but that there was only probable cause to support a search for marijuana and a single gun. In fact, Davis had said that two different potential weapons were displayed; the third man could have had another weapon. In addition to the marijuana smoke, there was reason to suspect that the male occupants might be connected with unspecified illegal drugs. So there was reason here to suppose that other weapons and drugs might well be found.</p>\n<p>The warrant was particularizedguns and drugs are certainly a defined class and far broader classes have been allowed.<sup>[2]</sup> Further, specifying weapons and drugs rather than a gun and marijuana can hardly have enlarged the intrusiveness of the search. Indeed, had the warrant referred only to a gun and marijuana, the officers would have been entitled to seize other guns and illegal drugs as suspected contraband if found in plain view in the course of the narrower search. <i>See </i><i>Horton v. California,</i> 496 U.S. 128, 135, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990).</p>\n<p>Attacking his sentence, Parker says that he should not have received a consecutive five year mandatory minimum for carrying or using the gun because the statute so providing, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), contains a qualifier that he says applies to him. Although he did not preserve the argument in the district court or present it to us in his briefs, it is useful (and does not prejudice the government) for us to address the claim on the merits.</p>\n<p>The relevant part of section 924(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote>Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years....</blockquote>\n<p>Subsections (ii) <i>et seq.</i> provide longer consecutive sentences for brandishing or discharge of the gun or the use of certain especially dangerous weapons like automatic weapons.</p>\n<p>Parker's argument, in expanded form, goes as follows. The \"except clause\" makes the five year consecutive sentence inapplicable where \"a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this sub-section <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> or by any other provision of law\"; Parker, by virtue of the amount of drugs recovered, was already subject to a mandatory minimum ten year sentence based on the drug convictions (actually, two mandatory minimums, served concurrently, see note 1, above); and therefore, the consecutive five year sentence is not applicable to him.</p>\n<p>Parker's reading is suspect on its face because section 924(c)(1)(A)'s supplementary provision (quoted above)by providing a five year sentence \"in addition to the punishment\" for the predicate crime self-evidently intends that one who carries a firearm in connection with a serious drug offense should serve a further consecutive sentence of five years. Further, his reading would create very odd outcomes.<sup>[3]</sup> A more careful reading defeats Parker's suggestion that the statutory language compels such results.</p>\n<p>The except clause in this case (\"Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law\") does not say \"a greater minimum sentence\" <i>for what;</i> yet it has to have <i>some</i> understood referent to be intelligible. Here, the referent could be \"any other crime related to this case\" or \"the underlying drug crime or crime of violence.\" Either of those readings would help Parker; but they, like any other reading of the phrase, require reading <i>into</i> the clause a referent not literally expressed. <i>Compare </i><i>United States v. Rodriquez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008).</p>\n<p>An alternative (and more sensible) referent is obvious. Section 924(c) dictates an additional minimum sentence for an underlying offense <i>because</i> of the presence of the firearm; thus, if \"a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided\" <i>on account of the firearm,</i> then under the \"except clause\" that greater minimum might supercede the otherwise applicable section 924(c) adjustment. Conceivably, Congress wished to avoid a double increment for the same firearm, so this is at least a plausible reading, while Parker's suggested readings are implausible based on the statutory purpose. <i>See generally </i><i>Caron v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 308, 315-16, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998).</p>\n<p>That very double-counting danger was arguably present in <i>United States v. Whitley,</i> 529 F.3d 150 (2d Cir.2008), on which Parker principally relies. There the defendant was convicted and sentenced for Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, and also subject to a fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence because he possessed a firearm in the course of the robbery and had three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1). Application of section 924(c), which the <i>Whitley</i> court disallowed, would have imposed a <i>further</i> ten year consecutive sentence for discharge of <i>the same gun</i> in the same robbery. 529 F.3d at 151-53, 158.</p>\n<p>Because double counting was threatened, <i>Whitley</i> is easily distinguishable from our own case, and the remaining circuit precedents are adverse to Parker: other circuits have rejected any reading of the \"except\" clause that would reach our case and, indeed, some of the circuits would squarely reject <i>Whitley.</i><sup>[4]</sup> We need <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> not decide how the <i>Whitley</i> problem would be resolved in this circuit: it is enough that no double counting of the gun is presented here. <i>Cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex.</i></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Parker was sentenced to 135 months for each of the two drug counts (each carried a mandatory minimum term of ten years, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846), to be served concurrently, and to sixty months on the gun count to be served consecutively (the mandatory minimum, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Upham,</i> 168 F.3d 532, 535-36 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 527 U.S. 1011, 119 S.Ct. 2353, 144 L.Ed.2d 249 (1999) (warrant allowing search of all computer software, hardware, computer disks, or disk drives upheld); <i>United States v. Morris,</i> 977 F.2d 677, 680-81 (1st Cir. 1992), <i>cert. denied,</i> 507 U.S. 988, 113 S.Ct. 1588, 123 L.Ed.2d 155 (1993) (upholding part of warrant authorizing search for \"all that is relating [sic] to drugs and narcotics\").</p>\n<p>[3]  For example, Parker would avoid the extra five years here because the ten year drug sentence stemmed from a mandatory provision; but he would serve the five years if given a ten year sentenceor even a higher onefor a drug offense or violent crime based not on a mandatory minimum provision but merely on the guidelines and trial judge's exercise of judgment.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>United States v.

In <i>Beaudoin,</i> we held (albeit by a divided vote) that no warrant was required for a reasonable police request that the suspect step out of his hotel room. We deemed the intrusion on privacy of such a direction to be real but modest, especially when weighed against the risk to police officers, and stressed the analogy to the <i>Terry</i> stop cases allowing investigative stops on the street.</p>\n<p>Here, as in <i>Beaudoin,</i> the men inside the room were reasonably suspected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> of involvement in a felony (the threatening of Davis) and of possessing a gun. Indeed, although the crime at issue was less serious than in <i>Beaudoin,</i> the evidence pointing to Parker's involvement in it and the likelihood of his having a weapon were much stronger, as in <i>Beaudoin</i> police were acting merely on an anonymous tip. <i>Id.</i> at 62. Summoning Parker and the other men to step outside the hotel room was thus justified as a means of protecting the police while they pursued the investigation and of securing the weapon and other possible evidence when they decided to seek a warrant.</p>\n<p>Having the men outside the room, the police could perhaps have arrested them on the spot. Davis' statement provided probable cause, not mere suspicion, to arrest the men who had threatened her; and the tracing of the truck to the motel and the desk clerk's identification point to the men in Room 419 as the culprits. But absent exigent circumstances, <i>Samboy,</i> 433 F.3d at 158, or consent, <i>Luciano,</i> 329 F.3d at 7, the police still needed a warrant to search the room for physical evidence. So, reasonably enough they awaited the warrant and the confirmation provided by the gun, drugs and money before making formal arrests.</p>\n<p>Finally, even if Parker had been unlawfully seized, the later seizure of the safe would still not have been suppressible \"fruits\" of Parker's seizure. The warrant already in contemplation would inevitably have led to the safe being seized and searched, <i>Nix v.

Parker's admission to smoking a joint of marijuana occurred early in the period of detention and, under the <i>Terry</i> line of cases, it was not the result of a custodial \"interrogation\" of the kind requiring <i>Miranda</i> protection. <i>United States v.

And, under governing Supreme Court precedent, the physical fruits of an otherwise voluntary statement <i>are</i> admissible against a defendant even if a <i>Miranda</i> warning was wrongly omitted. <i>United States v.

In fact, Davis had said that two different potential weapons were displayed; the third man could have had another weapon. In addition to the marijuana smoke, there was reason to suspect that the male occupants might be connected with unspecified illegal drugs. So there was reason here to suppose that other weapons and drugs might well be found.</p>\n<p>The warrant was particularizedguns and drugs are certainly a defined class and far broader classes have been allowed.<sup>[2]</sup> Further, specifying weapons and drugs rather than a gun and marijuana can hardly have enlarged the intrusiveness of the search. Indeed, had the warrant referred only to a gun and marijuana, the officers would have been entitled to seize other guns and illegal drugs as suspected contraband if found in plain view in the course of the narrower search. <i>See </i><i>Horton v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 135, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span> (1990).</p>\n<p>Attacking his sentence, Parker says that he should not have received a consecutive five year mandatory minimum for carrying or using the gun because the statute so providing, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), contains a qualifier that he says applies to him. Although he did not preserve the argument in the district court or present it to us in his briefs, it is useful (and does not prejudice the government) for us to address the claim on the merits.</p>\n<p>The relevant part of section 924(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote>Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years....</blockquote>\n<p>Subsections (ii) <i>et seq.</i> provide longer consecutive sentences for brandishing or discharge of the gun or the use of certain especially dangerous weapons like automatic weapons.</p>\n<p>Parker's argument, in expanded form, goes as follows. The \"except clause\" makes the five year consecutive sentence inapplicable where \"a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this sub-section <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> or by any other provision of law\"; Parker, by virtue of the amount of drugs recovered, was already subject to a mandatory minimum ten year sentence based on the drug convictions (actually, two mandatory minimums, served concurrently, see note 1, above); and therefore, the consecutive five year sentence is not applicable to him.</p>\n<p>Parker's reading is suspect on its face because section 924(c)(1)(A)'s supplementary provision (quoted above)by providing a five year sentence \"in addition to the punishment\" for the predicate crime self-evidently intends that one who carries a firearm in connection with a serious drug offense should serve a further consecutive sentence of five years. Further, his reading would create very odd outcomes.<sup>[3]</sup> A more careful reading defeats Parker's suggestion that the statutory language compels such results.</p>\n<p>The except clause in this case (\"Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law\") does not say \"a greater minimum sentence\" <i>for what;</i> yet it has to have <i>some</i> understood referent to be intelligible. Here, the referent could be \"any other crime related to this case\" or \"the underlying drug crime or crime of violence.\" Either of those readings would help Parker; but they, like any other reading of the phrase, require reading <i>into</i> the clause a referent not literally expressed. <i>Compare </i><i>United States v. Rodriquez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145808\"><a href=\"/opinion/145808/united-states-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span> (2008).</p>\n<p>An alternative (and more sensible) referent is obvious. Section 924(c) dictates an additional minimum sentence for an underlying offense <i>because</i> of the presence of the firearm; thus, if \"a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided\" <i>on account of the firearm,</i> then under the \"except clause\" that greater minimum might supercede the otherwise applicable section 924(c) adjustment. Conceivably, Congress wished to avoid a double increment for the same firearm, so this is at least a plausible reading, while Parker's suggested readings are implausible based on the statutory purpose. <i>See generally </i><i>Caron v.

There the defendant was convicted and sentenced for Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, and also subject to a fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence because he possessed a firearm in the course of the robbery and had three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1). Application of section 924(c), which the <i>Whitley</i> court disallowed, would have imposed a <i>further</i> ten year consecutive sentence for discharge of <i>the same gun</i> in the same robbery. 529 F.3d at 151-53, 158.</p>\n<p>Because double counting was threatened, <i>Whitley</i> is easily distinguishable from our own case, and the remaining circuit precedents are adverse to Parker: other circuits have rejected any reading of the \"except\" clause that would reach our case and, indeed, some of the circuits would squarely reject <i>Whitley.</i><sup>[4]</sup> We need <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> not decide how the <i>Whitley</i> problem would be resolved in this circuit: it is enough that no double counting of the gun is presented here. <i>Cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex.</i></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Parker was sentenced to 135 months for each of the two drug counts (each carried a mandatory minimum term of ten years, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846), to be served concurrently, and to sixty months on the gun count to be served consecutively (the mandatory minimum, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.
