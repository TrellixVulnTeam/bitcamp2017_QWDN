Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n              Boudin, Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     José R. Olmo-Rodríguez on brief for appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Chief, Appellate\nDivision), and Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 31, 2009\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge.               A jury found defendant-appellant\n\nAdalberto Carrasquillo-Carmona guilty of carjacking a motor vehicle\n\nwith intent to cause death or serious bodily injury.                        See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119(2).         The district court imposed a 108-month incarcerative\n\nsentence.      This timely appeal followed.\n\n              We    start     with    the       relevant     factual      and    procedural\n\nbackground.         The government proved at trial that on November 13,\n\n2005, the appellant had a chance encounter with a family friend and\n\ndistant relative, Justo Pérez García, at a car wash.                            The friend,\n\nfamiliarly known as \"Poto,\" gave the appellant a ride home after\n\nthe pair made a long, wet stop at a bar.                    Near the end of the trip,\n\nthe    appellant         attacked    Poto       with   a   lug-wrench,      stole    Poto's\n\nvehicle, and drove away.                The caper ended when the appellant\n\ncrashed into a church and abandoned the wrecked car.\n\n              Poto subsequently filed a complaint with the Federal\n\nBureau   of    Investigation.              In    short     order,   the    appellant    was\n\narrested; waived his Miranda rights, see Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n\nU.S.    436,       444    (1966);     and       made   a   number    of    incriminating\n\nstatements.        Eventually, he wrote and signed a full confession.\n\n              In    due     course,    a    federal        grand    jury   indicted    the\n\nappellant for carjacking.             After his counsel moved unsuccessfully\n\nto suppress the confession and other inculpatory statements on\n\ngrounds not relevant here, the appellant went to trial.                           The jury\n\nfound him guilty.           The district court sentenced him at the bottom\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fof the applicable guideline sentencing range (GSR): 108 months in\n\nprison.\n\n            The appellant's principal claim of error is premised on\n\nthe allegedly ineffective assistance provided by his trial counsel.\n\nThis claim focuses on counsel's failure to offer into evidence at\n\nthe     suppression    hearing     a    report      of   a    neuropsychological\n\nevaluation.    The report, prepared at the behest of trial counsel,\n\ndiscloses that the appellant has an intelligence quotient (IQ) of\n\n62 — an IQ in the mentally retarded range — and that he suffers\n\nfrom \"mild to moderate\" cognitive impairments.\n\n            Before us, the appellant points out that voluntariness\n\nwas a sine qua non to the admissibility of his confession and other\n\nstatements at trial.       Building on this foundation, he argues that\n\ntrial    counsel's    failure     to   introduce     this    report   constituted\n\nineffective assistance because that report reflected adversely on\n\nthe voluntariness of his confession and other statements.\n\n            The standard for gauging claims of ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel is familiar.          See, e.g., Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 686-87 (1984); Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     The proponent must show both sub-par performance on\n\ncounsel's part and substantial prejudice attributable thereto.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Ouber, 293 F.3d at 25.\n\n            Here,     however,    we   do     not   reach    the   merits   of   the\n\nappellant's claim.       \"We have held with a regularity bordering on\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance\n\ncannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,\n\nbut, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by,\n\nthe trial court.\"         United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (collecting cases).              This prudential principle rests on\n\nthe truism that \"the trial judge, by reason of his familiarity with\n\nthe case, is usually in the best position to assess both the\n\nquality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in\n\nthe   district     court       and   the    impact    of    any     shortfall      in    that\n\nrepresentation.\"         Id.\n\n            The case at hand is a poster child for the application of\n\nthis prudential principle.             The record, as presently constituted,\n\nleaves too much to the imagination.\n\n            For    one    thing,      the    record    does       not   offer     any    real\n\nguidance as to the crucial question of why the appellant's trial\n\ncounsel decided not to present either the report or its author at\n\nthe suppression hearing.             At this point, it is impossible to tell,\n\nexcept through speculation and surmise, whether counsel's decision\n\nwas a strategic choice or an oversight.\n\n            For another thing, the record is equally undeveloped as\n\nto prejudice.      Assuming, for argument's sake, that the failure to\n\nraise the question of mental capacity at the suppression hearing\n\nbetokened     deficient         performance,      we       cannot       tell,    short     of\n\nconjecture,       whether      that    failure       prejudiced         the     appellant's\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsubstantive rights. After all, while the appellant is correct that\n\nvoluntariness   is   a   sine   qua   non   to   the   admissibility   of   a\n\nconfession, Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167 (1986), an\n\nassessment of voluntariness requires an appraisal of the totality\n\nof the circumstances. See United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281,\n\n286 (1st Cir. 2003).     The district court's views about the effect\n\nof the report on the totality of the circumstances (and, thus, on\n\nthe court's finding of voluntariness) is essential to a reasoned\n\ndetermination of the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nappellant urges us to invoke the rarely used exception to the\n\nprinciple that claims of ineffective assistance must make their\n\ndebut in the district court.          That exception applies \"when the\n\ncritical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.\"           Mala, 7\n\nF.3d at 1063.\n\n          The appellant has not satisfied these criteria.               The\n\nrecord is not fully fleshed out, and only the district court — not\n\nthis court — has the institutional competence to gather the needed\n\nsupplementation.     See United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 10-11\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Given the gaps in the record and the myriad uncertainties\n\nthat exist, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be\n\nresolved on a better-developed record.           See, e.g., id. (declining\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fto hear a claim of ineffective assistance, raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal, when the record was unclear as to whether counsel's\n\nchallenged decision when made, \"was a calculated stratagem or a\n\nmere oversight\").     Thus, we have no principled choice but to\n\ndismiss this assignment of error.           We do so, however, without\n\nprejudice to the appellant's pursuit of his ineffective assistance\n\nclaim through a petition filed in the district court under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255. Moreover, because we believe that the appellant has\n\narticulated a facially plausible claim of ineffectiveness, we\n\nadvise the district court that, if such a petition ensues, the\n\nappointment   of   counsel   would    be   warranted.1   See   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3006A(a)(2)(B) (stipulating that, if \"the interests of justice so\n\nrequire, representation may be provided for a financially eligible\n\nperson\" seeking relief under section 2255); see also Mala, 7 F.3d\n\nat 1063-64 (delineating criteria for such appointments).\n\n          The appellant's remaining ground of appeal is a claim of\n\nsentencing error, which also relates to his mental retardation. He\n\ncontends that, had the district court given due weight to his\n\ndiminished mental capacity, it would have sentenced him below the\n\nbottom of the GSR.     See USSG §5K2.13 (providing that diminished\n\nmental capacity may serve as a basis for a downward departure).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       This is in no way a finding on the merits but, rather, an\nacknowledgment that the appellant has limned a colorable claim.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            To begin, this argument is procedurally defaulted: the\n\nappellant   makes   it     for   the     first   time    in    this      court.     The\n\ngovernment asserts that this omission amounts to a waiver.\n\n            Based   on    the    record,     waiver     is    not   an    implausible\n\nconclusion.      During the disposition hearing, the district court\n\nspecifically inquired whether the appellant had any objections to\n\nthe findings set out in the presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport).    Defense counsel replied in the negative, even though the\n\nPSI Report made no reference either to the appellant's IQ or to his\n\nmental retardation. In somewhat the same vein, counsel never moved\n\nfor a downward departure on any ground approximating diminished\n\nmental capacity.        This background might well support a finding of\n\nwaiver.    See, e.g., United States v. Rodríguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (differentiating between waiver and forfeiture and\n\nfinding a waiver).\n\n            We   need    not    decide   that    question.          As   framed,    the\n\nappellant's argument boils down to a complaint that the sentencing\n\ncourt should have departed sua sponte.              We confronted just such an\n\nargument, in a nearly identical posture, in United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Castillo,       350    F.3d    1   (1st   Cir.      2003).2      There,    we\n\ndiscussed the possibility of waiver but assumed instead, favorably\n\n\n\n     2\n       The facts in the instant case are even stronger in favor of\nwaiver than those in Rodríguez-Castillo.    Here, the appellant's\ncounsel affirmatively accepted the findings contained in the PSI\nReport.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fto the appellant, that the failure to raise the argument was merely\n\na forfeiture.      Id. at 5-6.    Thus, we afforded review for plain\n\nerror.     Id. at 6.   We follow that lead and apply the plain-error\n\nstandard here.\n\n            To satisfy this standard, the appellant must show: \"(1)\n\nthat an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not\n\nonly (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"       United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).       This standard is not appellant-friendly.             \"A\n\nparty who aspires to demonstrate plain error faces a steep uphill\n\nclimb.\"    United States v. Jiménez, 512 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The appellant's case fails to clear any of the four\n\nhurdles    that   collectively   comprise     the   plain-error     standard.\n\nBecause an appellant must satisfy all four of the prescribed\n\nelements to establish plain error, Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60, it\n\nsuffices    for   present   purposes    to   discuss   only   the   first   two\n\nelements (which typically are conjoined).\n\n            The record makes manifest that at no point during the\n\ndisposition hearing did the sentencing court disregard or ignore\n\nevidence describing a diminished mental capacity or suggesting the\n\nappellant's retardation.      To the contrary, the court scrupulously\n\nconsidered the appellant's personal characteristics as illuminated\n\nby the record, including his history of drug abuse.           The court also\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fweighed the appellant's contention that his particular crime was\n\natypical. Given that departures from a properly calculated GSR are\n\ndiscretionary, see, e.g., United States v. Quiñones-Medina, 553\n\nF.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 2009), we cannot find any error — let alone\n\nclear or obvious error — in the district court's failure to depart\n\nsua sponte from the GSR.   See Rodríguez-Castillo, 350 F.3d at 5-6.\n\nAccordingly, we reject the appellant's claim of sentencing error.3\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the judgment appealed from, without prejudice to the\n\nappellant's right to raise claims of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel in a separate proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We take no view on whether the appellant, as part of a claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in a subsequent section 2255\npetition, may allege that trial counsel's failure to raise\ndiminished mental capacity as a ground for either a departure or a\nvariance at sentencing constituted ineffective representation.\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

The proponent must show both sub-par performance on\n\ncounsel's part and substantial prejudice attributable thereto.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Ouber, 293 F.3d at 25.\n\n            Here,     however,    we   do     not   reach    the   merits   of   the\n\nappellant's claim.       \"We have held with a regularity bordering on\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance\n\ncannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,\n\nbut, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by,\n\nthe trial court.\"         United States v. Mala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (collecting cases).              This prudential principle rests on\n\nthe truism that \"the trial judge, by reason of his familiarity with\n\nthe case, is usually in the best position to assess both the\n\nquality of the legal representation afforded to the defendant in\n\nthe   district     court       and   the    impact    of    any     shortfall      in    that\n\nrepresentation.\"         Id.\n\n            The case at hand is a poster child for the application of\n\nthis prudential principle.             The record, as presently constituted,\n\nleaves too much to the imagination.\n\n            For    one    thing,      the    record    does       not   offer     any    real\n\nguidance as to the crucial question of why the appellant's trial\n\ncounsel decided not to present either the report or its author at\n\nthe suppression hearing.             At this point, it is impossible to tell,\n\nexcept through speculation and surmise, whether counsel's decision\n\nwas a strategic choice or an oversight.\n\n            For another thing, the record is equally undeveloped as\n\nto prejudice.      Assuming, for argument's sake, that the failure to\n\nraise the question of mental capacity at the suppression hearing\n\nbetokened     deficient         performance,      we       cannot       tell,    short     of\n\nconjecture,       whether      that    failure       prejudiced         the     appellant's\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsubstantive rights. After all, while the appellant is correct that\n\nvoluntariness   is   a   sine   qua   non   to   the   admissibility   of   a\n\nconfession, Colorado v. Connelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111779\"><a href=\"/opinion/111779/colorado-v-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (1986), an\n\nassessment of voluntariness requires an appraisal of the totality\n\nof the circumstances. See United States v. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200712\"><a href=\"/opinion/200712/united-states-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n286 (1st Cir. 2003).     The district court's views about the effect\n\nof the report on the totality of the circumstances (and, thus, on\n\nthe court's finding of voluntariness) is essential to a reasoned\n\ndetermination of the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nappellant urges us to invoke the rarely used exception to the\n\nprinciple that claims of ineffective assistance must make their\n\ndebut in the district court.          That exception applies \"when the\n\ncritical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.\"           Mala, 7\n\nF.3d at 1063.\n\n          The appellant has not satisfied these criteria.               The\n\nrecord is not fully fleshed out, and only the district court — not\n\nthis court — has the institutional competence to gather the needed\n\nsupplementation.     See United States v. Moran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201379\"><a href=\"/opinion/201379/united-states-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10-11\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Given the gaps in the record and the myriad uncertainties\n\nthat exist, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be\n\nresolved on a better-developed record.           See, e.g., id. (declining\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fto hear a claim of ineffective assistance, raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal, when the record was unclear as to whether counsel's\n\nchallenged decision when made, \"was a calculated stratagem or a\n\nmere oversight\").     Thus, we have no principled choice but to\n\ndismiss this assignment of error.           We do so, however, without\n\nprejudice to the appellant's pursuit of his ineffective assistance\n\nclaim through a petition filed in the district court under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255. Moreover, because we believe that the appellant has\n\narticulated a facially plausible claim of ineffectiveness, we\n\nadvise the district court that, if such a petition ensues, the\n\nappointment   of   counsel   would    be   warranted.1   See   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3006A(a)(2)(B) (stipulating that, if \"the interests of justice so\n\nrequire, representation may be provided for a financially eligible\n\nperson\" seeking relief under section 2255); see also Mala, 7 F.3d\n\nat 1063-64 (delineating criteria for such appointments).\n\n          The appellant's remaining ground of appeal is a claim of\n\nsentencing error, which also relates to his mental retardation. He\n\ncontends that, had the district court given due weight to his\n\ndiminished mental capacity, it would have sentenced him below the\n\nbottom of the GSR.     See USSG §5K2.13 (providing that diminished\n\nmental capacity may serve as a basis for a downward departure).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       This is in no way a finding on the merits but, rather, an\nacknowledgment that the appellant has limned a colorable claim.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            To begin, this argument is procedurally defaulted: the\n\nappellant   makes   it     for   the     first   time    in    this      court.     The\n\ngovernment asserts that this omission amounts to a waiver.\n\n            Based   on    the    record,     waiver     is    not   an    implausible\n\nconclusion.      During the disposition hearing, the district court\n\nspecifically inquired whether the appellant had any objections to\n\nthe findings set out in the presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport).    Defense counsel replied in the negative, even though the\n\nPSI Report made no reference either to the appellant's IQ or to his\n\nmental retardation. In somewhat the same vein, counsel never moved\n\nfor a downward departure on any ground approximating diminished\n\nmental capacity.        This background might well support a finding of\n\nwaiver.    See, e.g., United States v. Rodríguez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (differentiating between waiver and forfeiture and\n\nfinding a waiver).\n\n            We   need    not    decide   that    question.          As   framed,    the\n\nappellant's argument boils down to a complaint that the sentencing\n\ncourt should have departed sua sponte.              We confronted just such an\n\nargument, in a nearly identical posture, in United States v.\n\nRodríguez-Castillo,       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200730\"><a href=\"/opinion/200730/united-states-v-rodriguez-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st   Cir.      2003).2      There,    we\n\ndiscussed the possibility of waiver but assumed instead, favorably\n\n\n\n     2\n       The facts in the instant case are even stronger in favor of\nwaiver than those in Rodríguez-Castillo.    Here, the appellant's\ncounsel affirmatively accepted the findings contained in the PSI\nReport.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fto the appellant, that the failure to raise the argument was merely\n\na forfeiture.      Id. at 5-6.    Thus, we afforded review for plain\n\nerror.     Id. at 6.   We follow that lead and apply the plain-error\n\nstandard here.\n\n            To satisfy this standard, the appellant must show: \"(1)\n\nthat an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not\n\nonly (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"       United States v. Duarte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).       This standard is not appellant-friendly.             \"A\n\nparty who aspires to demonstrate plain error faces a steep uphill\n\nclimb.\"    United States v. Jiménez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203091\"><a href=\"/opinion/203091/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The appellant's case fails to clear any of the four\n\nhurdles    that   collectively   comprise     the   plain-error     standard.\n\nBecause an appellant must satisfy all four of the prescribed\n\nelements to establish plain error, Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60, it\n\nsuffices    for   present   purposes    to   discuss   only   the   first   two\n\nelements (which typically are conjoined).\n\n            The record makes manifest that at no point during the\n\ndisposition hearing did the sentencing court disregard or ignore\n\nevidence describing a diminished mental capacity or suggesting the\n\nappellant's retardation.      To the contrary, the court scrupulously\n\nconsidered the appellant's personal characteristics as illuminated\n\nby the record, including his history of drug abuse.           The court also\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fweighed the appellant's contention that his particular crime was\n\natypical. Given that departures from a properly calculated GSR are\n\ndiscretionary, see, e.g., United States v. Quiñones-Medina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203622\"><a href=\"/opinion/203622/united-states-v-quinones-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1st Cir. 2009), we cannot find any error — let alone\n\nclear or obvious error — in the district court's failure to depart\n\nsua sponte from the GSR.   See Rodríguez-Castillo, 350 F.3d at 5-6.\n\nAccordingly, we reject the appellant's claim of sentencing error.3\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the judgment appealed from, without prejudice to the\n\nappellant's right to raise claims of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel in a separate proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We take no view on whether the appellant, as part of a claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in a subsequent section 2255\npetition, may allege that trial counsel's failure to raise\ndiminished mental capacity as a ground for either a departure or a\nvariance at sentencing constituted ineffective representation.\n\n                                -9-\n\f</pre>",
