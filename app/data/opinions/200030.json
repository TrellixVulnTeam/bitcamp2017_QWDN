McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 16, 2002\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.            Defendant-appellant Steven K.\n\nBrown   pled    guilty    to     nine   offenses,    including   kidnapping    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1).                On appeal, Brown seeks to\n\nvacate his kidnapping conviction, arguing that the indictment\n\nfailed to allege a necessary element of the kidnapping offense\n\nunder which he was sentenced.              Even assuming the indictment was\n\nwanting in some regard, Brown's appeal must fail because he cannot\n\ndemonstrate     that     the   indictment's       error   prejudiced    him.   We\n\ntherefore affirm his conviction.\n\n                               FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n           Armed with knives, a shotgun, and an assault rifle,\nSteven Brown and Patricia Teeter drove from New York to Lebanon,\nMaine on March 28, 1999.          After finding the home of the appellant's\n\nex-wife, Deborah Brown, the travelers hatched a murderous plot.\nThey planned to have Teeter lure the residents of Deborah Brown's\nhome, one by one, to an abandoned car, where Steven Brown would be\n\nwaiting to kill them.\n           Under the pretext of needing help with her car, Teeter\npersuaded Deborah Brown's brother, Donald Wood, to accompany her to\nthe abandoned vehicle.         As Wood unsuspectingly approached the car,\n\nthe appellant emerged unnoticed from the bushes, hit Wood with a\n\npipe, and fatally stabbed him.\n\n           Immediately         following    the    killing,   Brown    instructed\n\nTeeter to replay the gruesome scene with a new victim.                 Teeter then\n\nreturned   to    the     house    and   lured     Deborah   Brown's    boyfriend,\n\nChristopher Brouillard, to the abandoned car.                 Faithful to their\n\n                                         -2-\n\fplan, Brown hit Brouillard over the head with a pipe, dragged his\n\nbody into the nearby woods, and stabbed him to death.\n\n            Seeking yet another macabre encore, Teeter returned to\nthe house and convinced Deborah Brown to follow her.         Rather than\n\nwalking to the designated location, however, Deborah Brown drove\n\nher car.    As she was approaching the abandoned vehicle, Deborah\nBrown spotted the appellant hiding in the woods and fled back to\n\nher home.   After a brief chase, Brown and Teeter caught the victim\n\nand forced her, at gunpoint, to get into a car with them.            They\n\ndrove Deborah Brown to a motel in New York, where the appellant\n\nsexually assaulted her repeatedly.         Two days later, the New York\n\npolice arrested Brown and Teeter.\n\n            On May 27, 1999, a federal grand jury returned a ten-\ncount indictment against Brown.           Count one alleged that he and\n\nTeeter conspired to kidnap Deborah Brown and to cross state lines\n\nwith the intent to commit various crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 371.   As part of this count, Brown was charged with the deaths of\n\nDonald   Wood   and   Christopher   Brouillard.      Count   two   charged\n\nappellant with kidnapping Deborah Brown, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1201(a)(1); however, count two did not allege that the kidnapping\n\nresulted in the death of any person.          In counts three and four,\n\nBrown was charged with carrying a shotgun and an assault rifle,\n\nrespectively, during and in relation to the other crimes alleged in\n\nthe indictment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2.   Counts five and six alleged that Brown traveled across state\n\nlines -- and caused Deborah Brown to cross state lines -- with the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fintent to harass his ex-spouse and committed a crime of violence\n\nagainst her, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261(a)(1), (a)(2),\n\n(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), and 18 U.S.C. § 2.         In count seven, Brown\nwas charged with engaging in interstate travel with the intent to\n\nplace Deborah Brown in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily\n\ninjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261A, 2261(b)(1), (b)(3),\n(b)(4), and 18 U.S.C. § 2.1      Count nine alleged that Brown crossed\n\nstate lines with the intent to violate a protection order, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2262(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), and\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2.    Lastly, count ten charged Brown with transporting\n\na shotgun in interstate commerce with the intent to commit the\n\nfelonies described in counts one through nine of the indictment, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(b) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n          On November 4, 1999, Brown pleaded guilty to counts one\n\nthrough seven, nine, and ten.        The district court sentenced him to\n\nlife imprisonment on counts five, six, seven, and nine; to sixty\nmonths on count one; to one hundred and twenty months on count ten;\n\nto sixty months on count three; and to sixty months on count four.\n\nWith respect     to   count   two,   the   kidnapping   charge,   the   court\n\ndetermined that since Wood and Brouillard were killed during the\n\nkidnapping, Brown would be sentenced to the mandatory term of life\n\nimprisonment.    Seeking to vacate only his kidnapping conviction,\n\nBrown filed the instant appeal.\n\n\n1\n   Count eight, which charged Brown with crossing state lines with\nthe intent to injure and harass Deborah Brown and place Donald Wood\nin reasonable fear of death and serious injury, was later dismissed\non the government's motion.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                                DISCUSSION\n\n          Under    the     Federal   Rules   of   Criminal   Procedure,   an\n\nindictment must provide \"a plain, concise and definite written\n\nstatement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). The indictment should be specific enough\n\nto notify the defendant of the nature of the accusation against him\n\nand to apprise the court of the facts alleged.               See Russell v.\n\nUnited States, 369 U.S. 749, 766-68 (1962).            Though there is no\n\nprescribed     formula,    \"'[i]t    is   generally   sufficient   that   an\n\nindictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute\nitself,' as long as those words set forth all the elements of the\n\noffense without any uncertainty or ambiguity.\"           United States v.\nSerino, 835 F.2d 924, 929 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting Hamling v.\n\nUnited States, 418 U.S. 87, 117 (1974)).\n\n          Brown argues that his indictment was defective because it\nfailed to allege one of the essential elements of the kidnapping\ncrime under which he was sentenced -- namely, that the death of a\n\nperson resulted.2         Under the relevant portions of the federal\nkidnapping statute, any person who:\n             unlawfully    seizes,   confines,   inveigles,\n             decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and\n             holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any\n             person . . . shall be punished by imprisonment\n             for any term of years or for life and, if the\n             death of any person results, shall be punished\n             by death or life imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Although Brown seeks to dismiss the indictment, we think the\ncase is better characterized as an effort to vacate a plea.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 1201(a).       Brown interprets this statutory language to\n\nmean that the fact that a death results from the kidnapping is not\n\na   sentencing   factor,    but    rather   an   element   of   the   offense.\nTherefore, it must be included in the indictment in order to\n\ncomport with the Constitution.3       See generally Hamling, 418 U.S. at\n\n117-18   (discussing       the    constitutional    requirement       that   an\nindictment contain all the elements of the offense charged). Since\n\nhis   indictment   only    accused    him   of   kidnapping,    and   did    not\n\nspecifically charge him with a kidnapping that resulted in a death,\n\nBrown concludes that he did not receive fair notice of the charges\n\nagainst him and seeks to be reindicted on the kidnapping charge.4\n\n           For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without\n\ndeciding, that the \"death of any person\" as a result of kidnapping\nis an element of the offense, thereby rendering Brown's indictment\n\ndefective for failing to include it.         The omission of an element of\n\nthe offense from an indictment, however, is not automatic grounds\nfor reversal. See United States v. Mojica-Báez, 229 F.3d 292, 310-\n\n12 (1st Cir. 2000).    \"We still must determine whether the defect in\n\n\n3\n   In support of his argument, Brown relies primarily on Castillo\nv. United States, 530 U.S. 120 (2000), in which the Supreme Court\nheld that the statutory sentencing enhancement for using or\npossessing a \"machinegun\" under 18 U.S.C. § 942(c)(1) is an element\nof the offense, rather than a sentencing factor. Castillo, 530\nU.S. at 123-25.\n4\n   The question of when a guilty plea suffices to waive a claim of\ndefect in an indictment is a complex one, hinging on whether the\nclaimed defect is jurisdictional or merely \"factual and\ntheoretical.\" Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d 917, 920 (1st\nCir. 1991). We need not address this issue; we assume, arguendo,\nthat there is no waiver for purposes of this case. We, therefore,\nassess the merits of Brown's claim of defect.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe indictment prejudiced [appellant].\"          United States v. Yefsky,\n\n994 F.2d 885, 894 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing United States v. Fusaro,\n\n708 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1983)).\n           Brown's claim that he was prejudiced by the lack of fair\n\nnotice of the charges against him is \"serious,\" Mojica-Báez, 229\n\nF.3d at 310, and, if true, would \"seriously affect[] the fairness,\nintegrity, and public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\" United\n\nStates v. Murphy, 762 F.2d 1151, 1155 (1st Cir. 1985) (ruling,\n\nwithout   analysis,   that   an   indictment's    failure   to    apprise   a\n\ndefendant of the charges against him is reversible error, even when\n\nthe issue is raised for the first time on appeal).5\n\n           Notwithstanding    his    protestations    to    the   contrary,\n\nBrown's claim that he lacked fair notice of the charges against him\ncannot withstand even the mildest scrutiny.6           First, though the\n\nkidnapping count did not allege that the kidnapping resulted in a\n\n\n5\n   Though we did not specifically characterize this error as a\nstructural one in Murphy, the fact that we treated the error as per\nse prejudicial suggests that it may rise to the level of a\nstructural error. See Mojica-Báez, 229 F.3d at 310 (implying that\nthe lack of fair notice of the charges against a defendant is a\nstructural error that cannot be analyzed under the harmless error\nanalysis).\n6\n   The question of which standard of review to apply to Brown's\nclaim is a disputed issue. Our general rule is that if the issue\nof the alleged defect was not raised below, we review for plain\nerror. See Mojica-Báez, 229 F.3d at 306.       Brown states in his\nbrief that because \"[t]here was no objection to the indictment or\nfacts asserted by the Government at the Rule 11 hearing [,] . . .\nthe court should review this type of error for 'plain error.'\"\nSurprisingly, the government argues in its brief that Brown raised\nthe issue below and, as a result, should face a lower standard of\nreview. Determining what standard of review should apply to this\ncase is academic, as Brown's appeal fails under either the harmless\nerror standard or plain error review.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdeath, the conspiracy count explicitly charged Brown with killing\n\nWood and Brouillard. From the beginning, then, Brown was on notice\n\nthat he was being charged with conduct that included the deaths of\ntwo people.\n\n          Second, Brown knew, before pleading guilty, that he faced\n\nthe mandatory term of life in prison because two people died during\nthe kidnapping.     Before entertaining Brown's guilty plea, the\n\ndistrict court instructed the parties to file briefs on the issue\n\nof whether the \"death of any person\" as a result of kidnapping is\n\nan element of the offense or a sentencing factor.           The court ruled\n\nthat the statutory provision at issue was a sentencing factor and\n\ninformed Brown that if he pleaded guilty to the kidnapping charge,\n\nhe would be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment that\nby statute applies \"if the death of any person results.\"               Thus,\n\nBrown was aware of the charges against him and of the corresponding\n\npenalties before entering his guilty plea.\n          Third,   at   the   Rule    11   hearing,   the   district   court\n\nunequivocally informed Brown that he was facing mandatory life\n\nimprisonment on the kidnapping count because of the deaths of Wood\n\nand Brouillard.    The court asked appellant:\n\n          Do you understand that if you are convicted of\n          the offense charged in Count II, and if the\n          government can carry its burden of proof to\n          prove that a death resulted from the offense\n          conduct that you will stand exposed to a\n          mandatory    minimum    sentence    of    life\n          imprisonment plus a fine of $250,000?\n\nBrown answered this question in the affirmative, indicating his\n\nunderstanding of the charges against him.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          Fourth, the prosecution introduced an exhibit at the Rule\n\n11 hearing which described the events that transpired on the night\n\nof the kidnapping, including the gruesome murders of Wood and\nBrouillard. The defendant informed the court that he had discussed\n\nthe prosecution's exhibit with his attorney, that he knew the\n\ngovernment was capable of presenting evidence to prove its version\nof the events, and that he was aware that the prosecution's exhibit\n\nwould form the basis for sentencing.\n\n          Thus, the multiple colloquies between the district court\n\nand the appellant reveal that Brown was completely aware of all of\n\nthe charges against him and of the concomitant penalties.        See\n\nYefsky, 994 F.2d at 894 (\"Although the indictment itself did not\n\nwarn [appellant] of the nature of the [charge], he received ample\nnotice before trial of the facts underlying it.\").\n\n          In addition, the fact that Brown admitted to killing Wood\n\nand Brouillard substantially weakens any other claim of prejudice\nthat he may have.   In United States v. Corporan-Cuevas, 244 F.3d\n\n199 (1st Cir. 2001), the defendant was charged under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1203, which, inter alia, criminalizes hostage takings by foreign\n\nnationals.   See id. at 201.       The defendant argued that the\n\nindictment was defective because it failed to include an element of\n\nthe offense -- namely, that he was not a United States national\n\n(the \"international component\").     On appeal, we ruled that it was\n\nunnecessary to decide whether the international component was an\n\nelement of the offense that must be included in the indictment\n\nbecause the defendant had already admitted to being a foreign\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fnational. In light of the defendant's admission, we could not find\n\nany evidence in the record to support his claim of prejudice.                See\n\nid. at 202.\n            Applying the Corporan-Cuevas analysis to the instant case\n\nyields the same result. Several times in open court, the appellant\n\nadmitted to kidnapping Deborah Brown and killing two people in the\nprocess.    In fact, Brown received an acceptance-of-responsibility\n\ncredit under the Sentencing Guidelines for confessing to the\n\nkillings.      Like   the    defendant   in     Corporan-Cuevas,   Brown     has\n\nconfessed to the putative element of the offense that was omitted\n\nfrom the indictment.        Given Brown's admission, it is difficult to\n\nfind sufficient prejudice to warrant reversal.\n\n            Finally, even if we were to vacate the appellant's\nconviction on the kidnapping charge, he would still be serving\n\nmultiple life sentences for the other crimes to which he pled\n\nguilty.    This fate undeniably muffles Brown's cries of prejudice.\nFurthermore,    if    the   appellant    were    to   be   reindicted   on   the\n\nkidnapping count, the government would be authorized to seek the\n\ndeath penalty.        Given that he may face the death penalty if\n\nreindicted, Brown's claim that he was prejudiced by the current\n\nindictment is entirely without merit.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Brown's conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

Counts five and six alleged that Brown traveled across state lines &#8212; and caused Deborah Brown to cross state lines &#8212; with the intent to harass his exspouse and committed a crime of violence against her, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2261(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.

The indictment should be specific enough to notify the defendant of the nature of the accusation against him and to apprise the court of the facts alleged. <i>See Russell v. United States,</i> 369 U.S. 749, 766-68, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962). Though there is no prescribed formula, \"`[i]t is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the statute itself,' as long as those words set forth all the elements of the offense without any uncertainty or ambiguity.\" <i>United States v.

United States,</i> 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown argues that his indictment was defective because it failed to allege one of the essential elements of the kidnapping crime under which he was sentenced &#8212; namely, that the death of a person resulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Under the relevant portions of the federal kidnapping statute, any person who:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person ... shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life and, if the death of any person results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1201(a). Brown interprets this statutory language to mean that the fact that a death results from the kidnapping is not a sentencing factor, but rather an element of the offense. Therefore, it must be included in the indictment in order to comport with the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See generally Hamling,</i> 418 U.S. at 117-18, 94 S.Ct. 2887 (discussing the constitutional requirement that an indictment contain all the elements of the offense charged). Since his indictment only accused him of kidnapping, and did not specifically charge him with a kidnapping that resulted in a death, Brown concludes that he did not receive fair notice of the charges against him and seeks to be reindicted on the kidnapping charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the \"death of any person\" as a result of kidnapping is an element of the offense, thereby rendering Brown's indictment defective for failing to include it. The omission of an element of the offense from an indictment, however, is not automatic grounds for reversal. <i>See United States v. Mojica-B&#225;ez,</i> 229 F.3d 292, 310-12 (1st Cir.2000). \"We still must determine whether the defect in the indictment prejudiced [appellant].\" <i>United States v. Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d 885, 894 (1st Cir.1993) (citing <i>United States v.

Murphy,</i> 762 F.2d 1151, 1155 (1st Cir.1985) (ruling, without analysis, that an indictment's failure to apprise a defendant of the charges against him is reversible error, even when the issue is raised for the first time on appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding his protestations to the contrary, Brown's claim that he lacked fair notice of the charges against him cannot withstand even the mildest scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> First, though the kidnapping count did not allege that the kidnapping resulted in a death, the conspiracy count explicitly charged Brown with killing Wood and Brouillard. From the beginning, then, Brown was on notice that he was being charged with conduct that included the deaths of two people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Brown knew, before pleading guilty, that he faced the mandatory term of life in prison because two people died during the kidnapping. Before entertaining Brown's guilty plea, the district court instructed the parties to file briefs on the issue of whether the \"death of any person\" as a result of kidnapping is an element of the offense or a sentencing factor. The court ruled that the statutory provision at issue was a sentencing factor and informed Brown that if he pleaded guilty to the kidnapping charge, he would be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment that by statute applies \"if the death of any person results.\" Thus, Brown was aware of the charges against him and of the corresponding penalties before entering his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, at the Rule 11 hearing, the district court unequivocally informed Brown that he was facing mandatory life imprisonment on the kidnapping count because of the deaths of Wood and Brouillard. The court asked appellant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Do you understand that if you are convicted of the offense charged in Count II, and if the government can carry its burden of proof to prove that a death resulted from the offense conduct that you will stand exposed to a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment plus a fine of $250,000?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown answered this question in the affirmative, indicating his understanding of the charges against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the prosecution introduced an exhibit at the Rule 11 hearing which described the events that transpired on the night of the kidnapping, including the gruesome murders of Wood and Brouillard. The defendant informed the court that he had discussed the prosecution's exhibit with his attorney, that he knew the government was capable of presenting evidence to prove its version of the events, and that he was aware that the prosecution's exhibit would form the basis for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the multiple colloquies between the district court and the appellant reveal that Brown was completely aware of all of the charges against him and of the concomitant penalties. <i>See Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d at 894 (\"Although the indictment itself did not warn [appellant] of the nature of the [charge], he received ample notice before trial of the facts underlying it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the fact that Brown admitted to killing Wood and Brouillard substantially weakens any other claim of prejudice that he may have. In <i>United States v. Corporan-Cuevas,</i> 244 F.3d 199 (1st Cir.2001), the defendant was charged under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1203, which, inter alia, criminalizes hostage takings by foreign nationals. <i>See id.</i> at 201. The defendant argued that the indictment was defective because it failed to include an element of the offense &#8212; namely, that he was not a United States national (the \"international component\"). On appeal, we ruled that it was unnecessary to decide whether the international component was an element of the offense that must be included in the indictment because the defendant had already admitted to being a foreign national. In light of the defendant's admission, we could not find any evidence in the record to support his claim of prejudice. <i>See id.</i> at 202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the <i>Corporan-Cuevas</i> analysis to the instant case yields the same result. Several times in open court, the appellant admitted to kidnapping Deborah Brown and killing two people in the process. In fact, Brown received an acceptance-of-responsibility credit under the Sentencing Guidelines for confessing to the killings. Like the defendant in <i>Corporan-Cuevas,</i> Brown has confessed to the putative element of the offense that was omitted from the indictment. Given Brown's admission, it is difficult to find sufficient prejudice to warrant reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were to vacate the appellant's conviction on the kidnapping charge, he would still be serving multiple life sentences for the other crimes to which he pled guilty. This fate undeniably muffles Brown's cries of prejudice. Furthermore, if the appellant were to be reindicted on the kidnapping count, the government would be authorized to seek the death penalty. Given that he may face the death penalty if reindicted, Brown's claim that he was prejudiced by the current indictment is entirely without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Brown's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count eight, which charged Brown with crossing state lines with the intent to injure and harass Deborah Brown and place Donald Wood in reasonable fear of death and serious injury, was later dismissed on the government's motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although Brown seeks to dismiss the indictment, we think the case is better characterized as an effort to vacate a plea</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In support of his argument, Brown relies primarily on<i>Castillo v.

United States,</i> 923 F.2d 917, 920 (1st Cir.1991). We need not address this issue; we assume, arguendo, that there is no waiver for purposes of this case. We, therefore, assess the merits of Brown's claim of defect.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Though we did not specifically characterize this error as a structural one in<i>Murphy,</i> the fact that we treated the error as per se prejudicial suggests that it may rise to the level of a structural error. <i>See Mojica-B&#225;ez,</i> 229 F.3d at 310 (implying that the lack of fair notice of the charges against a defendant is a structural error that cannot be analyzed under the harmless error analysis).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The question of which standard of review to apply to Brown's claim is a disputed issue. Our general rule is that if the issue of the alleged defect was not raised below, we review for plain error<i>See Mojica-B&#225;ez,</i> 229 F.3d at 306. Brown states in his brief that because \"[t]here was no objection to the indictment or facts asserted by the Government at the Rule 11 hearing [,] ... the court should review this type of error for `plain error.'\" Surprisingly, the government argues in its brief that Brown raised the issue below and, as a result, should face a lower standard of review. Determining what standard of review should apply to this case is academic, as Brown's appeal fails under either the harmless error standard or plain error review.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Brown pled guilty to nine offenses, including kidnapping in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1201(a)(1). On appeal, Brown seeks to vacate his kidnapping conviction, arguing that the indictment failed to allege a necessary element of the kidnapping offense under which he was sentenced. Even assuming the indictment was wanting in some regard, Brown's appeal must fail because he cannot demonstrate that the indictment's error prejudiced him. We therefore affirm his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with knives, a shotgun, and an assault rifle, Steven Brown and Patricia Teeter drove from New York to Lebanon, Maine on March 28, 1999. After finding the home of the appellant's ex-wife, Deborah Brown, the travelers hatched a murderous plot. They planned to have Teeter lure the residents of Deborah Brown's home, one by one, to an abandoned car, where Steven Brown would be waiting to kill them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the pretext of needing help with her car, Teeter persuaded Deborah Brown's brother, Donald Wood, to accompany her to the abandoned vehicle. As Wood unsuspectingly approached the car, the appellant emerged unnoticed from the bushes, hit Wood with a pipe, and fatally stabbed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately following the killing, Brown instructed Teeter to replay the gruesome scene with a new victim. Teeter then returned to the house and lured Deborah Brown's boyfriend, Christopher Brouillard, to the abandoned car. Faithful to their plan, Brown hit Brouillard over the head with a pipe, dragged his body into the nearby woods, and stabbed him to death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking yet another macabre encore, Teeter returned to the house and convinced Deborah Brown to follow her. Rather than walking to the designated location, however, Deborah Brown drove her car. As she was approaching the abandoned vehicle, Deborah Brown spotted the appellant hiding in the woods and fled back to her home. After a brief chase, Brown and Teeter caught the victim and forced her, at gunpoint, to get into a car with them. They drove Deborah Brown to a motel in New York, where the appellant sexually assaulted her repeatedly. Two days later, the New York police arrested Brown and Teeter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 1999, a federal grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against Brown. Count one alleged that he and Teeter conspired to kidnap Deborah Brown and to cross state lines with the intent to commit various crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371. As part of this count, Brown was charged with the deaths of Donald Wood and Christopher Brouillard. Count two charged appellant with kidnapping Deborah Brown, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1201(a)(1); however, count two did not allege that the kidnapping resulted in the death of any person. In counts three and four, Brown was charged with carrying a shotgun and an assault rifle, respectively, during and in relation to the other crimes alleged in the indictment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Counts five and six alleged that Brown traveled across state lines &#8212; and caused Deborah Brown to cross state lines &#8212; with the intent to harass his exspouse and committed a crime of violence against her, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2261(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.

Therefore, it must be included in the indictment in order to comport with the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See generally Hamling,</i> 418 U.S. at 117-18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109084\"><a href=\"/opinion/109084/hamling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2887</span></a></span> (discussing the constitutional requirement that an indictment contain all the elements of the offense charged). Since his indictment only accused him of kidnapping, and did not specifically charge him with a kidnapping that resulted in a death, Brown concludes that he did not receive fair notice of the charges against him and seeks to be reindicted on the kidnapping charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the \"death of any person\" as a result of kidnapping is an element of the offense, thereby rendering Brown's indictment defective for failing to include it. The omission of an element of the offense from an indictment, however, is not automatic grounds for reversal. <i>See United States v. Mojica-B&#225;ez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770724\"><a href=\"/opinion/770724/united-states-v-john-alexis-mojica-baez-united-states-of-america-v-josue/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 310-12 (1st Cir.2000). \"We still must determine whether the defect in the indictment prejudiced [appellant].\" <i>United States v.

From the beginning, then, Brown was on notice that he was being charged with conduct that included the deaths of two people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Brown knew, before pleading guilty, that he faced the mandatory term of life in prison because two people died during the kidnapping. Before entertaining Brown's guilty plea, the district court instructed the parties to file briefs on the issue of whether the \"death of any person\" as a result of kidnapping is an element of the offense or a sentencing factor. The court ruled that the statutory provision at issue was a sentencing factor and informed Brown that if he pleaded guilty to the kidnapping charge, he would be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment that by statute applies \"if the death of any person results.\" Thus, Brown was aware of the charges against him and of the corresponding penalties before entering his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, at the Rule 11 hearing, the district court unequivocally informed Brown that he was facing mandatory life imprisonment on the kidnapping count because of the deaths of Wood and Brouillard. The court asked appellant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Do you understand that if you are convicted of the offense charged in Count II, and if the government can carry its burden of proof to prove that a death resulted from the offense conduct that you will stand exposed to a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment plus a fine of $250,000?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown answered this question in the affirmative, indicating his understanding of the charges against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the prosecution introduced an exhibit at the Rule 11 hearing which described the events that transpired on the night of the kidnapping, including the gruesome murders of Wood and Brouillard. The defendant informed the court that he had discussed the prosecution's exhibit with his attorney, that he knew the government was capable of presenting evidence to prove its version of the events, and that he was aware that the prosecution's exhibit would form the basis for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the multiple colloquies between the district court and the appellant reveal that Brown was completely aware of all of the charges against him and of the concomitant penalties. <i>See Yefsky,</i> 994 F.2d at 894 (\"Although the indictment itself did not warn [appellant] of the nature of the [charge], he received ample notice before trial of the facts underlying it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the fact that Brown admitted to killing Wood and Brouillard substantially weakens any other claim of prejudice that he may have. In <i>United States v. Corporan-Cuevas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772564\"><a href=\"/opinion/772564/united-states-v-felix-corporan-cuevas/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001), the defendant was charged under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1203, which, inter alia, criminalizes hostage takings by foreign nationals. <i>See id.</i> at 201. The defendant argued that the indictment was defective because it failed to include an element of the offense &#8212; namely, that he was not a United States national (the \"international component\"). On appeal, we ruled that it was unnecessary to decide whether the international component was an element of the offense that must be included in the indictment because the defendant had already admitted to being a foreign national. In light of the defendant's admission, we could not find any evidence in the record to support his claim of prejudice. <i>See id.</i> at 202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the <i>Corporan-Cuevas</i> analysis to the instant case yields the same result. Several times in open court, the appellant admitted to kidnapping Deborah Brown and killing two people in the process. In fact, Brown received an acceptance-of-responsibility credit under the Sentencing Guidelines for confessing to the killings. Like the defendant in <i>Corporan-Cuevas,</i> Brown has confessed to the putative element of the offense that was omitted from the indictment. Given Brown's admission, it is difficult to find sufficient prejudice to warrant reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were to vacate the appellant's conviction on the kidnapping charge, he would still be serving multiple life sentences for the other crimes to which he pled guilty. This fate undeniably muffles Brown's cries of prejudice. Furthermore, if the appellant were to be reindicted on the kidnapping count, the government would be authorized to seek the death penalty. Given that he may face the death penalty if reindicted, Brown's claim that he was prejudiced by the current indictment is entirely without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Brown's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count eight, which charged Brown with crossing state lines with the intent to injure and harass Deborah Brown and place Donald Wood in reasonable fear of death and serious injury, was later dismissed on the government's motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although Brown seeks to dismiss the indictment, we think the case is better characterized as an effort to vacate a plea</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In support of his argument, Brown relies primarily on<i>Castillo v.

We need not address this issue; we assume, arguendo, that there is no waiver for purposes of this case.

Brown states in his brief that because \"[t]here was no objection to the indictment or facts asserted by the Government at the Rule 11 hearing [,] ... the court should review this type of error for `plain error.'\" Surprisingly, the government argues in its brief that Brown raised the issue below and, as a result, should face a lower standard of review. Determining what standard of review should apply to this case is academic, as Brown's appeal fails under either the harmless error standard or plain error review.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
