Paris and Cutler & Associates on brief for\npetitioner.\n     Jesse M. Bless, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nDavid V. Bernal, Assistant Director, and Peter D.

Petitioner Tanios Abidaoud\n\nappeals from an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\nwhich affirmed an Immigration Judge's (IJ's) denial of his asylum\n\nclaim and other attendant immigration claims. Because a reasonable\n\nfact-finder would not be compelled to conclude to the contrary, we\n\naffirm   the   BIA's   denial   of   petitioner's   asylum   claim.1   In\n\naddition, because we find no abuse of discretion, we also deny\n\npetitioner's petition to review the BIA's denial of a motion to\n\nreopen based on changed country conditions.\n\n           The IJ found petitioner credible.        Therefore, we relate\n\nthe facts of the case as he testified to them.          Petitioner is a\n\nMaronite Christian, born and raised in Lebanon. For several months\n\nin his late teens he was a member of the Lebanese Forces, an armed\n\ngroup that aimed to protect the Lebanese Christian minority during\n\nthat country's civil war.        Petitioner left Lebanon in 1990 for\n\nLithuania, having received a scholarship to study architecture\n\nthere.   He remained in Lithuania as a student for seven years, and\n\nwhile there met and married his Lithuanian-born wife.\n\n           In 1997, the couple moved to Lebanon, where petitioner\n\ncontinued to develop his interest in Lebanon's Phoenician past. He\n\nfounded a political party, the United Phoenician Party (UPP), whose\n\n\n     1\n      While petitioner purports to appeal from the BIA's denial of\nwithholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against\nTorture, he makes no sustained argumentation regarding either of\nthese claims. Therefore, we deem them waived. See United States\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fprincipal tenet is that the various religious and ethnic factions\n\nin Lebanon can peacefully co-exist if they rediscover their common\n\nPhoenician roots.       Petitioner attempted to register his party with\n\nthe Lebanese Interior Ministry, but his request was denied. At the\n\ntime of his asylum hearing in 2005, petitioner attested that there\n\nwere about ten UPP members worldwide.\n\n             Petitioner testified that his advocacy on behalf of the\n\nUPP led to political disagreements with his employer in Lebanon,\n\nand petitioner was fired as a result.             Petitioner also testified\n\nthat    he   received   three   threatening      telephone     calls    while   in\n\nLebanon, during which unidentified callers threatened him with\n\n\"disappearance\" and other harms. He believed that the threats were\n\nrelated to his leadership of the UPP.                 The callers did not,\n\nhowever, reference the UPP or petitioner's political beliefs.\n\nAfter the second phone call, petitioner sent his wife and son to\n\nLithuania, out of concern for their safety.                 At some point after\n\nthe third phone call, petitioner himself left Lebanon for Canada.\n\nAfter spending two months in Canada, he entered the United States\n\nin September 1999 on a one-year nonimmigrant visa.\n\n             On appeal, petitioner points out a factual discrepancy in\n\nthe    record   regarding     when   he    received   the    three    threatening\n\ntelephone     calls.     In   his    written    testimony    and     I-589   asylum\n\napplication, petitioner alleged that the threatening phone calls\n\nbegan in 1998 and continued in 1999, and that he left Lebanon in\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f1999, shortly after the third call.                   In contrast, in his oral\n\ntestimony, petitioner stated that the phone calls occurred in 1997\n\nand 1998, and that there was a nine-month gap between the third\n\nphone   call    and    his     1999   departure.        However,   in       other   oral\n\ntestimony, he corroborated his written application, saying that he\n\nleft Lebanon shortly after he received the third phone call.                            The\n\nIJ credited petitioner's statement that he waited nine months after\n\nthe third call to leave Lebanon, and the BIA noted this nine-month\n\ngap   as   evidence       of   petitioner's      objective     lack     of       fear    of\n\npersecution.\n\n            We review the decision below for substantial evidence,\n\naccepting the BIA's findings of fact if they are supported by\n\n\"'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"              Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)). We will reverse only if \"any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe    compelled      to   conclude      to    the     contrary.\"        8    U.S.C.       ยง\n\n1252(b)(4)(B).        The burden of establishing eligibility for asylum\n\nis    carried   by     the     petitioner,      who    must   prove     either      past\n\npersecution       (thus      giving    rise     to    an   inference        of    future\n\npersecution) or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nhis race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion. Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f           Because the petitioner in this case only claims a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution, we do not address whether he\n\nsuffered   past    persecution.      \"A    well-founded   fear    of    future\n\npersecution entails both subjective and objective components. The\n\npetitioner must demonstrate not only that she harbors a genuine\n\nfear of future persecution but also that her fear is objectively\n\nreasonable.\"      Negeya v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 78, 82-83 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). Assuming that the petitioner in this case has satisfied the\n\nsubjective   component,   we   address     only   whether   the   objective\n\ncomponent has been sufficiently met. To do so, the petitioner must\n\nshow   \"'credible,   direct,   and    specific    evidence'\"     that   would\n\nobjectively support a reasonable fear of future individualized\n\npersecution based on a statutorily protected ground.              Guzman v.\n\nINS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Ravindran v. INS, 976\n\nF.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n           Therefore, we must decide whether the record evidence\n\ncompels the conclusion that the petitioner has established a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.         We conclude that it does not.\n\n           Several factors undermine petitioner's claim that the\n\nrecord compels a favorable outcome on his asylum claim:           he failed\n\nto show any evidence of a connection between the three threats he\n\nreceived and his political activities; he was not detained or\n\notherwise mistreated while living in Lebanon; he testified that he\n\nremained in Lebanon for nine months following the third threat; and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhe offered no evidence that other members of his political party\n\nhave suffered harm, either at the time petitioner was in Lebanon or\n\nsince he left the country.        Given our limited scope of review, we\n\ncannot conclude that this record compels the conclusion that\n\npetitioner has a well-founded fear of persecution were he to return\n\nto Lebanon.\n\n           We    also   briefly   address         petitioner's   claim    that   he\n\nmisspoke during his oral testimony when he stated that nine months\n\nelapsed between the third threat and his departure from Lebanon.\n\nHe argues that other evidence in the record suggests that he left\n\nshortly after he received the third threat, and that the IJ should\n\nhave credited that evidence, rather than his alleged misstatements.\n\nHowever,   the   fact   that   the       record    could   support   a   different\n\nconclusion than that reached by the IJ is not sufficient to compel\n\nour reversal of that finding of fact.                See Ziu v. Gonzales, 412\n\nF.3d 202, 204 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]hat the record could support an\n\nalternate inference from the one drawn by the IJ does not warrant\n\noverturning the IJ's decision.\").\n\n           Petitioner     makes      a    second,     underdeveloped     argument\n\nrequesting that his case be remanded to the BIA based on changed\n\ncountry conditions in Lebanon, and contesting the BIA's denial of\n\na similar motion to reopen.       While petitioner may well have waived\n\nthis issue due to a lack of developed argumentation, see United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), his claim also\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ffails on the merits.      To reverse the BIA's denial of a motion to\n\nreopen, we would have to determine that such a decision constituted\n\nan abuse of discretion.     See Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    To prevail on a motion to reopen based on changed\n\ncountry conditions, the petitioner must demonstrate \"[c]hanges in\n\nconditions   in    the   applicant's   country   of   nationality\"   that\n\n\"materially affect[] the applicant's eligibility for asylum.\"          8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(A).       Here, the BIA did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion to reopen where petitioner failed\n\nto connect the increased civil strife in Lebanon to his particular\n\ngrounds for claiming asylum.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.   The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",

Given our limited scope of review, we\n\ncannot conclude that this record compels the conclusion that\n\npetitioner has a well-founded fear of persecution were he to return\n\nto Lebanon.\n\n           We    also   briefly   address         petitioner's   claim    that   he\n\nmisspoke during his oral testimony when he stated that nine months\n\nelapsed between the third threat and his departure from Lebanon.\n\nHe argues that other evidence in the record suggests that he left\n\nshortly after he received the third threat, and that the IJ should\n\nhave credited that evidence, rather than his alleged misstatements.\n\nHowever,   the   fact   that   the       record    could   support   a   different\n\nconclusion than that reached by the IJ is not sufficient to compel\n\nour reversal of that finding of fact.

While petitioner may well have waived\n\nthis issue due to a lack of developed argumentation, see United\n\nStates v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), his claim also\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ffails on the merits.      To reverse the BIA's denial of a motion to\n\nreopen, we would have to determine that such a decision constituted\n\nan abuse of discretion.     See Roberts v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201802\"><a href=\"/opinion/201802/roberts-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    To prevail on a motion to reopen based on changed\n\ncountry conditions, the petitioner must demonstrate \"[c]hanges in\n\nconditions   in    the   applicant's   country   of   nationality\"   that\n\n\"materially affect[] the applicant's eligibility for asylum.\"          8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(A).       Here, the BIA did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion to reopen where petitioner failed\n\nto connect the increased civil strife in Lebanon to his particular\n\ngrounds for claiming asylum.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.   The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f</pre>",
