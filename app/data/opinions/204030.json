Dec. 19, 2007).\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                              I.    Background\n\n            The IRS investigation is focused on transactions that\n\ngenerated losses claimed from writing down the value of \"distressed\n\ndebt\" consisting of consumer accounts receivable obtained from one\n\nor more Brazilian retail stores.          According to an IRS Coordinated\n\nIssue Paper (\"CIP\")3 issued in April 2007, such \"distressed asset\n\nand debt\" transactions (known as \"DAD tax shelters\") generate tax\n\nlosses that are not allowable as deductions.            In a DAD shelter, a\n\nforeign    entity   that   does    not   pay   United   States   taxes   sells\n\npurportedly high-basis, low-value debt (the \"distressed debt\") to\n\na United States entity taxed as a partnership in exchange for a\n\npayment that is a very small percentage of the face value of the\n\ndebt.     The United States entity then contributes the distressed\n\ndebt to other entities taxed as partnerships -- partnerships in\n\nwhich interests are sold to tax shelter participants.            The shelter\n\nparticipants then claim some or all of the face value of the\n\ndistressed debt as a loss to offset other earned income.             The IRS\n\ncontends that U.S. taxpayers participating in the Brazilian debt\n\nDAD shelters claimed losses of approximately $39 million in 2003\n\nand $119 million in 2004.     The IRS is investigating the veracity of\n\nthese claimed losses by examining the returns filed by the entities\n\n\n     3\n      The IRS issues CIPs to \"provid[e] guidance to field examiners\nand to ensur[e] uniform application of the law\" relating to\n\"complex and significant industry wide issues.\" Internal Revenue\nService publication, available at http://www.irs.gov/businesses/\narticle/0,,id=96445,00.html.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthat pass on the losses to U.S. taxpayers and those filed by the\n\nindividual taxpayers.\n\n                              II.    The parties\n\n               The appellants are engaged in the business of consumer\n\nreceivables management and collection. They partner with creditors\n\nfor the servicing and collecting of consumer receivables in a\n\nglobal industry fueled by increasing levels of consumer debt,\n\nincreasing defaults of the receivables, and utilization of third-\n\nparty providers to collect such receivables.\n\n               Appellant John E. Rogers, an attorney with an MBA in\n\ninternational finance, was the driving force behind the appellants'\n\ninvolvement in the Brazilian debt market.                 Jetstream Business,\n\nLtd.4       (\"Jetstream\")   was   Rogers's     platform    for   international\n\ninvestment opportunities.         Jetstream is the Tax Matters Partner of\n\nappellants Derringer Trading, LLC (\"Derringer\") and Knight Trading,\n\nLLC (\"Knight\").        Rogers, in turn, is the sole shareholder of\n\nappellant Portfolio Properties, Inc. (\"Portfolio\"), an Illinois\n\ncorporation that is the sole shareholder of Jetstream.              Appellant\n\nWarwick Trading, LLC (\"Warwick\"), was formed by Jetstream as a\n\npossible vehicle through which to invest.             In 2006, Derringer and\n\nKnight       were   transferred     to    appellant   Sugarloaf    Fund,   LLC\n\n\n\n\n        4\n      Jetstream was a British Virgin Islands limited company during\nthe time period relevant to this appeal.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f(\"Sugarloaf\"), a Delaware company.     Rogers is the general manager\n\nof Sugarloaf.\n\n             III.   The summonses and prior proceedings\n\n           In June 2007, the IRS issued a set of administrative\n\nsummonses to Massachusetts resident Michael Hartigan (\"Hartigan\"),\n\nan attorney, directing him to appear before IRS Revenue Agent Larry\n\nWeinger to testify and produce for examination documents and\n\ninformation relating to Derringer, Knight, Portfolio, Sugarloaf and\n\nWarwick. A few days later, Hartigan received a second summons from\n\nthe IRS, directing him to appear before IRS Agent Kimberlee Loren\n\nto testify and produce documents regarding Rogers.    The first set\n\nwas served on Hartigan because he claimed losses on his joint\n\nincome tax return based on his wife's interest in Derringer and\n\nKnight.5   The second was based on his relationship with Rogers, as\n\n\n     5\n      The summons regarding Sugarloaf was typical of this first set\nserved on Hartigan. It sought:\n\n     1. All documents, including but not limited to engagement\n     letters, representation letters, agreements, invoices,\n     billing records, fee allocations, and correspondence\n     related to any fees for legal, professional, management,\n     accounting and tax advice and assistance incurred by you\n     and/or any entity controlled by you in connection with\n     Sugarloaf Fund, LLC, and/or its activities.\n\n     2. All minutes, notes, correspondence, emails, calendar\n     entries, and other recordings relating to or reflecting\n     meetings, conferences and telephone conversations in\n     which Sugarloaf Fund, LLC, and/or its activities was\n     discussed.\n\n     3.    All documents showing payments of any funds,\n     including, but not limited to fees, paid or received by\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe IRS believed that Hartigan, in addition to receiving fees from\n\nparticipants, also assisted Rogers in organizing, managing and\n\nselling interests in the various entities.6\n\n           The petitioners timely filed a motion to quash the\n\nsummonses, claiming that the IRS was engaging in a nationwide\n\npattern of harassment.7    The government moved to deny the motion to\n\nquash and for enforcement of the summonses.        After a hearing on the\n\npetitioners' motion for an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate\n\njudge denied both the motion for a hearing and the motion to quash,\n\nwhile simultaneously recommending the enforcement of the summonses.\n\nThe district court adopted the report and recommendation.             This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                            IV.    Discussion\n\n           The IRS has “expansive information-gathering authority”\n\nto   determine   tax   liability   under   the   Internal   Revenue   Code,\n\nincluding by issuance of summonses to taxpayers and third-party\n\n\n\n      any party in connection with Sugarloaf Fund, LLC, and/or\n      its activities.\n      6\n      The second summons contained forty three specific document\nrequests, broken down into the following categories: 1) materials\nrelated to Rogers's marketing efforts; 2) engagement letters and\ndocuments related to participants' involvement; 3) documents\ndiscussing expected tax benefits; 4) legal or tax opinions; 5)\ninformation about fees paid in connection with the shelters; and 6)\ndocuments related to Rogers's role.\n      7\n      Even though they were not the summoned parties, the\npetitioners are permitted to move to quash. See 26 U.S.C. §\n7609(b)(2).\n\n                                    -6-\n\frecord holders.   United States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805,\n\n816 (1984); 26 U.S.C. § 7602.   Taxpayers may petition to quash such\n\nsummonses and the IRS may petition to enforce them.    26 U.S.C. §§\n\n7604, 7609.   Enforcement proceedings are designed to be summary in\n\nnature.    Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 529 (1971).\n\n\"The court's role is to ensure that the IRS is using its broad\n\nauthority in good faith and in compliance with the law.\"     United\n\nStates v. Gertner, 65 F.3d 963, 966 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           Regardless of who initiates the action, the court follows\n\na familiar structured analysis in a summons enforcement proceeding.\n\nGertner, 65 F.3d at 966.    The IRS must first make a prima facie\n\nshowing “[1] that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to\n\na legitimate purpose, [2] that the inquiry may be relevant to the\n\npurpose, [3] that the information sought is not already within the\n\nCommissioner's possession, and [4] that the administrative steps\n\nrequired by the Code have been followed.” United States v. Powell,\n\n379 U.S. 48, 57-58 (1964).      The IRS need only make a “minimal”\n\nshowing.   See Gertner, 65 F.3d at 966 (\"This burden is not taxing,\n\nso to speak.\").   An affidavit of the investigating agent that the\n\nPowell requirements are satisfied is sufficient to make the prima\n\nfacie case.   Id.; see also United States v. Dynavac, Inc., 6 F.3d\n\n1407, 1414 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Alphin, 809 F.2d 236,\n\n238 (4th Cir. 1987); In re Newton, 718 F.2d 1015, 1019 (11th Cir.\n\n1983); United States v. Will, 671 F.2d 963, 966 (6th Cir. 1982);\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fUnited States v. Kis, 658 F.2d 526, 538 (7th Cir. 1981); United\n\nStates v. Garden State Nat'l Bank, 607 F.2d 61, 68 (3d Cir. 1979);\n\nHowa Trading, 2008 WL 2323872 at *4; United States v. Thomas, 254\n\nF. Supp. 2d 174, 180 (D. Me. 2003).\n\n           Once the IRS has made this showing, the burden shifts to\n\nthe taxpayer to disprove one or more of the Powell requirements, or\n\nto show that enforcement would be “an abuse of process, e.g., that\n\nthe summons was issued in bad faith for an improper purpose.”\n\nSterling Trading, 553 F. Supp. 2d at 1155-56 (C.D. Cal. 2008)\n\n(citing Liberty Fin. Serv. v. United States, 778 F.2d 1390, 1392\n\n(9th Cir. 1985)).      The taxpayer's burden is heavy, and he “must\n\nallege specific facts and evidence to support his allegations.”\n\nId. at 1156.     The district court found that the appellants failed\n\nto meet their ultimate burden.         After reviewing the ruling on the\n\nmotions to quash for abuse of discretion, Bogosian v. Woloohojian\n\nRealty Corp., 323 F.3d 55, 66 (1st Cir. 2003), we affirm.\n\nA.   The prima facie case\n\n           The appellants first argue that the district court erred\n\nwhen it concluded that the sworn declarations from Weigner and\n\nLoren were sufficient to establish the IRS's prima facie case under\n\nPowell.\n\n           Weigner's declaration stated that the summonses were\n\nissued for the purpose of investigating the appellants' returns\n\nbecause   they   may   be   involved    in   potentially   abusive   DAD   tax\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fshelters.        More    specifically,     Weinger    stated    that   the   IRS\n\nexaminations concerned the correctness of partnership returns filed\n\nby Sugarloaf, Warwick, Derringer and Knight for various tax years\n\nbetween January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005.                 The examination\n\nalso   implicated       returns   filed   by   individual    participants     who\n\nclaimed losses through their interests in these entities.\n\n             Weinger further stated that Portfolio's S-corporation\n\nreturn for tax years 2003-2005 was a subject of his examination, as\n\nwas    Rogers,    indirectly,       because     he   was    Portfolio's      sole\n\nshareholder, and Portfolio's losses flowed directly through to his\n\nindividual returns.\n\n             Regarding the summonses at issue, Weinger stated that\n\nafter following all IRS procedural requirements, the summonses were\n\nissued to Hartigan because he, through his wife (with whom he files\n\na joint tax return) purchased tax shelters involving several tiers\n\nof LLCs receiving and contributing distressed debt to other LLCs,\n\ntransactions appearing similar to the DAD shelters described in the\n\nCIP.   Hartigan also promoted the sale of interests in similar LLCs\n\nto others.    According to Weinger, Hartigan's wife indirectly owned\n\nbetween 96 and 98 percent of Derringer, and over 96 percent of\n\nKnight, during the relevant time period.             Losses from each entity\n\nwere claimed on the Hartigans' joint returns.              Weinger also stated\n\nthat an investor in and seller of tax shelters, such as Hartigan,\n\nshould have documents and information responsive to the summonses,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fand that such documents would provide information to the IRS about\n\nincome     and    expenses,      the    circumstances        surrounding       the   loss-\n\ngenerating transactions and their anticipated tax benefits, all of\n\nwhich would be relevant to the IRS investigation.                            In addition,\n\nHartigan would be expected to have information important to the IRS\n\nin making a penalty determination, such as the nature of due\n\ndiligence performed by the appellants, and the extent of their\n\nreliance on an advisor. Finally, Weinger stated that while the IRS\n\nhad obtained some information from taxpayers and third parties, it\n\nwas not in possession of the summoned information.\n\n               Agent Loren's declaration indicated that she was assigned\n\nto examine Rogers's role in organizing, managing and selling tax\n\nshelters; his compliance with various IRS registration and list\n\nmaintenance requirements and potential penalties for violating\n\nthem;    and     whether    he   made    false       or    fraudulent   statements      in\n\nconnection       with   selling        and    organizing       the   shelters.         The\n\ndeclaration noted that the forty-three specific document requests\n\nwould    provide     information        to    the    IRS    relevant    to    the    Rogers\n\nexamination. For example, where Hartigan personally marketed to\n\nparticipants, he would ordinarily have correspondence addressing\n\ntax implications. Such documents might help determine the legality\n\nof   the   shelters,       the   extent      of     Rogers's   involvement       and   any\n\nliability for penalties.               Also, information about fees paid to\n\nRogers or Hartigan would go toward explaining Rogers's role in\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fparticular transactions.     While Loren noted that the IRS had\n\nobtained copies of documents purportedly prepared by Rogers or\n\nHartigan, those documents were obtained from third parties.\n\n           The district court concluded that the IRS easily met\n\nPowell's prima facie test.    Considering the hearty content of the\n\nagents' declarations, and that even \"bareboned allegations\" can\n\nsuffice to support the prima facie showing, cf. Gertner, 65 F.3d at\n\n968, we agree that the IRS met its initial burden.\n\nB.   The appellants' response\n\n           The appellants advance three theories in support of their\n\nargument that, contrary to the district court's conclusion, they\n\nsuccessfully rebutted the IRS's prima facie case.      The first is\n\nthat the summoned information is not relevant to a legitimate\n\npurpose.   Next, they argue that the summonses themselves were not\n\nissued for a legitimate purpose.   And finally, they claim that the\n\nsummoned documents are already in the IRS's possession. We discuss\n\neach in turn.\n\n           1.   Relevance to a legitimate purpose\n\n           The appellants' first substantive argument is that the\n\ninformation sought by the summonses is not relevant to a legitimate\n\npurpose.   They set forth three supporting reasons: first, that the\n\ntransactions in which they are engaged are different from the DAD\n\nshelter described in the CIP; second, that the IRS improperly\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\ftargeted Hartigan's (and others') motives; and third, that the\n\nsummonses were overbroad.\n\n           We start our analysis by noting that \"the concept of\n\nrelevance under § 7602 is broader than that under the Federal Rules\n\nof Evidence.\"     Zugerese Trading LLC v. Internal Revenue Service,\n\n2009 WL 1706583, No. 08-30894 (5th Cir. June 18, 2009) (citing\n\nArthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. at 813-14 n.11).                  Moreover, the IRS\n\nmay   investigate      \"merely   on   suspicion     that   the    law   is    being\n\nviolated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.\"\n\nPowell, 379 U.S. at 57 (quoting United States v. Morton Salt Co.,\n\n338 U.S. 632, 642-43 (1950)).\n\n           The gist of the appellants' first argument is that the\n\ntransactions at issue here are not unlawful DAD shelters.                     Given\n\nthe broad sweep of the IRS's investigative powers, however, such a\n\ndetermination is beyond the scope of the inquiries undertaken by\n\nthe district court and this court in the summons enforcement\n\ncontext.    See Superior Trading, 2008 WL 5192379 at *6,                     n. 10\n\n(court in summons enforcement proceeding \"need not address whether\n\ntransactions were lawful\").           \"The function of the [court] in an\n\nenforcement proceeding is not to test the final merits of the\n\nclaimed tax deduction, but to assess within the limits of Powell\n\nwhether    the   IRS    issued    its     summons   for    a     legitimate     tax\n\ndetermination purpose.\"          Howa Trading, 2008 WL 2323872 at *4\n\n(citing United States v. White, 853 F.2d 107, 116 (2nd Cir. 1988)).\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fAccordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that the claimed\n\nlegality of their transactions provides a basis to quash the\n\nsummonses.\n\n              The appellants next argue that the motives of Hartigan\n\nand other persons or entities involved in the transactions at issue\n\nare \"completely irrelevant\" to the IRS's investigation.                     Again,\n\ngiven the wide breadth of relevance in the present context, we\n\ndisagree.     In a broad sense, the IRS is investigating the validity\n\nof the partnerships themselves for purposes of assessing the\n\nvalidity of the claimed tax losses.           Thus, the IRS is permitted to\n\ninquire as to whether the parties \"intended to join together as\n\npartners to conduct business activity for a purpose other than tax\n\navoidance.\"      Adantech LLC v.    Comm'r, 331 F.3d      972, 978 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n              Next, the appellants' overbreadth argument focuses on the\n\nsummonses' inclusion of the term, \"all documents,\" which, they\n\nclaim, makes the summonses overbroad as a matter of law.               The two\n\ncases    upon    which   they   rely,   however,     do     not   support    this\n\nproposition.      Both United States v. Theodore, 479 F.2d 749 (4th\n\nCir. 1973) and Racca v. United States, 2007 WL 1108872, No. C06-\n\n1822RSM, (W.D. Wash. Apr. 11, 2007), contain fact-specific analyses\n\nthat     do     not   necessarily    apply      beyond      their   particular\n\ncircumstances.        Indeed,   there   are    no   cases    that   universally\n\nproscribe the use of \"all documents\" language. To the contrary, as\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthe Fifth Circuit noted in rejecting an overbreadth claim in one of\n\nthe many cases involving the same players and issues present here,\n\na summons is not overbroad if it \"describes the requested material\n\nwith sufficient particularity to permit the summoned party to\n\nrespond adequately.\"      Zugarese Trading, 2009 WL 1706583 at *1.8\n\nHere, the use of the term \"all documents\" is limited by reference\n\nto particular subject matters.         We therefore conclude that the\n\nsummonses are not overly broad.\n\n           2.    Issuance for a legitimate purpose\n\n           The appellants next argue that the IRS did not issue the\n\nsummonses for a legitimate purpose.        Specifically, they claim that\n\nthe IRS intended to use the summonses in order to avoid more\n\nrestrictive Tax Court discovery rules, to harass them, and           to\n\nimproperly extend the statute of limitations applicable to the\n\nexamination of tax returns.\n\n           By way of background, a notice of deficiency permits an\n\nindividual taxpayer to bring a Tax Court proceeding to challenge\n\nthe tax liability claimed by the IRS in the notice.         26 U.S.C. §\n\n6213.    In the partnership context, a notice of final partnership\n\nadministrative adjustment (FPAA) is analogous to a notice of\n\ndeficiency.     26 U.S.C. § 6226.   Discovery in Tax Court proceedings\n\nis   more limited than that permitted under the Federal Rules of\n\n\n\n     8\n      Hartigan, the \"summoned party\" has interposed no objections\nto the summonses.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fCivil Procedure. Schneider Interests, L.P. v. Comm'r, 119 T.C. 151\n\n(2002); see also United States v. Admin. Enter. Inc., 46 F.3d 670,\n\n672   (7th   Cir.    1995)    (\"Discovery     in   Tax   Court    proceedings       is\n\ntraditionally informal and noncoercive . . . .\").\n\n             \"Courts look to the timing of a summons relative to the\n\ncommencement    of     [tax   court]   litigation        in   order    to   evaluate\n\nvalidity in the face of such allegations.\"                Sterling Trading, 553\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 1159-60 (citing PAA Mgmt., Ltd. v. United States,\n\n962 F.2d 212, 219 (2d Cir. 1992)).              \"Where the summons is issued\n\nbefore the commencement of judicial proceedings, that summons is\n\ngenerally not found to undermine the discovery process.\"                           Id.\n\nHere, as the district court noted, it is undisputed that the IRS\n\nissued the summonses before issuing the FPAA to Derringer.9                       Thus,\n\n\"the timing of the summons does not suggest that the IRS intended\n\nthe summons as a pre-litigation discovery tool . . . .\"                     Id.\n\n             The appellants argue that because the FPAA was a \"final\"\n\ndetermination of Derringer's tax liability, the summons could only\n\nhave been for illegitimate purposes.                 This position, however,\n\noverstates the impact of the FPAA.            \"The FPAA is not 'final' in the\n\nsense that its issuance necessarily obviates the need for further\n\ninformation,        [or]   brings   the       curtain     down    on    the   IRS's\n\nadministrative or investigative role . . . .\"                 PAA Mgmt., 962 F.2d\n\n\n\n      9\n      The Derringer FPAA was issued approximately six weeks after\nthe summons and two weeks after the summons return date.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fat 219.       Against this backdrop, the issuance of the FPAA does not\n\ninvalidate           the   legitimacy           of     the     Derringer       summons.\n\n               The    appellants        also    rely     on   Rogers's     version       of    a\n\nconversation with Weinger in which Weinger allegedly said that the\n\nIRS auditors were \"being guided by district counsel who planned to\n\nlitigate regardless of the result of the audit and notwithstanding\n\nwhether petitioners were able to prove bad business debt through\n\nthe audit.\"           The appellants rely on PAA Mgmt. Ltd. v. United\n\nStates, No. 91C168, 1992 WL 346314 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 19, 1992), for\n\nthe proposition that the motive to use in litigation materials\n\nobtained by summons is evidence of an improper purpose.                                In PAA\n\nMgmt, however, the court found that the IRS agent explicitly\n\nadmitted that the IRS did not need the summoned materials for its\n\nexamination,         but   rather       that    it    only    sought    the    material       to\n\n“protect the government's interests\" in Tax Court.                        1992 WL 346314\n\nat   *5-6.        There       is   no   such     admission      here.         Instead,    the\n\ndeclaration in this case states that the information sought in the\n\nDerringer summons \"is still necessary\" to the determination of the\n\naccuracy of Derringer's returns.                     And contrary to the appellants'\n\nassertions, Weinger's alleged statement (which was in connection\n\nwith a different summons enforcement proceeding10) does not compel\n\nan outcome in their favor here, particularly in light of the fact\n\nthat    in     the    other    proceeding        Weinger      expressly       denied    being\n\n\n       10\n            Ironwood Trading, supra.\n\n                                               -16-\n\fdirected by counsel to seek specific documents. Moreover, there is\n\nno prohibition against IRS agents speaking with district counsel\n\nduring an examination.    Good Karma, LLC, 546 F. Supp. 2d at 604.\n\nAccordingly, we reject the appellants' discovery claim.\n\n            The appellants' claim of harassment11 is based on two\n\nspecific claims, neither of which is sufficient to merit relief.\n\nFirst, they argue that the IRS threatened the imposition of severe\n\npenalties if they did not settle.    The IRS does not dispute that it\n\nsought settlement; however, \"The mere fact that the IRS attempted\n\nto settle with taxpayers . . . hardly amounts to a 'threat.'\"\n\nSterling Trading, 553 F. Supp. 2d at 1158.          Next, the appellants\n\nclaim that the IRS threatened one of their attorneys. According to\n\nan affidavit from the attorney, IRS agents believed that the\n\nattorney's responses to document requests were incomplete and told\n\nthe attorney that failure to respond could result in a disciplinary\n\nreferral.   This conduct does not rise to the level of harassment,\n\neither.   In the first place, the attorney did not characterize the\n\nagents' communications as \"threats,\" nor have other courts viewed\n\nthem as \"threats.\" See, e.g., Superior Trading, 2008 WL 5192379 at\n\n*6 (citing Ironwood Trading, 2008 WL 817006 at *3).         Perhaps more\n\nimportantly,   the   alleged   threats   involved    an   individual   and\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      The appellants' overarching theory is that the large number\nof pending legal proceedings is evidence of a nationwide harassment\neffort.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fpartnership entity distinct from any in this case.                 Accordingly,\n\nthe appellants' claim of harassment fails.\n\n            We   also   reject   the    appellants'       argument    that    the\n\nsummonses   were   issued   as   a     means    to    improperly     extend   the\n\napplicable statutes of limitation.12           As the district court noted,\n\nand as the appellants concede, it was the filing of the petition to\n\nquash that tolled the statute, not the issuance of the summonses.\n\n26 U.S.C. § 7609(e)(1).     The statute is also tolled if the summoned\n\nparty does not comply within six months.             26 U.S.C. § 7609(e)(2).13\n\nIn the end, the appellants fail to cite any evidence in support of\n\ntheir statute of limitations argument.\n\n            Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's\n\nfinding that the summonses were not issued for an improper purpose.\n\n            3.   Documents already possessed\n\n            The appellants' final substantive argument is that the\n\nIRS is already in possession of the summoned documents.               They rely\n\non the fact that Rogers and the appellants' accountant have already\n\nappeared for interviews and produced documents.                 As previously\n\nnoted, however, the IRS is entitled to obtain relevant records from\n\nthird parties to compare for accuracy any records obtained from the\n\n\n\n     12\n      The IRS is generally authorized to audit tax returns within\nthree years of their filing. 26 U.S.C. §§ 6501, 6229.\n     13\n      The limitations period with respect to Derringer and Rogers\nwere tolled by the issuance of an FPAA and deficiency notice,\nrespectively.\n\n                                     -18-\n\ftaxpayer.     While the appellants claim that \"more than one million\n\npages of documents\" have been produced, they do not suggest how\n\nthose documents are responsive to the summonses issued to Hartigan.\n\nSee Sterling Trading, 553 F. Supp. 2d at 1161 (rejecting identical\n\nargument).    Nor do they dispute that Hartigan has not yet provided\n\ntestimony, as was requested. The appellants' claim that the IRS is\n\nalready in possession of the summoned documents therefore fails.\n\nC. Other arguments\n\n             The appellants make two additional arguments, neither of\n\nwhich require extended discussion.            The first is that the district\n\ncourt should have stricken the IRS's petition to enforce, or deemed\n\nall of the appellants' allegations below admitted, because the IRS\n\ndid not file an answer or a motion under Rule 12 or Rule 56 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, but instead responded to the\n\npetition with its own motion to deny that of the appellants and to\n\nenforce the summonses. We disagree. While the federal rules apply\n\nto   these    proceedings,      \"they    are     not   inflexible    in   this\n\napplication,\" Donaldson, 400 U.S. at 528, since Rule 81(a)(5)\n\nexplicitly states that the rules may be limited by the district\n\ncourt.      Moreover,   given   that    the    IRS's   motion   \"mirror[ed]   a\n\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,\" Cosme v. United States, 708 F. Supp.\n\n45, 48 (E.D.N.Y. 1989), we agree with the Fifth Circuit that the\n\nIRS \"sufficiently responded to the petition to quash . . . .\"\n\nZugerese, 2009 WL 1706583 at *2.\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f           The appellants also claim that the district court erred\n\nin denying them discovery and an evidentiary hearing before ruling\n\non the dueling motions.             Yet as the Supreme Court has held,\n\n\"Summons enforcement proceedings should be summary in nature and\n\ndiscovery should be limited.\"          United States v. Stuart, 489 U.S.\n\n353, 369 (1989).       Accordingly, the decision whether to conduct an\n\nevidentiary hearing in a summons enforcement proceeding is within\n\nthe district court's discretion.             United States v. Tiffany Fine\n\nArts, 469 U.S. 310, 324 n.7. (1985); Gertner, 65 F.3d at 969.\n\n\"There is no hard-and-fast rule compelling an evidentiary hearing,\"\n\nGertner,   65   F.3d    at   967,    and   the   \"district   court   may,    in\n\nappropriate circumstances, forgo such a hearing and decide the\n\nissues on the existing record.\"            Id.   In order to proceed to an\n\nevidentiary hearing, a taxpayer must make a sufficient threshold\n\nshowing that there was an improper purpose behind an IRS summons.\n\nCopp v. United States, 968 F.2d 1435, 1438 (1st Cir. 1992).                 To\n\nmake this showing, the taxpayer must do more than allege an\n\nimproper   purpose;     he   must    introduce   evidence    to   support   his\n\nallegations.    Id.    Here, the district court supportably found that\n\nthe appellants failed to make this threshold showing.                   In so\n\nfinding, the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n                               V. Conclusion\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f",

Metzler, Attorney, Tax Division, Department of Justice, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This case is one of more than a dozen in federal courts across the country related to an Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") investigation into possible improper tax shelters.<sup>[1]</sup> As in the other cases, the targets of the investigation petitioned the district court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS. Approving a magistrate judge's report and recommendation, the district court denied the motions to quash and ordered the summonses enforced. The petitioners timely appealed. Consistent with every other court to address this issue, we affirm the district court.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. Background</i></h2>\n<p>The IRS investigation is focused on transactions that generated losses claimed from writing down the value of \"distressed debt\" consisting of consumer accounts receivable obtained from one or more Brazilian retail stores. According to an IRS Coordinated Issue Paper (\"CIP\")<sup>[3]</sup> issued in April 2007, such \"distressed asset and debt\" transactions (known as \"DAD tax shelters\") generate tax losses that are not allowable as deductions. In a DAD shelter, a foreign entity that does not pay <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> United States taxes sells purportedly high-basis, low-value debt (the \"distressed debt\") to a United States entity taxed as a partnership in exchange for a payment that is a very small percentage of the face value of the debt. The United States entity then contributes the distressed debt to other entities taxed as partnerships  partnerships in which interests are sold to tax shelter participants. The shelter participants then claim some or all of the face value of the distressed debt as a loss to offset other earned income. The IRS contends that U.S. taxpayers participating in the Brazilian debt DAD shelters claimed losses of approximately $39 million in 2003 and $119 million in 2004. The IRS is investigating the veracity of these claimed losses by examining the returns filed by the entities that pass on the losses to U.S. taxpayers and those filed by the individual taxpayers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. The parties</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants are engaged in the business of consumer receivables management and collection. They partner with creditors for the servicing and collecting of consumer receivables in a global industry fueled by increasing levels of consumer debt, increasing defaults of the receivables, and utilization of third-party providers to collect such receivables.</p>\n<p>Appellant John E. Rogers, an attorney with an MBA in international finance, was the driving force behind the appellants' involvement in the Brazilian debt market. Jetstream Business, Ltd.<sup>[4]</sup> (\"Jetstream\") was Rogers's platform for international investment opportunities. Jetstream is the Tax Matters Partner of appellants Derringer Trading, LLC (\"Derringer\") and Knight Trading, LLC (\"Knight\"). Rogers, in turn, is the sole shareholder of appellant Portfolio Properties, Inc. (\"Portfolio\"), an Illinois corporation that is the sole shareholder of Jetstream. Appellant Warwick Trading, LLC (\"Warwick\"), was formed by Jetstream as a possible vehicle through which to invest. In 2006, Derringer and Knight were transferred to appellant Sugarloaf Fund, LLC (\"Sugarloaf\"), a Delaware company. Rogers is the general manager of Sugarloaf.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. The summonses and prior proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>In June 2007, the IRS issued a set of administrative summonses to Massachusetts resident Michael Hartigan (\"Hartigan\"), an attorney, directing him to appear before IRS Revenue Agent Larry Weinger to testify and produce for examination documents and information relating to Derringer, Knight, Portfolio, Sugarloaf and Warwick. A few days later, Hartigan received a second summons from the IRS, directing him to appear before IRS Agent Kimberlee Loren to testify and produce documents regarding Rogers. The first set was served on Hartigan because he claimed losses on his joint income tax return based on his wife's interest in Derringer and Knight.<sup>[5]</sup> The second was based <span class=\"star-pagination\">*345</span> on his relationship with Rogers, as the IRS believed that Hartigan, in addition to receiving fees from participants, also assisted Rogers in organizing, managing and selling interests in the various entities.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The petitioners timely filed a motion to quash the summonses, claiming that the IRS was engaging in a nationwide pattern of harassment.<sup>[7]</sup> The government moved to deny the motion to quash and for enforcement of the summonses. After a hearing on the petitioners' motion for an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge denied both the motion for a hearing and the motion to quash, while simultaneously recommending the enforcement of the summonses. The district court adopted the report and recommendation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>IV. Discussion</i></h2>\n<p>The IRS has \"expansive information-gathering authority\" to determine tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code, including by issuance of summonses to taxpayers and third-party record holders. <i>United States v. Arthur Young &amp; Co.,</i> 465 U.S. 805, 816, 104 S.Ct. 1495, 79 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984); 26 U.S.C. § 7602. Taxpayers may petition to quash such summonses and the IRS may petition to enforce them. 26 U.S.C. §§ 7604, 7609. Enforcement proceedings are designed to be summary in nature. <i>Donaldson v. United States,</i> 400 U.S. 517, 529, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971). \"The court's role is to ensure that the IRS is using its broad authority in good faith and in compliance with the law.\" <i>United States v. Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d 963, 966 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>Regardless of who initiates the action, the court follows a familiar structured analysis in a summons enforcement proceeding. <i>Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d at 966. The IRS must first make a prima facie showing \"[1] that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, [2] that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, [3] that the information sought is not already within the Commissioner's possession, and [4] that the administrative steps required by the Code have been followed.\" <i>United States v. Powell,</i> 379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). The IRS need only make a \"minimal\" showing. <i>See </i><i>Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d at 966 (\"This burden is not taxing, so to speak.\"). An affidavit of the investigating agent that the <i>Powell</i> requirements are satisfied is sufficient to make the prima facie case. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>United States v. Dynavac, Inc.,</i> 6 F.3d 1407, 1414 (9th Cir. 1993); <i>Alphin v. United States,</i> 809 F.2d 236, 238 (4th Cir.1987); <i>In re Newton,</i> 718 F.2d 1015, 1019 (11th Cir.1983); <i>United States v. Will,</i> 671 F.2d 963, 966 (6th Cir. 1982); <i>United States v. Kis,</i> 658 F.2d 526, 538 (7th Cir.1981); <i>United States v. Garden State Nat'l Bank,</i> 607 F.2d 61, 68 (3d Cir.1979); <i>Howa Trading,</i> 2008 WL 2323872 at *4; <i>Thomas v. United States,</i> 254 F.Supp.2d 174, 180 (D.Me.2003).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*346</span> Once the IRS has made this showing, the burden shifts to the taxpayer to disprove one or more of the <i>Powell</i> requirements, or to show that enforcement would be \"an abuse of process, e.g., that the summons was issued in bad faith for an improper purpose.\" <i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1155-56 (C.D.Cal.2008) (<i>citing </i><i>Liberty Fin. Serv. v. United States,</i> 778 F.2d 1390, 1392 (9th Cir.1985)). The taxpayer's burden is heavy, and he \"must allege specific facts and evidence to support his allegations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1156. The district court found that the appellants failed to meet their ultimate burden. After reviewing the ruling on the motions to quash for abuse of discretion, <i>Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp.,</i> 323 F.3d 55, 66 (1st Cir.2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. The prima facie case</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants first argue that the district court erred when it concluded that the sworn declarations from Weinger and Loren were sufficient to establish the IRS's prima facie case under <i>Powell.</i></p>\n<p>Weinger's declaration stated that the summonses were issued for the purpose of investigating the appellants' returns because they may be involved in potentially abusive DAD tax shelters. More specifically, Weinger stated that the IRS examinations concerned the correctness of partnership returns filed by Sugarloaf, Warwick, Derringer and Knight for various tax years between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005. The examination also implicated returns filed by individual participants who claimed losses through their interests in these entities.</p>\n<p>Weinger further stated that Portfolio's S-corporation return for tax years 2003-2005 was a subject of his examination, as was Rogers, indirectly, because he was Portfolio's sole shareholder, and Portfolio's losses flowed directly through to his individual returns.</p>\n<p>Regarding the summonses at issue, Weinger stated that after following all IRS procedural requirements, the summonses were issued to Hartigan because he, through his wife (with whom he files a joint tax return) purchased tax shelters involving several tiers of LLCs receiving and contributing distressed debt to other LLCs, transactions appearing similar to the DAD shelters described in the CIP. Hartigan also promoted the sale of interests in similar LLCs to others. According to Weinger, Hartigan's wife indirectly owned between 96 and 98 percent of Derringer, and over 96 percent of Knight, during the relevant time period. Losses from each entity were claimed on the Hartigans' joint returns. Weinger also stated that an investor in and seller of tax shelters, such as Hartigan, should have documents and information responsive to the summonses, and that such documents would provide information to the IRS about income and expenses, the circumstances surrounding the loss-generating transactions and their anticipated tax benefits, all of which would be relevant to the IRS investigation. In addition, Hartigan would be expected to have information important to the IRS in making a penalty determination, such as the nature of due diligence performed by the appellants, and the extent of their reliance on an advisor. Finally, Weinger stated that while the IRS had obtained some information from taxpayers and third parties, it was not in possession of the summoned information.</p>\n<p>Agent Loren's declaration indicated that she was assigned to examine Rogers's role in organizing, managing and selling tax shelters; his compliance with various IRS registration and list maintenance requirements and potential penalties for violating them; and whether he made false or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> fraudulent statements in connection with selling and organizing the shelters. The declaration noted that the forty-three specific document requests would provide information to the IRS relevant to the Rogers examination. For example, where Hartigan personally marketed to participants, he would ordinarily have correspondence addressing tax implications. Such documents might help determine the legality of the shelters, the extent of Rogers's involvement and any liability for penalties. Also, information about fees paid to Rogers or Hartigan would go toward explaining Rogers's role in particular transactions. While Loren noted that the IRS had obtained copies of documents purportedly prepared by Rogers or Hartigan, those documents were obtained from third parties.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that the IRS easily met <i>Powell's</i> prima facie test. Considering the hearty content of the agents' declarations, and that even \"bareboned allegations\" can suffice to support the prima facie showing, <i>cf. </i><i>Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d at 968, we agree that the IRS met its initial burden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. The appellants' response</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants advance three theories in support of their argument that, contrary to the district court's conclusion, they successfully rebutted the IRS's prima facie case. The first is that the summoned information is not relevant to a legitimate purpose. Next, they argue that the summonses themselves were not issued for a legitimate purpose. And finally, they claim that the summoned documents are already in the IRS's possession. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Relevance to a legitimate purpose</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants' first substantive argument is that the information sought by the summonses is not relevant to a legitimate purpose. They set forth three supporting reasons: first, that the transactions in which they are engaged are different from the DAD shelter described in the CIP; second, that the IRS improperly targeted Hartigan's (and others') motives; and third, that the summonses were overbroad.</p>\n<p>We start our analysis by noting that \"the concept of relevance under § 7602 is broader than that under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" <i>Zugerese Trading LLC v. Internal Revenue Service,</i> 2009 WL 1706583, No. 08-30894 (5th Cir. June 18, 2009) (<i>citing </i><i>Arthur Young &amp; Co.,</i> 465 U.S. at 813-14 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1495). Moreover, the IRS may investigate \"merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.\" <i>Powell,</i> 379 U.S. at 57, 85 S.Ct. 248 (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Morton Salt Co.,</i> 338 U.S. 632, 642-43, 70 S.Ct. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401 (1950)).</p>\n<p>The gist of the appellants' first argument is that the transactions at issue here are not unlawful DAD shelters. Given the broad sweep of the IRS's investigative powers, however, such a determination is beyond the scope of the inquiries undertaken by the district court and this court in the summons enforcement context. <i>See Superior Trading,</i> 2008 WL 5192379 at *6, n. 10 (court in summons enforcement proceeding \"need not address whether transactions were lawful\"). \"The function of the [court] in an enforcement proceeding is not to test the final merits of the claimed tax deduction, but to assess within the limits of <i>Powell</i> whether the IRS issued its summons for a legitimate tax determination purpose.\" <i>Howa Trading,</i> 2008 WL 2323872 at *4 (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. White,</i> 853 F.2d 107, 116 (2nd Cir.1988)). Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that the claimed legality of their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> transactions provides a basis to quash the summonses.</p>\n<p>The appellants next argue that the motives of Hartigan and other persons or entities involved in the transactions at issue are \"completely irrelevant\" to the IRS's investigation. Again, given the wide breadth of relevance in the present context, we disagree. In a broad sense, the IRS is investigating the validity of the partnerships themselves for purposes of assessing the validity of the claimed tax losses. Thus, the IRS is permitted to inquire as to whether the parties \"intended to join together as partners to conduct business activity for a purpose other than tax avoidance.\" <i>Andantech LLC v. Comm'r,</i> 331 F.3d 972, 978 (D.C.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Next, the appellants' overbreadth argument focuses on the summonses' inclusion of the term, \"all documents,\" which, they claim, makes the summonses overbroad as a matter of law. The two cases upon which they rely, however, do not support this proposition. Both <i>United States v. Theodore,</i> 479 F.2d 749 (4th Cir. 1973) and <i>Racca v. United States,</i> 2007 WL 1108872, No. C06-1822RSM, (W.D.Wash. Apr. 11, 2007), contain fact-specific analyses that do not necessarily apply beyond their particular circumstances. Indeed, there are no cases that universally proscribe the use of \"all documents\" language. To the contrary, as the Fifth Circuit noted in rejecting an overbreadth claim in one of the many cases involving the same players and issues present here, a summons is not overbroad if it \"describes the requested material with sufficient particularity to permit the summoned party to respond adequately.\" <i>Zugarese Trading,</i> 2009 WL 1706583 at *1.<sup>[8]</sup> Here, the use of the term \"all documents\" is limited by reference to particular subject matters. We therefore conclude that the summonses are not overly broad.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Issuance for a legitimate purpose</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants next argue that the IRS did not issue the summonses for a legitimate purpose. Specifically, they claim that the IRS intended to use the summonses in order to avoid more restrictive Tax Court discovery rules, to harass them, and to improperly extend the statute of limitations applicable to the examination of tax returns.</p>\n<p>By way of background, a notice of deficiency permits an individual taxpayer to bring a Tax Court proceeding to challenge the tax liability claimed by the IRS in the notice. 26 U.S.C. § 6213. In the partnership context, a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment (FPAA) is analogous to a notice of deficiency. 26 U.S.C. § 6226. Discovery in Tax Court proceedings is more limited than that permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <i>Schneider Interests, L.P. v. Comm'r,</i> 119 T.C. 151, 2002 WL 31163105 (2002); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Admin. Enter., Inc.,</i> 46 F.3d 670, 672 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"Discovery in Tax Court proceedings is traditionally informal and noncoercive. . . .\").</p>\n<p>\"Courts look to the timing of a summons relative to the commencement of [tax court] litigation in order to evaluate validity in the face of such allegations.\" <i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1159-60 (<i>citing </i><i>PAA Mgmt., Ltd. v. United States,</i> 962 F.2d 212, 219 (2d Cir. 1992)). \"Where the summons is issued before the commencement of judicial proceedings, that summons is generally not found to undermine the discovery process.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, as the district court noted, it is undisputed that the IRS issued <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> the summonses <i>before</i> issuing the FPAA to Derringer.<sup>[9]</sup> Thus, \"the timing of the summons does not suggest that the IRS intended the summons as a pre-litigation discovery tool. . . .\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The appellants argue that because the FPAA was a \"final\" determination of Derringer's tax liability, the summons could only have been for illegitimate purposes. This position, however, overstates the impact of the FPAA. \"The FPAA is not `final' in the sense that its issuance necessarily obviates the need for further information, [or] brings the curtain down on the IRS's administrative or investigative role. . . .\" <i>PAA Mgmt.,</i> 962 F.2d at 219. Against this backdrop, the issuance of the FPAA does not invalidate the legitimacy of the Derringer summons. The appellants also rely on Rogers's version of a conversation with Weinger in which Weinger allegedly said that the IRS auditors were \"being guided by district counsel who planned to litigate regardless of the result of the audit and notwithstanding whether petitioners were able to prove bad business debt through the audit.\" The appellants rely on <i>PAA Mgmt., Ltd. v. United States,</i> No. 91C168, 1992 WL 346314 (N.D.Ill. Nov.19, 1992), for the proposition that the motive to use in litigation materials obtained by summons is evidence of an improper purpose. In <i>PAA Mgmt,</i> however, the court found that the IRS agent explicitly admitted that the IRS did not need the summoned materials for its examination, but rather that it only sought the material to \"protect the government's interests\" in Tax Court. 1992 WL 346314 at *5-6. There is no such admission here. Instead, the declaration in this case states that the information sought in the Derringer summons \"is still necessary\" to the determination of the accuracy of Derringer's returns. And contrary to the appellants' assertions, Weinger's alleged statement (which was in connection with a different summons enforcement proceeding<sup>[10]</sup>) does not compel an outcome in their favor here, particularly in light of the fact that in the other proceeding Weinger expressly denied being directed by counsel to seek specific documents. Moreover, there is no prohibition against IRS agents speaking with district counsel during an examination. <i>Good Karma, LLC,</i> 546 F.Supp.2d at 604. Accordingly, we reject the appellants' discovery claim.</p>\n<p>The appellants' claim of harassment<sup>[11]</sup> is based on two specific claims, neither of which is sufficient to merit relief. First, they argue that the IRS threatened the imposition of severe penalties if they did not settle. The IRS does not dispute that it sought settlement; however, \"The mere fact that the IRS attempted to settle with taxpayers . . . hardly amounts to a `threat.'\" <i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1158. Next, the appellants claim that the IRS threatened one of their attorneys. According to an affidavit from the attorney, IRS agents believed that the attorney's responses to document requests were incomplete and told the attorney that failure to respond could result in a disciplinary referral. This conduct does not rise to the level of harassment, either. In the first place, the attorney did not characterize the agents' communications as \"threats,\" nor have other courts viewed them as \"threats.\" <i>See, e.g., Superior Trading,</i> 2008 WL 5192379 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> at *6 (<i>citing Ironwood Trading,</i> 2008 WL 817066 at *3). Perhaps more importantly, the alleged threats involved an individual and partnership entity distinct from any in this case. Accordingly, the appellants' claim of harassment fails.</p>\n<p>We also reject the appellants' argument that the summonses were issued as a means to improperly extend the applicable statutes of limitation.<sup>[12]</sup> As the district court noted, and as the appellants concede, it was the filing of the petition to quash that tolled the statute, not the issuance of the summonses. 26 U.S.C. § 7609(e)(1). The statute is also tolled if the summoned party does not comply within six months. 26 U.S.C. § 7609(e)(2).<sup>[13]</sup> In the end, the appellants fail to cite any evidence in support of their statute of limitations argument.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's finding that the summonses were not issued for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. Documents already possessed</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants' final substantive argument is that the IRS is already in possession of the summoned documents. They rely on the fact that Rogers and the appellants' accountant have already appeared for interviews and produced documents. As previously noted, however, the IRS is entitled to obtain relevant records from third parties to compare for accuracy any records obtained from the taxpayer. While the appellants claim that \"more than one million pages of documents\" have been produced, they do not suggest how those documents are responsive to the summonses issued to Hartigan. <i>See </i><i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1161 (rejecting identical argument). Nor do they dispute that Hartigan has not yet provided testimony, as was requested. The appellants' claim that the IRS is already in possession of the summoned documents therefore fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Other arguments</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants make two additional arguments, neither of which require extended discussion. The first is that the district court should have stricken the IRS's petition to enforce, or deemed all of the appellants' allegations below admitted, because the IRS did not file an answer or a motion under Rule 12 or Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but instead responded to the petition with its own motion to deny that of the appellants and to enforce the summonses. We disagree. While the federal rules apply to these proceedings, \"they are not inflexible in this application,\" <i>Donaldson,</i> 400 U.S. at 528, 91 S.Ct. 534, since Rule 81(a)(5) explicitly states that the rules may be limited by the district court. Moreover, given that the IRS's motion \"mirror[ed] a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,\" <i>Cosme v. United States,</i> 708 F.Supp. 45, 48 (E.D.N.Y. 1989), we agree with the Fifth Circuit that the IRS \"sufficiently responded to the petition to quash. . . .\" <i>Zugerese,</i> 2009 WL 1706583 at *2.</p>\n<p>The appellants also claim that the district court erred in denying them discovery and an evidentiary hearing before ruling on the dueling motions. Yet as the Supreme Court has held, \"Summons enforcement proceedings should be summary in nature and discovery should be limited.\" <i>United States v. Stuart,</i> 489 U.S. 353, 369, 109 S.Ct. 1183, 103 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989). Accordingly, the decision whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> to conduct an evidentiary hearing in a summons enforcement proceeding is within the district court's discretion. <i>United States v. Tiffany Fine Arts,</i> 469 U.S. 310, 324 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 725, 83 L.Ed.2d 678. (1985); <i>Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d at 969. \"There is no hard-and-fast rule compelling an evidentiary hearing,\" <i>Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d at 967, and the \"district court may, in appropriate circumstances, forgo such a hearing and decide the issues on the existing record.\" <i>Id.</i> In order to proceed to an evidentiary hearing, a taxpayer must make a sufficient threshold showing that there was an improper purpose behind an IRS summons. <i>Copp v. United States,</i> 968 F.2d 1435, 1438 (1st Cir.1992). To make this showing, the taxpayer must do more than allege an improper purpose; he must introduce evidence to support his allegations. <i>Id.</i> Here, the district court supportably found that the appellants failed to make this threshold showing. In so finding, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>V.

Approving a magistrate judge's report and recommendation, the district court denied the motions to quash and ordered the summonses enforced. The petitioners timely appealed. Consistent with every other court to address this issue, we affirm the district court.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. Background</i></h2>\n<p>The IRS investigation is focused on transactions that generated losses claimed from writing down the value of \"distressed debt\" consisting of consumer accounts receivable obtained from one or more Brazilian retail stores. According to an IRS Coordinated Issue Paper (\"CIP\")<sup>[3]</sup> issued in April 2007, such \"distressed asset and debt\" transactions (known as \"DAD tax shelters\") generate tax losses that are not allowable as deductions. In a DAD shelter, a foreign entity that does not pay <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> United States taxes sells purportedly high-basis, low-value debt (the \"distressed debt\") to a United States entity taxed as a partnership in exchange for a payment that is a very small percentage of the face value of the debt. The United States entity then contributes the distressed debt to other entities taxed as partnerships  partnerships in which interests are sold to tax shelter participants. The shelter participants then claim some or all of the face value of the distressed debt as a loss to offset other earned income. The IRS contends that U.S. taxpayers participating in the Brazilian debt DAD shelters claimed losses of approximately $39 million in 2003 and $119 million in 2004. The IRS is investigating the veracity of these claimed losses by examining the returns filed by the entities that pass on the losses to U.S. taxpayers and those filed by the individual taxpayers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. The parties</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants are engaged in the business of consumer receivables management and collection. They partner with creditors for the servicing and collecting of consumer receivables in a global industry fueled by increasing levels of consumer debt, increasing defaults of the receivables, and utilization of third-party providers to collect such receivables.</p>\n<p>Appellant John E. Rogers, an attorney with an MBA in international finance, was the driving force behind the appellants' involvement in the Brazilian debt market. Jetstream Business, Ltd.<sup>[4]</sup> (\"Jetstream\") was Rogers's platform for international investment opportunities. Jetstream is the Tax Matters Partner of appellants Derringer Trading, LLC (\"Derringer\") and Knight Trading, LLC (\"Knight\"). Rogers, in turn, is the sole shareholder of appellant Portfolio Properties, Inc. (\"Portfolio\"), an Illinois corporation that is the sole shareholder of Jetstream. Appellant Warwick Trading, LLC (\"Warwick\"), was formed by Jetstream as a possible vehicle through which to invest. In 2006, Derringer and Knight were transferred to appellant Sugarloaf Fund, LLC (\"Sugarloaf\"), a Delaware company. Rogers is the general manager of Sugarloaf.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. The summonses and prior proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>In June 2007, the IRS issued a set of administrative summonses to Massachusetts resident Michael Hartigan (\"Hartigan\"), an attorney, directing him to appear before IRS Revenue Agent Larry Weinger to testify and produce for examination documents and information relating to Derringer, Knight, Portfolio, Sugarloaf and Warwick. A few days later, Hartigan received a second summons from the IRS, directing him to appear before IRS Agent Kimberlee Loren to testify and produce documents regarding Rogers. The first set was served on Hartigan because he claimed losses on his joint income tax return based on his wife's interest in Derringer and Knight.<sup>[5]</sup> The second was based <span class=\"star-pagination\">*345</span> on his relationship with Rogers, as the IRS believed that Hartigan, in addition to receiving fees from participants, also assisted Rogers in organizing, managing and selling interests in the various entities.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The petitioners timely filed a motion to quash the summonses, claiming that the IRS was engaging in a nationwide pattern of harassment.<sup>[7]</sup> The government moved to deny the motion to quash and for enforcement of the summonses. After a hearing on the petitioners' motion for an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge denied both the motion for a hearing and the motion to quash, while simultaneously recommending the enforcement of the summonses. The district court adopted the report and recommendation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>IV.

The taxpayer's burden is heavy, and he \"must allege specific facts and evidence to support his allegations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1156. The district court found that the appellants failed to meet their ultimate burden. After reviewing the ruling on the motions to quash for abuse of discretion, <i>Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781269\"><a href=\"/opinion/781269/elizabeth-v-bogosian-plaintiff-appellantcross-appellee-v-woloohojian/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. The prima facie case</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants first argue that the district court erred when it concluded that the sworn declarations from Weinger and Loren were sufficient to establish the IRS's prima facie case under <i>Powell.</i></p>\n<p>Weinger's declaration stated that the summonses were issued for the purpose of investigating the appellants' returns because they may be involved in potentially abusive DAD tax shelters. More specifically, Weinger stated that the IRS examinations concerned the correctness of partnership returns filed by Sugarloaf, Warwick, Derringer and Knight for various tax years between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005. The examination also implicated returns filed by individual participants who claimed losses through their interests in these entities.</p>\n<p>Weinger further stated that Portfolio's S-corporation return for tax years 2003-2005 was a subject of his examination, as was Rogers, indirectly, because he was Portfolio's sole shareholder, and Portfolio's losses flowed directly through to his individual returns.</p>\n<p>Regarding the summonses at issue, Weinger stated that after following all IRS procedural requirements, the summonses were issued to Hartigan because he, through his wife (with whom he files a joint tax return) purchased tax shelters involving several tiers of LLCs receiving and contributing distressed debt to other LLCs, transactions appearing similar to the DAD shelters described in the CIP. Hartigan also promoted the sale of interests in similar LLCs to others. According to Weinger, Hartigan's wife indirectly owned between 96 and 98 percent of Derringer, and over 96 percent of Knight, during the relevant time period. Losses from each entity were claimed on the Hartigans' joint returns. Weinger also stated that an investor in and seller of tax shelters, such as Hartigan, should have documents and information responsive to the summonses, and that such documents would provide information to the IRS about income and expenses, the circumstances surrounding the loss-generating transactions and their anticipated tax benefits, all of which would be relevant to the IRS investigation. In addition, Hartigan would be expected to have information important to the IRS in making a penalty determination, such as the nature of due diligence performed by the appellants, and the extent of their reliance on an advisor. Finally, Weinger stated that while the IRS had obtained some information from taxpayers and third parties, it was not in possession of the summoned information.</p>\n<p>Agent Loren's declaration indicated that she was assigned to examine Rogers's role in organizing, managing and selling tax shelters; his compliance with various IRS registration and list maintenance requirements and potential penalties for violating them; and whether he made false or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*347</span> fraudulent statements in connection with selling and organizing the shelters. The declaration noted that the forty-three specific document requests would provide information to the IRS relevant to the Rogers examination. For example, where Hartigan personally marketed to participants, he would ordinarily have correspondence addressing tax implications. Such documents might help determine the legality of the shelters, the extent of Rogers's involvement and any liability for penalties. Also, information about fees paid to Rogers or Hartigan would go toward explaining Rogers's role in particular transactions. While Loren noted that the IRS had obtained copies of documents purportedly prepared by Rogers or Hartigan, those documents were obtained from third parties.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that the IRS easily met <i>Powell's</i> prima facie test. Considering the hearty content of the agents' declarations, and that even \"bareboned allegations\" can suffice to support the prima facie showing, <i>cf. </i><i>Gertner,</i> 65 F.3d at 968, we agree that the IRS met its initial burden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. The appellants' response</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants advance three theories in support of their argument that, contrary to the district court's conclusion, they successfully rebutted the IRS's prima facie case. The first is that the summoned information is not relevant to a legitimate purpose. Next, they argue that the summonses themselves were not issued for a legitimate purpose. And finally, they claim that the summoned documents are already in the IRS's possession. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>1. Relevance to a legitimate purpose</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants' first substantive argument is that the information sought by the summonses is not relevant to a legitimate purpose. They set forth three supporting reasons: first, that the transactions in which they are engaged are different from the DAD shelter described in the CIP; second, that the IRS improperly targeted Hartigan's (and others') motives; and third, that the summonses were overbroad.</p>\n<p>We start our analysis by noting that \"the concept of relevance under § 7602 is broader than that under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" <i>Zugerese Trading LLC v. Internal Revenue Service,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1706583</span></span>, No. 08-30894 (5th Cir.

Moreover, the IRS may investigate \"merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.\" <i>Powell,</i> 379 U.S. at 57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106933\"><a href=\"/opinion/106933/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span> (1950)).</p>\n<p>The gist of the appellants' first argument is that the transactions at issue here are not unlawful DAD shelters. Given the broad sweep of the IRS's investigative powers, however, such a determination is beyond the scope of the inquiries undertaken by the district court and this court in the summons enforcement context. <i>See Superior Trading,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5192379</span></span> at *6, n. 10 (court in summons enforcement proceeding \"need not address whether transactions were lawful\"). \"The function of the [court] in an enforcement proceeding is not to test the final merits of the claimed tax deduction, but to assess within the limits of <i>Powell</i> whether the IRS issued its summons for a legitimate tax determination purpose.\" <i>Howa Trading,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2323872</span></span> at *4 (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509535\"><a href=\"/opinion/509535/united-states-of-america-and-james-m-serling-estate-tax-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 116 (2nd Cir.1988)). Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that the claimed legality of their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*348</span> transactions provides a basis to quash the summonses.</p>\n<p>The appellants next argue that the motives of Hartigan and other persons or entities involved in the transactions at issue are \"completely irrelevant\" to the IRS's investigation. Again, given the wide breadth of relevance in the present context, we disagree. In a broad sense, the IRS is investigating the validity of the partnerships themselves for purposes of assessing the validity of the claimed tax losses. Thus, the IRS is permitted to inquire as to whether the parties \"intended to join together as partners to conduct business activity for a purpose other than tax avoidance.\" <i>Andantech LLC v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185972\"><a href=\"/opinion/185972/andantech-llc-v-cmsnr-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span>, 978 (D.C.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Next, the appellants' overbreadth argument focuses on the summonses' inclusion of the term, \"all documents,\" which, they claim, makes the summonses overbroad as a matter of law. The two cases upon which they rely, however, do not support this proposition. Both <i>United States v. Theodore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"311479\"><a href=\"/opinion/311479/united-states-of-america-and-tobe-h-todd-jr-revenue-agent-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span> (4th Cir. 1973) and <i>Racca v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1108872</span></span>, No. C06-1822RSM, (W.D.Wash. Apr. 11, 2007), contain fact-specific analyses that do not necessarily apply beyond their particular circumstances. Indeed, there are no cases that universally proscribe the use of \"all documents\" language. To the contrary, as the Fifth Circuit noted in rejecting an overbreadth claim in one of the many cases involving the same players and issues present here, a summons is not overbroad if it \"describes the requested material with sufficient particularity to permit the summoned party to respond adequately.\" <i>Zugarese Trading,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1706583</span></span> at *1.<sup>[8]</sup> Here, the use of the term \"all documents\" is limited by reference to particular subject matters. We therefore conclude that the summonses are not overly broad.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>2. Issuance for a legitimate purpose</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants next argue that the IRS did not issue the summonses for a legitimate purpose. Specifically, they claim that the IRS intended to use the summonses in order to avoid more restrictive Tax Court discovery rules, to harass them, and to improperly extend the statute of limitations applicable to the examination of tax returns.</p>\n<p>By way of background, a notice of deficiency permits an individual taxpayer to bring a Tax Court proceeding to challenge the tax liability claimed by the IRS in the notice. 26 U.S.C. § 6213. In the partnership context, a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment (FPAA) is analogous to a notice of deficiency. 26 U.S.C. § 6226. Discovery in Tax Court proceedings is more limited than that permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <i>Schneider Interests, L.P. v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31163105</span></span> (2002); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Admin. Enter., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687650\"><a href=\"/opinion/687650/united-states-v-administrative-enterprises-incorporated-principal/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span>, 672 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"Discovery in Tax Court proceedings is traditionally informal and noncoercive. . . .\").</p>\n<p>\"Courts look to the timing of a summons relative to the commencement of [tax court] litigation in order to evaluate validity in the face of such allegations.\" <i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1159-60 (<i>citing </i><i>PAA Mgmt., Ltd. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582549\"><a href=\"/opinion/582549/paa-management-ltd-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 219 (2d Cir. 1992)). \"Where the summons is issued before the commencement of judicial proceedings, that summons is generally not found to undermine the discovery process.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, as the district court noted, it is undisputed that the IRS issued <span class=\"star-pagination\">*349</span> the summonses <i>before</i> issuing the FPAA to Derringer.<sup>[9]</sup> Thus, \"the timing of the summons does not suggest that the IRS intended the summons as a pre-litigation discovery tool. . . .\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The appellants argue that because the FPAA was a \"final\" determination of Derringer's tax liability, the summons could only have been for illegitimate purposes. This position, however, overstates the impact of the FPAA. \"The FPAA is not `final' in the sense that its issuance necessarily obviates the need for further information, [or] brings the curtain down on the IRS's administrative or investigative role. . . .\" <i>PAA Mgmt.,</i> 962 F.2d at 219. Against this backdrop, the issuance of the FPAA does not invalidate the legitimacy of the Derringer summons. The appellants also rely on Rogers's version of a conversation with Weinger in which Weinger allegedly said that the IRS auditors were \"being guided by district counsel who planned to litigate regardless of the result of the audit and notwithstanding whether petitioners were able to prove bad business debt through the audit.\" The appellants rely on <i>PAA Mgmt., Ltd. v. United States,</i> No. 91C168, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">346314</span></span> (N.D.Ill. Nov.19, 1992), for the proposition that the motive to use in litigation materials obtained by summons is evidence of an improper purpose. In <i>PAA Mgmt,</i> however, the court found that the IRS agent explicitly admitted that the IRS did not need the summoned materials for its examination, but rather that it only sought the material to \"protect the government's interests\" in Tax Court. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">346314</span></span> at *5-6. There is no such admission here. Instead, the declaration in this case states that the information sought in the Derringer summons \"is still necessary\" to the determination of the accuracy of Derringer's returns. And contrary to the appellants' assertions, Weinger's alleged statement (which was in connection with a different summons enforcement proceeding<sup>[10]</sup>) does not compel an outcome in their favor here, particularly in light of the fact that in the other proceeding Weinger expressly denied being directed by counsel to seek specific documents. Moreover, there is no prohibition against IRS agents speaking with district counsel during an examination. <i>Good Karma, LLC,</i> 546 F.Supp.2d at 604. Accordingly, we reject the appellants' discovery claim.</p>\n<p>The appellants' claim of harassment<sup>[11]</sup> is based on two specific claims, neither of which is sufficient to merit relief. First, they argue that the IRS threatened the imposition of severe penalties if they did not settle. The IRS does not dispute that it sought settlement; however, \"The mere fact that the IRS attempted to settle with taxpayers . . . hardly amounts to a `threat.'\" <i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1158. Next, the appellants claim that the IRS threatened one of their attorneys. According to an affidavit from the attorney, IRS agents believed that the attorney's responses to document requests were incomplete and told the attorney that failure to respond could result in a disciplinary referral. This conduct does not rise to the level of harassment, either. In the first place, the attorney did not characterize the agents' communications as \"threats,\" nor have other courts viewed them as \"threats.\" <i>See, e.g., Superior Trading,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5192379</span></span> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> at *6 (<i>citing Ironwood Trading,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">817066</span></span> at *3). Perhaps more importantly, the alleged threats involved an individual and partnership entity distinct from any in this case. Accordingly, the appellants' claim of harassment fails.</p>\n<p>We also reject the appellants' argument that the summonses were issued as a means to improperly extend the applicable statutes of limitation.<sup>[12]</sup> As the district court noted, and as the appellants concede, it was the filing of the petition to quash that tolled the statute, not the issuance of the summonses. 26 U.S.C. § 7609(e)(1). The statute is also tolled if the summoned party does not comply within six months. 26 U.S.C. § 7609(e)(2).<sup>[13]</sup> In the end, the appellants fail to cite any evidence in support of their statute of limitations argument.</p>\n<p>Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's finding that the summonses were not issued for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>3. Documents already possessed</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants' final substantive argument is that the IRS is already in possession of the summoned documents. They rely on the fact that Rogers and the appellants' accountant have already appeared for interviews and produced documents. As previously noted, however, the IRS is entitled to obtain relevant records from third parties to compare for accuracy any records obtained from the taxpayer. While the appellants claim that \"more than one million pages of documents\" have been produced, they do not suggest how those documents are responsive to the summonses issued to Hartigan. <i>See </i><i>Sterling Trading,</i> 553 F.Supp.2d at 1161 (rejecting identical argument). Nor do they dispute that Hartigan has not yet provided testimony, as was requested. The appellants' claim that the IRS is already in possession of the summoned documents therefore fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Other arguments</i></h2>\n<p>The appellants make two additional arguments, neither of which require extended discussion. The first is that the district court should have stricken the IRS's petition to enforce, or deemed all of the appellants' allegations below admitted, because the IRS did not file an answer or a motion under Rule 12 or Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but instead responded to the petition with its own motion to deny that of the appellants and to enforce the summonses. We disagree. While the federal rules apply to these proceedings, \"they are not inflexible in this application,\" <i>Donaldson,</i> 400 U.S. at 528, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108236\"><a href=\"/opinion/108236/donaldson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, since Rule 81(a)(5) explicitly states that the rules may be limited by the district court. Moreover, given that the IRS's motion \"mirror[ed] a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,\" <i>Cosme v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2389875\"><a href=\"/opinion/2389875/cosme-v-irs/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
