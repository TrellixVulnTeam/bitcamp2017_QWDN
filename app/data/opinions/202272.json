On February 6, 2002, Moisés\n\nMuñiz-Crespo (\"Moisés\"), a minor, and his parents, Héctor Muñiz and\n\nSonia Crespo (collectively \"plaintiffs\"), brought this diversity\n\naction in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico, alleging medical malpractice against defendant Dr.\n\nSalvador Rovira-Martinó (\"Dr. Rovira\").1       Plaintiffs requested\n\ndamages caused by Dr. Rovira's failure to provide Moisés with\n\nadequate pre-natal care and for his mishandling of the infant's\n\ndelivery.\n\n            On May 15, 2003, a jury found that Moisés suffered a\n\nlesion in his brachial plexus2 due to traction during his delivery,\n\nwhich permanently impaired the use of his left arm and hand.     The\n\njury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of two million\n\ndollars.    On June 11, 2003, the district court reduced the award to\n\n$1,790,000.     Dr. Rovira appealed the judgment and we affirmed.\n\nMuñiz v. Rovira, 373 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004).       On May 10, 2004,\n\nRovira filed a Motion to Set Aside Judgment, pursuant to Rule\n\n\n1\n   Plaintiffs also filed suit against Hospital San Antonio, Inc.\nand the Puerto Rico Insurance Guaranty Association, but the parties\nsettled on December 9, 2002 and April 11, 2003, respectively, and\nthose claims are not relevant to this appeal.\n2\n   The brachial plexus is \"formed from a group of combining nerve\nroots that eventually divide again to form both motor and sensory\nperipheral nerves. These peripheral nerves are responsible for the\nentire sensory and motor supply to the upper extremities\n(shoulders, arms, forearms, and hands) and some muscles of the back\nand chest.\"\nhttp://neurosurgery.ucla.edu/Diagnoses/PeripheralNerve/Peripheral\nNerveDis_1.html.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f60(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.              On September 9,\n\n2004, the district court denied the motion, and Rovira now appeals,\n\nrequesting that we grant the motion, or in the alternative, remand\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing.                After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n           Sonia Crespo came into Dr. Rovira's care when she was\n\nthirty weeks pregnant.        She was thirty-eight years old, diabetic,\n\nand pregnant with her sixth child.                 The combination of these\n\nfactors made Sonia a high-risk patient, and the jury heard evidence\n\nfrom which it concluded that Dr. Rovira breached the applicable\n\nstandard   of   care   with    respect      to   her   pregnancy   and   Moisés's\n\ndelivery. At trial, the jury heard evidence that Dr. Rovira failed\n\nto monitor and control Sonia's blood sugar levels during the later\n\nstages of her pregnancy, and did not monitor adequately (through\n\nultrasound examinations and oxytocin challenge tests) Moisés's\n\nstatus during gestation.           These omissions increased the risk that\n\nMoisés would be macrosomic, i.e., a large infant.                  Large infants\n\nmust be delivered using specific methods (ideally by caesarean\n\nsection) to avoid injury, and plaintiffs' expert testified that Dr.\n\nRovira failed to take the necessary precautions to determine\n\nwhether Moisés was macrosomic.\n\n           Moisés      was    in    fact    a    macrosomic   infant,    and   he\n\nexperienced a traumatic delivery on April 29, 2000, during which he\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fsustained an injury to his brachial plexus.               The brachial plexus\n\ninjury led Moisés to develop Erb's Palsy, a paralysis of the\n\ncervical spinal nerves corresponding to the brachial plexus.                  As a\n\nresult   of    the    injury,   Moisés's    left   shoulder,    arm,   and   hand\n\nsuffered atrophy and did not develop normally.\n\n              The jury heard expert testimony to the effect that Moisés\n\nhas little range of motion and diminished reflexes on his left\n\nside, even after extensive treatment and two surgeries.                      Sonia\n\ntestified that Moisés cannot play, bathe, use the restroom, or\n\nattend   school       without   extensive    supervision       and   assistance.\n\nPlaintiffs'     expert    testified   that    even   if   he    continues     with\n\nphysical therapy, Moisés's condition will affect him for the rest\n\nof his life.         Dr. Rovira, in turn, presented contrary testimony\n\nfrom an expert who predicted that Moisés would fully recover.\n\n              One year and five months after judgment was entered for\n\nplaintiffs, Dr. Rovira submitted to the district court video\n\nsurveillance footage3 of Moisés in support of his motion to set\n\naside judgment on the basis that plaintiffs had misrepresented the\n\nextent of Moisés's injuries at trial.\n\n              The district court reviewed the surveillance footage and\n\nmade the following observations: 1) On November 6, 2003, Moisés\n\n\n\n3\n   Dr. Rovira had retained North American Investigation (NAI), a\nprivate investigative agency, to conduct the surveillance in an\neffort to determine the extent of impairment to the mobility of\nMoisés's left arm.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fappears to be picking something up from the floor with his right\n\nhand while protecting his left arm.        The left arm appears stiff and\n\nshows no signs of ordinary mobility; 2) On the same date, Moisés\n\nappears to be trying to lower the hood of his jacket without using\n\nhis left arm; 3) On January 6, 2004, Moisés appears, holding and\n\n\"protecting\" his left arm; 4) On January 7, 2004, Moisés appears,\n\ncarrying a bag of indeterminate weight on his shoulders, but not\n\nusing his left arm; 5) On March 3, 2004, Moisés was observed\n\nwalking and \"showing a distinct and clear[ly] stiff left arm\"; and\n\n6) On April 28, 2004, Moisés appears to have had full movement of\n\nhis right arm, but his left arm was stiff as he waited for the bus\n\nto go to school.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            We review denial of a Motion to Set Aside Judgment under\n\nRule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Under 60(b)(3), \"the court may relieve a party or a party's\n\nlegal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\n\nfor . . . fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or\n\nextrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse\n\nparty.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3).         A successful rule 60(b)(3)\n\nmotion has two elements: \"First, the movant must demonstrate\n\nmisconduct -- such as fraud or misrepresentation -- by clear and\n\nconvincing    evidence.   Second,    the    movant   must   show   that   the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fmisconduct foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of\n\n[his] case.\" Karak, 288 F.3d at 20-21 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n           Dr. Rovira argues that he has satisfied both prongs under\n\nKarak, and that the district court abused its discretion by denying\n\nhis motion to set aside judgment.      As to the first prong, he claims\n\nthat plaintiffs misrepresented Moisés's injury and the extent of\n\nhis impairment.     Because we find that Dr. Rovira has not met his\n\nburden under the first prong, we do not consider the merits of his\n\nargument under the second.\n\n           In support of his allegation of misrepresentation, Dr.\n\nRovira   presents   an   alternative    interpretation   of   the   events\n\ndepicted in the surveillance video.      He disagrees with the court's\n\nanalysis of the video, essentially arguing that Moisés's failure to\n\nuse his left arm or hand in the activities depicted \"in no[] way\n\nevinces the child having trouble using his left arm\" because \"he\n\ncould be right-handed.\"     Based solely upon this flimsy argument,\n\nDr. Rovira concludes that the video actually depicts Moisés with a\n\nfunctional arm, and argues therefore that he has satisfied the\n\nfirst Karak prong.       We find Dr. Rovira's video evidence to be\n\nneither clear nor convincing.\n\n           Under Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n\n\"[f]indings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence,\n\nshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\"        We are bound by\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthis deferential standard of review, clarified by the Supreme Court\n\nin Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564 (1985).\n\nIn that case the Court held that,\n\n            [i]f the district court's account of the\n            evidence is plausible in light of the record\n            viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals\n            may not reverse it even though convinced that\n            had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it\n            would have weighed the evidence differently.\n            Where there are two permissible views of the\n            evidence, the factfinder's choice between them\n            cannot be clearly erroneous. This is so even\n            when the district court's findings do not rest\n            on credibility determinations, but are based\n            instead on physical or documentary evidence or\n            inferences from other facts.\n\nId. at 573-74 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Court could scarcely have been more clear on this point: we may\n\nnot exercise de novo review over the district court's account of\n\nthe video evidence in this case.    Under the clear error standard,\n\nDr. Rovira must convince us that there was only one permissible\n\ninterpretation of the surveillance footage, and that the district\n\ncourt's interpretation was clearly incorrect.    Dr. Rovira has not\n\nmet this burden.   Because we find that Dr. Rovira has not satisfied\n\nthe first prong of Karak, we need not continue to consider the\n\nsecond.\n\n            Dr. Rovira requests, in the alternative, that we remand\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the gravity of Moisés's\n\ninjuries.    Dr. Rovira does not develop any argument in support of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthis request and we consider it waived.       Am. Cyanamid Co. v.\n\nCapuano, 381 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          We award standard costs to the appellees. The appellees'\n\nrequest for attorneys' fees, made in the closing sentence of\n\nappellees' brief, must be made by separate motion, 1st Cir. Loc. R.\n\n39(b), and we note that (absent statute) such motions are granted\n\nonly in egregious circumstances.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

The jury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of two million dollars. On June 11, 2003, the district court reduced the award to $1,790,000. Dr. Rovira appealed the judgment and we affirmed. <i>Mu&#241;iz v.

On May 10, 2004, Rovira filed a Motion to Set Aside Judgment, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On September 9, 2004, the district court denied the motion, and Rovira now appeals, requesting that we grant the motion, or in the alternative, remand for an evidentiary hearing. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sonia Crespo came into Dr. Rovira's care when she was thirty weeks pregnant. She was thirty-eight years old, diabetic, and pregnant with her sixth child. The combination of these factors made Sonia a high-risk patient, and the jury heard evidence from which it concluded that Dr. Rovira breached the applicable standard of care with respect to her pregnancy and Mois&#233;s's delivery. At trial, the jury heard evidence that Dr. Rovira failed to monitor and control Sonia's blood sugar levels during the later stages of her pregnancy, and did not monitor adequately (through ultrasound examinations and oxytocin challenge tests) Mois&#233;s's status during gestation. These omissions increased the risk that Mois&#233;s would be macrosomic, i.e., a large infant. Large infants must be delivered using specific methods (ideally by caesarean section) to avoid injury, and plaintiffs' expert testified that Dr. Rovira failed to take the necessary precautions to determine whether Mois&#233;s was macrosomic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mois&#233;s was in fact a macrosomic infant, and he experienced a traumatic delivery on April 29, 2000, during which he sustained an injury to his brachial plexus. The brachial plexus injury led Mois&#233;s to develop Erb's Palsy, a paralysis of the cervical spinal nerves corresponding to the brachial plexus. As a result of the injury, Mois&#233;s's left shoulder, arm, and hand suffered atrophy and did not develop normally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury heard expert testimony to the effect that Mois&#233;s has little range of motion and diminished reflexes on his left side, even after extensive treatment and two surgeries. Sonia testified that Mois&#233;s cannot play, bathe, use the restroom, or attend school without extensive supervision and assistance. Plaintiffs' expert testified that even if he continues with physical therapy, Mois&#233;s's condition will affect him for the rest of his life. Dr. Rovira, in turn, presented contrary testimony from an expert who predicted that Mois&#233;s would fully recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year and five months after judgment was entered for plaintiffs, Dr. Rovira submitted to the district court video surveillance footage<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> of Mois&#233;s in support of his motion to set aside judgment on the basis that plaintiffs had misrepresented the extent of Mois&#233;s's injuries at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reviewed the surveillance footage and made the following observations: 1) On November 6, 2003, Mois&#233;s appears to be picking something up from the floor with his right hand while protecting his left arm. The left arm appears stiff and shows no signs of ordinary mobility; 2) On the same date, Mois&#233;s appears to be trying to lower the hood of his jacket without using his left arm; 3) On January 6, 2004, Mois&#233;s appears, holding and \"protecting\" his left arm; 4) On January 7, 2004, Mois&#233;s appears, carrying a bag of indeterminate weight on his shoulders, but not using his left arm; 5) On March 3, 2004, Mois&#233;s was observed walking and \"showing a distinct and clear[ly] stiff left arm\"; and 6) On April 28, 2004, Mois&#233;s appears to have had full movement of his right arm, but his left arm was stiff as he waited for the bus to go to school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review denial of a Motion to Set Aside Judgment under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for abuse of discretion. <i>Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199935\"><a href=\"/opinion/199935/karak-v-bursaw-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2002). Under 60(b)(3), \"the court may relieve a party or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). A successful rule 60(b)(3) motion has two elements: \"First, the movant must demonstrate misconduct&#8212;such as fraud or misrepresentation&#8212;by clear and convincing evidence. Second, the movant must show that the misconduct foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of [his] case.\" <i>Karak,</i> 288 F.3d at 20-21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rovira argues that he has satisfied both prongs under <i>Karak,</i> and that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to set aside judgment. As to the first prong, he claims that plaintiffs misrepresented Mois&#233;s's injury and the extent of his impairment. Because we find that Dr. Rovira has not met his burden under the first prong, we do not consider the merits of his argument under the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his allegation of misrepresentation, Dr. Rovira presents an alternative interpretation of the events depicted in the surveillance video. He disagrees with the court's analysis of the video, essentially arguing that Mois&#233;s's failure to use his left arm or hand in the activities depicted \"in no[] way evinces the child having trouble using his left arm\" because \"he could be right-handed.\" Based solely upon this flimsy argument, Dr. Rovira concludes that the video actually depicts Mois&#233;s with a functional arm, and argues therefore that he has satisfied the first <i>Karak</i> prong. We find Dr. Rovira's video evidence to be neither clear nor convincing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[f]indings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\" We are bound by this deferential standard of review, clarified by the Supreme Court in <i>Anderson v.

Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. This is so even when the district court's findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 573-74 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court could scarcely have been more clear on this point: we may not exercise <i>de novo</i> review over the district court's account of the video evidence in this case.
