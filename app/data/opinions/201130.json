Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas W. Olick on brief pro se.\n     Edwin G. Schallert and Debevoise & Plimpton, LLP on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n                              July 14, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.      This appeal involves a dispute growing out of a\n\nmassive class action against John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance\n\nCompany and related defendants.          The underlying suit, brought on\n\nbehalf of nearly four million policyholders, charged defendants\n\nwith a number of deceptive sales and marketing practices.                       In a\n\nDecember 1997 final judgment, the district court certified the\n\nclass and approved a comprehensive settlement agreement imposing a\n\nseries of remedial measures. See Duhaime v. John Hancock Mut. Life\n\nIns. Co., 177 F.R.D. 54 (D. Mass. 1997); cf. Duhaime v. John\n\nHancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 183 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999) (collateral\n\nappeal).     One     such   measure    enabled      class   members     to     obtain\n\nindividualized relief through an alternative dispute resolution\n\n(ADR) process.\n\n     Appellant Thomas Olick, a former John Hancock agent and\n\nunnamed member of the plaintiff class, here complains about the\n\nmanner in which his ADR claims were handled.                  The ADR mechanism\n\ninvolves a   two-tiered      process.         A    \"claim   review     team\"    (CRT)\n\nconsisting of John Hancock employees initially evaluates a claim\n\nbased on objective scoring criteria prescribed by the settlement\n\nagreement.       A   claimant    may    then       appeal   to    an   independent\n\narbitrator, who reviews the claim de novo using the same scoring\n\nand relief criteria.         The arbitrator's decision is ordinarily\n\nbinding. Pursuant to this process, Olick submitted claim forms for\n\neleven   separate     policies   held    by       himself   and   various      family\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fmembers.    Under circumstances that are unclear from the record\n\nbefore us, defendants allegedly refused to accept seven of these\n\nclaims for ADR resolution. The remaining four were reviewed by the\n\nCRT and given the lowest score of \"1.\"                       After a hearing, an\n\narbitrator raised the scores to \"2.\"\n\n     When      no   awards    reflecting       these     revised     scores     were\n\nimmediately forthcoming, Olick filed a trio of motions.                  First, in\n\na \"motion to compel and to grant sanctions,\" he accused defendants\n\nof violating the settlement agreement in two ways: (1) by refusing\n\nto comply with the arbitrator's decision (or even to furnish him\n\nwith a copy thereof), and (2) by refusing to submit his other seven\n\nclaims to ADR at all.          By way of relief, he sought an order\n\ncompelling defendants to produce the arbitrator's decision and to\n\noffer awards consistent therewith; he also sought punitive damages\n\nfor defendants' alleged \"misconduct and contempt.\"                 Second, Olick\n\nsought to intervene on behalf of a subclass consisting of former\n\nJohn Hancock agents and their families, contending that defendants\n\nduring   the    CRT   stage   had    improperly        undervalued    the     claims\n\nsubmitted by such individuals.         Finally, Olick sought an emergency\n\nhearing.\n\n     While these motions were pending, defendants sent settlement\n\noffers to Olick on each of the four ADR claims; according to\n\ndefendants,     these   offers      complied    in     all    respects   with    the\n\narbitrator's decision.         Olick responded with a fourth motion.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCharging that the offers were \"frivolous and substantially less\"\n\nthan what was mandated by the settlement agreement, he sought\n\nproduction of all documents employed by defendants in calculating\n\nthose offers.\n\n     The district court summarily denied all four motions, but\n\nstated that the motion to compel and for sanctions was denied\n\n\"without prejudice pending a showing that defendants have not\n\ncomplied with the arbitrator's decision, as they represent they now\n\nhave.\"       Olick   unsuccessfully   sought   reconsideration    without\n\nattempting any such showing.      He now appeals.    We affirm.\n\n     While the district court's 1997 final judgment authorized\n\n\"action[s] to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement,\"\n\nDuhaime, 177 F.R.D. at 77, Olick has failed to carry his burden of\n\nestablishing any breach thereof.      With respect to the four claims\n\nthat were submitted to the ADR process, it suffices to note the\n\nfollowing.     Olick's motions are partly moot, now that defendants\n\nhave advanced offers in response to the arbitrator's decision.        To\n\nthe extent not moot, they are misplaced.            Olick acknowledges\n\nreceiving a \"full and fair hearing\" before the arbitrator and\n\nconcedes that the arbitrator's determination is binding. His vague\n\naccusation that defendants' offers conflict with that determination\n\nis unsupported.      And he has not otherwise satisfied the criteria\n\nfor intervention.      Under these circumstances, the district court\n\ndid not err in withholding the relief requested.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f       With respect to the seven claims allegedly excluded from the\n\nADR process, Olick asserts on appeal that he moved to \"compel\n\narbitration.\"      He also suggests that such a procedure is governed\n\nby the Federal Arbitration Act.             9 U.S.C. ยง 4.   Defendants, for\n\ntheir part, allege that such claims were the subject of earlier\n\narbitration unconnected to the Duhaime litigation; Olick retorts\n\nthat any such \"res judicata defense\" is one to be determined by the\n\narbitrator, not the court.         Whatever the merit of these positions,\n\nOlick's premise is mistaken: he never did move below to compel\n\narbitration of these claims. In the motions under review here, the\n\nonly    thing   he   sought   to    \"compel\"    was   compliance   with   the\n\narbitrator's decision.        With respect to the excluded claims, the\n\nonly forms of relief requested were sanctions and punitive damages,\n\nand those were properly denied.         Whether Olick might still be able\n\nto compel arbitration of these claims is a matter we leave for\n\nresolution, if and when presented by proper motion, by the district\n\ncourt in the first instance.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
