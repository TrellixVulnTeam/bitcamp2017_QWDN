Bashkim Alimadhi is an Albanian national who\n\nentered the United States on a fraudulent passport and visa in\n\nMarch 2001.   In removal proceedings begun a year later, Alimadhi\n\nconceded removability but sought asylum and withholding of removal\n\nbecause of persecution based on his political opinions.   8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42) (2000); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13 (2006).    The immigration\n\njudge (\"IJ\") held a hearing and denied relief in an order summarily\n\naffirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\n           Alimadhi was born in 1968 in Albania during the rule of\n\nEnver Hoxha, a Communist dictator.    The regime was overthrown in\n\n1991 and the Democratic Party of Albania ruled the country until\n\n1997.   Then, after another period of upheaval, the Socialist Party\n\nof Albania rose to power and has ruled ever since.     Alimadhi is\n\naffiliated with an opposition party, the National Front Party\n\n(\"PBK\"), which has a few legislative seats.\n\n           To support his claim of past and future persecution,\n\nAlimadhi described four incidents of alleged persecution at the\n\nhearing in front of the IJ.       Two of the incidents were not\n\nmentioned when Alimadhi was initially interviewed by an asylum\n\nofficer.    A third incident--an alleged beating of Alimadhi by\n\npolice in July 1997--occurred during a period when Alimadhi had\n\ntold the asylum officer he was in Greece.       Two of the alleged\n\nincidents were not mentioned in Alimadhi's written (and sworn)\n\nasylum application.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f          The IJ found Alimadhi not to be credible as to his\n\ndescription of alleged past persecution--a reasonable conclusion to\n\nwhich we defer.    Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).   Past incidents aside, Alimadhi's main basis for his\n\nalleged fear of future persecution is his claim that the present\n\nruling Socialist Party of Albania will persecute him because he\n\nbelongs to an opposition party.        The inference is at odds with\n\nState Department reports as to political conditions in Albania\n\ntoday; other of Alimadhi's family members, who belong to his own\n\nparty, reside peacefully in Albania.\n\n          The IJ's conclusion that Alimadhi has not established a\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution is so clearly supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence as to make detailed discussion unnecessary.\n\nWith that conclusion, Alimadhi's further claim for withholding of\n\nremoval also fails.    Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 n. 3\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).     So, too, does Alimadhi's additional claim for\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c).\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
