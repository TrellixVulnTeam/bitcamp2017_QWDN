This case stems from extensive\n\nfinancial mismanagement at the Passamaquoddy Tribe Indian Township\n\nReservation (the \"Tribe\") in Down East Maine.      Defendants Robert\n\nNewell, the former governor of the Tribe, and James Parisi, Jr.,\n\nthe Tribe's former finance director, were convicted for conspiracy\n\nto defraud the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 371, as well as\n\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 287, 666 and 669, involving the misuse\n\nof federal grant and tribal monies.    On appeal, Newell and Parisi\n\nraise a host of issues related to the federal court's jurisdiction\n\nover \"internal tribal matters,\" the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthe   lower   court's   jury   instructions,   sentencing,   and   the\n\nrestitution order entered against them.    For the reasons explained\n\nbelow, we vacate Parisi's conviction on count five and remand for\n\nclarification of certain issues related to the restitution order,\n\nbut otherwise affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The following facts are drawn from the parties' filings\n\nsupplemented by the record as necessary, and are presented in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict.    See United States v. Poulin,\n\n631 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            A.       Background\n\n            The Passamaquoddy Tribe is a federally recognized Indian\n\ntribe located in northern Maine.1              The Tribe is relatively small,\n\nwith fewer than seven hundred residents.                  It relies in large part\n\non federal grant and contract money for its financial survival.\n\nDuring the period of time at issue -- roughly, September 2002 to\n\nSeptember 2006, i.e., Newell's tenure as tribal governor -- the\n\nTribe received between five and eight million dollars annually in\n\nfederal grants and contracts.\n\n            The Tribe's political leadership consists of a governor\n\nand tribal council.            In addition, the Tribe shares a 12-member\n\njoint tribal council with its sister reservation in Princeton,\n\nMaine.     Council members receive no official salary, but many are\n\nemployed    by   the     tribal     government       in   other   capacities,         are\n\nreimbursed    for      travel     expenses,    and    receive     \"honoraria\"        that\n\napproximate      a    salaried     employee's    vacation       pay.         The   tribal\n\ngovernment provides administrative services to the tribal programs,\n\nincluding bookkeeping and accounting services.\n\n            The Tribe receives funding from the Bureau of Indian\n\nAffairs (\"BIA\") and the Department of Health and Human Services\n\n(\"HHS\")    through       the    Indian   Self-Determination            and    Education\n\nAssistance Act.          These grants are used to fund myriad tribal\n\n\n1\n   There are two Passamaquoddy reservations; this case concerns\nsolely the Indian Township reservation located near Princeton,\nMaine.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fservices, including the police, fire, child welfare and wildlife\n\nand parks departments, the housing authority, the Tribe's courts\n\nand schools, and the Indian health center.            The Tribe additionally\n\nreceives funding from HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health\n\nServices    Administration     (\"SAMHSA\")      for   an    HIV   awareness    and\n\nsubstance    abuse    prevention   program.          The    Tribe   received    a\n\nDepartment   of     Justice   (\"DOJ\")   COPS    program     grant   for    police\n\nequipment and training, as well as funding from the Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (\"EPA\") for its environmental department and from\n\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") for its\n\nhousing authority.        Each of the federal contracts and grants\n\nincluded terms and conditions specifying how they were to be used.\n\nGenerally, the contracts required the Tribe to use the funds to pay\n\nfor allowable direct costs of the identified programs, as well as\n\nspecified amounts of the indirect costs incurred by the tribal\n\ngovernment    for    administrative     services.          The   awarded    funds\n\ngenerally could not be diverted for non-contract or grant purposes\n\nwithout a contract amendment or agency approval.2\n\n            In addition to the federal grants and contracts, the\n\nTribe had income from its ownership interests \"in three companies\n\n[Dragon Cement, Creative Apparel and Northeast Blueberry Company]\n\n\n\n2\n    A tribe receiving BIA funds under a \"638 contract\" may\nreallocate funds intended for one program to another program funded\nby the contract unless the funds have a separate funding code.\nHowever, BIA funds cannot be diverted to non-BIA programs.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat it purchased with money it received under the Indian Claims\n\nSettlement Act.\"   This income was on the order of \"several million\n\ndollars . . . annually.\"\n\n          Newell served as the Tribe's governor from 1986 to 1993,\n\nand again from 2002 to 2006.     Newell served as his own finance\n\ndirector for the first year of his most recent term, but in the\n\nfall of 2003 he hired Parisi to fill the position.      Parisi had\n\nworked as a banker but did not have experience with federal\n\ncontracts.   In addition to Parisi, the finance department was\n\ncomposed of several bookkeepers and a federal grant compliance\n\nofficer, Linda Lewey.      Despite his official job title, Parisi\n\nappeared to have had little actual authority, and would refer most\n\nquestions to Newell.    There is also evidence that Parisi may have\n\nbeen somewhat ostracized by at least some of his co-workers as he\n\nwas not a member of the Tribe.\n\n          During his tenure as governor, Newell exercised extensive\n\ncontrol over tribal governance in general, and the Tribe's finances\n\nin particular.     Newell would transfer funds between the various\n\naccounts to pay for unauthorized expenses, including salaries for\n\nindividuals who did not actually work for the programs that were\n\nfunding them.    Newell also caused the Tribe's various programs to\n\n\"loan\" hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to the Tribe\n\nwhich he then disbursed in the form of \"general assistance\" to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fTribe members, including friends, family and political supporters.3\n\nThese loans were by and large never repaid.\n\n           We now sketch briefly the details of the transactions\n\nrelevant to the current appeals, leaving aside those uncontested on\n\nappeal. Our discussion is somewhat condensed in light of the large\n\nmultitude of transactions, which were spread over a number of\n\nyears, involved a large cast of supporting characters, several\n\ndistinct funding sources, and the arcana of accounting practices\n\nfor federal grants and contracts.\n\n           B.   The financial mismanagement\n\n           In 2003, the Tribe received a three-year, $350,000-per-\n\nyear grant from SAMHSA to fund its HIV and substance abuse program,\n\nknown as the Wonahkik program.           The Wonahkik program ramped up\n\nslowly. Roger Paul, the Wonahkik program coordinator, testified at\n\ntrial that the program did not \"get a staff to start getting things\n\nactually done\" until January of 2004.          As of October of 2003, the\n\nprogram   had   only   spent   $86,354    of   the   $350,000   grant.   In\n\nSeptember, Newell and Elizabeth Neptune, the director of the health\n\ncenter, wrote to SAMHSA requesting permission to carry over the\n\nremainder into the next fiscal year.           In October, Faye Socobasin,\n\nthe Tribe's SAMHSA bookkeeper, filed a \"269\" form with SAMHSA\n\nshowing that the Tribe had $236,645 in unspent grant funds. Lewey,\n\n\n3\n  The Tribe's General Assistance Office was set up to provide cash\nassistance and other forms of assistance to needy tribal members.\nAll general assistance had to be approved by the governor.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe Tribe's federal grant compliance officer, signed off on the\n\nform.    Parisi was hired at around this time.\n\n            In February 2004, before SAMHSA had responded to the\n\nrequest,    Newell      directed   that     the   unspent     funds   be    used   to\n\nreimburse the Tribe for salaries it had paid to three tribal\n\ncouncilors despite the fact that they did not actually work for the\n\nWonahkik program.4       Newell insisted that the grant money \"had to be\n\nspent,\" and that if the Wonahkik program wasn't going to spend it,\n\n\"the    Tribe    would.\"      Socobasin,     at     Lewey's   instruction,      then\n\nprepared a journal entry form for the Tribe's records indicating\n\nthat the three individuals had been paid out of the SAMHSA grant on\n\nor before September 30, 2003, the last day of the fiscal year.\n\nParisi signed the journal entry.\n\n            When SAMHSA notified the Tribe in April 2004 that it\n\nwould not permit the unused funds to be rolled over, Newell wrote\n\nback, stating, among other things, that the Tribe's initial 269\n\nreport   had     been   in   error,   and    that    the   Tribe   had     spent   an\n\nadditional $129,044 of the SAMHSA grant in salary expenditures in\n\nFY 2003.        Subsequently, Socobasin prepared a revised 269 form\n\nreflecting the additional $129,044 expenditures, again dated to\n\nappear as if they had occurred in September of 2003.                       Socobasin\n\n\n4\n  The individuals that Newell and Parisi paid through these grants\nworked for the tribal government, just not for the programs that\nwere funded by the federal grants. In other cases, the \"ghost\"\nemployees were employed at least part-time with the relevant\nprograms.\n\n                                       -7-\n\frefused to backdate the charges unless either Parisi or Newell\n\napproved it.      Parisi, rather than Lewey, subsequently signed the\n\nrevised 269 form.      Newell told Socobasin that Parisi should sign\n\nthe revised 269 \"so we can blame it all on him.\"              In June 2004,\n\nSAMHSA relented, and approved the Tribe's request to roll over the\n\nunused grant funds.\n\n            It was during this time that the tribal council learned\n\nthat the Tribe's budget had been overspent to the tune of $1.6\n\nmillion.    At a contentious council meeting, Newell admitted he had\n\nbeen using SAMHSA funds to pay council members, but insisted he had\n\nthe authority to do so.         The council voted to strip Newell of\n\nadministrative authority, but backtracked when it came out that\n\nthis   meant    they   would   no   longer   receive    general   assistance\n\npayments.      The council insisted that subsequent checks, with the\n\nexception of payroll and housing authority checks, be signed by two\n\ncouncil members. Undeterred and largely unimpeded, Newell was able\n\nto secure the cooperation of sympathetic council members or, in\n\nother cases, circumvent the council entirely by transferring funds\n\nthrough online or wire transfers.\n\n            The Tribe continued to pay the salaries of council\n\nmembers and other non-health center \"ghost\" employees with the\n\nhealth center's funds throughout FY 2004.              Wonahkik was not the\n\nonly program that saw its budget raided.          Funds were \"loaned\" to\n\nthe tribal government from the Indian Health Services (\"IHS\")\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcontract, state Medicaid payments, and EPA and BIA grants. Several\n\nof the tribal health services administrators objected, but Newell\n\nand Parisi continued to authorize the payments.      Parisi promised\n\nthat the non-employees would be taken off the health center's\n\npayroll, and that the funds would be restored.       When pressed by\n\nPaul about the missing funds, Parisi replied that it was \"normal\"\n\nfor Tribes to use incoming grant money to pay pressing non-grant\n\nrelated bills, and to replenish the funds later with other income,\n\nan explanation that Paul conceded he found \"reasonable.\"\n\n            Despite the earlier troubles, SAMHSA approved funding for\n\nthe Wonahkik grant for a second year.     This time around, however,\n\nSAMHSA required that the Tribe submit itemized claims for approved\n\nexpenses.    Thus, when Parisi requested $81,779 in reimbursement\n\nfrom SAMHSA in February of 2005, the claim was denied because it\n\nwas not correctly itemized.    Parisi resubmitted correctly itemized\n\nforms to SAMHSA in March, but because the requested amount included\n\nthe salaries of individuals who did not work for Wonahkik, SAMHSA\n\nultimately refused to pay for those claims.\n\n            Neither Newell nor Parisi was accused of lining their own\n\npockets. (Parisi appears to have been motivated mostly by a desire\n\nto retain his employment with the Tribe).      Newell, however, did\n\nimproperly redirect federal grant money to help friends and family.\n\nFor instance, shortly after Newell took office in the fall of 2002,\n\nhe refused to release funds that the BIA had awarded the Tribe\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthrough its Housing Improvement Program.          Instead, he spent the\n\nmoney on his friends, family, and tribal council members and their\n\nfamilies, including William Nicholas, the Tribe's current governor.\n\nSimilarly, in June of 2004, Newell had Carol Roehrich, the Tribe's\n\nBIA bookkeeper, issue his son, Roger, a check for $1020, ostensibly\n\nto reimburse Roger for the costs of attending training in Boston.\n\nAlex Nichols, Roger's supervisor, knew that Roger did not attend\n\ntraining in Boston and asked Roger to return the money.           Newell\n\ninsisted that Roger needed help, and the funds were never repaid.\n\nOn other occasions, Newell dipped into Housing Authority funds for\n\nwedding donations, unspecified small loans, travel reimbursement\n\nfor his son, Eric, and \"general assistance\" for two other Tribe\n\nmembers.\n\n           Despite his efforts to keep the political wheels well-\n\ngreased, by the spring of 2005, Newell was facing increasing\n\nopposition    to    his   leadership.   Several   of the   health center\n\nadministrators -- including Roger Paul, the head of Wonahkik, and\n\nElizabeth Neptune, the health center's director -- participated in\n\nan anti-Newell protest and went to federal investigators with their\n\ncomplaints.        Newell responded by cleaning house, firing Paul,\n\nNeptune and three other health center administrators.        Bookkeepers\n\nwho protested the interfund \"loans\" found themselves suspended.\n\nNewell then reassured Don Payne, the new head of the health center,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthat although       health   center    funds     were    being used    for    other\n\npurposes, the funds would be restored.\n\n            The misapplication of funds continued apace, and the\n\nTribe's financial situation deteriorated further.               As of the fall\n\nof 2005, the Tribe owed $866,000 to the BIA and IHS grants.                    The\n\nTribe had budgeted $621,000 in \"tribal assistance\" in FY 2005, but\n\nhad spent nearly three times that amount.               Newell continued to try\n\nto cover the Tribe's costs by \"borrowing\" money from the incoming\n\nfederal grants, and Parisi continued to offer assurances to the\n\naffected programs that the funds would be repaid. Although some of\n\nthe non-employees who had been drawing salaries from the grants\n\nwere finally removed at this point, some remained, and others were\n\nadded on.\n\n            Newell and Parisi received multiple warnings at around\n\nthis time that their conduct was of questionable legality.                      In\n\nearly 2005, the Tribe's outside auditor warned them that \"pooling\"\n\nfederal funds was permissible, but that the funds should only be\n\nused for allowable purposes, a point reiterated by Lewey, the\n\nfederal     grant     compliance      officer,     and     Roehrich,    the    BIA\n\nbookkeeper.5        Harry Schade, a former finance director for the\n\n\n5\n   Ronald Smith, the Tribe's outside auditor, testified at trial\nthat interfund transfers were a \"necessary part of the business\" in\nlight of the complexity of tribal finances, and that he had advised\nNewell and Parisi that they were consistent with accepted\ngovernment practices, provided the money was returned and accounted\nfor within \"a reasonable time frame.\"       Smith did not specify\nprecisely what such a time frame would be, but suggested \"a week\"\n\n                                       -11-\n\fTribe, was brought back in June of 2005 to help Newell and Parisi\n\nsort out the Tribe's increasingly desperate finances.              However,\n\nSchade's repeated demands that non-approved employees be taken off\n\nthe health center's payroll were ignored.\n\n           Newell and Parisi were also put on notice by warnings\n\nfrom various federal officials.          IHS officials confronted Newell\n\nand Parisi in August 2005 about delinquent audits and interfund\n\ntransfers.     Despite the fact that Schade and Payne had asked the\n\nIHS not to release the funds because Newell and Parisi were raiding\n\nthe accounts, the IHS was satisfied with Newell and Parisi's\n\nassurances that the funds would not be misused and that they would\n\nconduct an audit.    IHS then agreed to a lump sum wire transfer of\n\n$2,000,000 for FY 2006.         Within a week, over $400,000 had been\n\ndiverted to the tribal government at Newell's direction.               Newell\n\nand   Parisi   directed   the   health    center   to   \"loan\"   the   tribal\n\ngovernment a further $200,000 over the next two months.            In a by-\n\nnow-familiar scene, Schade protested and was subsequently fired.\n\nIHS officials began inquiring as to why so little of the grant\n\nfunds remained, but were rebuffed by Newell.\n\n           One of the \"loans\" in question occurred in November of\n\n2005.   At this point in time, the Tribe, together with its sister\n\nPleasant Point reservation, was engaged in an effort to place a\n\nreferendum question on the 2007 ballot asking for approval of a\n\n\nas an example.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcombined race track and casino, otherwise known as a Racino.              The\n\nJoint Tribal Council hired an outside firm to solicit the necessary\n\nsignatures to ensure that the question was placed on the ballot.\n\nNewell realized that the Tribe lacked the funds to pay for its\n\nshare of the expenses and so decided once again to dip into his\n\nfederal slush   fund,    a/k/a   the   health   center    budget.     Parisi\n\ntransmitted   Newell's    request      to   Frances    Neptune,     the   IHS\n\nbookkeeper, who drew up a check for $33,000.          After the payment was\n\napproved by two tribal council members, it was picked up by Joseph\n\nSocobasin, the Tribe's lieutenant governor and delivered to the\n\nJoint Tribal Council.    This money was never returned to the health\n\ncenter.\n\n          As he neared the end of his term, Newell must have\n\nrealized that the game was up, as the Tribe's financial situation\n\nhad become increasingly precarious at the same time that federal\n\ninvestigators were closing in on him.        In the spring of 2006, the\n\nsituation had become so dire that in order to meet the Tribe's\n\npayroll obligations, Newell directed Parisi to transfer funds from\n\nthe tribal employees' 401K account, and directed the account\n\nbookkeeper not to file the mandatory report with the company that\n\nmanaged the 401K program.    Parisi also directed the payroll clerk\n\nto pay only net salaries, meaning that state and federal tax\n\nwithholdings, 401K contributions, state garnishments for child\n\nsupport or back taxes, and rent (for those employees who lived in\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fHUD housing) were not paid.           Among the sources tapped to cover\n\npayroll was a DOJ COPS grant for the Tribe's police department.\n\nThe grant's remaining $30,000 of unspent funds was pressed into\n\nservice to meet the Tribe's payroll obligations.          When Newell left\n\noffice in September, after losing the election to William Nicholas,\n\nthe Tribe only had enough money left to pay one person's salary --\n\nNewell's.\n\n            When   Newell   stepped    down   as   governor,   \"the   Tribe's\n\nemployees had not been paid in two weeks, worker's compensation\n\npayments had not been made, vendors and programs were owed over $3\n\nmillion, and the Tribe owed federal programs $1.7 to $1.8 million.\"\n\nIn addition, the health center -- regularly raided by Newell -- had\n\noutstanding debts of approximately $850,000. An audit subsequently\n\nrevealed that the Tribe had no cash available, owed other funds\n\napproximately $1.6 million, lost $2 million from its general fund,\n\nand had once again overspent its general assistance budget by\n\napproximately $1.1 million.\n\n            In the spring of 2008, Newell and Parisi were charged by\n\nindictment with thirty counts of misapplying federal funds, making\n\nfalse statements to federal agencies, submitting false claims, and\n\nmisapplying retirement, police, housing authority and other program\n\nfunds, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.6\n\n\n\n6\n   For reference, a summary of the charges brought against Newell\nand Parisi is attached as an appendix.\n\n                                      -14-\n\f          C.    Trial\n\n          At trial, Newell argued that he believed in good faith\n\nthat he had the authority to act as he did, and that his intent had\n\nbeen to help the Tribe's impoverished and needy residents.    Parisi\n\nargued that he was an outsider who simply did as Newell instructed.\n\nThe jury found Newell guilty of all counts except count 10, and\n\nfound Parisi guilty of counts 1, 5, 8, 9, 11-15, 29 and 30.    Both\n\ndefendants moved for acquittal, and Parisi moved for a new trial.\n\nBoth defendants' motions were denied by the district court.\n\n          Newell's guideline range was determined to be 151 to 188\n\nmonths.   The court sentenced him instead to concurrent 60 month\n\nterms on counts 2, 3, 7-9, 11, 29 and 30, and concurrent 31 month\n\nterms on counts 1, 4-6 and 12-28, followed by three years of\n\nsupervised release. Parisi's guidelines range was determined to be\n\n51-63 months.    The court sentenced him to a year and a day, also\n\nfollowed by three years of supervised release.   In addition, under\n\nthe Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA), codified at 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3663, the court imposed a restitution order of $1,741,876.18 on\n\nNewell and $1,602,516.13 on Parisi, payable jointly and severally.7\n\n\n7\n   Newell's restitution order was composed of: (1) $305,693.77 to\nthe IHS; (2) $195,895.35 to HHS; (3) $782,693 to the BIA; (4)\n$45,230.05 to the EPA; (5) $30,000 to the DOJ COPS program; (6)\n$23,796,96 to the Maine Office of Substance Abuse; (7) $43,367.50\nto the Tribe's retirement fund; (8) $215,199.55 to the tribal\ngovernment; and (9) $100,000 to On Point underwriting.\n\n    Parisi's restitution order was identical, except for (4) and\n(8). The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence\n\n                               -15-\n\f          This appeal followed.\n\n         II.   Did the district court have jurisdiction?\n\n          Newell, joined by Parisi, first contends that counts 1,\n\n2, 29 and 30 fall outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n\nEssentially, the appellants argue that the Passamaquoddy Tribe has\n\nnegotiated agreements with the state of Maine and the federal\n\ngovernment granting them exclusive jurisdiction over \"internal\n\ntribal matters,\" and that the conduct charged in counts 1, 2, 29\n\nand 30 should be understood as such.\n\n          We note that the parties appear to have conflicting\n\nunderstandings of the nature of the claim being raised.                   The\n\ngovernment   appears   to    construe   the   claim   as   one   of   \"tribal\n\nsovereign immunity,\" and contends that Parisi, at least, has waived\n\nany such claim.   Parisi, for his part, insists that the argument\n\ninstead concerns our subject matter jurisdiction, and hence avoids\n\nthe \"[o]rdinary raise-or-waive rules\" which the government seeks to\n\nenforce against him.        See Cabán-Hernández v. Philip Morris USA,\n\nInc., 486 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).8\n\n\nthat Parisi was not responsible for the losses to the EPA, and\ndeducted amounts tied to \"acquitted conduct\" from (8), lessening\nthe   amount he was required to pay the tribal government to\n$121,069.55.\n8\n   There is some support for the government's interpretation.\nPrior to trial, Newell presented a motion to dismiss asserting a\n\"privilege based upon the sovereignty and sovereign immunity of the\nPassamaquoddy Tribe.\" The motion, which was ultimately denied by\nthe district court, cited the same statutory authority to support\nthe \"tribal sovereign immunity\" claim as the (allegedly)\n\n                                   -16-\n\f          As   we   have   noted,   an     \"objection   to    subject   matter\n\njurisdiction is not waivable and may be raised for the first time\n\non appeal.\"    F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de\n\nPuerto Rico, 449 F.3d 185, 189 (1st Cir. 2006).              Even if the same\n\nclaims were presented below as a sovereign immunity defense, this\n\ndoes not preclude the defendants from appealing to them, now, to\n\nchallenge our jurisdiction.         Our review is de novo.         Miller v.\n\nNichols, 586 F.3d 53, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"The existence of\n\nfederal subject matter jurisdiction . . . [is a] question[] of law,\n\nsubject to de novo review in this court.\").\n\n          Relations between the Tribe and the state and federal\n\ngovernment are governed by an agreement that the parties arrived at\n\nafter the Passamaquoddy filed suit in the 1970s, asserting claims\n\nto nearly two-thirds of Maine's land mass.        The Tribe and the state\n\nof Maine eventually reached a settlement, in which the Tribe \"in\n\nmany respects gained the powers of a municipality under Maine law.\"\n\nAkins v. Penobscot Nation, 130 F.3d 482, 484 (1st Cir. 1997).              The\n\nsettlement granted the Tribe recognition under federal law as a\n\ntribe, as well as entitlement to a portion of the income from an\n\n$81.5 million settlement fund established by Congress.                  See 25\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1723-24.     In exchange, the Tribe's claims to Maine's\n\nterritory were extinguished, and the Tribe agreed that \"with very\n\n\njurisdictional argument before us on appeal.       The sovereign\nimmunity argument presented there appears to have transmogrified\ninto an argument anent subject matter jurisdiction here.\n\n                                    -17-\n\flimited exceptions,\" it was \"subject to the laws of Maine.\" Akins,\n\n130 F.3d at 485; see also Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer, 164 F.3d\n\n706, 708 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"Maine was permitted to\n\nextend its jurisdiction over the Nation to a greater degree than\n\nmost states exercise over other Indian Tribes\").          The agreement\n\nbetween the Tribe and the state of Maine was memorialized in the\n\nAct to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, 30 M.R.S.A.\n\n§§ 6201-14 (the \"Implementing Act\").          The Implementing Act was\n\nsubsequently ratified by Congress in the Maine Indian Claims\n\nSettlement Act, at 25 U.S.C. §§ 1721-35 (the \"Settlement Act\").\n\n          Section 6206 of the Implementing Act states, in material\n\npart, that   \"internal   tribal    matters,   including   .   .   . tribal\n\norganization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or\n\ndisposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to\n\nregulation by the State.\"   30 M.R.S.A. § 6206.     This limitation on\n\nstate jurisdiction was incorporated into the federal Settlement Act\n\nby reference.   See 25 U.S.C. § 1725(f) (\"The Passamaquoddy Tribe\n\n. . . [is] hereby authorized to exercise jurisdiction, separate and\n\ndistinct from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of\n\nMaine, to the extent authorized by the Maine Implementing Act, and\n\nany subsequent amendments thereto.\").         We have interpreted the\n\nSettlement Act to interpose a bar to federal jurisdiction over\n\n\"internal tribal matters.\"        See Akins, 130 F.3d at 485 (\"[T]he\n\nNation in certain capacities functions as a municipality of Maine\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fand is reachable under state and federal law in that capacity, but\n\nwhen it functions as a tribe as to internal tribal matters, it is\n\nnot.\").\n\n            The    operative    question      is,   accordingly,    whether     the\n\nconduct alleged in counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 constitute \"internal\n\ntribal matters.\"         Newell's argument is that the government's\n\nattempt to enforce 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A) against him reaches\n\n\"internal tribal matters\" because \"the allocation of tribal money\n\namongst     tribal    accounts       only   affects    tribal      members,     not\n\nnonmembers\" and concerns only matters of \"tribal organization,\n\ntribal government, and the use or disposition of settlement fund\n\nincome.\"9     He     argues   that    \"[f]ederal    jurisdiction     over     these\n\nallegations would be contrary to the purpose of the Settlement\n\nActs, which is to allow the Tribe to handle internal tribal\n\nmatters, particularly internal government matters.\"\n\n\n\n\n9\n    Section 666(a)(1)(A) reads: \"Whoever, if the circumstance\ndescribed in subsection (b) of this section exists -- being an\nagent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal\ngovernment, or any agency thereof, embezzles, steals, obtains by\nfraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use\nof any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally\nmisapplies property that is valued at $5000 or more, and is owned\nby, or is under the care, custody, or control of such organization,\ngovernment, or agency . . . shall be fined under this title,\nimprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\"       18 U.S.C. § 666\n(a)(1)(A). The referred to circumstance is \"that the organization,\ngovernment, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in\nexcess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant,\ncontract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of\nFederal assistance.\" Id. § 666(b).\n\n                                       -19-\n\f          Not   surprisingly,   Newell   neglects   to   mention   that\n\nCongress specifically exempted the Tribe from several federal\n\ncriminal statutes in the Settlement Act -- but that § 666 is not\n\none of those exempted.   See 25 U.S.C. § 1725(c).    Indeed, Congress\n\nspecifically included Indian Tribes within the ambit of § 666(a),\n\nwhich explicitly applies to agents of \"Indian tribal government.\"\n\nThese observations suggest that assertion of federal jurisdiction\n\nover counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 was not improper.10\n\n\n10\n    We do not say that there could never be a challenge to the\nenforcement   of   §   666(a)(1)(A)  against   the Penobscot  or\nPassamaquoddy Tribes.     Although conditioned on the receipt of\nfederal funds, § 666(a)(1)(A) does not actually require the\nmisapplied   funds   to   themselves  be   federal funds.    The\njurisdictional question would thus be more difficult if the\nindictment alleged misapplication of settlement fund income, the\nuse or disposition of which is specifically exempted by the\nImplementing Act.      See 30 M.S.R.A. § 6206 (\"[T]he use or\ndisposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to\nregulation by the State.\").\n\n   However, Newell has alleged only that \"tribal income includes,\"\nand that the \"statute reaches\" settlement fund income, but has not\nprovided any more precise explanation of how counts 1, 2, 29 and 30\ndo so.    What is evident is that these counts contain specific\nallegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States and the\nintentional misapplication of the Indian Township Housing\nAuthority's Project Income and NAHASDA accounts, the Tribe's BIA\n638 contract, the tribal employees' retirement fund, and a DOJ COPS\ngrant.   It is possible that some of these sources (perhaps the\nTribe's retirement funds and/or the Housing Authority's Project\nIncome account) were made up of settlement fund income. But we\nsimply cannot say from the record whether this is so. Moreover,\nbecause Newell did not raise this issue below, there are no\nrelevant factual findings.\n\n   We have never considered whether there might, on some facts, be\na conflict between § 666(a)(1)(A) and 30 M.S.R.A. § 6206. In light\nof the undeveloped factual basis for the claims, we do not decide\nthe issue today.\n\n                                -20-\n\f           Although \"tribes generally retain the right to self-\n\ngovernment, [they] are nonetheless subject to federal criminal\n\njurisdiction of both a specified and more general nature.\"          United\n\nStates v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 593 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal\n\ncitations omitted).      In Boots, the defendants were accused, inter\n\nalia, of defrauding the Passamaquoddy Reservation of the honest\n\nservices of their police chief by attempting to bribe him.          One of\n\nthe defendants claimed that he should have been acquitted \"in\n\ndeference to tribal sovereignty.\"        Id. at 592.    We rejected this\n\nclaim, noting that the violations he was charged with \"are not\n\nspecific   to   Native    Americans,     but   rather   are   of   general\n\napplicability,\" and that even if such crimes \"may involve 'an\n\nindependent federal interest to be protected,' . . . it is unclear\n\nthat one is required.\"     Id. at 593 (internal citations omitted).\n\n           Conspiring to defraud the United States and misapplying\n\nfederal funds are, like the crimes defined by the wire fraud\n\nstatute at issue in Boots, crimes of general applicability.\n\nTherefore, even were we to accept Newell's claim that there is no\n\nfederal interest in how the Tribe transfers its money between its\n\naccounts, it is not clear that any \"peculiarly federal interest\" is\n\nin fact required for such a statute to apply to the Tribe.         Id., 80\n\nF.3d at 593.    Moreover, a less tendentious description of Newell's\n\nconduct would in any case suggest that there may well be a relevant\n\nfederal interest, viz. an interest in ensuring that federal grants\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fand contracts are spent in the way the government intends them to\n\nbe spent.      As the Supreme Court has held, when federal agencies\n\nspend taxpayer dollars, Congress has an interest in ensuring that\n\nthis   money    is   \"not    frittered       away    in   graft    or   on   projects\n\nundermined when funds are siphoned off.\"                  Sabri v. United States,\n\n541 U.S. 600, 605 (2004) (rejecting claim that § 666(a)(2) -- the\n\nanti-bribery portion of the statute at issue here -- required proof\n\nof a nexus between the federal funds received and the alleged\n\nbribe).     When \"money can be drained off here because a federal\n\ngrant is pouring in there . . . [i]t is certainly enough that the\n\nstatutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal\n\ndollars defining the federal interest.\"                   Id. at 606.        Congress\n\npresumably agreed that there was such an interest when it made\n\n§ 666(a) explicitly applicable to Indian tribal governments.\n\nMoreover, despite rather mysterious invocations of tribal self-\n\ngovernance, Newell has not managed to explain how holding him, qua\n\ngovernor of a Tribe that received millions of dollars a year in\n\nfederal financial assistance, criminally responsible for extensive\n\nmisuse of federal funds would interfere with a \"right integral to\n\nself-government.\"      Boots, 80 F.3d at 593.\n\n            Finally,    in    Akins,     a    case    about    a   tribe's    timber\n\nharvesting policies, we emphasized five factors that were \"strong\n\nconsiderations\" to take into account in deciding whether a dispute\n\nabout tribal practices constitutes an internal tribal matter.\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fAkins, 130 F.3d at 486-87.         These factors are (1) whether the\n\npractice in question \"purports to regulate only members of the\n\ntribe,\" or if \"the interests of non-members\" are \"at issue\"; (2)\n\nwhether it \"regulates the very land that defines the territory of\n\nthe Nation\"; (3) whether it concerns the use of a natural resource\n\nderived from the land; (4) whether it \"implicate[s] or impair[s]\n\nany interest of the state of Maine\"; and (5) whether construing the\n\nchallenged practice as an internal tribal matter \"is consistent\n\nwith prior legal understandings.\"         Id. at 486-87.   Applying these\n\nfactors to the current case reveals the following.             First, the\n\ninterests of non-members -- at the very least, those of the federal\n\nagencies in ensuring that the funds they award are properly spent\n\n-- are clearly implicated.         Second, the funds at issue include\n\nstate funds (count 10 alleged misuse of state Medicaid funds).\n\nFinally,   as   our   discussion   has    just   indicated,   prior   legal\n\nunderstandings support our finding that the challenged conduct does\n\nnot constitute an internal tribal matter.11\n\n           Because the conduct alleged in counts 1, 2, 29 and 30\n\ninvolves mismanagement of federal grants and contracts, which are\n\nsubject to regulations that the Tribe is not free to ignore, we\n\nhold that the conduct alleged in these counts do not constitute\n\ninternal tribal matters.      We emphasize that the case before us\n\n\n11\n   The other two Akins factors -- whether the practice concerns the\nTribe's use of its lands, or natural resources from the lands -- do\nnot apply here.\n\n                                   -23-\n\frests on malfeasance involving federal grant money, in which the\n\nfederal interest is clear.       It would be a different case if the\n\ncounts attempted to apply § 666 to mismanagement of settlement fund\n\nincome.    We express no opinion as to whether such a prosecution\n\nwould or would not implicate the internal tribal matters exception\n\nto federal jurisdiction under the Implementing and Settlement Acts.\n\n                 III.     Was the evidence sufficient?\n\n           We now turn to Parisi's contentions that the evidence\n\nfailed, in several key respects, to sufficiently support the jury's\n\nverdict.    \"We review a sufficiency claim de novo, drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the verdict to determine whether\n\na rational jury could find each element of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"      United States v. Scott, 564 F.3d 34, 39 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).\n\n           A.   Count 1\n\n           Parisi   challenges    the     sufficiency    of     the    evidence\n\nsupporting his conviction under count one, for conspiracy to\n\nmisapply    government     property     in   violation     of     18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(A), and to misapply the funds and assets of a health\n\ncare program, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 669.12         To prove its case,\n\n\n12\n    The governing conspiracy statute is 18 U.S.C. § 371, which\nreads, in pertinent part, \"If two or more persons conspire either\nto commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the\nUnited States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any\npurpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the\nobject of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or\nimprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\n\n                                   -24-\n\fthe government had to show beyond a reasonable doubt that \"(1) a\n\nconspiracy existed; (2) the defendant knew of and voluntarily\n\nparticipated in the conspiracy; and (3) there was an overt act in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\" United States v. Muñoz-Franco, 487\n\nF.3d 25, 45 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          Parisi challenges his conspiracy conviction under heading\n\n(1).   Parisi argues that a conspiracy consists of an agreement\n\nbetween two or more individuals to disregard or disobey the law,\n\nUnited States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1984), and that\n\nsimply doing what his employer asked of him was insufficient to\n\nestablish such an \"agreement.\"     The question is thus whether the\n\nevidence was sufficient to allow a rational jury to conclude,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that Parisi and Newell came to an\n\nagreement to \"disregard or disobey\" §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669, i.e.,\n\nthe statutes prohibiting the misapplication of government funds\n\ngenerally and the funds and assets of a health care benefit program\n\nspecifically.\n\n          We have noted in similar circumstances that \"[a] formal\n\nagreement [between co-conspirators] is not required; rather '[t]he\n\nagreement may be shown by a concert of action, all the parties\n\nworking together understandingly, with a single design for the\n\naccomplishment of a common purpose.'\"     Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at\n\n45-46 (internal citation omitted) (quoting Am. Tobacco Co. v.\n\nUnited States, 147 F.2d 93, 107 (6th Cir. 1944)).     In that case,\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\femployees of a bank and a development company were convicted for\n\nconspiring under 18 U.S.C. § 371 to commit bank fraud, misapply\n\nbank funds and make false entries in the books and records of the\n\nbank.    Id. at 45.    We dismissed their sufficiency of the evidence\n\nchallenge, noting that the two bank officials \"directly supervised\"\n\nand \"worked closely with\" the developer's loans, that the developer\n\nand his employee \"submitted many certifications for work not yet\n\ncompleted,\" that one of the bank officials \"repeatedly approved\"\n\nthose certifications, that the same bank official \"met frequently\"\n\nwith    the   developer's   employee   regarding      the   status    of    their\n\nbusiness ventures, and that the bank officials failed to disclose\n\nmaterial information to the bank's Board of Directors.                    We held\n\nthat this was sufficient to allow a jury to infer an agreement\n\namong the four defendants to defraud the bank.              Id. at 46.\n\n              The nature of the evidence in this case is similar.             The\n\nevidence presented at trial showed, for instance, that Newell\n\nchanneled money from the accounts of various federally funded\n\nprograms into non-approved uses.       These \"interfund transfers\" were\n\nrecorded as \"loans,\" and while some were ultimately repaid, others\n\nwere not.      Some of these expenditures went toward paying payroll\n\nand    general   assistance,   as   well   as   the    salaries      of    \"ghost\n\nemployees,\" individuals who either no longer worked at the various\n\ngrant-funded programs, or did not work for the time claimed.\n\nParisi signed off on financial status reports filed with the\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\ffederal agencies that were funding the programs, certifying that\n\nthe money was spent in accordance with the grant's terms.                Parisi\n\nwas     well    aware   that   the   grant   money    could   not   be     used\n\nindiscriminately; indeed, he was repeatedly told as much by the\n\nfund administrators themselves.         Nevertheless, Parisi continued to\n\ndivert federal grant funds, including funds provided by SAMHSA\n\nintended for the Tribe's health center, to payroll and tribal\n\ngovernment       expenses.     Parisi   promised     bookkeepers    at   these\n\nfederally-funded programs that the ghost employees would be removed\n\nfrom payroll, but that did not happen.         Similarly, Parisi assured\n\nthe manager of the Tribe's health center (funded by federal SAMHSA\n\ngrants) that the diverted funds would be repaid, although very\n\nlittle ultimately was.         This conduct persisted for a period of\n\nnearly three years.\n\n               The evidence presented against Parisi was sufficient to\n\nestablish that even if there was no express agreement with Newell,\n\nnonetheless there was an implied or tacit agreement.                     Newell\n\nordered that federal funds be misapplied and Parisi saw that they\n\nwere.     This was the requisite \"concert of action\" evincing a\n\n\"common purpose.\"       See Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d at 45-46.         We will\n\nnot disturb the jury's verdict as to count one.13\n\n\n13\n   Parisi insists that he was not conspiring with Newell but rather\n\"merely doing what Newell instructed him to do.\" This misconstrues\nthe issue.    The issue is not why Parisi may have agreed to\nparticipate in Newell's schemes; it is whether he so agreed. The\nanswer to that question is not affected one way or the other by the\n\n                                     -27-\n\f              B.   Count 5\n\n              Parisi next contends that he was improperly convicted\n\nunder count five, which alleged that he made a materially false\n\nstatement with regard to how $215,599.43 of a SAMHSA grant intended\n\nfor   the    Tribe's    Wonahkik    substance    abuse   and    HIV   prevention\n\nprograms was spent.           Parisi signed and submitted a \"financial\n\nstatus      report\"    with   HHS   claiming    this   amount   was    spent   in\n\naccordance with grant purposes.         In reality, $129,044.67 was spent\n\nto pay \"ghost employees\" -- Dennis Tomah, Sr., Dana Newell, and\n\nJohn Stevens -- who did not work for those programs during the\n\nrelevant time period.         Parisi's claims on appeal are, first, that\n\nthe government's evidence did not prove that his submission was\n\n\"knowing[] and willful[]\" as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2)\n\nand, second, that the form was in any case not \"material\" as it was\n\nimproperly filled out.14\n\n              \"To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the\n\ngovernment must prove that the defendant knowingly and willfully\n\nmade or used a false writing or document, in relation to a matter\n\n\n\nobservation that Parisi's only reason for being involved was\nbecause he was employed by the Tribe.\n14\n   Section 1001(a)(2) provides that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided\nin this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of\nthe executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of\nthe United States, knowingly and willfully . . . (2) makes any\nmaterially   false,   fictitious,   or  fraudulent   statement   or\nrepresentation . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned\nnot more than 5 years or . . . or both.\"\n\n                                      -28-\n\fwithin the jurisdiction of the United States government, with\n\nknowledge of its falsity.\" United States v. McGauley, 279 F.3d 62,\n\n69 (1st Cir. 2002).   \"Willfulness . . . means nothing more in this\n\ncontext than that the defendant knew that his statement was false\n\nwhen he made it or . . . consciously disregarded or averted his\n\neyes from its likely falsity.\"          United States v. Gonsalves, 435\n\nF.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Parisi contends that the government produced no evidence\n\nshowing that he knew that Tomah, Newell and Stevens had not worked\n\nin the Wonahkik program during the specified time.               The form\n\nreferenced a period of time prior to Parisi's employment at the\n\nreservation, and the jury acquitted Parisi of actually misapplying\n\nthose particular funds (count three).\n\n          An   examination   of   the    trial   transcript   reveals   the\n\nfollowing: at trial, Faye Socobasin (the tribal bookkeeper who\n\nactually filled out the form that Parisi later signed) was asked by\n\nthe prosecutor if she had conversed with \"either\" Parisi or Newell\n\nabout the inappropriate use of the funds.          She said she had, and\n\nthe prosecutor continued, \"so you did have a conversation with\n\nRobert Newell about this?\" to which she replied, \"Yes.\"                 The\n\nprosecutor then asked if she discussed the matter with Parisi, and\n\nshe replied that \"with Jim Parisi, I -- what I can remember is I\n\njust did the 269 [the financial status report] and told him that it\n\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fhad to be signed.\"     The prosecutor then went on to establish that\n\nParisi in fact signed the 269 form.\n\n            Three days later, Linda Lewey, the Tribe's federal grant\n\ncompliance officer, testified that Parisi was present at two\n\nmeetings during which the issue of what to do about the unused\n\nmoney in the SAMHSA grant was discussed.         The first meeting was\n\napparently in December of 2003, when the decision was taken to\n\nrequest permission from HHS to \"roll over\" the unused money into\n\nthe next fiscal year's budget.        Lewey appears not to have been\n\nquestioned as to what, specifically, transpired at the second\n\nmeeting.    As before, the prosecutor moved immediately to discuss\n\nwhether Parisi had in fact signed off on the fraudulent financial\n\nreports.\n\n            The most specific testimony on the issue of Parisi's\n\nknowledge of the falsehoods contained in the 269 form appears to\n\nhave been provided by Roger Paul, the Wonahkik program coordinator.\n\nThe prosecutor asked Paul whether he ever discussed payment of non-\n\nprogram employees with Parisi.       His reply was: \"I don't remember\n\nthat    issue   exactly.   There   were   many   occasions   I   spoke   to\n\nMr. Parisi, and there was one occasion I spoke to Mr. Parisi about\n\nthe finances, and I remember Mr. Parisi saying, well, that's what\n\nGovernor Newell wants done, and that's why we're doing it this\n\nway.\"    However, this statement is ambiguous in at least two key\n\nrespects.   First, Paul testified only that he discussed \"finances\"\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fwith Parisi.     And, second, it is unclear when Paul had this\n\nconversation with Parisi.   Even if Paul's testimony is sufficient\n\nto show that Parisi knew of the unauthorized use of SAMHSA funds,\n\nif the revelation occurred after the false 269 form had already\n\nbeen filed, it would shed little light on the crucial question of\n\nwhether Parisi knew the form to be false at the time of filing.\n\n          The evidence the government amassed as to Parisi's guilt\n\non count five clearly establishes that Parisi signed the 269 form,\n\nand that the 269 form misrepresented that certain expenses were\n\nproperly charged to the SAMHSA grant.   However, the evidence as to\n\nwhether Parisi at this point knew that the information he was\n\nfiling was materially incorrect -- that Tomah, Newell and Stevens\n\nhad not worked for Wonahkik in FY 2003 -- appears to be skimpy at\n\nbest. The time period in question was prior to Parisi's employment\n\nwith the Tribe, and we see no reason to believe that he knew,\n\nwithin a few months of his arrival, where every tribal member had\n\nworked in the previous fiscal year.     Conversely, of course, the\n\ninference of knowledge becomes increasingly pressing as Parisi\n\nbecame more and more deeply involved with, and received warning\n\nafter warning about, Newell's on-going financial tomfoolery.\n\n          Perhaps one could conclude from the evidence presented\n\nthat it was possible that ParisI knew the 269 form to contain false\n\nstatements.    But we do not see how a reasonable person could view\n\nthe evidence as establishing such knowledge beyond a reasonable\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fdoubt.   Accordingly, we find that the evidence was not sufficient\n\nto convict Parisi under count 5.15\n\n           C.    Counts 12-15\n\n           Parisi was convicted of counts 12-15, which assert that\n\nParisi   filed    fraudulent    claims     for    reimbursement     to   SAMHSA\n\nofficials in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2005, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 287.16      Parisi challenges his convictions\n\non these counts because he claims that the government failed to\n\nprove that the forms at issue were material.                   They were not\n\nmaterial, Parisi claims, because one of them -- the form underlying\n\ncount 12 -- was returned to him \"because it was not in a format in\n\nwhich [HHS] was willing to review it,\" and because the government\n\ndid not pay the claims listed on the forms underlying counts 13-15.\n\n           The   plain   language    of    §     287   makes   no   mention   of\n\nmateriality as an element of the offense.              Parisi argues that we\n\nshould nevertheless read materiality into the statute, as the\n\nEighth and Fourth Circuits have done.            See United States v. Adler,\n\n\n\n15\n   Because we vacate the conviction, Parisi's additional contention\nthat the 269 form was not \"material\" because it was incomplete and\nwas not relied upon by agency officials is moot. It is in any case\nwithout merit, for the reasons noted in section C, infra.\n16\n    \"Whoever makes or presents to any person or officer in the\ncivil, military, or naval service of the United States, or to any\ndepartment or agency thereof, any claim upon or against the United\nStates, or any department or agency thereof, knowing such claim to\nbe false, fictitious, or fraudulent, shall be imprisoned not more\nthan five years and shall be subject to a fine in the amount\nprovided in this title.\" 18 U.S.C. § 287.\n\n                                    -32-\n\f623 F.2d 1287, 1291 n.5 (8th Cir. 1980); United States v. Snider,\n\n502 F.2d 645, 652 n.12 (4th Cir. 1974).    In contrast, the Fifth,\n\nNinth, Tenth and Second Circuits have held that § 287 does not\n\nrequire proof of the materiality of the false statement.        See\n\nUnited States v. Upton, 91 F.3d 677, 685 (5th Cir. 1996); United\n\nStates v. Taylor, 66 F.3d 254, 255 (9th Cir. 1995); United States\n\nv. Parsons, 967 F.2d 452, 455 (10th Cir. 1992); United States v.\n\nElkin, 731 F.2d 1005, 1009-10 (2d Cir. 1984), overruled on other\n\ngrounds by United States v. Ali, 68 F.3d 1468 (2d Cir. 1995).\n\nFinally, the Third Circuit has split the difference and concluded\n\nthat materiality sometimes is, and sometimes is not, an element\n\nunder § 287.   See United States v. Saybolt, 577 F.3d 195, 200 (3d\n\nCir. 2009).\n\n          This case does not require us to express a view as to\n\nwhether materiality is an element under 18 U.S.C. § 287.   This is\n\nbecause Parisi's claim cannot succeed either way. As we have noted\n\nin other statutory contexts, a statement need not actually deceive\n\nto qualify as \"material.\"   Rather, \"materiality requires only that\n\nthe fraud in question have a natural tendency to influence, or be\n\ncapable of affecting or influencing, a government function.    The\n\nalleged concealment or misrepresentation need not have influenced\n\nthe actions of the Government agency, and the Government agents\n\nneed not have been actually deceived.\"    United States v. Corsino,\n\n812 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing United States v. Markham,\n\n\n                                -33-\n\f537 F.2d 187, 196 (5th Cir. 1976)); see also United States v.\n\nMoran, 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2004).17\n\n            It is thus clear that Parisi's claims would be unavailing\n\neven were we to read materiality into § 287.       The forms Parisi\n\nsubmitted    were   expressly   designed    to   cause   the   SAMHSA\n\nadministrators to pay on claims that were not authorized by the\n\nterms of the SAMHSA grant.   Although the 270 form at issue in count\n\ntwelve was returned to Parisi because it was improperly formatted,\n\nit contained the substance of the relevant false claims, which\n\nsubstance was re-submitted several days later in the correct\n\nformat.18   As our precedent on materiality makes clear, that SAMHSA\n\n\n17\n     Perhaps one might wonder whether this understanding of\nmateriality -- taken from the context of § 1001 -- is appropriate\nin the context of § 287. Parisi, however, is in no position to\nraise this argument. Parisi's argument for reading materiality\ninto § 287 in the first place rests on the putative statutory\nhistory of §§ 287 and 1001. He argues that § 1001 includes an\nexplicit reference to materiality because it was designed to\naddress false statements, which, unlike the false claims penalized\nin § 287, was not a common law term of art that already implicitly\nincorporated a materiality requirement. Therefore, § 287 does not\ninclude a reference to materiality simply because -- according to\nParisi -- doing so would have been otiose. We express no view on\nthe veracity of this account of the distinction between §§ 287 and\n1001, but note that if Parisi is correct, then it stands to reason\nthat materiality under § 1001 ought to be identical to that under\n§ 287, as the former (allegedly) only makes explicit what is anyway\nimplicit in the latter.\n18\n    The false claims at issue in counts 12-15 were requests for\nreimbursement from SAMHSA for the salaries of the same three tribal\ncouncil members that were the subject of counts 3 and 5. None of\nthese council members worked for the Wonahkik program. Although it\nis plausible that Parisi did not know of the fraudulent nature of\nthese claims with respect to the initial 269 form -- filed shortly\nafter he began working at the Tribe -- these forms were filed more\n\n                                 -34-\n\fadministrators were not ultimately deceived into paying out on the\n\nfraudulent claims at issue in counts 12-15 does not bear on the\n\nmateriality of the fraudulent misrepresentations.      Corsino, 812\n\nF.2d at 30. For these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to show\n\nthat the misrepresentations contained on the forms underlying\n\ncounts 12-15 were \"material.\"19\n\n          D.   Counts 1, 8, 9, 11, 29, 30\n\n          Finally, Parisi attacks his conviction under counts 1, 8,\n\n9, 11, 29 and 30 on the grounds that the government failed to prove\n\n\"the necessary criminal intent of acting willfully.\"   The relevant\n\nstatutes are §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669; the former alleges that\n\n\n\nthan a year after he was hired. Parisi does not contend that he\ndid not know, at this point, that these individuals did not work\nfor Wonahkik and so were not eligible to have their salaries paid\nby SAMHSA.\n19\n    Our conclusion here means that there is no need to dwell on\nParisi's complaint (which Newell joins) that the district court\nerred in failing to instruct the jury on materiality with respect\nto counts 12-15 (the counts alleging violations of § 287). Even\nassuming that materiality is an element under § 287, the failure to\ninstruct the jury on materiality is subject to harmless error\nreview. See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 9 (1999) (\"Unlike\nsuch defects as the complete deprivation of counsel or trial before\na biased judge, an instruction that omits an element of the offense\ndoes not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair\nor an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\").\nHarmless error review requires ascertaining \"whether it appears\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not\ncontribute to the verdict obtained.\" Id. at 15 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Our conclusion entails that even if\nthe district court erred in not giving the requested materiality\ninstruction -- and we certainly do not say it did -- that error was\nharmless as the evidence of materiality was more than sufficient to\nsupport the convictions under this standard.\n\n                                  -35-\n\fParisi \"intentionally misapplie[d]\" property, whereas the latter\n\nalleges that he \"knowingly and willfully\" embezzled, stole or\n\nconverted the assets of a health care benefit program.                   Parisi\n\ninsists that he had \"no motive to disobey or disregard the law, as\n\nhe gained no benefit from the transfers.\"\n\n           Parisi's argument is that in order to obtain a conviction\n\nunder either of these statutes, the government needed to show that\n\nhe acted \"willfully,\" meaning that the government had to show that\n\nhe acted with an illicit motive.          See Bryan v. United States, 524\n\nU.S. 184, 192 n.12 (1998) (explaining that the term \"willful\" in a\n\ncriminal   statute       \"generally    means   an   act   done    with   a   bad\n\npurpose.\"). Parisi supports his contention by suggesting that when\n\nallegedly fraudulent acts are not \"themselves wrongful,\" then the\n\ngovernment must additionally show illicit motive. See Fed. Deposit\n\nIns. Corp. v. Elder Care Servs., 82 F.3d 524, 572 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(noting that \"[n]ormally, a party suggesting fraud or bad faith is\n\nexpected to point to the misconduct (lies, rigged account books,\n\nself-dealing   by    a    fiduciary)    that   reflects   the    bad   faith or\n\nconstitutes the fraud,\" but acknowledging that \"on some occasions\n\nthe inference of fraud or bad faith might be compelled by the\n\ncombination of motive and outcome.\").\n\n           There appears to be scant law on the necessary mens rea\n\nunder either §§ 666(a)(1)(A) or 669, and we do not attempt here to\n\ndefine the precise criminal intent required by these statutes.                In\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\fparticular, we do not express any view as to whether the government\n\nis   required   to   prove   a    self-interested    motive   under   either\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(A) or § 669.        It is sufficient for our purposes to note\n\nthat,   even    if   Parisi's    argument   were   correct,   the   evidence\n\npresented was sufficient to support a finding of illicit motive.\n\nAfter all, Parisi evidently did have a \"motive to disobey or\n\ndisregard the law,\" and derived a very concrete benefit from doing\n\nso: continued employment with the Tribe.           Although not the direct\n\nbeneficiary of the financial maneuvers he executed on Newell's\n\nbehalf, Parisi benefitted indirectly by avoiding the fate of others\n\nwho protested and subsequently found themselves out of a job.\n\nThus, even if proof of an illicit motive or personal benefit was\n\nrequired -- an issue we do not resolve today -- the existence of\n\nsuch a motive or benefit was supportable from the facts.                  We\n\ndiscern no error in the jury's verdicts on this score.\n\n         IV.    Were the Pinkerton instructions misleading?\n\n           Both appellants contend that the district court erred in\n\ntwice giving the jury a Pinkerton instruction because doing so\n\ncould have misled the jury.         When an appellant claims that a jury\n\ninstruction would \"tend[] to confuse or mislead the jury on the\n\ncontrolling issues,\" we review for abuse of discretion.               United\n\nStates v. Silva, 554 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).          In assessing a challenge to a trial\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fcourt's jury instructions, we must bear in mind that \"[a] trial\n\njudge has broad discretion in deciding how best to communicate\n\ncomplicated legal rules to a lay jury.\"    DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc.,\n\n580 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir. 2009).   In addition, \"[w]hen reviewing a\n\ndistrict court's instructions to the jury, we look at the charge as\n\na whole, not in isolated fragments.\"   United States v. Taylor, 54\n\nF.3d 967, 976 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. García-Pastrana,\n\n584 F.3d 351, 385 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          A Pinkerton instruction tells the jury that they may hold\n\na defendant liable for a criminal offense in which the defendant\n\ndid not personally participate if it was committed during the\n\ncourse of and in furtherance of the conspiracy of which he was a\n\nmember.   See United States v. Pinkerton, 328 U.S. 640, 645-48\n\n(1946); United States v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92, 103 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nThe district court gave the jury a Pinkerton instruction once when\n\ninstructing on counts 29 and 30, and again when instructing on\n\ncounts 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.      Both Newell and Parisi objected\n\nbefore the court instructed the jury, and Parisi objected again\n\nafter the instructions were given.\n\n          Appellants argue that by giving the Pinkerton instruction\n\ntwice, the court created an undue risk that the jury would draw the\n\ninference that a person who had committed the substantive offense\n\nmust have been a conspirator as well.        See United States v.\n\nSánchez, 917 F.2d 607, 612 n.4 (1st Cir. 1990) (cautioning against\n\n\n                               -38-\n\fautomatically providing a Pinkerton instruction in cases \"where the\n\njury is being asked . . . to infer, on the basis of a series of\n\ndisparate criminal acts, that a conspiracy existed\").                  But see\n\nUnited   States   v.   Wester,   90    F.3d     592,   597   (1st   Cir.   1996)\n\n(rejecting challenge to Pinkerton instruction on grounds that in\n\nsome cases \"some interplay between the jury's assessment of guilt\n\non the substantive counts and the conspiracy charge is both natural\n\nand appropriate,\" and that \"the fact that substantive crimes were\n\ncarried out by the defendants, following discussions between them,\n\nmay well make the fact of agreement more likely\").\n\n           As the government notes, the two Pinkerton instructions\n\nwere not duplicative, but rather were addressed to two distinct\n\nsets of offenses -- the misapplication of tribal funds in counts 29\n\nand 30 and the misapplication of government and health care funds\n\nin counts 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.             Even if giving the instruction\n\ntwice created a risk that the jury would improperly infer the\n\nexistence of a conspiracy, there was a converse risk that failing\n\nto adequately instruct the jury that vicarious liability was\n\navailable on these distinct sets of charges would itself have\n\nmisled the jury.       (The appellants do not contend that Pinkerton\n\nliability was in fact impermissible on either set of charges).\n\nMoreover, it is worth bearing in mind that the appellants were\n\nfacing a thirty-count indictment, alleging violations of five\n\nseparate statutes in dozens of transactions occurring over the span\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\fof approximately four years.      The trial took eleven days, and the\n\njury instructions alone occupy approximately forty pages in the\n\ntrial transcript.     Under these circumstances, it was well within\n\nthe court's discretion to decide whether providing the Pinkerton\n\ninstruction twice would serve to clarify or to confuse.\n\n        V.    Were specific unanimity instructions required?\n\n             Many of the counts in the indictment -- specifically,\n\ncounts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 -- alleged multiple fraudulent\n\ntransactions.      Each of these counts listed multiple instances of\n\nthe misapplication of funds occurring within discrete one-year\n\nwindows.     The appellants now object that the structure of the\n\nindictment was duplicitous and violated their right to a unanimous\n\nverdict.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(a).    The gist of the appellants'\n\ncomplaint is that counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 of the\n\nindictment allowed the jury to vote to convict even though they may\n\nhave   disagreed     as   to   which   specific   acts   of   intentional\n\nmisapplication were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.          Some of the\n\njurors could have thought, for instance, that the appellants had\n\nintentionally misapplied funds on only a particular subset of\n\noccasions, whereas other jurors could have thought that they had\n\nmisapplied funds on a different subset of occasions.          Despite this\n\ndisagreement, the jurors could still have all agreed that the\n\ngovernment had proven that appellants had intentionally misapplied\n\nat least some funds, and voted to convict on that basis.              The\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fquestion    is    whether    unanimity    on     that    proposition        would    be\n\nsufficient to sustain the convictions.\n\n            Normally,       \"[a]   party's     entitlement      to     a    unanimity\n\ninstruction presents a question of law,\" meaning that \"the district\n\ncourt's answer to that question engenders de novo review.\"                        United\n\nStates v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir. 2003).                 However, in this\n\ncase, neither Newell nor Parisi raised the issue below, so we\n\nreview for plain error.        United States v. Pagán-Santini, 451 F.3d\n\n258, 267 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Puerta, 38 F.3d 34, 40-\n\n41 (1st Cir. 1994).     Plain error is established by showing not only\n\nthat error occurred, but that it was plain or obvious, violated\n\nsubstantial       rights,    and    \"seriously       affected        the    fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                         United\n\nStates v.     Pérez-Montañez,       202   F.3d   434,     442   (1st       Cir.    2000)\n\n(quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).\n\n            The    characterization       of   the      issue   as    one    of    jury\n\n\"unanimity\" is in some respects misleading.                No one disputes that\n\nconviction requires unanimous agreement amongst the jurors.                         The\n\nissue is rather what it is that they must be unanimous about.                      This\n\nquestion is subtle and difficult, and raises two closely related\n\nsets of issues.       The first is: when is a disputed fact -- e.g.,\n\nwhether the crime occurred on a Monday or a Tuesday, with a knife\n\nor a gun, against this or that victim -- one that the jury must\n\nunanimously agree upon, and when is it merely dispensable detail?\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fAnd the second is: when is a defendant's conduct one violation of\n\na statute, and when is it many?\n\n           Although the basic issue raised in this portion of the\n\nappeal concerns the second question -- potential duplicity in the\n\nindictment      --   the   government   devotes   substantial   energy   to\n\nresisting the appellants' argument on grounds that proof of a\n\nspecific transaction is not an element under the relevant statutes.\n\nBut, as we now explain, even if not always in the most perspicuous\n\nmanner, our cases have distinguished between unanimity as to a\n\ncrime's elements and unanimity as to a crime's instances.\n\n           A.    Unanimity as to a crime's elements\n\n           The government points us toward United States v. Lee, 317\n\nF.3d 26 (1st Cir. 2003).       In Lee, the defendant was convicted under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), which prohibited possession of \"fifteen or\n\nmore . . . counterfeit or unauthorized access devices.\"                  Lee\n\nclaimed that the jury was required to agree on which fifteen\n\nunauthorized credit cards he actually possessed. After considering\n\nthe statutory text, relevant legal traditions, the structure of the\n\nlaw, its legislative history and implications for unfairness, see\n\nLee, 317 F.3d at 37, we, on de novo review, rejected the claim and\n\nheld that \"the identity of the particular devices possessed by a\n\ndefendant is not an element\" under 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3).          Id. at\n\n40.   We cautioned, however, that \"[a]scertainment of the level at\n\n\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\fwhich unanimity is required . . . tends to be offense-specific.\"\n\nId. at 37.\n\n            The government insists that Lee controls the outcome here\n\nas well.     If so, then the appellants' claims are doomed.                    If a\n\nclaim fails under de novo review, then it must of course also fail\n\nunder plain error review.         So the question is whether Lee governs.\n\nIt does not.\n\n            The government fails to appreciate that the appellants\n\nare not contending that the jury had to be given a specific\n\nunanimity instruction because proof of a specific transaction is an\n\nelement of § 666(a)(1)(A), i.e., that the government must in every\n\nprosecution    under    §   666(a)(1)(A)     show      a    single,     unambiguous\n\nqualifying transaction. What the appellants are claiming is rather\n\nthat the indictment brought against them bundled multiple discrete\n\nviolations of the statute under single counts, meaning that, in the\n\nabsence of a specific unanimity instruction, it is unclear which\n\n(if any) of the referenced crimes commanded the jury's unanimous\n\nassent.    This claim is fundamentally not about the \"elements\" of\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(A); it is about the structure of the indictment.                    See\n\nUnited    States   v.   Holley,    942   F.2d   916,       927   (5th   Cir.   1991)\n\n(distinguishing alternative mentes reae for a single killing from\n\n\"the situation where a single count as submitted to the jury\n\n\n\n\n                                      -43-\n\fembraces two or more separate offenses, though each be a violation\n\nof the same statute\").20\n\n            This latter issue was not broached in Lee.    The statute\n\nat issue in Lee, 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), defined the crime in terms\n\nof possession of \"fifteen or more\" unauthorized credit cards.     The\n\ntext of the statute thus supported our finding that the statute did\n\nnot consist of \"fifteen acts of possessing an unauthorized credit\n\ncard, but, rather, a single act of possession of fifteen such\n\ndevices.\"   Lee, 317 F.3d at 39-40.    As we noted, the starting point\n\nof the analysis was the text of the statute, and the statute in\n\nthat case made it reasonably clear that \"Congress's emphasis was\n\nnot on the identity of the actual items . . . but, rather, on the\n\npossession thereof.\"    Id. at 38.\n\n            Because § 1029(a)(3) defined an offense in terms of\n\npossession of \"fifteen or more\" unauthorized credit cards, it was\n\nclear that even if some of the jurors thought that Lee possessed\n\nthis pile of cards while other jurors thought he possessed that\n\npile, either way Lee could have committed no more, and no less,\n\nthan a single violation of § 1029(a)(3).      The same cannot be said\n\nof the indictment brought against Newell and Parisi.\n\n\n\n\n20\n   The other material statute in the challenged counts is § 669.\nOddly, however, the parties focus their discussion exclusively on\n§ 666(a)(1)(A).    Our analysis, accordingly, is also focused\nexclusively on § 666(a)(1)(A).\n\n                                -44-\n\f           The government claims that the elements of an offense\n\nunder § 666 are:\n\n           1) the defendant was an agent of an Indian\n           tribal government; 2) who embezzled, stole,\n           fraudulently obtained or willingly converted\n           property worth at least $5000 of tribal\n           property [sic]; and 3) did so during a time\n           when the tribal government received more than\n           $10,000 in any one year from a qualifying\n           federal assistance program.\n\n           Counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 of the indictment each\n\ncontained descriptions of numerous transactions.            With a few\n\nexceptions, each of these transactions would seem, on its face, to\n\nbe enough to make out an independent violation of § 666(a)(1)(A).\n\nFor instance, count two claimed that Newell was \"an agent\" of the\n\nTribe, that the tribe \"received benefits in excess of $10,000\n\nthrough contract, grants, and cooperative agreements with U.S.\n\nDepartments and agencies,\" and that he \"intentionally misapplied\"\n\nthe following funds: (1) approximately $50,130 from the BIA Housing\n\nImprovement Program, and (2) approximately $44,000 from the Indian\n\nTownship   Housing   Authority.     In   light   of   the   government's\n\ncharacterization of the elements of § 666(a)(1)(A), it appears that\n\nproof of either (1) or (2) would have been sufficient to make out\n\na complete violation.   It thus appears that the appellants have a\n\npoint when they complain that the challenged counts presented \"two\n\nor more distinct violations of the same statute . . . lumped\n\ntogether in a single count,\" an allegation that the government, for\n\nits part, does not deny.\n\n                                  -45-\n\f            But if it is true that, for instance, misapplying $50,130\n\nin BIA funds and misapplying $44,000 of Indian Township Housing\n\nAuthority funds constitute discrete violations of the statute, then\n\ncount two did not allege two different ways of committing one and\n\nthe same crime, as in Lee, but rather alleged two entirely distinct\n\ncrimes.     Under these circumstances, an undifferentiated guilty\n\nverdict on count two would leave it entirely unclear whether the\n\njurors unanimously agreed (a) that Newell had misapplied the\n\n$50,130 in BIA funds; (b) that he had misapplied the $44,000 in\n\nIndian Township Housing Authority funds; (c) that he had misapplied\n\nboth; or (d) that he had misapplied either the BIA or the Housing\n\nAuthority funds, although they were not in agreement as to which.\n\nIn short, if a specific unanimity instruction was required, it was\n\nnot because proof of which specific funds were misapplied is an\n\n\"element\" under § 666(a)(1)(A), but because this indictment was\n\nduplicitous   in   consolidating   multiple   complete   offenses   under\n\nsingle counts.     Lee did not address this issue, and does not govern\n\nthis case.\n\n            The government has insisted in this appeal that the\n\nbundled allegations merely specify \"alternate means of committing\n\na crime,\" and therefore no specific unanimity instruction was\n\nrequired.    As we have noted, it is true that a jury does not need\n\nto agree upon \"a single means of commission\" of a crime.      See Schad\n\nv. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 631 (1991); see also Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\f7(c) (\"A count may allege that the means by which the defendant\n\ncommitted the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed\n\nit by one or more specified means.\").   However, it does not follow\n\nfrom the fact that unanimity is not required with respect to\n\nalternative means of committing one and the same criminal act that\n\nunanimity is not required with respect to multiple instances of the\n\nsame type of criminal act.21\n\n          B.   Unanimity as to a crime's instances\n\n          The transactions detailed in counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29\n\nand 30 occurred on various dates and involved misapplications from\n\nvarious sources. Count two, for instance, merely specifies that at\n\nsome point between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2003, Newell\n\nmisapplied some funds from the BIA and also some other funds from\n\n\n\n21\n   To conclude otherwise would be to conflate two distinct senses\nof \"alternate means of committing a crime.\" The distinction is\neasily illustrated.    Suppose, for instance, that there is some\ndoubt as to whether A robbed B with a knife or a pistol.        The\ngovernment may obtain a conviction for armed robbery even if some\nof the jurors believe A used a knife and others believe he used a\ngun. But one thing the government certainly could not do is to\ncharge A with two armed robberies -- once with the knife, and once\nwith the gun. The appellants' complaint in this case raises the\nlatter concern, but the government's response addresses the former.\n\n   Indeed, were the facts sufficient to support two distinct armed\nrobberies -- if, say, A robbed B with a knife and then, feeling\npeckish, returned at a later point and robbed B again with a pistol\n-- the jury would be required to unanimously agree which of the\ncrimes the government had proven. The point of specific unanimity\ninstructions is, presumably, to preserve this right to a unanimous\nverdict regardless of whether the government decides to charge the\ntwo armed robberies in separate counts or to instead fold them into\na single duplicitous one.\n\n                               -47-\n\fthe Indian Township Housing Authority.         The question now is how\n\nmany statutory violations the alleged conduct states.\n\n          We cannot evade this question because the Supreme Court\n\nhas indicated, on at least two separate occasions, that the jury is\n\nrequired to unanimously agree as to which instances of a crime the\n\ndefendant committed.      In Schad, the Supreme Court rejected a\n\nchallenge to Arizona's murder statute, which permitted conviction\n\non a theory of either premeditation or felony murder.             In his\n\nconcurrence, Justice Scalia concurred with the plurality largely on\n\ngrounds   of   legal   tradition,     and   disavowed   the   plurality's\n\nexplanation for why \"it is permissible to combine in one count\n\nkilling in the course of robbery and killing by premeditation.\"\n\nSchad, 501 U.S. at 651 (Scalia, J., concurring).              After all,\n\ndespite their \"moral equivalence,\" Justice Scalia noted that \"[w]e\n\nwould not permit . . . an indictment charging that the defendant\n\nassaulted either X on Tuesday or Y on Wednesday.\"22\n\n          Later, in Richardson v. United States, 526 U.S. 813, 815\n\n(1999), the Court held that a jury must agree unanimously as to the\n\nindividual violations making up the \"series of violations\" element\n\nunder the federal continuing criminal enterprise statute (\"CCE\"),\n\n21 U.S.C. § 848(a).       The majority specifically cited Justice\n\nScalia's warning in Schad as authority for the proposition that\n\n\n\n22\n   Schad was decided by a plurality.        Hence, Justice Scalia's vote\nwas necessary to the outcome.\n\n                                    -48-\n\f\"the Constitution itself limits a State's power to define crimes in\n\nways that would permit juries to convict while disagreeing about\n\nmeans, at least where that definition risks serious unfairness and\n\nlacks support in history or tradition.\"             Id. at 820.\n\n             We have described the type of indictment singled out by\n\nJustice Scalia in Schad, and subsequently emphasized in Richardson,\n\nas duplicitous -- that is, as one that \"join[s] in a single count\n\n. . . two or more distinct and separate offenses.\"                   United States\n\nv. Canas, 595 F.2d 73, 78 (1st Cir. 1979).            We must, therefore, now\n\nturn   our   attention     squarely    to    the   question     of    whether    the\n\ntransactions bundled under counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 were\n\nduplicitous -- that is, whether they described distinct violations\n\nof §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669.       If they did, then the failure to give\n\nspecific unanimity instructions was error.             If not, then not.\n\n             Determining     whether        the    challenged        counts     were\n\nduplicitous is no easy matter.23            In some cases the standard for\n\nindividuating crimes is obvious -- we count murders, for instance,\n\nby counting bodies.         But in other cases, determining how many\n\ncrimes were committed is much less clear. See, e.g., United States\n\n\n\n23\n   We have not always needed to engage in extended analysis of the\nallowable unit of prosecution under plain error. For instance, in\nUnited States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir. 2007), we\nwere able to sidestep analysis of this thorny question because\nFirst Circuit precedent had already established the unit of\nprosecution under the relevant statute. This is not the case here;\nthe unit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) appears not to have\nbeen previously considered by this court.\n\n                                      -49-\n\fv. Rivera Ramos, 856 F.2d 420, 422-23 (1st Cir. 1988).        The text of\n\n§ 666 offers little guidance.       Section 666(a)(1)(A) refers to\n\n\"property that is valued at $5000 or more and is owned by, or is\n\nunder the care, custody or control of\" qualifying institutions.\n\nSection 669 refers to \"any of the moneys, funds, securities,\n\npremiums, credits, property, or other assets of a health care\n\nbenefits program.\"   Neither clearly specifies the baseline unit of\n\nprosecution.    Although   the   statute   is   conditioned    upon   the\n\norganization's receipt of over $10,000 in benefits from a Federal\n\nprogram \"in any one year period,\"       § 666(b), this is consistent\n\nwith either (a) treating all qualifying transactions within a one-\n\nyear period as aggregated together to state one offense under § 666\n\n(a)(1)(A), or (b) treating each qualifying transaction as an\n\nindependent offense. The text of the statute thus fails to specify\n\nthe allowable unit of prosecution.\n\n          The legislative history of § 666 indicates that it was\n\nenacted as part of the Comprehensive Crime Bill of 1984, and that\n\nit was\n\n          designed to create new offenses to augment the\n          ability of the United States to vindicate\n          significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery\n          involving Federal monies which are disbursed\n          to private organizations or State and local\n          governments pursuant to a Federal program.\n\nUnited States v. Cicco, 938 F.2d 441, 444 (3d Cir. 1991) (citing S.\n\nRep. No. 98-225, at 369 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n\n\n                                 -50-\n\f3182, 3510). This history does not illuminate Congress's preferred\n\nunit of prosecution.\n\n          There is a \"surprising paucity of federal case law\n\nidentifying the unit of prosecution for § 666.\"      United States v.\n\nNystrom, No. 07-30100, 2008 WL 4833984, at *10 (D.S.D. Nov. 4,\n\n2008).   We have previously held that the government may aggregate\n\ntransactions occurring within a one-year time period in order to\n\nmeet the $5000 jurisdictional minimum of § 666(a)(1)(A).        United\n\nStates v. Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 484 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nCruzado-Laureano relied on a case from the Sixth Circuit, United\n\nStates v. Sanderson, 966 F.2d 184, 189 (6th Cir. 1992), which\n\nconcluded that aggregation to meet the jurisdictional minimum is\n\npermissible when the transactions are part of a single scheme. See\n\nalso United States v. Hines, 541 F.3d 833, 837 (8th Cir. 2008)\n\n(interpreting aggregation of transactions for purpose of § 666\n\ngenerally); United States v. Webb, 691 F. Supp. 1164, 1168 (N.D.\n\nIll. 1988) (\"[A]ggregation is permissible where the thefts are part\n\nof a single plan.\").\n\n          These   cases   are   not    dispositive   of   the   present\n\ncontroversy.   These cases were concerned with the propriety of\n\naggregation when the transactions involved sums which fell below\n\nthe jurisdictional minimum and hence did not make out independent\n\nviolations of § 666.   However, one of the rationales for allowing\n\naggregation under such circumstances is to ensure that poorly\n\n\n                                -51-\n\fmotivated officials do not evade liability under § 666 simply by\n\nstealing less than $5000 at a time.                See Webb, 691 F. Supp. at\n\n1168; Sanderson, 966 F.2d at 189.                Worries about opportunistic\n\nevasion of liability do not apply to transactions that involve sums\n\nlarger than the statutory minimum.                Since most of the bundled\n\ntransactions in this case involved sums greater than $5000, it is\n\nnot    clear    whether    this   line    of    precedent    would   support   the\n\naggregation that occurred in this case.              But see United States v.\n\nUrlacher, 784 F. Supp. 61, 64 (W.D.N.Y. 1992) (holding that the\n\nunit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) is \"'$5,000 or more,' from\n\nwhatever source, in any one year period in which the government or\n\nagency at issue receives more than $10,000 in Federal aid.\").\n\n               Fortunately, we are not completely without compass.              We\n\nhave    previously        given   more     general    consideration      to    the\n\nindividuation of criminal transactions.                See United States v.\n\nVerrecchia, 196 F.3d 294, 297-301 (1st Cir. 1999).               In Verrecchia,\n\nan undercover sting caught the defendant attempting to fence stolen\n\nfirearms.       When he was arrested, the police discovered weapons in\n\nboth    his    truck   and   in   the    adjacent    barn.      Verrecchia     was\n\nsubsequently charged with (among other things) one count related to\n\nthe two weapons found in the truck and another for the twenty-one\n\nweapons found in the barn, under the auspices of the federal felon-\n\nin-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).                    Id. at 296.\n\nVerrecchia contended that the counts were duplicitous insofar as\n\n\n                                         -52-\n\fthey each alleged multiple crimes, and that it was plain error not\n\nto instruct the jury that they had to agree on which gun or guns he\n\nwas shown to have possessed.       Id. at 297.\n\n           We rejected the claim under plain error review, and held\n\nthat \"[c]ontrary to Verrecchia's contention, . . . the government\n\ncould not have properly charged him with twenty-three separate\n\ncrimes for the twenty-three different guns he allegedly possessed.\"\n\nId. at 298.   We relied in part on the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nBell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81 (1955), and in part on the\n\noverwhelming consensus from other courts of appeals that \"the\n\nsimultaneous possession of multiple firearms . . . constitutes only\n\none crime.\"   Verrecchia, 196 F.3d at 297.\n\n           In Bell, the Supreme Court emphasized the \"presupposition\n\nof our law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\n\nagainst the imposition of harsher punishment.\"       Bell, 349 U.S. at\n\n83.   Therefore, \"if Congress does not fix the punishment for a\n\nfederal offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be\n\nresolved   against   turning   a   single   transaction   into   multiple\n\noffenses.\"    Id. at 84.       Accordingly, after finding that the\n\nlanguage of § 922(g)(1) (referring to \"any firearm\") was, like the\n\nlanguage of the Mann Act at issue in Bell (18 U.S.C. § 2421,\n\nreferring to \"any woman or girl\"), ambiguous as to the allowable\n\nunit of prosecution, and finding no indication of Congress's clear\n\nintent \"to treat each possession of a firearm as a separate\n\n\n                                   -53-\n\fviolation,\" we applied Bell in holding that the government properly\n\ncharged him with two offenses rather than twenty-three -- one for\n\nthe two guns found in the truck and the other for the twenty-one\n\nguns found in the shed.         Verrecchia, 196 F.3d 298.\n\n             The government cites Verrecchia for the proposition that\n\n\"[w]here separate instances of the same act are grouped in a single\n\ncount   .    .    .   there    is   no    duplicity.\"     This   is    a   serious\n\nmisunderstanding of Verrecchia.                 After all, on this view, the\n\nindictment in Verrecchia should have contained only one count,\n\nencompassing all twenty-three guns. But we quite clearly held that\n\n\"the indictment here correctly grouped the firearms into counts\n\nbased on the place of possession.\"              Id. at 298.   Moreover, Bell, on\n\nwhich we relied, did not say that every instance of the same type\n\nof criminal act could be lumped together under one count.                  It said\n\nthat, for the sake of lenity, a single transaction should not be\n\nsplit up into multiple offenses.            The focus on the transaction as\n\nthe unit of prosecution explains why there were two counts in\n\nVerrecchia, rather than either one or twenty-three: possession of\n\nthe guns in the truck counted as one transaction, and possession of\n\nthe   guns   in   the   shed    counted    as     another.     Thus,   Verrecchia\n\npermitted bundling of guns by transaction, not simply qua instances\n\nof the same type of criminal act.                  See also United States v.\n\nWaldman, 579 F.2d 649, 654 (1st Cir. 1978) (identifying appropriate\n\nunit of prosecution under 15 U.S.C. § 77(q)a to be \"separate\n\n\n                                         -54-\n\ftransactions accompanied by the use of the mails).      But see United\n\nStates v. Campbell, No. 90-1130, 1990 WL 151318, at *1-2 (1st Cir.\n\nJuly 19, 1990) (treating unit of prosecution under 26 U.S.C. § 5861\n\n(d) as possession of the \"individual firearm\").24\n\n          But if, as we held in Verrecchia, the fact that some guns\n\nare stored in a shed and others in a truck parked next to it is\n\nsufficient to constitute two distinct transactions, then there is\n\na compelling claim that misapplying funds from agency A in March\n\nand misapplying funds from agency B in July is also sufficient to\n\nconstitute two distinct transactions.     Thus, far from supporting\n\nthe   government's   position,   Verrecchia   appears   to   seriously\n\nundermine it.    In light of Verrecchia, insofar as the conduct\n\naggregated under counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 involved distinct\n\ntransactions, the counts must be deemed to bundle within their\n\nambit multiple distinct violations of § 666(a)(1)(A).\n\n          There is thus reason to believe that the indictment\n\nbrought against Newell and Parisi was constitutionally infirm. For\n\n\n\n24\n   Focus on the transaction as the unit of prosecution, at least\nwhen Congress has left the issue open, is consistent with how we\nhave treated claims of multiplicity in an indictment. Multiplicity\nis the converse of duplicity: it alleges that the government seeks\nmultiple punishments for the same offense via an impermissibly\nrepetitive indictment. In addressing multiplicity challenges, we\nhave noted that \"an inquiring court must determine whether the\nfacts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit of\nprosecution.\"    United States v. Pires, No. 10-1062 (1st Cir.\nApril 6, 2011) at *12. In applying this test, we focus on whether\nthere is evidence that might establish that the conduct in question\nconstitutes \"separate and distinct transactions.\" Id.\n\n                                 -55-\n\fthe only sense in which it is true that a duplicitous count merely\n\nspecifies \"alternate means of committing\" some crime is in the\n\nsense in which it is true that an indictment that alleges that A\n\nkilled B on Monday, C on Tuesday and D on Wednesday specifies\n\n\"alternate means\" of committing a single instance of the crime of\n\nmurder.      The Supreme Court has made quite clear that this form of\n\nindictment violates a defendant's right to a unanimous verdict.\n\nSee Richardson, 526 U.S. at 820; Schad, 501 U.S. at 651 (Scalia,\n\nJ., concurring).\n\n             Other circuits have come to similar conclusions.                In\n\nUnited States v. Holley, the Fifth Circuit held that an indictment\n\nthat charged counts of perjury on the basis of multiple statements\n\nrequired a specific unanimity instruction, as the \"government was\n\nrequired to prove dissimilar facts to show the knowing falsity of\n\neach statement.\"       Holley, 942 F.2d at 928-29.          The Holley court\n\nspecifically relied on Justice Scalia's warning against duplicitous\n\nindictments in Schad.       Id. at 927; see also      United States v. Bins,\n\n331   F.2d    390,   393   (5th   Cir.    1964)   (noting   that   a   two-count\n\nindictment, each count of which alleged multiple acts of uttering\n\nand publishing false documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1010,\n\nwas duplicitous, as \"[t]he filing of each false document would\n\nconstitute a crime, and each should be alleged in a separate and\n\ndistinct count of the indictment.\").              The Third Circuit has held\n\nthat the unanimity requirement extends to an indictment that\n\n\n                                         -56-\n\fincludes \"several transactions or occurrences, any of which could\n\nconstitute one of the acts proscribed by the charged statutes.\"\n\nUnited States v. Beros, 833 F.2d 455, 460-61 (3d Cir. 1987).                  The\n\nBeros court noted that \"just as the sixth amendment requires jury\n\nunanimity in federal criminal cases on each delineated offense that\n\nit finds a defendant culpable . . . it must also require unanimity\n\nregarding the specific act or acts which constitutes that offense.\n\nAbsent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too\n\nlittle protection in too many instances.\"           Id. at 461.   The Seventh\n\nCircuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to\n\nHolley.   See United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 471 (7th Cir.\n\n1998).    But see United States v. Margiotta, 646 F.2d 729, 733 (2d\n\nCir. 1981) (holding that the \"policy\" considerations behind the\n\nunanimity requirement suggest \"that a single count of an indictment\n\nshould not be found impermissibly duplicitous whenever it contains\n\nseveral   allegations    that   could     have    been   stated   as   separate\n\noffenses . . . but only when the failure to do so risks unfairness\n\nto the defendant.\").\n\n           The   risks    of    serious     unfairness     presented     by     a\n\nduplicitous indictment are apparent.             In conditions where jurors\n\ndisagree among themselves as to just which offenses the evidence\n\nsupports, the defendant may nevertheless wind up convicted because\n\nthe jurors agree that the evidence showed that he had committed an\n\noffense, even if it was ambiguous as to which one.                 See United\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\fStates v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir. 1995).            In other words,\n\nalthough a jury may return a guilty verdict even if the jurors\n\ndisagree about how a specific crime was committed, this is quite\n\ndifferent from allowing a jury to return a guilty verdict when they\n\ndisagree even as to which crime or crimes were committed.                  The\n\nSupreme Court emphasized just this kind of danger in Richardson,\n\nwarning that the lack of a unanimity instruction could cover up\n\n\"wide disagreement among the jurors about just what the defendant\n\ndid, or did not, do.\"     Richardson, 526 U.S. at 819; see also Beros,\n\n833 F.2d at 460 (observing that a general unanimity instruction is\n\nlikely to be inadequate \"where the complexity of the case, or other\n\nfactors, creates the potential that the jury will be confused.\").\n\n              Secondly, in criminal cases, the government is still\n\nostensibly     required   to   prove    the     defendant's   guilt   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt.      See United States v. Ayewoh, 627 F.3d 914, 930\n\n(1st   Cir.    2010)   (Thompson,   J.,       dissenting).    In   aggregating\n\nmultiple instances of the same crime, the prosecution may bundle\n\ntogether alleged offenses that are strongly supported by the\n\nevidence with ones that are only moderately, or even weakly,\n\nsupported by the evidence.             If a jury does not specifically\n\nindicate that it has assented to each alleged offense, then by\n\nassenting to the bundle it has done no more than indicate its\n\nagreement with the proposition that the defendant is guilty of\n\nsome, though perhaps not all, of the charged conduct.              (And it may\n\n\n                                       -58-\n\fnot have even indicated that much, if the jurors did not agree\n\nwhich offense was committed -- which, again, we simply do not know\n\nwithout      an    specific   jury    instruction).       The   consequences    of\n\nconviction on that count may potentially lead to punishment over\n\nand above what the government's proof actually sustains.                 This is\n\na   danger    we    have   stressed    before,   albeit    in   the   context   of\n\nunanimity as to a crime's elements rather than duplicity per se.\n\nSee Lee, 317 F.3d at 36 (noting that \"the unanimity requirement\n\n. . . helps to ensure that no defendant will be convicted unless\n\nthe government has carried its burden of proving guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt,\" and that \"leaving jurors free to convict despite\n\ndisagreements about critical facts will imperil the integrity of\n\nthe reasonable doubt standard.\").\n\n              For these reasons, we hold that charges 2, 7, 8, 9, 11,\n\n29 and 30 were duplicitous, and that the failure to provide a\n\nspecific unanimity instruction was error.\n\n              C.    If there was error, was it plain?\n\n              Nevertheless, despite our concern about the form of the\n\nindictment in this case, we cannot lose sight of the fact that\n\nthese issues were not raised below and so are before us on plain\n\nerror review.        As we have noted on an earlier occasion, the hurdle\n\nof plain error \"nowhere looms larger than in the context of alleged\n\ninstructional errors.\"         United States v. Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d\n\n242, 246 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                        -59-\n\f               Although we have concluded that the failure to provide a\n\nspecific       unanimity    instruction      was     error    and    violated      the\n\nappellants' right to a unanimous jury verdict, this alone is not\n\nsufficient to satisfy the rigors of plain error review. To prevail\n\nunder plain error requires showing, among other things, that any\n\nerror of law was plain -- that is, that it was \"obvious and clear\n\nunder current law.\"         Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n               We cannot say that the error here met that standard.                 We\n\nnote that this court has previously rejected a claim substantially\n\nsimilar to that brought by the appellants, albeit with fairly\n\nminimal analysis.        See Pagán-Santini, 451 F.3d at 267.               Moreover,\n\nas we noted in Pagán-Santini, \"the law is less clear than it might\n\nbe   as   to    when    juror   unanimity      is    required   in   the    face    of\n\nalternative paths to a verdict.\"             Id.; see also United States v.\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir. 2002) (declining to find plain\n\nerror     in    trial   court's    failure      to    give    specific     unanimity\n\ninstruction with respect to charge of conspiracy to murder thirteen\n\nindividuals on grounds of the \"unsettled state of the law.\")                        It\n\nappears not to have gotten any clearer since then.\n\n               In light of the presence of some, even if not exactly\n\noverwhelming, countervailing authority, and because of the lack of\n\ndoctrinal clarity in this area -- the relevant unit of prosecution\n\nunder     §    666(a)(1)(A),      the   crucial       issue     underpinning       the\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\fappellants' claim, appears not to have been hitherto addressed by\n\nthis circuit -- we cannot say with confidence that any error here\n\nwas plain.\n\n              We emphasize, however, that because we hold that the\n\nindictment was impermissibly duplicitous, plain error review may\n\nprove   to     be   cold   comfort    for    similarly   defective     charging\n\ninstruments going forward.\n\n        VI.    Should Newell have been sentenced under § 450d?\n\n              Newell claims that the district court erred in sentencing\n\nhim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 666 and 669 rather than 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 450d, despite the fact that he was charged with, and convicted\n\nof, violating only the former statutes.             Section 666 criminalizes\n\nthe intentional misapplication of funds by an official of an\n\norganization receiving over $10,000 per year in federal funds, and\n\ncarries a      maximum     sentence   of    ten   years; §   669   criminalizes\n\nintentional misapplication of the assets of \"health care benefit\n\nprogram,\" again setting a statutory cap of ten years imprisonment.\n\nBy contrast, § 450d imposes a maximum sentence of two years for\n\ntribal officers who are convicted of misapplying funds received\n\nunder the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.\n\nSection 450d is, Newell insists, specifically directed to Indian\n\nofficials unlike the general purpose §§ 666 and 669 statutes.\n\nNewell argues that the rule of lenity, as well as the principle of\n\nstatutory construction favoring specific statutes over general\n\n\n                                      -61-\n\fstatutes,    require   that   he    be    sentenced    under     §   450d,\n\nnotwithstanding that one is usually sentenced under the statute\n\nthat one is accused of violating.\n\n            \"[Q]uestions of statutory interpretation that bear on\n\nsentencing\" engender de novo review.         United States      v. Vidal-\n\nReyes, 562 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            In support of his position, Newell cites the dissenting\n\nopinion in United States v. Largo, 775 F.2d 1099 (10th Cir. 1985)\n\n(McKay, J.,    dissenting).   In    Largo,   the   majority    upheld   the\n\ndefendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 641 for misapplying federal\n\nfunds, rejecting the argument that the defendant should have been\n\nsentenced under § 450d.       Id. at 1102.         The dissenting judge\n\ndisagreed, explaining that, because § 450d specifically applied to\n\ntribal officers and carried a lighter maximum sentence, remand for\n\nresentencing under 25 U.S.C. § 450d was required.        Id.\n\n            Newell's argument is not persuasive.      The statute under\n\nwhich Newell was charged explicitly applies to tribal officers,\n\nundermining Newell's contention that Congress intended prosecution\n\nof tribal officers to be governed exclusively by 25 U.S.C. § 450d.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1) (referring specifically to \"agent[s] of\n\n. . . Indian tribal government.\").        Moreover, Newell's proposed\n\napplication of the rule of lenity is questionable.            The rule of\n\nlenity, which favors narrow construction of ambiguous criminal\n\nstatutes, is of little import in choosing between the application\n\n\n                                   -62-\n\fof   overlapping        criminal    statutes.      In   any    case,    absent   a\n\ndiscriminatory motive on the part of prosecutors, \"what charge to\n\nfile   .   .     .    generally    rests     entirely   in    the   prosecutor's\n\ndiscretion.\"         United States v. Bucci, 582 F.3d 108, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (internal citations and alterations omitted).                 Consequently,\n\nwe discern no error and reject Newell's request for resentencing\n\nunder 25 U.S.C. § 450d.\n\n               VII.     Calculation of the restitution order\n\n            Parisi objects to the restitution order of approximately\n\n$1.6 million that was entered against him.              He contends that the\n\nrestitution order should be remanded to the district court to\n\ncorrect a      multitude     of    alleged   errors.    We    address   Parisi's\n\ncontentions one by one.             As is well-established, \"[w]e review\n\nrestitution orders for abuse of discretion and the subsidiary\n\nfindings of fact for clear error.            If the appellant's challenge is\n\nbased on a legal conclusion, we review that conclusion de novo.\n\nWhere the defendant has failed to object below . . . we review only\n\nfor plain error.\"         United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68,\n\n83-84 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).\n\n            A.       Who were the victims?\n\n            Parisi argues that \"to the extent there were any victims,\n\nthey were the [tribal] programs which did not have use of the\n\nfunds.\"    The federal agencies to whom Parisi is required to make\n\nrestitution are not \"victims\" of his conduct, he claims, because\n\n\n                                       -63-\n\feven if \"the federal government's funds were not utilized as\n\nintended, the federal government turned over the right to possess\n\nthose funds when it transferred the funds to\" the Tribe.\n\n           The restitution order is governed by the Mandatory Victim\n\nRestitution Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3663.           As it happens, the\n\nstatute includes a definition of \"victim\": \"a person directly and\n\nproximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for\n\nwhich restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an\n\noffense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or\n\npattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the\n\ndefendant's   criminal   conduct    in    the   course    of   the   scheme,\n\nconspiracy, or pattern.\"   18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).\n\n           We have noted, as Parisi concedes, that governmental\n\nentities may, \"without dispute,\" be considered victims under the\n\nMVRA.   United States v. Janosko, No. 10-1046, 2011 WL 1366436, at\n\n*1 (1st Cir. Apr. 12, 2011).   What, then, is the basis of Parisi's\n\nclaim that the agencies were not victims of his conduct?                The\n\nclosest he comes to pressing the point is his assertion, noted\n\nabove, that the agencies lost any right to possess the relevant\n\nfunds once they were granted to the Tribe.          But this contention\n\nmisses the point entirely. If the federal agencies were harmed, it\n\nwas not by losing possession of the funds -- these were, after all,\n\ngrants -- but rather by not having the funds go to the designated\n\n\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\fprograms.25    For Parisi to have so much as a shadow of a claim that\n\nthe federal agencies were not his victims, he would have to show\n\nwhy that kind of frustrated expectation is not a cognizable harm\n\nunder the MVRA.26     But he nowhere makes any such allegation.                  We\n\ntherefore consider the claim waived, and do not address it.\n\n             Parisi   spends   a    good      deal   of    his    discussion     of\n\nrestitution    claiming   that     a    restitution       order   would   work   a\n\n\"fundamental unfairness.\"          Parisi claims that misuse of federal\n\ngrant money was standard practice at the Tribe long before he\n\narrived on the scene, and that the tribal council was well aware of\n\nthis fact.    Parisi claims that the tribal council acknowledged, in\n\na May 2004 meeting, both that they were seriously overspending\n\ntheir budget and that federal SAMHSA grant money was being siphoned\n\n\n\n25\n    The legislative history of § 666 makes this point clear, as\n§ 666 was designed to cover the situation in which \"even though\ntitle to the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly\nretains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such program\nfunds.\" Cicco, 938 F.2d at 445 (quoting S. Rep. No. 225, at 369\n(1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510).\n26\n   This is consistent with United States v. Cornier-Ortiz, 361 F.3d\n29, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2004), in which we vacated a restitution order\nrequiring   the   defendant,   who   had   been   convicted   under\n§ 666(a)(1)(A), to compensate HUD for intentionally misapplied\nfunds.    There, we emphasized that even though the defendant had\nintentionally misapplied the funds, the work that the funds were\nmeant to pay for had actually been completed, a fact pointed out by\nthe government's own witness. Id. at 42. In light of the lack of\nevidence as to any actual loss, ordering restitution under these\ncircumstances would, we found, \"be an unfair windfall to HUD.\" Id.\nIn this case, however, although the misapplied funds were arguably\nused for the benefit of the Tribe, they were used in contravention\nof their specified purposes.\n\n                                       -65-\n\foff to pay their own salaries.     In short, Parisi's claim is that\n\nthe tribal council was entirely aware of and complicit in Newell's\n\nfinancial shenanigans, and that he should not be made to compensate\n\nthe Tribe for the financial consequences of \"decisions of the\n\ntribal political leadership, including the governor and tribal\n\ncouncil members,\" particularly when he, as a tribal outsider, had\n\nno say in making these decisions.\n\n           This is an argument about whether or not what he did\n\nought to be considered a crime, or perhaps whether it is fair to\n\npunish him while not punishing the other allegedly complicit\n\nparties.   It does not appear to be an argument about whether there\n\nwas error in calculating the restitution order.      Parisi had an\n\nopportunity to present this argument to a jury of his peers.     We\n\nwill not reopen the matter now.\n\n           B.   How harmful was it?\n\n           Parisi next challenges the inclusion of specific amounts\n\nin the restitution order.      Parisi disputes the following five\n\namounts: (1) $129,044 relating to the SAMHSA funds at issue in\n\ncounts three and five; (2) $33,000 spent on a Racino referendum\n\neffort, as well as other transfers from the health center's budget\n\nover which he had no control; (3) $15,900 of housing authority\n\nfunds; and (4) a $30,000 DOJ COPS grant.27\n\n\n27\n   In his opening brief, Parisi contested the inclusion of $229,000\nfrom count eleven, claiming that he had been acquitted on that\ncount.    The government pointed out that Parisi was in fact\n\n                                 -66-\n\f              Before we address these contentions, however, we must\n\nfirst      determine     whether   these    claims     were   preserved.         The\n\ngovernment claims that Parisi did not properly object to some, and\n\npossibly     any,   of    the   specified    amounts    at    sentencing.         The\n\ngovernment claims that Parisi only objected at sentencing to (3),\n\nthe Racino expenditures, and that it was raised only with respect\n\nto   the    guidelines     calculation      rather   than     the    size   of    the\n\nrestitution order itself. Paragraphs 71-72 of the PSR detailed the\n\nuse of health center funds to pay for the Racino effort.                       Parisi\n\nobjected to paragraph 71 on the ground that he had no authority to\n\ninitiate or stop the use of the $33,000 for the Racino effort, and\n\nhe   repeated    this     contention at     the   sentencing        hearing.      The\n\ngovernment's position appears to be that although Parisi objected\n\nto the inclusion of the Racino funds, he did not object to the\n\n\"amount\" imposed.\n\n              We do not know what to make of this contention. Parisi's\n\nclaim was that the Racino funds should not have been included at\n\nall, from which it follows that in his view the correct amount was\n\nzero. Moreover, the government's contention that \"[t]he sentencing\n\ntranscript reveals only one reference to any of the four\" disputed\n\namounts is belied by the record.            Parisi's objections to the PSR's\n\ninclusion of the $129,044 in SAMHSA funds can be found on pages 8-\n\n\nconvicted on count eleven. Parisi conceded the point in his reply\nbrief, but then substituted a challenge to the $30,000 COPS grant\ninstead.\n\n                                      -67-\n\f10 of the sentencing transcript.      His objections to the DOJ COPS\n\ngrant can be found on pages 15-16.        The discussion of Parisi's\n\ninvolvement with transfers from the Housing Authority, although\n\nmore elliptical, can be found on page 8.        The objections were\n\npreserved.\n\n          1.   $129,044 of SAMHSA funds\n\n          Parisi first contests the inclusion of the $129,044\n\nderiving from the misapplication of SAMHSA funds used to pay ghost\n\nemployee salaries in the early part of 2004.    Parisi argues that he\n\nwas not the cause of this loss under the standard announced in\n\nUnited States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 589 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          In Vaknin, we held that a \"modified but for standard of\n\ncausation is appropriate for restitution under the [Victim and\n\nWitness Protection Act],\" meaning that \"the government must show\n\nnot only that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the\n\nconduct underlying the offense of conviction, but also that the\n\ncausal nexus between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated\n\n(either factually or temporally).\"     Id. at 589-90.   We cautioned\n\nthat \"what constitutes sufficient causation can only be determined\n\ncase by case, in a fact-specific probe.\"     Id.28\n\n\n28\n   Vaknin interpreted the predecessor to the MVRA, the Victim and\nWitness Protection Act (\"VWPA\"). However, we have noted that \"the\ncausation language of the MVRA is the same as that in the VWPA,\nmaking it appropriate for us to turn to Vaknin for guidance\" in\ninterpreting the MVRA. United States v. Cutter, 313 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 2002). There is a further wrinkle, however, insofar as the\nVWPA was amended after Vaknin to clarify that restitution may be\n\n                               -68-\n\f          Parisi was acquitted of count three, which alleged the\n\nactual misapplication, but was convicted of count five, which\n\nalleged filing false statements with HHS relating to the misuse of\n\nthe SAMHSA funds.29   Although the timing is not entirely clear, it\n\nappears that the funds were disbursed no later than May 2004, i.e.,\n\nbefore the falsified 269 forms were filed with HHS.        The form\n\ntherefore could not have been a \"but for\" cause in causing HHS to\n\ndisburse the funds.    See id. at 589 (\"Restitution should not be\n\nordered in respect to a loss which would have occurred regardless\n\nof the defendant's conduct.\").    This sum therefore should not have\n\nbeen included under Vaknin.30\n\n\n\n\nordered for harms caused not just by a defendant personally, but\nalso by his or her co-conspirators as well, at least so long as\nthose harms were \"reasonably foreseeable.\" See United States v.\nCollins, 209 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1999).       Similar language is\ncontained in the MVRA. See 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). Nevertheless,\neven if the eligible sources of harm are more numerous now than\nthey were under Vaknin, this is a distinct issue from what it takes\nto count as having caused the harm, on which Vaknin remains\nauthoritative.\n29\n   As noted above, we vacate Parisi's conviction on this count on\ngrounds of insufficient evidence that he knew the forms to be\nfalse.\n30\n   To be clear, we do not base our conclusion here on our holding\nthat the evidence was insufficient to convict Parisi for knowingly\nmaking false statements to HHS. See United States v. Watts, 519\nU.S. 148, 156 (1997) (noting, in a pre-Booker Guidelines case, that\n\"application of the preponderance standard at sentencing generally\nsatisfies due process.\") Our conclusion is based on First Circuit\nprecedent as to which harms are compensable under the MVRA.\n\n                                 -69-\n\f          2.   $33,000 Racino effort and Health Center transfers\n\n          Parisi also contests the inclusion of $33,000 used by the\n\ntribal government to pay for expenses stemming from an effort to\n\nget a referendum question on the November 2007 ballot asking for\n\nvoter approval of a Racino.   Less specifically, he challenges the\n\ninclusion of any of the \"transfers from the Health Center account\n\nused to make PTIT's payroll.\"   Parisi does not provide a specific\n\ndollar amount, but the challenge appears to account for over $1\n\nmillion of the $1.6 million restitution order.\n\n           In both cases, the gist of Parisi's argument is that he\n\nwas not the \"cause\" of these losses, as the decision to make those\n\nillicit transfers was made by Newell and other members of the\n\nTribe's political leadership.     Newell, in many cases with the\n\ntribal council's express consent, made the decision to transfer\n\nfunds from federal grants to pay for, among other things, the\n\ncouncil members' own salaries. Similarly, the $33,000 check to the\n\nJoint Tribal Council to cover the cost of the Racino referendum\n\neffort was authorized by Newell and approved by three separate\n\ncouncil members.   It was delivered to the Joint Tribal Council by\n\nJoe Socobasin, the Tribe's lieutenant governor at the time.        It\n\ndoes not appear that Parisi had any say in deciding whether to\n\nsupport the Racino effort in the first place, or where the funds to\n\ndo so would come from.   The entirety of Parisi's involvement with\n\nthis check appears to be that Newell ordered him to have it drawn\n\n\n                                -70-\n\fup, an order that he in turn conveyed to Frances Neptune, the\n\nTribe's IHS bookkeeper.     The Tribe's habit of playing fast and\n\nloose with federal grant money, Parisi argues, was present \"before\n\n[Parisi] arrived . . . and continued after he left.\" Therefore, he\n\ncontends, he was not a cause of the losses under Vaknin.\n\n          The uncontroverted evidence in the record does indeed\n\nsuggest that Parisi may have been set up by Newell to take the fall\n\nfor the Tribe's corrupt financial practices.       Unfortunately for\n\nParisi, however, it is well established that defendants can be\n\nrequired to pay restitution for the reasonably foreseeable offenses\n\nof their co-conspirators.    Collins, 209 F.3d at 4.     As we noted\n\nabove, even if Parisi's role was as limited as he suggests --\n\ncarrying out or transmitting Newell's orders -- that is sufficient\n\nto support his conviction for conspiring with Newell to misapply\n\nfederal funds.   Since at some point the financial impropriety must\n\nhave been glaringly obvious, and since there is no question that\n\nParisi's co-conspirator, Newell, caused the transfers, Parisi's\n\nchallenge to the inclusion of these amounts must be denied.\n\n          Parisi's reliance on United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190,\n\n1200-01 (1st Cir. 1994), is misplaced.     It is true that we held in\n\nNeal that a person who aided others in committing a bank robbery,\n\nbut did not actually participate in the robbery itself, could not\n\nbe required on that basis alone to make restitution for the full\n\namount of the loss suffered by the bank.    However, as we made clear\n\n\n                                -71-\n\fin Neal, Congress has insisted on a different standard when a\n\ndefendant has been convicted of a federal crime that \"require[s]\n\nproof of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal conduct.\"\n\nId. at 1200; see also Collins, 209 F.3d at 3.31                 Unlike the\n\ndefendant in Neal, Parisi was most definitely convicted of such a\n\ncrime.    Therefore, the reckoning of the losses that may be laid at\n\nhis doorstep is substantially broader than it otherwise would have\n\nbeen.\n\n            3.    $15,900 Indian Township Housing Authority\n\n            Parisi claims that the district court erred in including\n\n$15,900   based    on   transfers   from   the   Indian   Township   Housing\n\nAuthority.   The district court, Parisi argues, explicitly conceded\n\nthat Parisi was not involved in these transfers but went ahead and\n\nincluded them in the restitution order anyway.            Our review is for\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n            Parisi claims that the district court found that Parisi\n\n\"had nothing to do\" with the transfers from the Housing Authority.\n\nIt is not clear from the record whether or not the district court\n\nmade such a finding.      The portion of the sentencing transcript on\n\nwhich Parisi relies shows that the parties were disputing another\n\nmatter -- Parisi's contention that the PSR should reflect that he\n\n\n\n31\n   The operative statutory language of the VWPA, at issue in Neal\nand Collins, is identical to that of the MVRA, applicable here.\nCompare Neal, 36 F.3d at 1200 (discussing VWPA), and Collins, 209\nF.3d at 2-3 (same), with 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2) (MVRA).\n\n                                    -72-\n\fnever transferred money to accounts outside the tribal government's\n\ncontrol.    The court overruled Parisi's objection, and stated that\n\nit \"takes into account the parenthetical added to paragraph 26, and\n\nwith that addition believes the paragraph to be accurate.\"32\n\nHowever, while the referenced parenthetical does include Parisi's\n\ninsistence that he had nothing to do with the Housing Authority\n\ntransfers, no actual discussion of that claim is reflected in the\n\nsentencing transcript, as the discussion instead was focused on the\n\nissue of his responsibility for transferring money to non-tribal\n\naccounts.\n\n            Also bearing on our analysis here is the fact that many\n\nof these transfers from the Housing Authority's funds appear to\n\nhave been undertaken exclusively by Newell for his own purposes --\n\ne.g., a \"donation\" for the marriage of \"Mr. and Mrs. Tammy Newell,\"\n\nunspecified   \"loans\"   in   small    amounts,   compensation   to   Newell\n\nhimself for \"mileage,\" and medical assistance to Tribe members\n\nwhose relationship to Newell and/or Parisi is unexplained.           In the\n\nabsence of an explicit ruling by the district court, we are left\n\nuncertain whether the district court viewed these transfers as not\n\nwithin the scope of the (tacit) agreement between Newell and\n\n\n\n32\n     The parenthetical reads, \"Parisi advised that he never\ntransferred any money from a federally-funded account to an account\noutside the control of the [Tribe]. He only transferred federal\nfunds between [Tribe]-controlled accounts, and always at the\nGovernor's direction.    Parisi had nothing to do with Housing\nAuthority transfers.\"\n\n                                     -73-\n\fParisi, but        mistakenly    did    not    deduct   them   from    the   overall\n\nrestitution order, or if the court concluded that they were,\n\nappearances notwithstanding, indeed part of the overall conspiracy.\n\nParticularly in light of the extensive number of transactions\n\ninvolved,     and     the   factual      complexity       of    the    case,   both\n\npossibilities seem equally plausible.              Because of the ambiguity in\n\nthe record, we remand the restitution order to the district court\n\nto clarify its disposition of the $15,900 Indian Township Housing\n\nAuthority transfers.\n\n             4.    $30,000 DOJ COPS grant\n\n             Parisi raises a similar contention in his reply brief as\n\nto the inclusion of $30,000 based on the misapplication of a DOJ\n\nCOPS grant.       The district court stated that \"[b]oth sides seem to\n\nagree that the PSR is inaccurate to the extent it states that\n\nMr. Parisi requested the transfer of those funds.                     The statement\n\nwill   not    be    considered     by    the    court.\"        Nevertheless,    the\n\nrestitution order included this amount.                 Parisi's suggestion is\n\nthat this was an oversight.              The government's somewhat gnostic\n\ncounter-suggestion is that the district court ruled only that it\n\n\"would not consider at sentencing\" the PSR's claim that Parisi had\n\nrequested the transfer, but that it nevertheless intended to\n\ninclude the $30,000 in the restitution order.\n\n             Once again, it is simply unclear on the record what the\n\ndistrict court intended.          It is possible that the district court\n\n\n                                        -74-\n\fconcluded that the $30,000 DOJ COPS transfer was to be excluded\n\nfrom consideration.       But we are not in a position to assert as much\n\nwith any confidence.\n\n           However, Parisi only raised this issue in his reply\n\nbrief.   As we have noted, \"issues raised for the first time in an\n\nappellant's reply brief are generally deemed waived.\"                 United\n\nStates v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998).            Parisi attempts\n\nto circumvent this rule by characterizing the DOJ COPS grant issue\n\nas merely another instance of the restitution order including\n\n\"acquitted conduct.\"       But Parisi was not in fact acquitted of this\n\nconduct.   He was convicted of count 30, which, among other things,\n\nalleged misapplication of the COPS grant.           The claim is therefore\n\nprocedurally defaulted.\n\n           C.   Repayment of misapplied funds\n\n           Parisi next argues that the district court failed to\n\nconsider \"amounts that were misapplied but subsequently repaid.\"\n\nAs before, our review is for abuse of discretion.\n\n           Parisi     argues   that    some   of   the    moneys   that   were\n\ntransferred from the federal grants into the Tribe's general\n\naccounts were subsequently repaid by the Tribe.            Therefore, it was\n\nerror to   base     the   restitution order    on   the    initial   quantity\n\ntransferred rather than the amount net repayments.             Parisi argues\n\nthat the restitution order \"grossly exaggerates\" the actual losses,\n\nand notes that restitution must be gauged by \"actual loss\" to the\n\n\n                                      -75-\n\fvictim, United States v. Galloway, 509 F.3d 1246, 1253 (10th Cir.\n\n2007), and that the burden is on the government to establish the\n\namount of the loss.    18 U.S.C. § 3664(e).\n\n          Unfortunately, Parisi fails to provide any details about\n\nthe alleged repayments.    He fails to specify to whom the payments\n\nwere made, who they were made by, when they were made, or how much\n\nwas repaid.    At sentencing, the district court heard from the\n\nparties as to whether those Tribe members whose retirement accounts\n\nhad been affected by the misuse of earmarked money had been\n\ncompensated, and that the government conceded that \"five or six\"\n\nsuch individuals had in fact been repaid.            Neither party put\n\nforward a specific dollar amount that had been repaid.33\n\n          The MVRA stipulates that \"[a]ny dispute as to the proper\n\namount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\"     18 U.S.C. § 3664(e).     As it does\n\nnot appear that Parisi disputed the inclusion of allegedly repaid\n\namounts in the PSR or at sentencing, we do not discern any abuse of\n\ndiscretion on this score.\n\n          D.   The Excessive Fines clause\n\n          Finally,    Parisi   claims   that   the   imposition   of   the\n\napproximately $1.6 million restitution order is a violation of the\n\n\n\n33\n    Count 30 of the indictment charged Newell and Parisi of\nmisapplying $45,824 from the Tribe's retirement fund; the judgment\nentered against Parisi ordered restitution in the amount of\n$43,367.50.\n\n                                 -76-\n\fExcessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because (a) the\n\nfunds were spent on tribal government expenses, (b) Parisi did not\n\npersonally benefit from the funds in question, (c) he does not have\n\nthe resources to repay such an amount, and (d) the size of the\n\norder will \"prevent him from achieving any reasonable livelihood.\"\n\n            We have never held that the Excessive Fines Clause of the\n\nEighth Amendment applies to restitution.       The circuits that have\n\nconsidered challenges to restitution orders under the Excessive\n\nFines clause have held that where the restitution order reflects\n\nthe amount of the victim's loss no constitutional violation has\n\noccurred.    See United States v. Lessner, 498 F.3d 185, 205-06 (3d\n\nCir. 2007); United States v. Newsome, 322 F.3d 328, 342 (4th Cir.\n\n2003); United States v. Dubose, 146 F.3d 1141, 1145 (9th Cir. 1998)\n\n(noting that \"[w]here the amount of restitution is geared directly\n\nto the amount of the victim's loss caused by the defendant's\n\nillegal activity, proportionality is already built in.\").      This is\n\nnot surprising, as restitution is inherently proportional, insofar\n\nas the point of restitution is to restore the victim to the status\n\nquo ante. Restitution is distinct in this regard from forfeiture,\n\nas Parisi concedes.\n\n            In this case, the amount of restitution ordered was the\n\nsum of the moneys that Parisi was found to have misapplied or for\n\nwhich he submitted false claims.        Even assuming that restitution\n\norders may be challenged under the Excessive Fines clause, the\n\n\n                                 -77-\n\frestitution ordered in this case would not therefore violate\n\nParisi's rights.\n\n                         VIII.    Conclusion\n\n          For   the   reasons    given   above,   we   vacate   Parisi's\n\nconviction on count five, reduce the restitution order entered\n\nagainst him by $129,044, remand for further clarification of\n\nwhether the Indian Township Housing Authority transfers were meant\n\nto be included in the restitution order, and otherwise affirm.\n\n          Vacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -78-\n\f",

Defendants Robert Newell, the former governor of the Tribe, and James Parisi, Jr., the Tribe's former finance director, were convicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 371, as well as violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 287, 666 and 669, involving the misuse of federal grant and tribal monies. On appeal, Newell and Parisi raise a host of issues related to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> federal court's jurisdiction over \"internal tribal matters,\" the sufficiency of the evidence, the lower court's jury instructions, sentencing, and the restitution order entered against them. For the reasons explained below, we vacate Parisi's conviction on count five and remand for clarification of certain issues related to the restitution order, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The following facts are drawn from the parties' filings supplemented by the record as necessary, and are presented in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Poulin,</i> 631 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir.2011).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>The Passamaquoddy Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe located in northern Maine.<sup>[1]</sup> The Tribe is relatively small, with fewer than seven hundred residents. It relies in large part on federal grant and contract money for its financial survival. During the period of time at issueroughly, September 2002 to September 2006, i.e., Newell's tenure as tribal governorthe Tribe received between five and eight million dollars annually in federal grants and contracts.</p>\n<p>The Tribe's political leadership consists of a governor and tribal council. In addition, the Tribe shares a 12-member joint tribal council with its sister reservation in Princeton, Maine. Council members receive no official salary, but many are employed by the tribal government in other capacities, are reimbursed for travel expenses, and receive \"honoraria\" that approximate a salaried employee's vacation pay. The tribal government provides administrative services to the tribal programs, including bookkeeping and accounting services.</p>\n<p>The Tribe receives funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") and the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") through the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. These grants are used to fund myriad tribal services, including the police, fire, child welfare and wildlife and parks departments, the housing authority, the Tribe's courts and schools, and the Indian health center. The Tribe additionally receives funding from HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (\"SAMHSA\") for an HIV awareness and substance abuse prevention program. The Tribe received a Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") COPS program grant for police equipment and training, as well as funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") for its environmental department and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") for its housing authority. Each of the federal contracts and grants included terms and conditions specifying how they were to be used. Generally, the contracts required the Tribe to use the funds to pay for allowable direct costs of the identified programs, as well as specified amounts of the indirect costs incurred by the tribal government for administrative services. The awarded funds generally could not be diverted for non-contract or grant purposes without a contract amendment or agency approval.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> In addition to the federal grants and contracts, the Tribe had income from its ownership interests \"in three companies [Dragon Cement, Creative Apparel and Northeast Blueberry Company] that it purchased with money it received under the Indian Claims Settlement Act.\" This income was on the order of \"several million dollars . . . annually.\"</p>\n<p>Newell served as the Tribe's governor from 1986 to 1993, and again from 2002 to 2006. Newell served as his own finance director for the first year of his most recent term, but in the fall of 2003 he hired Parisi to fill the position. Parisi had worked as a banker but did not have experience with federal contracts. In addition to Parisi, the finance department was composed of several bookkeepers and a federal grant compliance officer, Linda Lewey. Despite his official job title, Parisi appeared to have had little actual authority, and would refer most questions to Newell. There is also evidence that Parisi may have been somewhat ostracized by at least some of his co-workers as he was not a member of the Tribe.</p>\n<p>During his tenure as governor, Newell exercised extensive control over tribal governance in general, and the Tribe's finances in particular. Newell would transfer funds between the various accounts to pay for unauthorized expenses, including salaries for individuals who did not actually work for the programs that were funding them. Newell also caused the Tribe's various programs to \"loan\" hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to the Tribe which he then disbursed in the form of \"general assistance\" to Tribe members, including friends, family and political supporters.<sup>[3]</sup> These loans were by and large never repaid.</p>\n<p>We now sketch briefly the details of the transactions relevant to the current appeals, leaving aside those uncontested on appeal. Our discussion is somewhat condensed in light of the large multitude of transactions, which were spread over a number of years, involved a large cast of supporting characters, several distinct funding sources, and the arcana of accounting practices for federal grants and contracts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The financial mismanagement</h2>\n<p>In 2003, the Tribe received a three-year, $350,000-per-year grant from SAMHSA to fund its HIV and substance abuse program, known as the Wonahkik program. The Wonahkik program ramped up slowly. Roger Paul, the Wonahkik program coordinator, testified at trial that the program did not \"get a staff to start getting things actually done\" until January of 2004. As of October of 2003, the program had only spent $86,354 of the $350,000 grant. In September, Newell and Elizabeth Neptune, the director of the health center, wrote to SAMHSA requesting permission to carry over the remainder into the next fiscal year. In October, Faye Socobasin, the Tribe's SAMHSA bookkeeper, filed a \"269\" form with SAMHSA showing that the Tribe had $236,645 in unspent grant funds. Lewey, the Tribe's federal grant compliance officer, signed off on the form. Parisi was hired at around this time.</p>\n<p>In February 2004, before SAMHSA had responded to the request, Newell directed that the unspent funds be used to reimburse the Tribe for salaries it had paid to three tribal councilors despite the fact that they did not actually work for the Wonahkik <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> program.<sup>[4]</sup> Newell insisted that the grant money \"had to be spent,\" and that if the Wonahkik program wasn't going to spend it, \"the Tribe would.\" Socobasin, at Lewey's instruction, then prepared a journal entry form for the Tribe's records indicating that the three individuals had been paid out of the SAMHSA grant on or before September 30, 2003, the last day of the fiscal year. Parisi signed the journal entry.</p>\n<p>When SAMHSA notified the Tribe in April 2004 that it would not permit the unused funds to be rolled over, Newell wrote back, stating, among other things, that the Tribe's initial 269 report had been in error, and that the Tribe had spent an additional $129,044 of the SAMHSA grant in salary expenditures in FY 2003. Subsequently, Socobasin prepared a revised 269 form reflecting the additional $129,044 expenditures, again dated to appear as if they had occurred in September of 2003. Socobasin refused to backdate the charges unless either Parisi or Newell approved it. Parisi, rather than Lewey, subsequently signed the revised 269 form. Newell told Socobasin that Parisi should sign the revised 269 \"so we can blame it all on him.\" In June 2004, SAMHSA relented, and approved the Tribe's request to roll over the unused grant funds.</p>\n<p>It was during this time that the tribal council learned that the Tribe's budget had been overspent to the tune of $1.6 million. At a contentious council meeting, Newell admitted he had been using SAMHSA funds to pay council members, but insisted he had the authority to do so. The council voted to strip Newell of administrative authority, but backtracked when it came out that this meant they would no longer receive general assistance payments. The council insisted that subsequent checks, with the exception of payroll and housing authority checks, be signed by two council members. Undeterred and largely unimpeded, Newell was able to secure the cooperation of sympathetic council members or, in other cases, circumvent the council entirely by transferring funds through online or wire transfers.</p>\n<p>The Tribe continued to pay the salaries of council members and other non-health center \"ghost\" employees with the health center's funds throughout FY 2004. Wonahkik was not the only program that saw its budget raided. Funds were \"loaned\" to the tribal government from the Indian Health Services (\"IHS\") contract, state Medicaid payments, and EPA and BIA grants. Several of the tribal health services administrators objected, but Newell and Parisi continued to authorize the payments. Parisi promised that the non-employees would be taken off the health center's payroll, and that the funds would be restored. When pressed by Paul about the missing funds, Parisi replied that it was \"normal\" for Tribes to use incoming grant money to pay pressing non-grant related bills, and to replenish the funds later with other income, an explanation that Paul conceded he found \"reasonable.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the earlier troubles, SAMHSA approved funding for the Wonahkik grant for a second year. This time around, however, SAMHSA required that the Tribe submit itemized claims for approved expenses. Thus, when Parisi requested $81,779 in reimbursement from SAMHSA in February of 2005, the claim was denied because it was not correctly itemized. Parisi resubmitted correctly itemized forms to SAMHSA in March, but because the requested amount included the salaries <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> of individuals who did not work for Wonahkik, SAMHSA ultimately refused to pay for those claims.</p>\n<p>Neither Newell nor Parisi was accused of lining their own pockets. (Parisi appears to have been motivated mostly by a desire to retain his employment with the Tribe). Newell, however, did improperly redirect federal grant money to help friends and family. For instance, shortly after Newell took office in the fall of 2002, he refused to release funds that the BIA had awarded the Tribe through its Housing Improvement Program. Instead, he spent the money on his friends, family, and tribal council members and their families, including William Nicholas, the Tribe's current governor. Similarly, in June of 2004, Newell had Carol Roehrich, the Tribe's BIA bookkeeper, issue his son, Roger, a check for $1020, ostensibly to reimburse Roger for the costs of attending training in Boston. Alex Nichols, Roger's supervisor, knew that Roger did not attend training in Boston and asked Roger to return the money. Newell insisted that Roger needed help, and the funds were never repaid. On other occasions, Newell dipped into Housing Authority funds for wedding donations, unspecified small loans, travel reimbursement for his son, Eric, and \"general assistance\" for two other Tribe members.</p>\n<p>Despite his efforts to keep the political wheels well-greased, by the spring of 2005, Newell was facing increasing opposition to his leadership. Several of the health center administratorsincluding Roger Paul, the head of Wonahkik, and Elizabeth Neptune, the health center's directorparticipated in an anti-Newell protest and went to federal investigators with their complaints. Newell responded by cleaning house, firing Paul, Neptune and three other health center administrators. Bookkeepers who protested the interfund \"loans\" found themselves suspended. Newell then reassured Don Payne, the new head of the health center, that although health center funds were being used for other purposes, the funds would be restored.</p>\n<p>The misapplication of funds continued apace, and the Tribe's financial situation deteriorated further. As of the fall of 2005, the Tribe owed $866,000 to the BIA and IHS grants. The Tribe had budgeted $621,000 in \"tribal assistance\" in FY 2005, but had spent nearly three times that amount. Newell continued to try to cover the Tribe's costs by \"borrowing\" money from the incoming federal grants, and Parisi continued to offer assurances to the affected programs that the funds would be repaid. Although some of the non-employees who had been drawing salaries from the grants were finally removed at this point, some remained, and others were added on.</p>\n<p>Newell and Parisi received multiple warnings at around this time that their conduct was of questionable legality. In early 2005, the Tribe's outside auditor warned them that \"pooling\" federal funds was permissible, but that the funds should only be used for allowable purposes, a point reiterated by Lewey, the federal grant compliance officer, and Roehrich, the BIA bookkeeper.<sup>[5]</sup> Harry Schade, a former finance director for the Tribe, was brought back in June of 2005 to help Newell <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> and Parisi sort out the Tribe's increasingly desperate finances. However, Schade's repeated demands that non-approved employees be taken off the health center's payroll were ignored.</p>\n<p>Newell and Parisi were also put on notice by warnings from various federal officials. IHS officials confronted Newell and Parisi in August 2005 about delinquent audits and interfund transfers. Despite the fact that Schade and Payne had asked the IHS not to release the funds because Newell and Parisi were raiding the accounts, the IHS was satisfied with Newell and Parisi's assurances that the funds would not be misused and that they would conduct an audit. IHS then agreed to a lump sum wire transfer of $2,000,000 for FY 2006. Within a week, over $400,000 had been diverted to the tribal government at Newell's direction. Newell and Parisi directed the health center to \"loan\" the tribal government a further $200,000 over the next two months. In a by-now-familiar scene, Schade protested and was subsequently fired. IHS officials began inquiring as to why so little of the grant funds remained, but were rebuffed by Newell.</p>\n<p>One of the \"loans\" in question occurred in November of 2005. At this point in time, the Tribe, together with its sister Pleasant Point reservation, was engaged in an effort to place a referendum question on the 2007 ballot asking for approval of a combined race track and casino, otherwise known as a Racino. The Joint Tribal Council hired an outside firm to solicit the necessary signatures to ensure that the question was placed on the ballot. Newell realized that the Tribe lacked the funds to pay for its share of the expenses and so decided once again to dip into his federal slush fund, a/k/a the health center budget. Parisi transmitted Newell's request to Frances Neptune, the IHS bookkeeper, who drew up a check for $33,000. After the payment was approved by two tribal council members, it was picked up by Joseph Socobasin, the Tribe's lieutenant governor and delivered to the Joint Tribal Council. This money was never returned to the health center.</p>\n<p>As he neared the end of his term, Newell must have realized that the game was up, as the Tribe's financial situation had become increasingly precarious at the same time that federal investigators were closing in on him. In the spring of 2006, the situation had become so dire that in order to meet the Tribe's payroll obligations, Newell directed Parisi to transfer funds from the tribal employees' 401K account, and directed the account bookkeeper not to file the mandatory report with the company that managed the 401K program. Parisi also directed the payroll clerk to pay only net salaries, meaning that state and federal tax withholdings, 401K contributions, state garnishments for child support or back taxes, and rent (for those employees who lived in HUD housing) were not paid. Among the sources tapped to cover payroll was a DOJ COPS grant for the Tribe's police department. The grant's remaining $30,000 of unspent funds was pressed into service to meet the Tribe's payroll obligations. When Newell left office in September, after losing the election to William Nicholas, the Tribe only had enough money left to pay one person's salaryNewell's.</p>\n<p>When Newell stepped down as governor, \"the Tribe's employees had not been paid in two weeks, worker's compensation payments had not been made, vendors and programs were owed over $3 million, and the Tribe owed federal programs $1.7 to $1.8 million.\" In addition, the health centerregularly raided by Newellhad outstanding debts of approximately $850,000. An audit subsequently revealed that the Tribe had no cash available, owed other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> funds approximately $1.6 million, lost $2 million from its general fund, and had once again overspent its general assistance budget by approximately $1.1 million.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2008, Newell and Parisi were charged by indictment with thirty counts of misapplying federal funds, making false statements to federal agencies, submitting false claims, and misapplying retirement, police, housing authority and other program funds, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Trial</h2>\n<p>At trial, Newell argued that he believed in good faith that he had the authority to act as he did, and that his intent had been to help the Tribe's impoverished and needy residents. Parisi argued that he was an outsider who simply did as Newell instructed. The jury found Newell guilty of all counts except count 10, and found Parisi guilty of counts 1, 5, 8, 9, 11-15, 29 and 30. Both defendants moved for acquittal, and Parisi moved for a new trial. Both defendants' motions were denied by the district court.</p>\n<p>Newell's guideline range was determined to be 151 to 188 months. The court sentenced him instead to concurrent 60 month terms on counts 2, 3, 7-9, 11, 29 and 30, and concurrent 31 month terms on counts 1, 4-6 and 12-28, followed by three years of supervised release. Parisi's guidelines range was determined to be 51-63 months. The court sentenced him to a year and a day, also followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA), codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3663, the court imposed a restitution order of $1,741,876.18 on Newell and $1,602,516.13 on Parisi, payable jointly and severally.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Did the district court have jurisdiction?</h2>\n<p>Newell, joined by Parisi, first contends that counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 fall outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Essentially, the appellants argue that the Passamaquoddy Tribe has negotiated agreements with the state of Maine and the federal government granting them exclusive jurisdiction over \"internal tribal matters,\" and that the conduct charged in counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 should be understood as such.</p>\n<p>We note that the parties appear to have conflicting understandings of the nature of the claim being raised. The government appears to construe the claim as one of \"tribal sovereign immunity,\" and contends that Parisi, at least, has waived any such claim. Parisi, for his part, insists that the argument instead concerns our subject matter jurisdiction, and hence avoids the \"[o]rdinary raise-or-waive rules\" which the government seeks to enforce against him. <i>See </i><i>Caban Hernandez v. Philip Morris</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>USA, Inc.,</i> 486 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>As we have noted, an \"objection to subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable and may be raised for the first time on appeal.\" <i>F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de Puerto Rico,</i> 449 F.3d 185, 189 (1st Cir.2006). Even if the same claims were presented below as a sovereign immunity defense, this does not preclude the defendants from appealing to them, now, to challenge our jurisdiction. Our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>Miller v. Nichols,</i> 586 F.3d 53, 58-59 (1st Cir.2009) (\"The existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction . . . [is a] question[] of law, subject to <i>de novo</i> review in this court.\").</p>\n<p>Relations between the Tribe and the state and federal government are governed by an agreement that the parties arrived at after the Passamaquoddy filed suit in the 1970s, asserting claims to nearly two-thirds of Maine's land mass. The Tribe and the state of Maine eventually reached a settlement, in which the Tribe \"in many respects gained the powers of a municipality under Maine law.\" <i>Akins v. Penobscot Nation,</i> 130 F.3d 482, 484 (1st Cir.1997). The settlement granted the Tribe recognition under federal law as a tribe, as well as entitlement to a portion of the income from an $81.5 million settlement fund established by Congress. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. §§ 1723-24. In exchange, the Tribe's claims to Maine's territory were extinguished, and the Tribe agreed that \"with very limited exceptions,\" it was \"subject to the laws of Maine.\" <i>Akins,</i> 130 F.3d at 485; <i>see also </i><i>Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer,</i> 164 F.3d 706, 708 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that \"Maine was permitted to extend its jurisdiction over the Nation to a greater degree than most states exercise over other Indian Tribes\"). The agreement between the Tribe and the state of Maine was memorialized in the Act to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, 30 M.R.S.A. §§ 6201-14 (the \"Implementing Act\"). The Implementing Act was subsequently ratified by Congress in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, at 25 U.S.C. §§ 1721-35 (the \"Settlement Act\").</p>\n<p>Section 6206 of the Implementing Act states, in material part, that \"internal tribal matters, including . . . tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\" 30 M.R.S.A. § 6206. This limitation on state jurisdiction was incorporated into the federal Settlement Act by reference. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1725(f) (\"The Passamaquoddy Tribe . . . [is] hereby authorized to exercise jurisdiction, separate and distinct from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of Maine, to the extent authorized by the Maine Implementing Act, and any subsequent amendments thereto.\"). We have interpreted the Settlement Act to interpose a bar to federal jurisdiction over \"internal tribal matters.\" <i>See </i><i>Akins,</i> 130 F.3d at 485 (\"[T]he Nation in certain capacities functions as a municipality of Maine and is reachable under state and federal law in that capacity, but when it functions as a tribe as to internal tribal matters, it is not.\").</p>\n<p>The operative question is, accordingly, whether the conduct alleged in counts 1, 2, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> 29 and 30 constitute \"internal tribal matters.\" Newell's argument is that the government's attempt to enforce 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A) against him reaches \"internal tribal matters\" because \"the allocation of tribal money amongst tribal accounts only affects tribal members, not nonmembers\" and concerns only matters of \"tribal organization, tribal government, and the use or disposition of settlement fund income.\"<sup>[9]</sup> He argues that \"[f]ederal jurisdiction over these allegations would be contrary to the purpose of the Settlement Acts, which is to allow the Tribe to handle internal tribal matters, particularly internal government matters.\"</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Newell neglects to mention that Congress specifically exempted the Tribe from several federal criminal statutes in the Settlement Actbut that § 666 is not one of those exempted. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1725(c). Indeed, Congress specifically <i>included</i> Indian Tribes within the ambit of § 666(a), which explicitly applies to agents of \"Indian tribal government.\" These observations suggest that assertion of federal jurisdiction over counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 was not improper.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Although \"tribes generally retain the right to self-government, [they] are nonetheless subject to federal criminal jurisdiction of both a specified and more general nature.\" <i>United States v. Boots,</i> 80 F.3d 580, 593 (1st Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted). In <i>Boots,</i> the defendants were accused, <i>inter alia,</i> of defrauding the Passamaquoddy Reservation of the honest services of their police chief by attempting to bribe him. One of the defendants claimed that he should have been acquitted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> \"in deference to tribal sovereignty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 592. We rejected this claim, noting that the violations he was charged with \"are not specific to Native Americans, but rather are of general applicability,\" and that even if such crimes \"may involve `an independent federal interest to be protected,' . . . it is unclear that one is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 593 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Conspiring to defraud the United States and misapplying federal funds are, like the crimes defined by the wire fraud statute at issue in <i>Boots,</i> crimes of general applicability. Therefore, even were we to accept Newell's claim that there is no federal interest in how the Tribe transfers its money between its accounts, it is not clear that any \"peculiarly federal interest\" is in fact required for such a statute to apply to the Tribe. <i>Id.,</i> 80 F.3d at 593. Moreover, a less tendentious description of Newell's conduct would in any case suggest that there may well be a relevant federal interest, viz. an interest in ensuring that federal grants and contracts are spent in the way the government intends them to be spent. As the Supreme Court has held, when federal agencies spend taxpayer dollars, Congress has an interest in ensuring that this money is \"not frittered away in graft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned off.\" <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 600, 605, 124 S.Ct. 1941, 158 L.Ed.2d 891 (2004) (rejecting claim that § 666(a)(2)the anti-bribery portion of the statute at issue hererequired proof of a nexus between the federal funds received and the alleged bribe). When \"money can be drained off here because a federal grant is pouring in there . . . [i]t is certainly enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 606, 124 S.Ct. 1941. Congress presumably agreed that there was such an interest when it made § 666(a) explicitly applicable to Indian tribal governments. Moreover, despite rather mysterious invocations of tribal self-governance, Newell has not managed to explain how holding him, <i>qua</i> governor of a Tribe that received millions of dollars a year in federal financial assistance, criminally responsible for extensive misuse of federal funds would interfere with a \"right integral to self-government.\" <i>Boots,</i> 80 F.3d at 593.</p>\n<p>Finally, in <i>Akins,</i> a case about a tribe's timber harvesting policies, we emphasized five factors that were \"strong considerations\" to take into account in deciding whether a dispute about tribal practices constitutes an internal tribal matter. <i>Akins,</i> 130 F.3d at 486-87. These factors are (1) whether the practice in question \"purports to regulate only members of the tribe,\" or if \"the interests of non-members\" are \"at issue\"; (2) whether it \"regulates the very land that defines the territory of the Nation\"; (3) whether it concerns the use of a natural resource derived from the land; (4) whether it \"implicate[s] or impair[s] any interest of the state of Maine\"; and (5) whether construing the challenged practice as an internal tribal matter \"is consistent with prior legal understandings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 486-87. Applying these factors to the current case reveals the following. First, the interests of non-membersat the very least, those of the federal agencies in ensuring that the funds they award are properly spentare clearly implicated. Second, the funds at issue include state funds (count 10 alleged misuse of state Medicaid funds). Finally, as our discussion has just indicated, prior legal understandings support our finding that the challenged conduct does not constitute an internal tribal matter.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Because the conduct alleged in counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 involves mismanagement of federal grants and contracts, which are subject to regulations that the Tribe is not free to ignore, we hold that the conduct alleged in these counts do not constitute internal tribal matters. We emphasize that the case before us rests on malfeasance involving federal grant money, in which the federal interest is clear. It would be a different case if the counts attempted to apply § 666 to mismanagement of settlement fund income. We express no opinion as to whether such a prosecution would or would not implicate the internal tribal matters exception to federal jurisdiction under the Implementing and Settlement Acts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Was the evidence sufficient?</h2>\n<p>We now turn to Parisi's contentions that the evidence failed, in several key respects, to sufficiently support the jury's verdict. \"We review a sufficiency claim <i>de novo,</i> drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict to determine whether a rational jury could find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 564 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Count 1</h2>\n<p>Parisi challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction under count one, for conspiracy to misapply government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A), and to misapply the funds and assets of a health care program, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 669.<sup>[12]</sup> To prove its case, the government had to show beyond a reasonable doubt that \"(1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the defendant knew of and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy; and (3) there was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Munoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d 25, 45 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Parisi challenges his conspiracy conviction under heading (1). Parisi argues that a conspiracy consists of an agreement between two or more individuals to disregard or disobey the law, <i>United States v. Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir.1984), and that simply doing what his employer asked of him was insufficient to establish such an \"agreement.\" The question is thus whether the evidence was sufficient to allow a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Parisi and Newell came to an agreement to \"disregard or disobey\" §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669, i.e., the statutes prohibiting the misapplication of government funds generally and the funds and assets of a health care benefit program specifically.</p>\n<p>We have noted in similar circumstances that \"[a] formal agreement [between co-conspirators] is not required; rather `[t]he agreement may be shown by a concert of action, all the parties working together understandingly, with a single design for the accomplishment of a common purpose.'\" <i>Munoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 45-46 (internal citation omitted) (quoting <i>Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States,</i> 147 F.2d 93, 107 (6th Cir.1944)). In that case, employees of a bank and a development company were convicted for conspiring under 18 U.S.C. § 371 to commit bank fraud, misapply bank funds and make false entries in the books and records of the bank. <i>Id.</i> at 45. We dismissed their sufficiency of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> evidence challenge, noting that the two bank officials \"directly supervised\" and \"worked closely with\" the developer's loans, that the developer and his employee \"submitted many certifications for work not yet completed,\" that one of the bank officials \"repeatedly approved\" those certifications, that the same bank official \"met frequently\" with the developer's employee regarding the status of their business ventures, and that the bank officials failed to disclose material information to the bank's Board of Directors. We held that this was sufficient to allow a jury to infer an agreement among the four defendants to defraud the bank. <i>Id.</i> at 46.</p>\n<p>The nature of the evidence in this case is similar. The evidence presented at trial showed, for instance, that Newell channeled money from the accounts of various federally funded programs into non-approved uses. These \"interfund transfers\" were recorded as \"loans,\" and while some were ultimately repaid, others were not. Some of these expenditures went toward paying payroll and general assistance, as well as the salaries of \"ghost employees,\" individuals who either no longer worked at the various grant-funded programs, or did not work for the time claimed. Parisi signed off on financial status reports filed with the federal agencies that were funding the programs, certifying that the money was spent in accordance with the grant's terms. Parisi was well aware that the grant money could not be used indiscriminately; indeed, he was repeatedly told as much by the fund administrators themselves. Nevertheless, Parisi continued to divert federal grant funds, including funds provided by SAMHSA intended for the Tribe's health center, to payroll and tribal government expenses. Parisi promised bookkeepers at these federally-funded programs that the ghost employees would be removed from payroll, but that did not happen. Similarly, Parisi assured the manager of the Tribe's health center (funded by federal SAMHSA grants) that the diverted funds would be repaid, although very little ultimately was. This conduct persisted for a period of nearly three years.</p>\n<p>The evidence presented against Parisi was sufficient to establish that even if there was no express agreement with Newell, nonetheless there was an implied or tacit agreement. Newell ordered that federal funds be misapplied and Parisi saw that they were. This was the requisite \"concert of action\" evincing a \"common purpose.\" <i>See </i><i>Munoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 45-46. We will not disturb the jury's verdict as to count one.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Count 5</h2>\n<p>Parisi next contends that he was improperly convicted under count five, which alleged that he made a materially false statement with regard to how $215,599.43 of a SAMHSA grant intended for the Tribe's Wonahkik substance abuse and HIV prevention programs was spent. Parisi signed and submitted a \"financial status report\" with HHS claiming this amount was spent in accordance with grant purposes. In reality, $129,044.67 was spent to pay \"ghost employees\"Dennis Tomah, Sr., Dana Newell, and John Stevenswho did not work for those programs during the relevant time period. Parisi's claims on appeal are, first, that the government's evidence did not prove that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> his submission was \"knowing[] and willful[]\" as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) and, second, that the form was in any case not \"material\" as it was improperly filled out.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>\"To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the government must prove that the defendant knowingly and willfully made or used a false writing or document, in relation to a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States government, with knowledge of its falsity.\" <i>United States v. McGauley,</i> 279 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.2002). \"Willfulness . . . means nothing more in this context than that the defendant knew that his statement was false when he made it or . . . consciously disregarded or averted his eyes from its likely falsity.\" <i>United States v. Gonsalves,</i> 435 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Parisi contends that the government produced no evidence showing that he knew that Tomah, Newell and Stevens had not worked in the Wonahkik program during the specified time. The form referenced a period of time prior to Parisi's employment at the reservation, and the jury acquitted Parisi of actually misapplying those particular funds (count three).</p>\n<p>An examination of the trial transcript reveals the following: at trial, Faye Socobasin (the tribal bookkeeper who actually filled out the form that Parisi later signed) was asked by the prosecutor if she had conversed with \"either\" Parisi or Newell about the inappropriate use of the funds. She said she had, and the prosecutor continued, \"so you did have a conversation with Robert Newell about this?\" to which she replied, \"Yes.\" The prosecutor then asked if she discussed the matter with Parisi, and she replied that \"with Jim Parisi, Iwhat I can remember is I just did the 269 [the financial status report] and told him that it had to be signed.\" The prosecutor then went on to establish that Parisi in fact signed the 269 form.</p>\n<p>Three days later, Linda Lewey, the Tribe's federal grant compliance officer, testified that Parisi was present at two meetings during which the issue of what to do about the unused money in the SAMHSA grant was discussed. The first meeting was apparently in December of 2003, when the decision was taken to request permission from HHS to \"roll over\" the unused money into the next fiscal year's budget. Lewey appears not to have been questioned as to what, specifically, transpired at the second meeting. As before, the prosecutor moved immediately to discuss whether Parisi had in fact signed off on the fraudulent financial reports.</p>\n<p>The most specific testimony on the issue of Parisi's knowledge of the falsehoods contained in the 269 form appears to have been provided by Roger Paul, the Wonahkik program coordinator. The prosecutor asked Paul whether he ever discussed payment of non-program employees with Parisi. His reply was: \"I don't remember that issue exactly. There were many occasions I spoke to Mr. Parisi, and there was one occasion I spoke to Mr. Parisi about the finances, and I remember Mr. Parisi saying, well, that's what Governor Newell wants done, and that's why we're doing it this way.\" However, this statement is ambiguous in at least two key respects. First, Paul testified only that he discussed \"finances\" with Parisi. And, second, it is unclear <i>when</i> Paul had this conversation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> with Parisi. Even if Paul's testimony is sufficient to show that Parisi knew of the unauthorized use of SAMHSA funds, if the revelation occurred after the false 269 form had already been filed, it would shed little light on the crucial question of whether Parisi knew the form to be false <i>at the time of filing.</i></p>\n<p>The evidence the government amassed as to Parisi's guilt on count five clearly establishes that Parisi signed the 269 form, and that the 269 form misrepresented that certain expenses were properly charged to the SAMHSA grant. However, the evidence as to whether Parisi at this point knew that the information he was filing was materially incorrectthat Tomah, Newell and Stevens had not worked for Wonahkik in FY 2003appears to be skimpy at best. The time period in question was prior to Parisi's employment with the Tribe, and we see no reason to believe that he knew, within a few months of his arrival, where every tribal member had worked in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, of course, the inference of knowledge becomes increasingly pressing as Parisi became more and more deeply involved with, and received warning after warning about, Newell's on-going financial tomfoolery.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one could conclude from the evidence presented that it was possible that Parisi knew the 269 form to contain false statements. But we do not see how a reasonable person could view the evidence as establishing such knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we find that the evidence was not sufficient to convict Parisi under count 5.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Counts 12-15</h2>\n<p>Parisi was convicted of counts 12-15, which assert that Parisi filed fraudulent claims for reimbursement to SAMHSA officials in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2005, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 287.<sup>[16]</sup> Parisi challenges his convictions on these counts because he claims that the government failed to prove that the forms at issue were material. They were not material, Parisi claims, because one of themthe form underlying count 12was returned to him \"because it was not in a format in which [HHS] was willing to review it,\" and because the government did not pay the claims listed on the forms underlying counts 13-15.</p>\n<p>The plain language of § 287 makes no mention of materiality as an element of the offense. Parisi argues that we should nevertheless read materiality into the statute, as the Eighth and Fourth Circuits have done. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Adler,</i> 623 F.2d 1287, 1291 n. 5 (8th Cir.1980); <i>United States v. Snider,</i> 502 F.2d 645, 652 n. 12 (4th Cir.1974). In contrast, the Fifth, Ninth, Tenth and Second Circuits have held that § 287 does not require proof of the materiality of the false statement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Upton,</i> 91 F.3d 677, 685 (5th Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 66 F.3d 254, 255 (9th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Parsons,</i> 967 F.2d 452, 455 (10th Cir. 1992); <i>United States v. Elkin,</i> 731 F.2d 1005, 1009-10 (2d Cir.1984), <i>overruled on</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> <i>other grounds by </i><i>United States v. Ali,</i> 68 F.3d 1468 (2d Cir.1995). Finally, the Third Circuit has split the difference and concluded that materiality sometimes is, and sometimes is not, an element under § 287. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Saybolt,</i> 577 F.3d 195, 200 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>This case does not require us to express a view as to whether materiality is an element under 18 U.S.C. § 287. This is because Parisi's claim cannot succeed either way. As we have noted in other statutory contexts, a statement need not actually deceive to qualify as \"material.\" Rather, \"materiality requires only that the fraud in question have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of affecting or influencing, a government function. The alleged concealment or misrepresentation need not have influenced the actions of the Government agency, and the Government agents need not have been actually deceived.\" <i>United States v. Corsino,</i> 812 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1987) (citing <i>United States v. Markham,</i> 537 F.2d 187, 196 (5th Cir.1976)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2004).<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>It is thus clear that Parisi's claims would be unavailing even were we to read materiality into § 287. The forms Parisi submitted were expressly designed to cause the SAMHSA administrators to pay on claims that were not authorized by the terms of the SAMHSA grant. Although the 270 form at issue in count twelve was returned to Parisi because it was improperly formatted, it contained the substance of the relevant false claims, which substance was re-submitted several days later in the correct format.<sup>[18]</sup> As our precedent on materiality makes clear, that SAMHSA administrators were not ultimately deceived into paying out on the fraudulent claims at issue in counts 12-15 does not bear on the materiality of the fraudulent misrepresentations. <i>Corsino,</i> 812 F.2d at 30. For these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to show that the misrepresentations contained on the forms underlying counts 12-15 were \"material.\"<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> D. Counts 1, 8, 9, 11, 29, 30</h2>\n<p>Finally, Parisi attacks his conviction under counts 1, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 on the grounds that the government failed to prove \"the necessary criminal intent of acting willfully.\" The relevant statutes are §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669; the former alleges that Parisi \"intentionally misapplie[d]\" property, whereas the latter alleges that he \"knowingly and willfully\" embezzled, stole or converted the assets of a health care benefit program. Parisi insists that he had \"no motive to disobey or disregard the law, as he gained no benefit from the transfers.\"</p>\n<p>Parisi's argument is that in order to obtain a conviction under either of these statutes, the government needed to show that he acted \"willfully,\" meaning that the government had to show that he acted with an illicit motive. <i>See </i><i>Bryan v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 184, 192 n. 12, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998) (explaining that the term \"willful\" in a criminal statute \"generally means an act done with a bad purpose.\"). Parisi supports his contention by suggesting that when allegedly fraudulent acts are not \"themselves wrongful,\" then the government must additionally show illicit motive. <i>See </i><i>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Elder Care Servs.,</i> 82 F.3d 524, 527 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that \"[n]ormally, a party suggesting fraud or bad faith is expected to point to the <i>misconduct</i> (lies, rigged account books, self-dealing by a fiduciary) that reflects the bad faith or constitutes the fraud,\" but acknowledging that \"on some occasions the inference of fraud or bad faith might be compelled by the combination of motive and outcome.\").</p>\n<p>There appears to be scant law on the necessary <i>mens rea</i> under either §§ 666(a)(1)(A) or 669, and we do not attempt here to define the precise criminal intent required by these statutes. In particular, we do not express any view as to whether the government is required to prove a self-interested motive under either § 666(a)(1)(A) or § 669. It is sufficient for our purposes to note that, even if Parisi's argument were correct, the evidence presented was sufficient to support a finding of illicit motive. After all, Parisi evidently did have a \"motive to disobey or disregard the law,\" and derived a very concrete benefit from doing so: continued employment with the Tribe. Although not the direct beneficiary of the financial maneuvers he executed on Newell's behalf, Parisi benefitted indirectly by avoiding the fate of others who protested and subsequently found themselves out of a job. Thus, even if proof of an illicit motive or personal benefit was requiredan issue we do not resolve todaythe existence of such a motive or benefit was supportable from the facts. We discern no error in the jury's verdicts on this score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. Were the <i>Pinkerton</i> instructions misleading?</h2>\n<p>Both appellants contend that the district court erred in twice giving the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> jury a <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction because doing so could have misled the jury. When an appellant claims that a jury instruction would \"tend[] to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues,\" we review for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Silva,</i> 554 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted)). In assessing a challenge to a trial court's jury instructions, we must bear in mind that \"[a] trial judge has broad discretion in deciding how best to communicate complicated legal rules to a lay jury.\" <i>DeCaro v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> 580 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir.2009). In addition, \"[w]hen reviewing a district court's instructions to the jury, we look at the charge as a whole, not in isolated fragments.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 976 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Garcia-Pastrana,</i> 584 F.3d 351, 385 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>A <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction tells the jury that they may hold a defendant liable for a criminal offense in which the defendant did not personally participate if it was committed during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy of which he was a member. <i>See </i><i>Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 645-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946); <i>United States v. Hansen,</i> 434 F.3d 92, 103 (1st Cir.2006). The district court gave the jury a <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction once when instructing on counts 29 and 30, and again when instructing on counts 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Both Newell and Parisi objected before the court instructed the jury, and Parisi objected again after the instructions were given.</p>\n<p>Appellants argue that by giving the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction twice, the court created an undue risk that the jury would draw the inference that a person who had committed the substantive offense must have been a conspirator as well. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d 607, 612 n. 4 (1st Cir.1990) (cautioning against automatically providing a <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction in cases \"where the jury is being asked . . . to infer, on the basis of a series of disparate criminal acts, that a conspiracy existed\"). <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Wester,</i> 90 F.3d 592, 597 (1st Cir.1996) (rejecting challenge to <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction on grounds that in some cases \"some interplay between the jury's assessment of guilt on the substantive counts and the conspiracy charge is both natural and appropriate,\" and that \"the fact that substantive crimes were carried out by the defendants, following discussions between them, may well make the fact of agreement more likely\").</p>\n<p>As the government notes, the two <i>Pinkerton</i> instructions were not duplicative, but rather were addressed to two distinct sets of offensesthe misapplication of tribal funds in counts 29 and 30 and the misapplication of government and health care funds in counts 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Even if giving the instruction twice created a risk that the jury would improperly infer the existence of a conspiracy, there was a converse risk that failing to adequately instruct the jury that vicarious liability was available on these distinct sets of charges would itself have misled the jury. (The appellants do not contend that <i>Pinkerton</i> liability was in fact impermissible on either set of charges). Moreover, it is worth bearing in mind that the appellants were facing a thirty-count indictment, alleging violations of five separate statutes in dozens of transactions occurring over the span of approximately four years. The trial took eleven days, and the jury instructions alone occupy approximately forty pages in the trial transcript. Under these circumstances, it was well within the court's discretion to decide whether providing the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction twice would serve to clarify or to confuse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> V. Were specific unanimity instructions required?</h2>\n<p>Many of the counts in the indictmentspecifically, counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30alleged multiple fraudulent transactions. Each of these counts listed multiple instances of the misapplication of funds occurring within discrete one-year windows. The appellants now object that the structure of the indictment was duplicitous and violated their right to a unanimous verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(a). The gist of the appellants' complaint is that counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 of the indictment allowed the jury to vote to convict even though they may have disagreed as to which specific acts of intentional misapplication were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Some of the jurors could have thought, for instance, that the appellants had intentionally misapplied funds on only a particular subset of occasions, whereas other jurors could have thought that they had misapplied funds on a different subset of occasions. Despite this disagreement, the jurors could still have all agreed that the government had proven that appellants had intentionally misapplied at least <i>some</i> funds, and voted to convict on that basis. The question is whether unanimity on that proposition would be sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p>Normally, \"[a] party's entitlement to a unanimity instruction presents a question of law,\" meaning that \"the district court's answer to that question engenders <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir.2003). However, in this case, neither Newell nor Parisi raised the issue below, so we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Pagan-Santini,</i> 451 F.3d 258, 267 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Puerta,</i> 38 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir.1994). Plain error is established by showing not only that error occurred, but that it was plain or obvious, violated substantial rights, and \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Montanez,</i> 202 F.3d 434, 442 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p>The characterization of the issue as one of jury \"unanimity\" is in some respects misleading. No one disputes that conviction requires unanimous agreement amongst the jurors. The issue is rather <i>what</i> it is that they must be unanimous <i>about.</i> This question is subtle and difficult, and raises two closely related sets of issues. The first is: when is a disputed facte.g., whether the crime occurred on a Monday or a Tuesday, with a knife or a gun, against this or that victimone that the jury must unanimously agree upon, and when is it merely dispensable detail? And the second is: when is a defendant's conduct one violation of a statute, and when is it many?</p>\n<p>Although the basic issue raised in this portion of the appeal concerns the second questionpotential duplicity in the indictmentthe government devotes substantial energy to resisting the appellants' argument on grounds that proof of a specific transaction is not an element under the relevant statutes. But, as we now explain, even if not always in the most perspicuous manner, our cases have distinguished between unanimity as to a crime's elements and unanimity as to a crime's instances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Unanimity as to a crime's elements</h2>\n<p>The government points us toward <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 2003). In <i>Lee,</i> the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), which prohibited possession of \"fifteen or more. . . counterfeit or unauthorized access devices.\" Lee claimed that the jury was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> required to agree on which fifteen unauthorized credit cards he actually possessed. After considering the statutory text, relevant legal traditions, the structure of the law, its legislative history and implications for unfairness, <i>see </i><i>Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 37, we, on <i>de novo</i> review, rejected the claim and held that \"the identity of the particular devices possessed by a defendant is not an element\" under 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3). <i>Id.</i> at 40. We cautioned, however, that \"[a]scertainment of the level at which unanimity is required . . . tends to be offense-specific.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>The government insists that <i>Lee</i> controls the outcome here as well. If so, then the appellants' claims are doomed. If a claim fails under <i>de novo</i> review, then it must of course also fail under plain error review. So the question is whether <i>Lee</i> governs. It does not.</p>\n<p>The government fails to appreciate that the appellants are not contending that the jury had to be given a specific unanimity instruction because proof of a specific transaction is an element of § 666(a)(1)(A), i.e., that the government must in every prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) show a single, unambiguous qualifying transaction. What the appellants are claiming is rather that the indictment brought against them bundled multiple discrete violations of the statute under single counts, meaning that, in the absence of a specific unanimity instruction, it is unclear which (if any) of the referenced crimes commanded the jury's unanimous assent. This claim is fundamentally not about the \"elements\" of § 666(a)(1)(A); it is about the <i>structure</i> of the indictment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Holley,</i> 942 F.2d 916, 927 (5th Cir.1991) (distinguishing alternative <i>mentes reae</i> for a single killing from \"the situation where a single count as submitted to the jury embraces two or more separate offenses, though each be a violation of the same statute\").<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>This latter issue was not broached in <i>Lee.</i> The statute at issue in <i>Lee,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), defined the crime in terms of possession of \"fifteen or more\" unauthorized credit cards. The text of the statute thus supported our finding that the statute did not consist of \"fifteen acts of possessing an unauthorized credit card, but, rather, a single act of possession of fifteen such devices.\" <i>Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 39-40. As we noted, the starting point of the analysis was the text of the statute, and the statute in that case made it reasonably clear that \"Congress's emphasis was not on the identity of the actual items . . . but, rather, on the possession thereof.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38.</p>\n<p>Because § 1029(a)(3) defined an offense in terms of possession of \"fifteen or more\" unauthorized credit cards, it was clear that even if some of the jurors thought that Lee possessed <i>this</i> pile of cards while other jurors thought he possessed <i>that</i> pile, either way Lee could have committed no more, and no less, than a <i>single</i> violation of § 1029(a)(3). The same cannot be said of the indictment brought against Newell and Parisi.</p>\n<p>The government claims that the elements of an offense under § 666 are:</p>\n<blockquote>1) the defendant was an agent of an Indian tribal government; 2) who embezzled, stole, fraudulently obtained or willingly converted property worth at least $5000 of tribal property [sic]; and 3) did so during a time when the tribal government received more than $10,000 in any one year from a qualifying federal assistance program.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> Counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 of the indictment each contained descriptions of numerous transactions. With a few exceptions, each of these transactions would seem, on its face, to be enough to make out an independent violation of § 666(a)(1)(A). For instance, count two claimed that Newell was \"an agent\" of the Tribe, that the tribe \"received benefits in excess of $10,000 through contract, grants, and cooperative agreements with U.S. Departments and agencies,\" and that he \"intentionally misapplied\" the following funds: (1) approximately $50,130 from the BIA Housing Improvement Program, and (2) approximately $44,000 from the Indian Township Housing Authority. In light of the government's characterization of the elements of § 666(a)(1)(A), it appears that proof of either (1) or (2) would have been sufficient to make out a complete violation. It thus appears that the appellants have a point when they complain that the challenged counts presented \"two or more distinct violations of the same statute . . . lumped together in a single count,\" an allegation that the government, for its part, does not deny.</p>\n<p>But if it is true that, for instance, misapplying $50,130 in BIA funds and misapplying $44,000 of Indian Township Housing Authority funds constitute discrete violations of the statute, then count two did not allege two different ways of committing one and the same crime, as in <i>Lee,</i> but rather alleged two entirely distinct crimes. Under these circumstances, an undifferentiated guilty verdict on count two would leave it entirely unclear whether the jurors unanimously agreed (a) that Newell had misapplied the $50,130 in BIA funds; (b) that he had misapplied the $44,000 in Indian Township Housing Authority funds; (c) that he had misapplied both; or (d) that he had misapplied either the BIA or the Housing Authority funds, although they were not in agreement as to which. In short, if a specific unanimity instruction was required, it was not because proof of which specific funds were misapplied is an \"element\" under § 666(a)(1)(A), but because this indictment was duplicitous in consolidating multiple complete offenses under single counts. <i>Lee</i> did not address this issue, and does not govern this case.</p>\n<p>The government has insisted in this appeal that the bundled allegations merely specify \"alternate means of committing a crime,\" and therefore no specific unanimity instruction was required. As we have noted, it is true that a jury does not need to agree upon \"a single means of commission\" of a crime. <i>See </i><i>Schad v. Arizona,</i> 501 U.S. 624, 631, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555 (1991); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c) (\"A count may allege that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more specified means.\"). However, it does not follow from the fact that unanimity is not required with respect to alternative means of committing <i>one and the same</i> criminal act that unanimity is not required with respect to multiple instances of the same <i>type</i> of criminal act.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> B. Unanimity as to a crime's instances</h2>\n<p>The transactions detailed in counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 occurred on various dates and involved misapplications from various sources. Count two, for instance, merely specifies that at some point between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2003, Newell misapplied some funds from the BIA and also some other funds from the Indian Township Housing Authority. The question now is how many statutory violations the alleged conduct states.</p>\n<p>We cannot evade this question because the Supreme Court has indicated, on at least two separate occasions, that the jury is required to unanimously agree as to which instances of a crime the defendant committed. In <i>Schad,</i> the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to Arizona's murder statute, which permitted conviction on a theory of either premeditation or felony murder. In his concurrence, Justice Scalia concurred with the plurality largely on grounds of legal tradition, and disavowed the plurality's explanation for why \"it is permissible to combine in one count killing in the course of robbery and killing by premeditation.\" <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 651, 111 S.Ct. 2491 (Scalia, J., concurring). After all, despite their \"moral equivalence,\" Justice Scalia noted that \"[w]e would not permit . . . an indictment charging that the defendant assaulted either X on Tuesday or Y on Wednesday.\"<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Later, in <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 813, 815, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), the Court held that a jury must agree unanimously as to the individual violations making up the \"series of violations\" element under the federal continuing criminal enterprise statute (\"CCE\"), 21 U.S.C. § 848(a). The majority specifically cited Justice Scalia's warning in <i>Schad</i> as authority for the proposition that \"the Constitution itself limits a State's power to define crimes in ways that would permit juries to convict while disagreeing about means, at least where that definition risks serious unfairness and lacks support in history or tradition.\" <i>Id.</i> at 820, 119 S.Ct. 1707.</p>\n<p>We have described the type of indictment singled out by Justice Scalia in <i>Schad,</i> and subsequently emphasized in <i>Richardson,</i> as duplicitousthat is, as one that \"join[s] in a single count . . . two or more distinct and separate offenses.\" <i>United States v. Canas,</i> 595 F.2d 73, 78 (1st Cir.1979). We must, therefore, now turn our attention squarely to the question of whether the transactions bundled under counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 were duplicitousthat is, whether they described distinct violations of §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669. If they did, then the failure to give specific unanimity instructions was error. If not, then not.</p>\n<p>Determining whether the challenged counts were duplicitous is no easy matter.<sup>[23]</sup> In some cases the standard for individuating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> crimes is obviouswe count murders, for instance, by counting bodies. But in other cases, determining how many crimes were committed is much less clear. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rivera Ramos,</i> 856 F.2d 420, 422-23 (1st Cir.1988). The text of § 666 offers little guidance. Section 666(a)(1)(A) refers to \"property that is valued at $5000 or more and is owned by, or is under the care, custody or control of\" qualifying institutions. Section 669 refers to \"any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits, property, or other assets of a health care benefits program.\" Neither clearly specifies the baseline unit of prosecution. Although the statute is conditioned upon the organization's receipt of over $10,000 in benefits from a Federal program \"in any one year period,\" § 666(b), this is consistent with either (a) treating all qualifying transactions within a one-year period as aggregated together to state <i>one</i> offense under § 666(a)(1)(A), or (b) treating each qualifying transaction as an independent offense. The text of the statute thus fails to specify the allowable unit of prosecution.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of § 666 indicates that it was enacted as part of the Comprehensive Crime Bill of 1984, and that it was</p>\n<blockquote>designed to create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery involving Federal monies which are disbursed to private organizations or State and local governments pursuant to a Federal program.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Cicco,</i> 938 F.2d 441, 444 (3d Cir.1991) (citing S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 369 (1983), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510). This history does not illuminate Congress's preferred unit of prosecution.</p>\n<p>There is a \"surprising paucity of federal case law identifying the unit of prosecution for § 666.\" <i>United States v. Nystrom,</i> No. 07-30100-03, 2008 WL 4833984, at *10 (D.S.D. Nov. 4, 2008). We have previously held that the government may aggregate transactions occurring within a one-year time period in order to meet the $5000 jurisdictional minimum of § 666(a)(1)(A). <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d 470, 484 (1st Cir.2005). <i>Cruzado-Laureano</i> relied on a case from the Sixth Circuit, <i>United States v. Sanderson,</i> 966 F.2d 184, 189 (6th Cir.1992), which concluded that aggregation to meet the jurisdictional minimum is permissible when the transactions are part of a single scheme. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Hines,</i> 541 F.3d 833, 837 (8th Cir.2008) (interpreting aggregation of transactions for purpose of § 666 generally); <i>United States v. Webb,</i> 691 F.Supp. 1164, 1168 (N.D.Ill.1988) (\"[A]ggregation is permissible where the thefts are part of a single plan.\").</p>\n<p>These cases are not dispositive of the present controversy. These cases were concerned with the propriety of aggregation when the transactions involved sums which fell below the jurisdictional minimum and hence did not make out independent violations of § 666. However, one of the rationales for allowing aggregation under such circumstances is to ensure that poorly motivated officials do not evade liability under § 666 simply by stealing less than $5000 at a time. <i>See </i><i>Webb,</i> 691 F.Supp. at 1168; <i>Sanderson,</i> 966 F.2d at 189. Worries about opportunistic evasion of liability do not apply to transactions that involve sums larger than the statutory minimum. Since most of the bundled transactions in this case involved sums <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> greater than $5000, it is not clear whether this line of precedent would support the aggregation that occurred in this case. <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Urlacher,</i> 784 F.Supp. 61, 64 (W.D.N.Y.1992) (holding that the unit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) is \"`$5,000 or more,' from whatever source, in any one year period in which the government or agency at issue receives more than $10,000 in Federal aid.\").</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we are not completely without compass. We have previously given more general consideration to the individuation of criminal transactions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d 294, 297-301 (1st Cir.1999). In <i>Verrecchia,</i> an undercover sting caught the defendant attempting to fence stolen firearms. When he was arrested, the police discovered weapons in both his truck and in the adjacent barn. Verrecchia was subsequently charged with (among other things) one count related to the two weapons found in the truck and another for the twenty-one weapons found in the barn, under the auspices of the federal felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 296. Verrecchia contended that the counts were duplicitous insofar as they each alleged multiple crimes, and that it was plain error not to instruct the jury that they had to agree on which gun or guns he was shown to have possessed. <i>Id.</i> at 297.</p>\n<p>We rejected the claim under plain error review, and held that \"[c]ontrary to Verrecchia's contention, . . . the government could not have properly charged him with twenty-three separate crimes for the twenty-three different guns he allegedly possessed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 298. We relied in part on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Bell v. United States,</i> 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955), and in part on the overwhelming consensus from other courts of appeals that \"the simultaneous possession of multiple firearms . . . constitutes only one crime.\" <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bell,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized the \"presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code against the imposition of harsher punishment.\" <i>Bell,</i> 349 U.S. at 83, 75 S.Ct. 620. Therefore, \"if Congress does not fix the punishment for a federal offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 84, 75 S.Ct. 620. Accordingly, after finding that the language of § 922(g)(1) (referring to \"any firearm\") was, like the language of the Mann Act at issue in <i>Bell</i> (18 U.S.C. § 2421, referring to \"any woman or girl\"), ambiguous as to the allowable unit of prosecution, and finding no indication of Congress's clear intent \"to treat each possession of a firearm as a separate violation,\" we applied <i>Bell</i> in holding that the government properly charged him with two offenses rather than twenty-threeone for the two guns found in the truck and the other for the twenty-one guns found in the shed. <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p>The government cites <i>Verrecchia</i> for the proposition that \"[w]here separate instances of the same act are grouped in a single count . . . there is no duplicity.\" This is a serious misunderstanding of <i>Verrecchia.</i> After all, on this view, the indictment in <i>Verrecchia</i> should have contained only <i>one</i> count, encompassing all twenty-three guns. But we quite clearly held that \"the indictment here correctly grouped the firearms into counts based on the place of possession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 298. Moreover, <i>Bell,</i> on which we relied, did not say that every instance of the same type of criminal act could be lumped together under one count. It said that, for the sake of lenity, a <i>single transaction</i> should not be split up into multiple offenses. The focus on the transaction as the unit of prosecution explains <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> why there were two counts in <i>Verrecchia,</i> rather than either one or twenty-three: possession of the guns in the truck counted as one transaction, and possession of the guns in the shed counted as another. Thus, <i>Verrecchia</i> permitted bundling of guns <i>by transaction,</i> not simply <i>qua</i> instances of the same type of criminal act. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Waldman,</i> 579 F.2d 649, 654 (1st Cir.1978) (identifying appropriate unit of prosecution under 15 U.S.C. § 77(q)a to be \"separate transactions accompanied by the use of the mails\"). <i>But see United States v. Campbell,</i> No. 90-1130, 1990 WL 151318, at *1-2 (1st Cir. July 19, 1990) (treating unit of prosecution under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) as possession of the \"individual firearm\").<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>But if, as we held in <i>Verrecchia,</i> the fact that some guns are stored in a shed and others in a truck parked next to it is sufficient to constitute two distinct transactions, then there is a compelling claim that misapplying funds from agency A in March and misapplying funds from agency B in July is <i>also</i> sufficient to constitute two distinct transactions. Thus, far from supporting the government's position, <i>Verrecchia</i> appears to seriously undermine it. In light of <i>Verrecchia,</i> insofar as the conduct aggregated under counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 involved distinct transactions, the counts must be deemed to bundle within their ambit multiple distinct violations of § 666(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>There is thus reason to believe that the indictment brought against Newell and Parisi was constitutionally infirm. For the only sense in which it is true that a duplicitous count merely specifies \"alternate means of committing\" some crime is in the sense in which it is true that an indictment that alleges that A killed B on Monday, C on Tuesday and D on Wednesday specifies \"alternate means\" of committing a single instance of the crime of murder. The Supreme Court has made quite clear that this form of indictment violates a defendant's right to a unanimous verdict. <i>See </i><i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 820, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 651, 111 S.Ct. 2491 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Other circuits have come to similar conclusions. In <i>United States v. Holley</i><i>,</i> the Fifth Circuit held that an indictment that charged counts of perjury on the basis of multiple statements required a specific unanimity instruction, as the \"government was required to prove dissimilar facts to show the knowing falsity of each statement.\" <i>Holley,</i> 942 F.2d at 928-29. The <i>Holley</i> court specifically relied on Justice Scalia's warning against duplicitous indictments in <i>Schad. Id.</i> at 927; <i>see also </i><i>Bins v. United States,</i> 331 F.2d 390, 393 (5th Cir. 1964) (noting that a two-count indictment, each count of which alleged multiple acts of uttering and publishing false documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1010, was duplicitous, as \"[t]he filing of each false document would constitute a crime, and each should be alleged in a separate and distinct count of the indictment.\"). The Third Circuit has held that the unanimity requirement extends to an indictment that includes \"several transactions or occurrences, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> any of which could constitute one of the acts proscribed by the charged statutes.\" <i>United States v. Beros,</i> 833 F.2d 455, 460-61 (3d Cir.1987). The <i>Beros</i> court noted that \"just as the sixth amendment requires jury unanimity in federal criminal cases on each delineated offense that it finds a defendant culpable . . . it must also require unanimity regarding the specific act or acts which constitutes that offense. Absent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too little protection in too many instances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 461. The Seventh Circuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to <i>Holley. See </i><i>United States v. Fawley,</i> 137 F.3d 458, 471 (7th Cir.1998). <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Margiotta,</i> 646 F.2d 729, 733 (2d Cir.1981) (holding that the \"policy\" considerations behind the unanimity requirement suggest \"that a single count of an indictment should not be found impermissibly duplicitous whenever it contains several allegations that could have been stated as separate offenses . . . but only when the failure to do so risks unfairness to the defendant.\").</p>\n<p>The risks of serious unfairness presented by a duplicitous indictment are apparent. In conditions where jurors disagree among themselves as to just which offenses the evidence supports, the defendant may nevertheless wind up convicted because the jurors agree that the evidence showed that he had committed <i>an</i> offense, even if it was ambiguous as to which one. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Valerio,</i> 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.1995). In other words, although a jury may return a guilty verdict even if the jurors disagree about how a specific crime was committed, this is quite different from allowing a jury to return a guilty verdict when they disagree even as to <i>which</i> crime or crimes were committed. The Supreme Court emphasized just this kind of danger in <i>Richardson,</i> warning that the lack of a unanimity instruction could cover up \"wide disagreement among the jurors about just what the defendant did, or did not, do.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 819, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>see also </i><i>Beros,</i> 833 F.2d at 460 (observing that a general unanimity instruction is likely to be inadequate \"where the complexity of the case, or other factors, creates the potential that the jury will be confused.\").</p>\n<p>Secondly, in criminal cases, the government is still ostensibly required to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ayewoh,</i> 627 F.3d 914, 930 (1st Cir.2010) (Thompson, J., dissenting). In aggregating multiple instances of the same crime, the prosecution may bundle together alleged offenses that are strongly supported by the evidence with ones that are only moderately, or even weakly, supported by the evidence. If a jury does not specifically indicate that it has assented to each alleged offense, then by assenting to the bundle it has done no more than indicate its agreement with the proposition that the defendant is guilty of <i>some,</i> though perhaps not all, of the charged conduct. (And it may not have even indicated that much, if the jurors did not agree which offense was committedwhich, again, we simply do not know without an specific jury instruction). The consequences of conviction on that count may potentially lead to punishment over and above what the government's proof actually sustains. This is a danger we have stressed before, albeit in the context of unanimity as to a crime's elements rather than duplicity <i>per se. See </i><i>Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 36 (noting that \"the unanimity requirement. . . helps to ensure that no defendant will be convicted unless the government has carried its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and that \"leaving jurors free to convict despite disagreements about critical facts will imperil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> the integrity of the reasonable doubt standard.\").</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that charges 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 were duplicitous, and that the failure to provide a specific unanimity instruction was error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. If there was error, was it plain?</h2>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite our concern about the form of the indictment in this case, we cannot lose sight of the fact that these issues were not raised below and so are before us on plain error review. As we have noted on an earlier occasion, the hurdle of plain error \"nowhere looms larger than in the context of alleged instructional errors.\" <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Although we have concluded that the failure to provide a specific unanimity instruction was error and violated the appellants' right to a unanimous jury verdict, this alone is not sufficient to satisfy the rigors of plain error review. To prevail under plain error requires showing, among other things, that any error of law was plainthat is, that it was \"obvious and clear under current law.\" <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>We cannot say that the error here met that standard. We note that this court has previously rejected a claim substantially similar to that brought by the appellants, albeit with fairly minimal analysis. <i>See </i><i>Pagan-Santini,</i> 451 F.3d at 267. Moreover, as we noted in <i>Pagan-Santini,</i> \"the law is less clear than it might be as to when juror unanimity is required in the face of alternative paths to a verdict.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir.2002) (declining to find plain error in trial court's failure to give specific unanimity instruction with respect to charge of conspiracy to murder thirteen individuals on grounds of the \"unsettled state of the law.\") It appears not to have gotten any clearer since then.</p>\n<p>In light of the presence of some, even if not exactly overwhelming, countervailing authority, and because of the lack of doctrinal clarity in this areathe relevant unit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A), the crucial issue underpinning the appellants' claim, appears not to have been hitherto addressed by this circuitwe cannot say with confidence that any error here was plain.</p>\n<p>We emphasize, however, that because we hold that the indictment was impermissibly duplicitous, plain error review may prove to be cold comfort for similarly defective charging instruments going forward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. Should Newell have been sentenced under § 450d?</h2>\n<p>Newell claims that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 666 and 669 rather than 25 U.S.C. § 450d, despite the fact that he was charged with, and convicted of, violating only the former statutes. Section 666 criminalizes the intentional misapplication of funds by an official of an organization receiving over $10,000 per year in federal funds, and carries a maximum sentence of ten years; § 669 criminalizes intentional misapplication of the assets of \"health care benefit program,\" again setting a statutory cap of ten years imprisonment. By contrast, § 450d imposes a maximum sentence of two years for tribal officers who are convicted of misapplying funds received under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Section 450d is, Newell insists, specifically directed to Indian officials unlike the general purpose §§ 666 and 669 statutes. Newell argues that the rule of lenity, as well as the principle of statutory construction favoring specific statutes over general statutes, require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> that he be sentenced under § 450d, notwithstanding that one is usually sentenced under the statute that one is accused of violating.</p>\n<p>\"[Q]uestions of statutory interpretation that bear on sentencing\" engender <i>de novo</i> review. <i>United States v. Vidal-Reyes,</i> 562 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>In support of his position, Newell cites the dissenting opinion in <i>United States v. Largo,</i> 775 F.2d 1099 (10th Cir.1985) (McKay, J., dissenting). In <i>Largo,</i> the majority upheld the defendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 641 for misapplying federal funds, rejecting the argument that the defendant should have been sentenced under § 450d. <i>Id.</i> at 1102. The dissenting judge disagreed, explaining that, because § 450d specifically applied to tribal officers and carried a lighter maximum sentence, remand for resentencing under 25 U.S.C. § 450d was required. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Newell's argument is not persuasive. The statute under which Newell was charged explicitly applies to tribal officers, undermining Newell's contention that Congress intended prosecution of tribal officers to be governed <i>exclusively</i> by 25 U.S.C. § 450d. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1) (referring specifically to \"agent[s] of . . . Indian tribal government.\"). Moreover, Newell's proposed application of the rule of lenity is questionable. The rule of lenity, which favors narrow construction of ambiguous criminal statutes, is of little import in choosing between the application of overlapping criminal statutes. In any case, absent a discriminatory motive on the part of prosecutors, \"what charge to file . . . generally rests entirely in the prosecutor's discretion.\" <i>United States v. Bucci,</i> 582 F.3d 108, 113 (1st Cir.2009) (internal citations and alterations omitted). Consequently, we discern no error and reject Newell's request for resentencing under 25 U.S.C. § 450d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII. Calculation of the restitution order</h2>\n<p>Parisi objects to the restitution order of approximately $1.6 million that was entered against him. He contends that the restitution order should be remanded to the district court to correct a multitude of alleged errors. We address Parisi's contentions one by one. As is well-established, \"[w]e review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and the subsidiary findings of fact for clear error. If the appellant's challenge is based on a legal conclusion, we review that conclusion <i>de novo.</i> Where the defendant has failed to object below . . . we review only for plain error.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 83-84 (1st Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Who were the victims?</h2>\n<p>Parisi argues that \"to the extent there were any victims, they were the [tribal] programs which did not have use of the funds.\" The federal agencies to whom Parisi is required to make restitution are not \"victims\" of his conduct, he claims, because even if \"the federal government's funds were not utilized as intended, the federal government turned over the right to possess those funds when it transferred the funds to\" the Tribe.</p>\n<p>The restitution order is governed by the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3663. As it happens, the statute includes a definition of \"victim\": \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> We have noted, as Parisi concedes, that governmental entities may, \"without dispute,\" be considered victims under the MVRA. <i>United States v. Janosko,</i> 642 F.3d 40, 41 (1st Cir.2011). What, then, is the basis of Parisi's claim that the agencies were not victims of his conduct? The closest he comes to pressing the point is his assertion, noted above, that the agencies lost any right to possess the relevant funds once they were granted to the Tribe. But this contention misses the point entirely. If the federal agencies were harmed, it was not by losing possession of the fundsthese were, after all, <i>grants</i>but rather by not having the funds go to the designated programs.<sup>[25]</sup> For Parisi to have so much as a shadow of a claim that the federal agencies were not his victims, he would have to show why <i>that</i> kind of frustrated expectation is not a cognizable harm under the MVRA.<sup>[26]</sup> But he nowhere makes any such allegation. We therefore consider the claim waived, and do not address it.</p>\n<p>Parisi spends a good deal of his discussion of restitution claiming that a restitution order would work a \"fundamental unfairness.\" Parisi claims that misuse of federal grant money was standard practice at the Tribe long before he arrived on the scene, and that the tribal council was well aware of this fact. Parisi claims that the tribal council acknowledged, in a May 2004 meeting, both that they were seriously overspending their budget and that federal SAMHSA grant money was being siphoned off to pay their own salaries. In short, Parisi's claim is that the tribal council was entirely aware of and complicit in Newell's financial shenanigans, and that he should not be made to compensate the Tribe for the financial consequences of \"decisions of the tribal political leadership, including the governor and tribal council members,\" particularly when he, as a tribal outsider, had no say in making these decisions.</p>\n<p>This is an argument about whether or not what he did ought to be considered a crime, or perhaps whether it is fair to punish him while not punishing the other allegedly complicit parties. It does not appear to be an argument about whether there was error in calculating the restitution order. Parisi had an opportunity to present this argument to a jury of his peers. We will not reopen the matter now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. How harmful was it?</h2>\n<p>Parisi next challenges the inclusion of specific amounts in the restitution order. Parisi disputes the following five amounts: (1) $129,044 relating to the SAMHSA funds at issue in counts three and five; (2) $33,000 spent on a Racino referendum effort, as well as other transfers from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> health center's budget over which he had no control; (3) $15,900 of housing authority funds; and (4) a $30,000 DOJ COPS grant.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>Before we address these contentions, however, we must first determine whether these claims were preserved. The government claims that Parisi did not properly object to some, and possibly any, of the specified amounts at sentencing. The government claims that Parisi only objected at sentencing to (3), the Racino expenditures, and that it was raised only with respect to the guidelines calculation rather than the size of the restitution order itself. Paragraphs 71-72 of the PSR detailed the use of health center funds to pay for the Racino effort. Parisi objected to paragraph 71 on the ground that he had no authority to initiate or stop the use of the $33,000 for the Racino effort, and he repeated this contention at the sentencing hearing. The government's position appears to be that although Parisi objected to the inclusion of the Racino funds, he did not object to the \"amount\" imposed.</p>\n<p>We do not know what to make of this contention. Parisi's claim was that the Racino funds should not have been included at all, from which it follows that in his view the correct amount was zero. Moreover, the government's contention that \"[t]he sentencing transcript reveals only one reference to any of the four\" disputed amounts is belied by the record. Parisi's objections to the PSR's inclusion of the $129,044 in SAMHSA funds can be found on pages 8-10 of the sentencing transcript. His objections to the DOJ COPS grant can be found on pages 15-16. The discussion of Parisi's involvement with transfers from the Housing Authority, although more elliptical, can be found on page 8. The objections were preserved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. $129,044 of SAMHSA funds</h2>\n<p>Parisi first contests the inclusion of the $129,044 deriving from the misapplication of SAMHSA funds used to pay ghost employee salaries in the early part of 2004. Parisi argues that he was not the cause of this loss under the standard announced in <i>United States v. Vaknin,</i> 112 F.3d 579, 589 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>In <i>Vaknin,</i> we held that a \"modified but for standard of causation is appropriate for restitution under the [Victim and Witness Protection Act],\" meaning that \"the government must show not only that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the conduct underlying the offense of conviction, but also that the causal nexus between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated (either factually or temporally).\" <i>Id.</i> at 589-90. We cautioned that \"what constitutes sufficient causation can only be determined case by case, in a fact-specific probe.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Parisi was acquitted of count three, which alleged the actual misapplication, but was convicted of count five, which alleged filing false statements with HHS relating to the misuse of the SAMHSA funds.<sup>[29]</sup> Although the timing is not entirely clear, it appears that the funds were disbursed no later than May 2004, i.e., before the falsified 269 forms were filed with HHS. The form therefore could not have been a \"but for\" cause in causing HHS to disburse the funds. <i>See id.</i> at 589 (\"Restitution should not be ordered in respect to a loss which would have occurred regardless of the defendant's conduct.\"). This sum therefore should not have been included under <i>Vaknin.</i><sup>[30]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. $33,000 Racino effort and Health Center transfers</h2>\n<p>Parisi also contests the inclusion of $33,000 used by the tribal government to pay for expenses stemming from an effort to get a referendum question on the November 2007 ballot asking for voter approval of a Racino. Less specifically, he challenges the inclusion of any of the \"transfers from the Health Center account used to make PTIT's payroll.\" Parisi does not provide a specific dollar amount, but the challenge appears to account for over $1 million of the $1.6 million restitution order.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the gist of Parisi's argument is that he was not the \"cause\" of these losses, as the decision to make those illicit transfers was made by Newell and other members of the Tribe's political leadership. Newell, in many cases with the tribal council's express consent, made the decision to transfer funds from federal grants to pay for, among other things, the council members' own salaries. Similarly, the $33,000 check to the Joint Tribal Council to cover the cost of the Racino referendum effort was authorized by Newell and approved by three separate council members. It was delivered to the Joint Tribal Council by Joe Socobasin, the Tribe's lieutenant governor at the time. It does not appear that Parisi had any say in deciding whether to support the Racino effort in the first place, or where the funds to do so would come from. The entirety of Parisi's involvement with this check appears to be that Newell ordered him to have it drawn up, an order that he in turn conveyed to Frances Neptune, the Tribe's IHS bookkeeper. The Tribe's habit of playing fast and loose with federal grant money, Parisi argues, was present \"before [Parisi] arrived. . . and continued after he left.\" Therefore, he contends, he was not a cause of the losses under <i>Vaknin.</i></p>\n<p>The uncontroverted evidence in the record does indeed suggest that Parisi may have been set up by Newell to take the fall for the Tribe's corrupt financial practices. Unfortunately for Parisi, however, it is well established that defendants can be required to pay restitution for the reasonably foreseeable offenses of their co-conspirators. <i>Collins,</i> 209 F.3d at 4. As <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> we noted above, even if Parisi's role was as limited as he suggestscarrying out or transmitting Newell's ordersthat is sufficient to support his conviction for conspiring with Newell to misapply federal funds. Since at some point the financial impropriety must have been glaringly obvious, and since there is no question that Parisi's co-conspirator, Newell, caused the transfers, Parisi's challenge to the inclusion of these amounts must be denied.</p>\n<p>Parisi's reliance on <i>United States v. Neal,</i> 36 F.3d 1190, 1200-01 (1st Cir.1994), is misplaced. It is true that we held in <i>Neal</i> that a person who aided others in committing a bank robbery, but did not actually participate in the robbery itself, could not be required on that basis alone to make restitution for the full amount of the loss suffered by the bank. However, as we made clear in <i>Neal,</i> Congress has insisted on a different standard when a defendant has been convicted of a federal crime that \"require[s] proof of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1200; <i>see also </i><i>Collins,</i> 209 F.3d at 3.<sup>[31]</sup> Unlike the defendant in <i>Neal,</i> Parisi was most definitely convicted of such a crime. Therefore, the reckoning of the losses that may be laid at his doorstep is substantially broader than it otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. $15,900 Indian Township Housing Authority</h2>\n<p>Parisi claims that the district court erred in including $15,900 based on transfers from the Indian Township Housing Authority. The district court, Parisi argues, explicitly conceded that Parisi was not involved in these transfers but went ahead and included them in the restitution order anyway. Our review is for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Parisi claims that the district court found that Parisi \"had nothing to do\" with the transfers from the Housing Authority. It is not clear from the record whether or not the district court made such a finding. The portion of the sentencing transcript on which Parisi relies shows that the parties were disputing another matterParisi's contention that the PSR should reflect that he never transferred money to accounts outside the tribal government's control. The court overruled Parisi's objection, and stated that it \"takes into account the parenthetical added to paragraph 26, and with that addition believes the paragraph to be accurate.\"<sup>[32]</sup> However, while the referenced parenthetical does include Parisi's insistence that he had nothing to do with the Housing Authority transfers, no actual discussion of that claim is reflected in the sentencing transcript, as the discussion instead was focused on the issue of his responsibility for transferring money to non-tribal accounts.</p>\n<p>Also bearing on our analysis here is the fact that many of these transfers from the Housing Authority's funds appear to have been undertaken exclusively by Newell for his own purposese.g., a \"donation\" for the marriage of \"Mr. and Mrs. Tammy Newell,\" unspecified \"loans\" in small amounts, compensation to Newell himself for \"mileage,\" and medical assistance to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> Tribe members whose relationship to Newell and/or Parisi is unexplained. In the absence of an explicit ruling by the district court, we are left uncertain whether the district court viewed these transfers as not within the scope of the (tacit) agreement between Newell and Parisi, but mistakenly did not deduct them from the overall restitution order, or if the court concluded that they were, appearances notwithstanding, indeed part of the overall conspiracy. Particularly in light of the extensive number of transactions involved, and the factual complexity of the case, both possibilities seem equally plausible. Because of the ambiguity in the record, we remand the restitution order to the district court to clarify its disposition of the $15,900 Indian Township Housing Authority transfers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. $30,000 DOJ COPS grant</h2>\n<p>Parisi raises a similar contention in his reply brief as to the inclusion of $30,000 based on the misapplication of a DOJ COPS grant. The district court stated that \"[b]oth sides seem to agree that the PSR is inaccurate to the extent it states that Mr. Parisi requested the transfer of those funds. The statement will not be considered by the court.\" Nevertheless, the restitution order included this amount. Parisi's suggestion is that this was an oversight. The government's somewhat gnostic counter-suggestion is that the district court ruled only that it \"would not consider at sentencing\" the PSR's claim that Parisi had requested the transfer, but that it nevertheless intended to include the $30,000 in the restitution order.</p>\n<p>Once again, it is simply unclear on the record what the district court intended. It is possible that the district court concluded that the $30,000 DOJ COPS transfer was to be excluded from consideration. But we are not in a position to assert as much with any confidence.</p>\n<p>However, Parisi only raised this issue in his reply brief. As we have noted, \"issues raised for the first time in an appellant's reply brief are generally deemed waived.\" <i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1998). Parisi attempts to circumvent this rule by characterizing the DOJ COPS grant issue as merely another instance of the restitution order including \"acquitted conduct.\" But Parisi was not in fact acquitted of this conduct. He was convicted of count 30, which, among other things, alleged misapplication of the COPS grant. The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Repayment of misapplied funds</h2>\n<p>Parisi next argues that the district court failed to consider \"amounts that were misapplied but subsequently repaid.\" As before, our review is for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Parisi argues that some of the moneys that were transferred from the federal grants into the Tribe's general accounts were subsequently repaid by the Tribe. Therefore, it was error to base the restitution order on the initial quantity transferred rather than the amount net repayments. Parisi argues that the restitution order \"grossly exaggerates\" the actual losses, and notes that restitution must be gauged by \"actual loss\" to the victim, <i>United States v. Galloway,</i> 509 F.3d 1246, 1253 (10th Cir.2007), and that the burden is on the government to establish the amount of the loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Parisi fails to provide any details about the alleged repayments. He fails to specify to whom the payments were made, who they were made by, when they were made, or how much was repaid. At sentencing, the district court heard from the parties as to whether those Tribe members whose retirement accounts had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> been affected by the misuse of earmarked money had been compensated, and that the government conceded that \"five or six\" such individuals had in fact been repaid. Neither party put forward a specific dollar amount that had been repaid.<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p>The MVRA stipulates that \"[a]ny dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e). As it does not appear that Parisi disputed the inclusion of allegedly repaid amounts in the PSR or at sentencing, we do not discern any abuse of discretion on this score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Excessive Fines clause</h2>\n<p>Finally, Parisi claims that the imposition of the approximately $1.6 million restitution order is a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because (a) the funds were spent on tribal government expenses, (b) Parisi did not personally benefit from the funds in question, (c) he does not have the resources to repay such an amount, and (d) the size of the order will \"prevent him from achieving any reasonable livelihood.\"</p>\n<p>We have never held that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to restitution. The circuits that have considered challenges to restitution orders under the Excessive Fines clause have held that where the restitution order reflects the amount of the victim's loss no constitutional violation has occurred. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lessner,</i> 498 F.3d 185, 205-06 (3d Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Newsome,</i> 322 F.3d 328, 342 (4th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Dubose,</i> 146 F.3d 1141, 1145 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that \"[w]here the amount of restitution is geared directly to the amount of the victim's loss caused by the defendant's illegal activity, proportionality is already built in.\"). This is not surprising, as restitution is inherently proportional, insofar as the point of restitution is to restore the victim to the status <i>quo ante.</i> Restitution is distinct in this regard from forfeiture, as Parisi concedes.</p>\n<p>In this case, the amount of restitution ordered was the sum of the moneys that Parisi was found to have misapplied or for which he submitted false claims. Even assuming that restitution orders may be challenged under the Excessive Fines clause, the restitution ordered in this case would not therefore violate Parisi's rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons given above, we vacate Parisi's conviction on count five, reduce the restitution order entered against him by $129,044, remand for further clarification of whether the Indian Township Housing Authority transfers were meant to be included in the restitution order, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  There are two Passamaquoddy reservations; this case concerns solely the Indian Township reservation located near Princeton, Maine.</p>\n<p>[2]  A tribe receiving BIA funds under a \"638 contract\" may reallocate funds intended for one program to another program funded by the contract unless the funds have a separate funding code. However, BIA funds cannot be diverted to non-BIA programs.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Tribe's General Assistance Office was set up to provide cash assistance and other forms of assistance to needy tribal members. All general assistance had to be approved by the governor.</p>\n<p>[4]  The individuals that Newell and Parisi paid through these grants worked for the tribal government, just not for the programs that were funded by the federal grants. In other cases, the \"ghost\" employees were employed at least part-time with the relevant programs.</p>\n<p>[5]  Ronald Smith, the Tribe's outside auditor, testified at trial that interfund transfers were a \"necessary part of the business\" in light of the complexity of tribal finances, and that he had advised Newell and Parisi that they were consistent with accepted government practices, provided the money was returned and accounted for within \"a reasonable time frame.\" Smith did not specify precisely what such a time frame would be, but suggested \"a week\" as an example.</p>\n<p>[6]  For reference, a summary of the charges brought against Newell and Parisi is attached as an appendix.</p>\n<p>[7]  Newell's restitution order was composed of: (1) $305,693.77 to the IHS; (2) $195,895.35 to HHS; (3) $782,693 to the BIA; (4) $45,230.05 to the EPA; (5) $30,000 to the DOJ COPS program; (6) $23,796,96 to the Maine Office of Substance Abuse; (7) $43,367.50 to the Tribe's retirement fund; (8) $215,199.55 to the tribal government; and (9) $100,000 to On Point underwriting.\n</p>\n<p>Parisi's restitution order was identical, except for (4) and (8). The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Parisi was not responsible for the losses to the EPA, and deducted amounts tied to \"acquitted conduct\" from (8), lessening the amount he was required to pay the tribal government to $121,069.55.</p>\n<p>[8]  There is some support for the government's interpretation. Prior to trial, Newell presented a motion to dismiss asserting a \"privilege based upon the sovereignty and sovereign immunity of the Passamaquoddy Tribe.\" The motion, which was ultimately denied by the district court, cited the same statutory authority to support the \"tribal sovereign immunity\" claim as the (allegedly) jurisdictional argument before us on appeal. The sovereign immunity argument presented there appears to have transmogrified into an argument anent subject matter jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p>[9]  Section 666(a)(1)(A) reads: \"Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section existsbeing an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereofembezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies property that is valued at $5000 or more, and is owned by, or is under the care, custody, or control of such organization, government, or agency . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\" 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A). The referred to circumstance is \"that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.\" <i>Id.</i> § 666(b).</p>\n<p>[10]  We do not say that there could never be a challenge to the enforcement of § 666(a)(1)(A) against the Penobscot or Passamaquoddy Tribes. Although conditioned on the receipt of federal funds, § 666(a)(1)(A) does not actually require the misapplied funds to themselves <i>be</i> federal funds. The jurisdictional question would thus be more difficult if the indictment alleged misapplication of settlement fund income, the use or disposition of which is specifically exempted by the Implementing Act. <i>See</i> 30 M.S.R.A. § 6206 (\"[T]he use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\").\n</p>\n<p>However, Newell has alleged only that \"tribal income includes,\" and that the \"statute reaches\" settlement fund income, but has not provided any more precise explanation of how counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 do so. What is evident is that these counts contain specific allegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States and the intentional misapplication of the Indian Township Housing Authority's Project Income and NAHASDA accounts, the Tribe's BIA 638 contract, the tribal employees' retirement fund, and a DOJ COPS grant. It is possible that some of these sources (perhaps the Tribe's retirement funds and/or the Housing Authority's Project Income account) were made up of settlement fund income. But we simply cannot say from the record whether this is so. Moreover, because Newell did not raise this issue below, there are no relevant factual findings.</p>\n<p>We have never considered whether there might, on some facts, be a conflict between § 666(a)(1)(A) and 30 M.S.R.A. § 6206. In light of the undeveloped factual basis for the claims, we do not decide the issue today.</p>\n<p>[11]  The other two <i>Akins</i> factorswhether the practice concerns the Tribe's use of its lands, or natural resources from the landsdo not apply here.</p>\n<p>[12]  The governing conspiracy statute is 18 U.S.C. § 371, which reads, in pertinent part, \"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  Parisi insists that he was not conspiring with Newell but rather \"merely doing what Newell instructed him to do.\" This misconstrues the issue. The issue is not <i>why</i> Parisi may have agreed to participate in Newell's schemes; it is <i>whether</i> he so agreed. The answer to that question is not affected one way or the other by the observation that Parisi's only reason for being involved was because he was employed by the Tribe.</p>\n<p>[14]  Section 1001(a)(2) provides that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully . . . (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or . . . or both.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  Because we vacate the conviction, Parisi's additional contention that the 269 form was not \"material\" because it was incomplete and was not relied upon by agency officials is moot. It is in any case without merit, for the reasons noted in section C, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[16]  \"Whoever makes or presents to any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States, or to any department or agency thereof, any claim upon or against the United States, or any department or agency thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent, shall be imprisoned not more than five years and shall be subject to a fine in the amount provided in this title.\" 18 U.S.C. § 287.</p>\n<p>[17]  Perhaps one might wonder whether this understanding of materialitytaken from the context of § 1001is appropriate in the context of § 287. Parisi, however, is in no position to raise this argument. Parisi's argument for reading materiality into § 287 in the first place rests on the putative statutory history of §§ 287 and 1001. He argues that § 1001 includes an explicit reference to materiality because it was designed to address false statements, which, unlike the false claims penalized in § 287, was not a common law term of art that already implicitly incorporated a materiality requirement. Therefore, § 287 does not include a reference to materiality simply becauseaccording to Parisidoing so would have been otiose. We express no view on the veracity of this account of the distinction between §§ 287 and 1001, but note that if Parisi is correct, then it stands to reason that materiality under § 1001 ought to be identical to that under § 287, as the former (allegedly) only makes explicit what is anyway implicit in the latter.</p>\n<p>[18]  The false claims at issue in counts 12-15 were requests for reimbursement from SAMHSA for the salaries of the same three tribal council members that were the subject of counts 3 and 5. None of these council members worked for the Wonahkik program. Although it is plausible that Parisi did not know of the fraudulent nature of these claims with respect to the initial 269 formfiled shortly after he began working at the Tribethese forms were filed more than a year after he was hired. Parisi does not contend that he did not know, at this point, that these individuals did not work for Wonahkik and so were not eligible to have their salaries paid by SAMHSA.</p>\n<p>[19]  Our conclusion here means that there is no need to dwell on Parisi's complaint (which Newell joins) that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on materiality with respect to counts 12-15 (the counts alleging violations of § 287). Even assuming that materiality is an element under § 287, the failure to instruct the jury on materiality is subject to harmless error review. <i>See </i><i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 9, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (\"Unlike such defects as the complete deprivation of counsel or trial before a biased judge, an instruction that omits an element of the offense does not <i>necessarily</i> render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\"). Harmless error review requires ascertaining \"whether it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our conclusion entails that even if the district court erred in not giving the requested materiality instructionand we certainly do not say it didthat error was harmless as the evidence of materiality was more than sufficient to support the convictions under this standard.</p>\n<p>[20]  The other material statute in the challenged counts is § 669. Oddly, however, the parties focus their discussion exclusively on § 666(a)(1)(A). Our analysis, accordingly, is also focused exclusively on § 666(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[21]  To conclude otherwise would be to conflate two distinct senses of \"alternate means of committing a crime.\" The distinction is easily illustrated. Suppose, for instance, that there is some doubt as to whether A robbed B with a knife or a pistol. The government may obtain a conviction for armed robbery even if some of the jurors believe A used a knife and others believe he used a gun. But one thing the government certainly could not do is to charge A with <i>two</i> armed robberiesonce with the knife, and once with the gun. The appellants' complaint in this case raises the latter concern, but the government's response addresses the former.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, were the facts sufficient to support two distinct armed robberiesif, say, A robbed B with a knife and then, feeling peckish, returned at a later point and robbed B again with a pistolthe jury would be required to unanimously agree which of the crimes the government had proven. The point of specific unanimity instructions is, presumably, to preserve this right to a unanimous verdict regardless of whether the government decides to charge the two armed robberies in separate counts or to instead fold them into a single duplicitous one.</p>\n<p>[22]  <i>Schad</i> was decided by a plurality. Hence, Justice Scalia's vote was necessary to the outcome.</p>\n<p>[23]  We have not always needed to engage in extended analysis of the allowable unit of prosecution under plain error. For instance, in <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir.2007), we were able to sidestep analysis of this thorny question because First Circuit precedent had already established the unit of prosecution under the relevant statute. This is not the case here; the unit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) appears not to have been previously considered by this court.</p>\n<p>[24]  Focus on the transaction as the unit of prosecution, at least when Congress has left the issue open, is consistent with how we have treated claims of multiplicity in an indictment. Multiplicity is the converse of duplicity: it alleges that the government seeks multiple punishments for the same offense via an impermissibly repetitive indictment. In addressing multiplicity challenges, we have noted that \"an inquiring court must determine whether the facts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit of prosecution.\" <i>United States v. Pires,</i> 642 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir.2011). In applying this test, we focus on whether there is evidence that might establish that the conduct in question constitutes \"separate and distinct transactions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[25]  The legislative history of § 666 makes this point clear, as § 666 was designed to cover the situation in which \"even though title to the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such program funds.\" <i>Cicco,</i> 938 F.2d at 445 (quoting S.Rep. No. 225, at 369 (1983), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510).</p>\n<p>[26]  This is consistent with <i>United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> 361 F.3d 29, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2004), in which we vacated a restitution order requiring the defendant, who had been convicted under § 666(a)(1)(A), to compensate HUD for intentionally misapplied funds. There, we emphasized that even though the defendant had intentionally misapplied the funds, the work that the funds were meant to pay for had actually been completed, a fact pointed out by the government's own witness. <i>Id.</i> at 42. In light of the lack of evidence as to any actual loss, ordering restitution under these circumstances would, we found, \"be an unfair windfall to HUD.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, however, although the misapplied funds were arguably used for the benefit of the Tribe, they were used in contravention of their specified purposes.</p>\n<p>[27]  In his opening brief, Parisi contested the inclusion of $229,000 from count eleven, claiming that he had been acquitted on that count. The government pointed out that Parisi was in fact convicted on count eleven. Parisi conceded the point in his reply brief, but then substituted a challenge to the $30,000 COPS grant instead.</p>\n<p>[28]  <i>Vaknin</i> interpreted the predecessor to the MVRA, the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\"VWPA\"). However, we have noted that \"the causation language of the MVRA is the same as that in the VWPA, making it appropriate for us to turn to <i>Vaknin</i> for guidance\" in interpreting the MVRA. <i>United States v. Cutter,</i> 313 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002). There is a further wrinkle, however, insofar as the VWPA was amended after <i>Vaknin</i> to clarify that restitution may be ordered for harms caused not just by a defendant personally, but also by his or her co-conspirators as well, at least so long as those harms were \"reasonably foreseeable.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Collins,</i> 209 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1999). Similar language is contained in the MVRA. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). Nevertheless, even if the eligible sources of harm are more numerous now than they were under <i>Vaknin,</i> this is a distinct issue from what it takes to count as having <i>caused</i> the harm, on which <i>Vaknin</i> remains authoritative.</p>\n<p>[29]  As noted above, we vacate Parisi's conviction on this count on grounds of insufficient evidence that he knew the forms to be false.</p>\n<p>[30]  To be clear, we do not base our conclusion here on our holding that the evidence was insufficient to convict Parisi for knowingly making false statements to HHS. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. 148, 156, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (noting, in a pre-<i>Booker</i> Guidelines case, that \"application of the preponderance standard at sentencing generally satisfies due process.\") Our conclusion is based on First Circuit precedent as to which harms are compensable under the MVRA.</p>\n<p>[31]  The operative statutory language of the VWPA, at issue in <i>Neal</i> and <i>Collins,</i> is identical to that of the MVRA, applicable here. <i>Compare </i><i>Neal,</i> 36 F.3d at 1200 (discussing VWPA), <i>and </i><i>Collins,</i> 209 F.3d at 2-3 (same), <i>with</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2) (MVRA).</p>\n<p>[32]  The parenthetical reads, \"Parisi advised that he never transferred any money from a federally-funded account to an account outside the control of the [Tribe]. He only transferred federal funds between [Tribe]-controlled accounts, and always at the Governor's direction.

Defendants Robert Newell, the former governor of the Tribe, and James Parisi, Jr., the Tribe's former finance director, were convicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 371, as well as violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 287, 666 and 669, involving the misuse of federal grant and tribal monies. On appeal, Newell and Parisi raise a host of issues related to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> federal court's jurisdiction over \"internal tribal matters,\" the sufficiency of the evidence, the lower court's jury instructions, sentencing, and the restitution order entered against them. For the reasons explained below, we vacate Parisi's conviction on count five and remand for clarification of certain issues related to the restitution order, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The following facts are drawn from the parties' filings supplemented by the record as necessary, and are presented in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Poulin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182471\"><a href=\"/opinion/182471/united-states-v-poulin/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2011).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>The Passamaquoddy Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe located in northern Maine.<sup>[1]</sup> The Tribe is relatively small, with fewer than seven hundred residents. It relies in large part on federal grant and contract money for its financial survival. During the period of time at issueroughly, September 2002 to September 2006, i.e., Newell's tenure as tribal governorthe Tribe received between five and eight million dollars annually in federal grants and contracts.</p>\n<p>The Tribe's political leadership consists of a governor and tribal council. In addition, the Tribe shares a 12-member joint tribal council with its sister reservation in Princeton, Maine. Council members receive no official salary, but many are employed by the tribal government in other capacities, are reimbursed for travel expenses, and receive \"honoraria\" that approximate a salaried employee's vacation pay. The tribal government provides administrative services to the tribal programs, including bookkeeping and accounting services.</p>\n<p>The Tribe receives funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") and the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") through the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. These grants are used to fund myriad tribal services, including the police, fire, child welfare and wildlife and parks departments, the housing authority, the Tribe's courts and schools, and the Indian health center. The Tribe additionally receives funding from HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (\"SAMHSA\") for an HIV awareness and substance abuse prevention program. The Tribe received a Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") COPS program grant for police equipment and training, as well as funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") for its environmental department and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") for its housing authority. Each of the federal contracts and grants included terms and conditions specifying how they were to be used. Generally, the contracts required the Tribe to use the funds to pay for allowable direct costs of the identified programs, as well as specified amounts of the indirect costs incurred by the tribal government for administrative services. The awarded funds generally could not be diverted for non-contract or grant purposes without a contract amendment or agency approval.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> In addition to the federal grants and contracts, the Tribe had income from its ownership interests \"in three companies [Dragon Cement, Creative Apparel and Northeast Blueberry Company] that it purchased with money it received under the Indian Claims Settlement Act.\" This income was on the order of \"several million dollars . . . annually.\"</p>\n<p>Newell served as the Tribe's governor from 1986 to 1993, and again from 2002 to 2006. Newell served as his own finance director for the first year of his most recent term, but in the fall of 2003 he hired Parisi to fill the position. Parisi had worked as a banker but did not have experience with federal contracts. In addition to Parisi, the finance department was composed of several bookkeepers and a federal grant compliance officer, Linda Lewey. Despite his official job title, Parisi appeared to have had little actual authority, and would refer most questions to Newell. There is also evidence that Parisi may have been somewhat ostracized by at least some of his co-workers as he was not a member of the Tribe.</p>\n<p>During his tenure as governor, Newell exercised extensive control over tribal governance in general, and the Tribe's finances in particular. Newell would transfer funds between the various accounts to pay for unauthorized expenses, including salaries for individuals who did not actually work for the programs that were funding them. Newell also caused the Tribe's various programs to \"loan\" hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to the Tribe which he then disbursed in the form of \"general assistance\" to Tribe members, including friends, family and political supporters.<sup>[3]</sup> These loans were by and large never repaid.</p>\n<p>We now sketch briefly the details of the transactions relevant to the current appeals, leaving aside those uncontested on appeal. Our discussion is somewhat condensed in light of the large multitude of transactions, which were spread over a number of years, involved a large cast of supporting characters, several distinct funding sources, and the arcana of accounting practices for federal grants and contracts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The financial mismanagement</h2>\n<p>In 2003, the Tribe received a three-year, $350,000-per-year grant from SAMHSA to fund its HIV and substance abuse program, known as the Wonahkik program. The Wonahkik program ramped up slowly. Roger Paul, the Wonahkik program coordinator, testified at trial that the program did not \"get a staff to start getting things actually done\" until January of 2004. As of October of 2003, the program had only spent $86,354 of the $350,000 grant. In September, Newell and Elizabeth Neptune, the director of the health center, wrote to SAMHSA requesting permission to carry over the remainder into the next fiscal year. In October, Faye Socobasin, the Tribe's SAMHSA bookkeeper, filed a \"269\" form with SAMHSA showing that the Tribe had $236,645 in unspent grant funds. Lewey, the Tribe's federal grant compliance officer, signed off on the form. Parisi was hired at around this time.</p>\n<p>In February 2004, before SAMHSA had responded to the request, Newell directed that the unspent funds be used to reimburse the Tribe for salaries it had paid to three tribal councilors despite the fact that they did not actually work for the Wonahkik <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> program.<sup>[4]</sup> Newell insisted that the grant money \"had to be spent,\" and that if the Wonahkik program wasn't going to spend it, \"the Tribe would.\" Socobasin, at Lewey's instruction, then prepared a journal entry form for the Tribe's records indicating that the three individuals had been paid out of the SAMHSA grant on or before September 30, 2003, the last day of the fiscal year. Parisi signed the journal entry.</p>\n<p>When SAMHSA notified the Tribe in April 2004 that it would not permit the unused funds to be rolled over, Newell wrote back, stating, among other things, that the Tribe's initial 269 report had been in error, and that the Tribe had spent an additional $129,044 of the SAMHSA grant in salary expenditures in FY 2003. Subsequently, Socobasin prepared a revised 269 form reflecting the additional $129,044 expenditures, again dated to appear as if they had occurred in September of 2003. Socobasin refused to backdate the charges unless either Parisi or Newell approved it. Parisi, rather than Lewey, subsequently signed the revised 269 form. Newell told Socobasin that Parisi should sign the revised 269 \"so we can blame it all on him.\" In June 2004, SAMHSA relented, and approved the Tribe's request to roll over the unused grant funds.</p>\n<p>It was during this time that the tribal council learned that the Tribe's budget had been overspent to the tune of $1.6 million. At a contentious council meeting, Newell admitted he had been using SAMHSA funds to pay council members, but insisted he had the authority to do so. The council voted to strip Newell of administrative authority, but backtracked when it came out that this meant they would no longer receive general assistance payments. The council insisted that subsequent checks, with the exception of payroll and housing authority checks, be signed by two council members. Undeterred and largely unimpeded, Newell was able to secure the cooperation of sympathetic council members or, in other cases, circumvent the council entirely by transferring funds through online or wire transfers.</p>\n<p>The Tribe continued to pay the salaries of council members and other non-health center \"ghost\" employees with the health center's funds throughout FY 2004. Wonahkik was not the only program that saw its budget raided. Funds were \"loaned\" to the tribal government from the Indian Health Services (\"IHS\") contract, state Medicaid payments, and EPA and BIA grants. Several of the tribal health services administrators objected, but Newell and Parisi continued to authorize the payments. Parisi promised that the non-employees would be taken off the health center's payroll, and that the funds would be restored. When pressed by Paul about the missing funds, Parisi replied that it was \"normal\" for Tribes to use incoming grant money to pay pressing non-grant related bills, and to replenish the funds later with other income, an explanation that Paul conceded he found \"reasonable.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the earlier troubles, SAMHSA approved funding for the Wonahkik grant for a second year. This time around, however, SAMHSA required that the Tribe submit itemized claims for approved expenses. Thus, when Parisi requested $81,779 in reimbursement from SAMHSA in February of 2005, the claim was denied because it was not correctly itemized. Parisi resubmitted correctly itemized forms to SAMHSA in March, but because the requested amount included the salaries <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> of individuals who did not work for Wonahkik, SAMHSA ultimately refused to pay for those claims.</p>\n<p>Neither Newell nor Parisi was accused of lining their own pockets. (Parisi appears to have been motivated mostly by a desire to retain his employment with the Tribe). Newell, however, did improperly redirect federal grant money to help friends and family. For instance, shortly after Newell took office in the fall of 2002, he refused to release funds that the BIA had awarded the Tribe through its Housing Improvement Program. Instead, he spent the money on his friends, family, and tribal council members and their families, including William Nicholas, the Tribe's current governor. Similarly, in June of 2004, Newell had Carol Roehrich, the Tribe's BIA bookkeeper, issue his son, Roger, a check for $1020, ostensibly to reimburse Roger for the costs of attending training in Boston. Alex Nichols, Roger's supervisor, knew that Roger did not attend training in Boston and asked Roger to return the money. Newell insisted that Roger needed help, and the funds were never repaid. On other occasions, Newell dipped into Housing Authority funds for wedding donations, unspecified small loans, travel reimbursement for his son, Eric, and \"general assistance\" for two other Tribe members.</p>\n<p>Despite his efforts to keep the political wheels well-greased, by the spring of 2005, Newell was facing increasing opposition to his leadership. Several of the health center administratorsincluding Roger Paul, the head of Wonahkik, and Elizabeth Neptune, the health center's directorparticipated in an anti-Newell protest and went to federal investigators with their complaints. Newell responded by cleaning house, firing Paul, Neptune and three other health center administrators. Bookkeepers who protested the interfund \"loans\" found themselves suspended. Newell then reassured Don Payne, the new head of the health center, that although health center funds were being used for other purposes, the funds would be restored.</p>\n<p>The misapplication of funds continued apace, and the Tribe's financial situation deteriorated further. As of the fall of 2005, the Tribe owed $866,000 to the BIA and IHS grants. The Tribe had budgeted $621,000 in \"tribal assistance\" in FY 2005, but had spent nearly three times that amount. Newell continued to try to cover the Tribe's costs by \"borrowing\" money from the incoming federal grants, and Parisi continued to offer assurances to the affected programs that the funds would be repaid. Although some of the non-employees who had been drawing salaries from the grants were finally removed at this point, some remained, and others were added on.</p>\n<p>Newell and Parisi received multiple warnings at around this time that their conduct was of questionable legality. In early 2005, the Tribe's outside auditor warned them that \"pooling\" federal funds was permissible, but that the funds should only be used for allowable purposes, a point reiterated by Lewey, the federal grant compliance officer, and Roehrich, the BIA bookkeeper.<sup>[5]</sup> Harry Schade, a former finance director for the Tribe, was brought back in June of 2005 to help Newell <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> and Parisi sort out the Tribe's increasingly desperate finances. However, Schade's repeated demands that non-approved employees be taken off the health center's payroll were ignored.</p>\n<p>Newell and Parisi were also put on notice by warnings from various federal officials. IHS officials confronted Newell and Parisi in August 2005 about delinquent audits and interfund transfers. Despite the fact that Schade and Payne had asked the IHS not to release the funds because Newell and Parisi were raiding the accounts, the IHS was satisfied with Newell and Parisi's assurances that the funds would not be misused and that they would conduct an audit. IHS then agreed to a lump sum wire transfer of $2,000,000 for FY 2006. Within a week, over $400,000 had been diverted to the tribal government at Newell's direction. Newell and Parisi directed the health center to \"loan\" the tribal government a further $200,000 over the next two months. In a by-now-familiar scene, Schade protested and was subsequently fired. IHS officials began inquiring as to why so little of the grant funds remained, but were rebuffed by Newell.</p>\n<p>One of the \"loans\" in question occurred in November of 2005. At this point in time, the Tribe, together with its sister Pleasant Point reservation, was engaged in an effort to place a referendum question on the 2007 ballot asking for approval of a combined race track and casino, otherwise known as a Racino. The Joint Tribal Council hired an outside firm to solicit the necessary signatures to ensure that the question was placed on the ballot. Newell realized that the Tribe lacked the funds to pay for its share of the expenses and so decided once again to dip into his federal slush fund, a/k/a the health center budget. Parisi transmitted Newell's request to Frances Neptune, the IHS bookkeeper, who drew up a check for $33,000. After the payment was approved by two tribal council members, it was picked up by Joseph Socobasin, the Tribe's lieutenant governor and delivered to the Joint Tribal Council. This money was never returned to the health center.</p>\n<p>As he neared the end of his term, Newell must have realized that the game was up, as the Tribe's financial situation had become increasingly precarious at the same time that federal investigators were closing in on him. In the spring of 2006, the situation had become so dire that in order to meet the Tribe's payroll obligations, Newell directed Parisi to transfer funds from the tribal employees' 401K account, and directed the account bookkeeper not to file the mandatory report with the company that managed the 401K program. Parisi also directed the payroll clerk to pay only net salaries, meaning that state and federal tax withholdings, 401K contributions, state garnishments for child support or back taxes, and rent (for those employees who lived in HUD housing) were not paid. Among the sources tapped to cover payroll was a DOJ COPS grant for the Tribe's police department. The grant's remaining $30,000 of unspent funds was pressed into service to meet the Tribe's payroll obligations. When Newell left office in September, after losing the election to William Nicholas, the Tribe only had enough money left to pay one person's salaryNewell's.</p>\n<p>When Newell stepped down as governor, \"the Tribe's employees had not been paid in two weeks, worker's compensation payments had not been made, vendors and programs were owed over $3 million, and the Tribe owed federal programs $1.7 to $1.8 million.\" In addition, the health centerregularly raided by Newellhad outstanding debts of approximately $850,000. An audit subsequently revealed that the Tribe had no cash available, owed other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> funds approximately $1.6 million, lost $2 million from its general fund, and had once again overspent its general assistance budget by approximately $1.1 million.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2008, Newell and Parisi were charged by indictment with thirty counts of misapplying federal funds, making false statements to federal agencies, submitting false claims, and misapplying retirement, police, housing authority and other program funds, as well as conspiracy to defraud the United States.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Trial</h2>\n<p>At trial, Newell argued that he believed in good faith that he had the authority to act as he did, and that his intent had been to help the Tribe's impoverished and needy residents. Parisi argued that he was an outsider who simply did as Newell instructed. The jury found Newell guilty of all counts except count 10, and found Parisi guilty of counts 1, 5, 8, 9, 11-15, 29 and 30. Both defendants moved for acquittal, and Parisi moved for a new trial. Both defendants' motions were denied by the district court.</p>\n<p>Newell's guideline range was determined to be 151 to 188 months. The court sentenced him instead to concurrent 60 month terms on counts 2, 3, 7-9, 11, 29 and 30, and concurrent 31 month terms on counts 1, 4-6 and 12-28, followed by three years of supervised release. Parisi's guidelines range was determined to be 51-63 months. The court sentenced him to a year and a day, also followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA), codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3663, the court imposed a restitution order of $1,741,876.18 on Newell and $1,602,516.13 on Parisi, payable jointly and severally.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Did the district court have jurisdiction?</h2>\n<p>Newell, joined by Parisi, first contends that counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 fall outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Essentially, the appellants argue that the Passamaquoddy Tribe has negotiated agreements with the state of Maine and the federal government granting them exclusive jurisdiction over \"internal tribal matters,\" and that the conduct charged in counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 should be understood as such.</p>\n<p>We note that the parties appear to have conflicting understandings of the nature of the claim being raised. The government appears to construe the claim as one of \"tribal sovereign immunity,\" and contends that Parisi, at least, has waived any such claim. Parisi, for his part, insists that the argument instead concerns our subject matter jurisdiction, and hence avoids the \"[o]rdinary raise-or-waive rules\" which the government seeks to enforce against him. <i>See </i><i>Caban Hernandez v. Philip Morris</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>USA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202726\"><a href=\"/opinion/202726/caban-hernandez-v-phillip-morris-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2007).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>As we have noted, an \"objection to subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable and may be raised for the first time on appeal.\" <i>F.A.C., Inc. v.

Even if the same claims were presented below as a sovereign immunity defense, this does not preclude the defendants from appealing to them, now, to challenge our jurisdiction. Our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>Miller v. Nichols,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381882\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381882/miller-v-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 58-59 (1st Cir.2009) (\"The existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction . . . [is a] question[] of law, subject to <i>de novo</i> review in this court.\").</p>\n<p>Relations between the Tribe and the state and federal government are governed by an agreement that the parties arrived at after the Passamaquoddy filed suit in the 1970s, asserting claims to nearly two-thirds of Maine's land mass. The Tribe and the state of Maine eventually reached a settlement, in which the Tribe \"in many respects gained the powers of a municipality under Maine law.\" <i>Akins v. Penobscot Nation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197651\"><a href=\"/opinion/197651/akins-v-penobscot-indian/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 484 (1st Cir.1997). The settlement granted the Tribe recognition under federal law as a tribe, as well as entitlement to a portion of the income from an $81.5 million settlement fund established by Congress. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. §§ 1723-24. In exchange, the Tribe's claims to Maine's territory were extinguished, and the Tribe agreed that \"with very limited exceptions,\" it was \"subject to the laws of Maine.\" <i>Akins,</i> 130 F.3d at 485; <i>see also </i><i>Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760464\"><a href=\"/opinion/760464/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1547-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45736-75-empl/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 708 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that \"Maine was permitted to extend its jurisdiction over the Nation to a greater degree than most states exercise over other Indian Tribes\"). The agreement between the Tribe and the state of Maine was memorialized in the Act to Implement the Maine Indian Claims Settlement, 30 M.R.S.A. §§ 6201-14 (the \"Implementing Act\"). The Implementing Act was subsequently ratified by Congress in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, at 25 U.S.C. §§ 1721-35 (the \"Settlement Act\").</p>\n<p>Section 6206 of the Implementing Act states, in material part, that \"internal tribal matters, including . . . tribal organization, tribal government, tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\" 30 M.R.S.A. § 6206. This limitation on state jurisdiction was incorporated into the federal Settlement Act by reference. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1725(f) (\"The Passamaquoddy Tribe . . . [is] hereby authorized to exercise jurisdiction, separate and distinct from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State of Maine, to the extent authorized by the Maine Implementing Act, and any subsequent amendments thereto.\"). We have interpreted the Settlement Act to interpose a bar to federal jurisdiction over \"internal tribal matters.\" <i>See </i><i>Akins,</i> 130 F.3d at 485 (\"[T]he Nation in certain capacities functions as a municipality of Maine and is reachable under state and federal law in that capacity, but when it functions as a tribe as to internal tribal matters, it is not.\").</p>\n<p>The operative question is, accordingly, whether the conduct alleged in counts 1, 2, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> 29 and 30 constitute \"internal tribal matters.\" Newell's argument is that the government's attempt to enforce 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A) against him reaches \"internal tribal matters\" because \"the allocation of tribal money amongst tribal accounts only affects tribal members, not nonmembers\" and concerns only matters of \"tribal organization, tribal government, and the use or disposition of settlement fund income.\"<sup>[9]</sup> He argues that \"[f]ederal jurisdiction over these allegations would be contrary to the purpose of the Settlement Acts, which is to allow the Tribe to handle internal tribal matters, particularly internal government matters.\"</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Newell neglects to mention that Congress specifically exempted the Tribe from several federal criminal statutes in the Settlement Actbut that § 666 is not one of those exempted. <i>See</i> 25 U.S.C. § 1725(c). Indeed, Congress specifically <i>included</i> Indian Tribes within the ambit of § 666(a), which explicitly applies to agents of \"Indian tribal government.\" These observations suggest that assertion of federal jurisdiction over counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 was not improper.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Although \"tribes generally retain the right to self-government, [they] are nonetheless subject to federal criminal jurisdiction of both a specified and more general nature.\" <i>United States v. Boots,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196657\"><a href=\"/opinion/196657/united-states-v-boots/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 593 (1st Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted). In <i>Boots,</i> the defendants were accused, <i>inter alia,</i> of defrauding the Passamaquoddy Reservation of the honest services of their police chief by attempting to bribe him. One of the defendants claimed that he should have been acquitted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> \"in deference to tribal sovereignty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 592. We rejected this claim, noting that the violations he was charged with \"are not specific to Native Americans, but rather are of general applicability,\" and that even if such crimes \"may involve `an independent federal interest to be protected,' . . . it is unclear that one is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 593 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Conspiring to defraud the United States and misapplying federal funds are, like the crimes defined by the wire fraud statute at issue in <i>Boots,</i> crimes of general applicability. Therefore, even were we to accept Newell's claim that there is no federal interest in how the Tribe transfers its money between its accounts, it is not clear that any \"peculiarly federal interest\" is in fact required for such a statute to apply to the Tribe. <i>Id.,</i> 80 F.3d at 593. Moreover, a less tendentious description of Newell's conduct would in any case suggest that there may well be a relevant federal interest, viz. an interest in ensuring that federal grants and contracts are spent in the way the government intends them to be spent. As the Supreme Court has held, when federal agencies spend taxpayer dollars, Congress has an interest in ensuring that this money is \"not frittered away in graft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned off.\" <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134745\"><a href=\"/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134745\"><a href=\"/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span> (2004) (rejecting claim that § 666(a)(2)the anti-bribery portion of the statute at issue hererequired proof of a nexus between the federal funds received and the alleged bribe). When \"money can be drained off here because a federal grant is pouring in there . . . [i]t is certainly enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 606, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134745\"><a href=\"/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, despite rather mysterious invocations of tribal self-governance, Newell has not managed to explain how holding him, <i>qua</i> governor of a Tribe that received millions of dollars a year in federal financial assistance, criminally responsible for extensive misuse of federal funds would interfere with a \"right integral to self-government.\" <i>Boots,</i> 80 F.3d at 593.</p>\n<p>Finally, in <i>Akins,</i> a case about a tribe's timber harvesting policies, we emphasized five factors that were \"strong considerations\" to take into account in deciding whether a dispute about tribal practices constitutes an internal tribal matter. <i>Akins,</i> 130 F.3d at 486-87. These factors are (1) whether the practice in question \"purports to regulate only members of the tribe,\" or if \"the interests of non-members\" are \"at issue\"; (2) whether it \"regulates the very land that defines the territory of the Nation\"; (3) whether it concerns the use of a natural resource derived from the land; (4) whether it \"implicate[s] or impair[s] any interest of the state of Maine\"; and (5) whether construing the challenged practice as an internal tribal matter \"is consistent with prior legal understandings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 486-87. Applying these factors to the current case reveals the following. First, the interests of non-membersat the very least, those of the federal agencies in ensuring that the funds they award are properly spentare clearly implicated. Second, the funds at issue include state funds (count 10 alleged misuse of state Medicaid funds). Finally, as our discussion has just indicated, prior legal understandings support our finding that the challenged conduct does not constitute an internal tribal matter.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Because the conduct alleged in counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 involves mismanagement of federal grants and contracts, which are subject to regulations that the Tribe is not free to ignore, we hold that the conduct alleged in these counts do not constitute internal tribal matters. We emphasize that the case before us rests on malfeasance involving federal grant money, in which the federal interest is clear. It would be a different case if the counts attempted to apply § 666 to mismanagement of settlement fund income. We express no opinion as to whether such a prosecution would or would not implicate the internal tribal matters exception to federal jurisdiction under the Implementing and Settlement Acts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Was the evidence sufficient?</h2>\n<p>We now turn to Parisi's contentions that the evidence failed, in several key respects, to sufficiently support the jury's verdict. \"We review a sufficiency claim <i>de novo,</i> drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict to determine whether a rational jury could find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203780\"><a href=\"/opinion/203780/united-states-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Count 1</h2>\n<p>Parisi challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction under count one, for conspiracy to misapply government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A), and to misapply the funds and assets of a health care program, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 669.<sup>[12]</sup> To prove its case, the government had to show beyond a reasonable doubt that \"(1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the defendant knew of and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy; and (3) there was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Munoz-Franco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202748\"><a href=\"/opinion/202748/united-states-v-munoz-franco/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Parisi challenges his conspiracy conviction under heading (1). Parisi argues that a conspiracy consists of an agreement between two or more individuals to disregard or disobey the law, <i>United States v. Drougas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1984), and that simply doing what his employer asked of him was insufficient to establish such an \"agreement.\" The question is thus whether the evidence was sufficient to allow a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Parisi and Newell came to an agreement to \"disregard or disobey\" §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669, i.e., the statutes prohibiting the misapplication of government funds generally and the funds and assets of a health care benefit program specifically.</p>\n<p>We have noted in similar circumstances that \"[a] formal agreement [between co-conspirators] is not required; rather `[t]he agreement may be shown by a concert of action, all the parties working together understandingly, with a single design for the accomplishment of a common purpose.'\" <i>Munoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 45-46 (internal citation omitted) (quoting <i>Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472145\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472145/american-tobacco-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 107 (6th Cir.1944)). In that case, employees of a bank and a development company were convicted for conspiring under 18 U.S.C. § 371 to commit bank fraud, misapply bank funds and make false entries in the books and records of the bank. <i>Id.</i> at 45. We dismissed their sufficiency of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> evidence challenge, noting that the two bank officials \"directly supervised\" and \"worked closely with\" the developer's loans, that the developer and his employee \"submitted many certifications for work not yet completed,\" that one of the bank officials \"repeatedly approved\" those certifications, that the same bank official \"met frequently\" with the developer's employee regarding the status of their business ventures, and that the bank officials failed to disclose material information to the bank's Board of Directors. We held that this was sufficient to allow a jury to infer an agreement among the four defendants to defraud the bank. <i>Id.</i> at 46.</p>\n<p>The nature of the evidence in this case is similar. The evidence presented at trial showed, for instance, that Newell channeled money from the accounts of various federally funded programs into non-approved uses. These \"interfund transfers\" were recorded as \"loans,\" and while some were ultimately repaid, others were not. Some of these expenditures went toward paying payroll and general assistance, as well as the salaries of \"ghost employees,\" individuals who either no longer worked at the various grant-funded programs, or did not work for the time claimed. Parisi signed off on financial status reports filed with the federal agencies that were funding the programs, certifying that the money was spent in accordance with the grant's terms. Parisi was well aware that the grant money could not be used indiscriminately; indeed, he was repeatedly told as much by the fund administrators themselves. Nevertheless, Parisi continued to divert federal grant funds, including funds provided by SAMHSA intended for the Tribe's health center, to payroll and tribal government expenses. Parisi promised bookkeepers at these federally-funded programs that the ghost employees would be removed from payroll, but that did not happen. Similarly, Parisi assured the manager of the Tribe's health center (funded by federal SAMHSA grants) that the diverted funds would be repaid, although very little ultimately was. This conduct persisted for a period of nearly three years.</p>\n<p>The evidence presented against Parisi was sufficient to establish that even if there was no express agreement with Newell, nonetheless there was an implied or tacit agreement. Newell ordered that federal funds be misapplied and Parisi saw that they were. This was the requisite \"concert of action\" evincing a \"common purpose.\" <i>See </i><i>Munoz-Franco,</i> 487 F.3d at 45-46. We will not disturb the jury's verdict as to count one.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Count 5</h2>\n<p>Parisi next contends that he was improperly convicted under count five, which alleged that he made a materially false statement with regard to how $215,599.43 of a SAMHSA grant intended for the Tribe's Wonahkik substance abuse and HIV prevention programs was spent. Parisi signed and submitted a \"financial status report\" with HHS claiming this amount was spent in accordance with grant purposes. In reality, $129,044.67 was spent to pay \"ghost employees\"Dennis Tomah, Sr., Dana Newell, and John Stevenswho did not work for those programs during the relevant time period. Parisi's claims on appeal are, first, that the government's evidence did not prove that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> his submission was \"knowing[] and willful[]\" as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) and, second, that the form was in any case not \"material\" as it was improperly filled out.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>\"To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the government must prove that the defendant knowingly and willfully made or used a false writing or document, in relation to a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States government, with knowledge of its falsity.\" <i>United States v. McGauley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776395\"><a href=\"/opinion/776395/united-states-v-karen-m-mcgauley/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.2002). \"Willfulness . . . means nothing more in this context than that the defendant knew that his statement was false when he made it or . . . consciously disregarded or averted his eyes from its likely falsity.\" <i>United States v. Gonsalves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202028\"><a href=\"/opinion/202028/united-states-v-gonsalves/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Parisi contends that the government produced no evidence showing that he knew that Tomah, Newell and Stevens had not worked in the Wonahkik program during the specified time. The form referenced a period of time prior to Parisi's employment at the reservation, and the jury acquitted Parisi of actually misapplying those particular funds (count three).</p>\n<p>An examination of the trial transcript reveals the following: at trial, Faye Socobasin (the tribal bookkeeper who actually filled out the form that Parisi later signed) was asked by the prosecutor if she had conversed with \"either\" Parisi or Newell about the inappropriate use of the funds. She said she had, and the prosecutor continued, \"so you did have a conversation with Robert Newell about this?\" to which she replied, \"Yes.\" The prosecutor then asked if she discussed the matter with Parisi, and she replied that \"with Jim Parisi, Iwhat I can remember is I just did the 269 [the financial status report] and told him that it had to be signed.\" The prosecutor then went on to establish that Parisi in fact signed the 269 form.</p>\n<p>Three days later, Linda Lewey, the Tribe's federal grant compliance officer, testified that Parisi was present at two meetings during which the issue of what to do about the unused money in the SAMHSA grant was discussed. The first meeting was apparently in December of 2003, when the decision was taken to request permission from HHS to \"roll over\" the unused money into the next fiscal year's budget. Lewey appears not to have been questioned as to what, specifically, transpired at the second meeting. As before, the prosecutor moved immediately to discuss whether Parisi had in fact signed off on the fraudulent financial reports.</p>\n<p>The most specific testimony on the issue of Parisi's knowledge of the falsehoods contained in the 269 form appears to have been provided by Roger Paul, the Wonahkik program coordinator. The prosecutor asked Paul whether he ever discussed payment of non-program employees with Parisi. His reply was: \"I don't remember that issue exactly. There were many occasions I spoke to Mr. Parisi, and there was one occasion I spoke to Mr. Parisi about the finances, and I remember Mr. Parisi saying, well, that's what Governor Newell wants done, and that's why we're doing it this way.\" However, this statement is ambiguous in at least two key respects. First, Paul testified only that he discussed \"finances\" with Parisi. And, second, it is unclear <i>when</i> Paul had this conversation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> with Parisi. Even if Paul's testimony is sufficient to show that Parisi knew of the unauthorized use of SAMHSA funds, if the revelation occurred after the false 269 form had already been filed, it would shed little light on the crucial question of whether Parisi knew the form to be false <i>at the time of filing.</i></p>\n<p>The evidence the government amassed as to Parisi's guilt on count five clearly establishes that Parisi signed the 269 form, and that the 269 form misrepresented that certain expenses were properly charged to the SAMHSA grant. However, the evidence as to whether Parisi at this point knew that the information he was filing was materially incorrectthat Tomah, Newell and Stevens had not worked for Wonahkik in FY 2003appears to be skimpy at best. The time period in question was prior to Parisi's employment with the Tribe, and we see no reason to believe that he knew, within a few months of his arrival, where every tribal member had worked in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, of course, the inference of knowledge becomes increasingly pressing as Parisi became more and more deeply involved with, and received warning after warning about, Newell's on-going financial tomfoolery.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one could conclude from the evidence presented that it was possible that Parisi knew the 269 form to contain false statements. But we do not see how a reasonable person could view the evidence as establishing such knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we find that the evidence was not sufficient to convict Parisi under count 5.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Counts 12-15</h2>\n<p>Parisi was convicted of counts 12-15, which assert that Parisi filed fraudulent claims for reimbursement to SAMHSA officials in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2005, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 287.<sup>[16]</sup> Parisi challenges his convictions on these counts because he claims that the government failed to prove that the forms at issue were material. They were not material, Parisi claims, because one of themthe form underlying count 12was returned to him \"because it was not in a format in which [HHS] was willing to review it,\" and because the government did not pay the claims listed on the forms underlying counts 13-15.</p>\n<p>The plain language of § 287 makes no mention of materiality as an element of the offense. Parisi argues that we should nevertheless read materiality into the statute, as the Eighth and Fourth Circuits have done. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Adler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379265\"><a href=\"/opinion/379265/united-states-v-kenneth-adler/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span>, 1291 n. 5 (8th Cir.1980); <i>United States v.

In contrast, the Fifth, Ninth, Tenth and Second Circuits have held that § 287 does not require proof of the materiality of the false statement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Upton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723780\"><a href=\"/opinion/723780/united-states-v-antony-michael-upton-santa-barbara-castle-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 685 (5th Cir.1996); <i>United States v.

Finally, the Third Circuit has split the difference and concluded that materiality sometimes is, and sometimes is not, an element under § 287. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Saybolt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1233543\"><a href=\"/opinion/1233543/united-states-v-saybolt/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 200 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>This case does not require us to express a view as to whether materiality is an element under 18 U.S.C. § 287. This is because Parisi's claim cannot succeed either way. As we have noted in other statutory contexts, a statement need not actually deceive to qualify as \"material.\" Rather, \"materiality requires only that the fraud in question have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of affecting or influencing, a government function. The alleged concealment or misrepresentation need not have influenced the actions of the Government agency, and the Government agents need not have been actually deceived.\" <i>United States v.

The forms Parisi submitted were expressly designed to cause the SAMHSA administrators to pay on claims that were not authorized by the terms of the SAMHSA grant. Although the 270 form at issue in count twelve was returned to Parisi because it was improperly formatted, it contained the substance of the relevant false claims, which substance was re-submitted several days later in the correct format.<sup>[18]</sup> As our precedent on materiality makes clear, that SAMHSA administrators were not ultimately deceived into paying out on the fraudulent claims at issue in counts 12-15 does not bear on the materiality of the fraudulent misrepresentations. <i>Corsino,</i> 812 F.2d at 30. For these reasons, the evidence was sufficient to show that the misrepresentations contained on the forms underlying counts 12-15 were \"material.\"<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> D. Counts 1, 8, 9, 11, 29, 30</h2>\n<p>Finally, Parisi attacks his conviction under counts 1, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 on the grounds that the government failed to prove \"the necessary criminal intent of acting willfully.\" The relevant statutes are §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669; the former alleges that Parisi \"intentionally misapplie[d]\" property, whereas the latter alleges that he \"knowingly and willfully\" embezzled, stole or converted the assets of a health care benefit program. Parisi insists that he had \"no motive to disobey or disregard the law, as he gained no benefit from the transfers.\"</p>\n<p>Parisi's argument is that in order to obtain a conviction under either of these statutes, the government needed to show that he acted \"willfully,\" meaning that the government had to show that he acted with an illicit motive. <i>See </i><i>Bryan v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118227\"><a href=\"/opinion/118227/bryan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 192 n. 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118227\"><a href=\"/opinion/118227/bryan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span> (1998) (explaining that the term \"willful\" in a criminal statute \"generally means an act done with a bad purpose.\"). Parisi supports his contention by suggesting that when allegedly fraudulent acts are not \"themselves wrongful,\" then the government must additionally show illicit motive. <i>See </i><i>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Elder Care Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196723\"><a href=\"/opinion/196723/fdic-v-elder-care-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that \"[n]ormally, a party suggesting fraud or bad faith is expected to point to the <i>misconduct</i> (lies, rigged account books, self-dealing by a fiduciary) that reflects the bad faith or constitutes the fraud,\" but acknowledging that \"on some occasions the inference of fraud or bad faith might be compelled by the combination of motive and outcome.\").</p>\n<p>There appears to be scant law on the necessary <i>mens rea</i> under either §§ 666(a)(1)(A) or 669, and we do not attempt here to define the precise criminal intent required by these statutes. In particular, we do not express any view as to whether the government is required to prove a self-interested motive under either § 666(a)(1)(A) or § 669. It is sufficient for our purposes to note that, even if Parisi's argument were correct, the evidence presented was sufficient to support a finding of illicit motive. After all, Parisi evidently did have a \"motive to disobey or disregard the law,\" and derived a very concrete benefit from doing so: continued employment with the Tribe. Although not the direct beneficiary of the financial maneuvers he executed on Newell's behalf, Parisi benefitted indirectly by avoiding the fate of others who protested and subsequently found themselves out of a job. Thus, even if proof of an illicit motive or personal benefit was requiredan issue we do not resolve todaythe existence of such a motive or benefit was supportable from the facts. We discern no error in the jury's verdicts on this score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.

Wester,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196877\"><a href=\"/opinion/196877/united-states-v-wester/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 597 (1st Cir.1996) (rejecting challenge to <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction on grounds that in some cases \"some interplay between the jury's assessment of guilt on the substantive counts and the conspiracy charge is both natural and appropriate,\" and that \"the fact that substantive crimes were carried out by the defendants, following discussions between them, may well make the fact of agreement more likely\").</p>\n<p>As the government notes, the two <i>Pinkerton</i> instructions were not duplicative, but rather were addressed to two distinct sets of offensesthe misapplication of tribal funds in counts 29 and 30 and the misapplication of government and health care funds in counts 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Even if giving the instruction twice created a risk that the jury would improperly infer the existence of a conspiracy, there was a converse risk that failing to adequately instruct the jury that vicarious liability was available on these distinct sets of charges would itself have misled the jury. (The appellants do not contend that <i>Pinkerton</i> liability was in fact impermissible on either set of charges). Moreover, it is worth bearing in mind that the appellants were facing a thirty-count indictment, alleging violations of five separate statutes in dozens of transactions occurring over the span of approximately four years. The trial took eleven days, and the jury instructions alone occupy approximately forty pages in the trial transcript. Under these circumstances, it was well within the court's discretion to decide whether providing the <i>Pinkerton</i> instruction twice would serve to clarify or to confuse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> V. Were specific unanimity instructions required?</h2>\n<p>Many of the counts in the indictmentspecifically, counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30alleged multiple fraudulent transactions. Each of these counts listed multiple instances of the misapplication of funds occurring within discrete one-year windows. The appellants now object that the structure of the indictment was duplicitous and violated their right to a unanimous verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(a). The gist of the appellants' complaint is that counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 of the indictment allowed the jury to vote to convict even though they may have disagreed as to which specific acts of intentional misapplication were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Some of the jurors could have thought, for instance, that the appellants had intentionally misapplied funds on only a particular subset of occasions, whereas other jurors could have thought that they had misapplied funds on a different subset of occasions. Despite this disagreement, the jurors could still have all agreed that the government had proven that appellants had intentionally misapplied at least <i>some</i> funds, and voted to convict on that basis. The question is whether unanimity on that proposition would be sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p>Normally, \"[a] party's entitlement to a unanimity instruction presents a question of law,\" meaning that \"the district court's answer to that question engenders <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>United States v.

No one disputes that conviction requires unanimous agreement amongst the jurors. The issue is rather <i>what</i> it is that they must be unanimous <i>about.</i> This question is subtle and difficult, and raises two closely related sets of issues. The first is: when is a disputed facte.g., whether the crime occurred on a Monday or a Tuesday, with a knife or a gun, against this or that victimone that the jury must unanimously agree upon, and when is it merely dispensable detail? And the second is: when is a defendant's conduct one violation of a statute, and when is it many?</p>\n<p>Although the basic issue raised in this portion of the appeal concerns the second questionpotential duplicity in the indictmentthe government devotes substantial energy to resisting the appellants' argument on grounds that proof of a specific transaction is not an element under the relevant statutes. But, as we now explain, even if not always in the most perspicuous manner, our cases have distinguished between unanimity as to a crime's elements and unanimity as to a crime's instances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Unanimity as to a crime's elements</h2>\n<p>The government points us toward <i>United States v. Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200295\"><a href=\"/opinion/200295/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2003). In <i>Lee,</i> the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), which prohibited possession of \"fifteen or more. . . counterfeit or unauthorized access devices.\" Lee claimed that the jury was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> required to agree on which fifteen unauthorized credit cards he actually possessed. After considering the statutory text, relevant legal traditions, the structure of the law, its legislative history and implications for unfairness, <i>see </i><i>Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 37, we, on <i>de novo</i> review, rejected the claim and held that \"the identity of the particular devices possessed by a defendant is not an element\" under 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3). <i>Id.</i> at 40. We cautioned, however, that \"[a]scertainment of the level at which unanimity is required . . . tends to be offense-specific.\" <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>The government insists that <i>Lee</i> controls the outcome here as well. If so, then the appellants' claims are doomed. If a claim fails under <i>de novo</i> review, then it must of course also fail under plain error review. So the question is whether <i>Lee</i> governs. It does not.</p>\n<p>The government fails to appreciate that the appellants are not contending that the jury had to be given a specific unanimity instruction because proof of a specific transaction is an element of § 666(a)(1)(A), i.e., that the government must in every prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) show a single, unambiguous qualifying transaction. What the appellants are claiming is rather that the indictment brought against them bundled multiple discrete violations of the statute under single counts, meaning that, in the absence of a specific unanimity instruction, it is unclear which (if any) of the referenced crimes commanded the jury's unanimous assent. This claim is fundamentally not about the \"elements\" of § 666(a)(1)(A); it is about the <i>structure</i> of the indictment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Holley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567200\"><a href=\"/opinion/567200/united-states-v-jerry-don-holley/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span>, 927 (5th Cir.1991) (distinguishing alternative <i>mentes reae</i> for a single killing from \"the situation where a single count as submitted to the jury embraces two or more separate offenses, though each be a violation of the same statute\").<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>This latter issue was not broached in <i>Lee.</i> The statute at issue in <i>Lee,</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), defined the crime in terms of possession of \"fifteen or more\" unauthorized credit cards. The text of the statute thus supported our finding that the statute did not consist of \"fifteen acts of possessing an unauthorized credit card, but, rather, a single act of possession of fifteen such devices.\" <i>Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 39-40. As we noted, the starting point of the analysis was the text of the statute, and the statute in that case made it reasonably clear that \"Congress's emphasis was not on the identity of the actual items . . . but, rather, on the possession thereof.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38.</p>\n<p>Because § 1029(a)(3) defined an offense in terms of possession of \"fifteen or more\" unauthorized credit cards, it was clear that even if some of the jurors thought that Lee possessed <i>this</i> pile of cards while other jurors thought he possessed <i>that</i> pile, either way Lee could have committed no more, and no less, than a <i>single</i> violation of § 1029(a)(3). The same cannot be said of the indictment brought against Newell and Parisi.</p>\n<p>The government claims that the elements of an offense under § 666 are:</p>\n<blockquote>1) the defendant was an agent of an Indian tribal government; 2) who embezzled, stole, fraudulently obtained or willingly converted property worth at least $5000 of tribal property [sic]; and 3) did so during a time when the tribal government received more than $10,000 in any one year from a qualifying federal assistance program.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> Counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 of the indictment each contained descriptions of numerous transactions. With a few exceptions, each of these transactions would seem, on its face, to be enough to make out an independent violation of § 666(a)(1)(A). For instance, count two claimed that Newell was \"an agent\" of the Tribe, that the tribe \"received benefits in excess of $10,000 through contract, grants, and cooperative agreements with U.S. Departments and agencies,\" and that he \"intentionally misapplied\" the following funds: (1) approximately $50,130 from the BIA Housing Improvement Program, and (2) approximately $44,000 from the Indian Township Housing Authority. In light of the government's characterization of the elements of § 666(a)(1)(A), it appears that proof of either (1) or (2) would have been sufficient to make out a complete violation. It thus appears that the appellants have a point when they complain that the challenged counts presented \"two or more distinct violations of the same statute . . . lumped together in a single count,\" an allegation that the government, for its part, does not deny.</p>\n<p>But if it is true that, for instance, misapplying $50,130 in BIA funds and misapplying $44,000 of Indian Township Housing Authority funds constitute discrete violations of the statute, then count two did not allege two different ways of committing one and the same crime, as in <i>Lee,</i> but rather alleged two entirely distinct crimes. Under these circumstances, an undifferentiated guilty verdict on count two would leave it entirely unclear whether the jurors unanimously agreed (a) that Newell had misapplied the $50,130 in BIA funds; (b) that he had misapplied the $44,000 in Indian Township Housing Authority funds; (c) that he had misapplied both; or (d) that he had misapplied either the BIA or the Housing Authority funds, although they were not in agreement as to which. In short, if a specific unanimity instruction was required, it was not because proof of which specific funds were misapplied is an \"element\" under § 666(a)(1)(A), but because this indictment was duplicitous in consolidating multiple complete offenses under single counts. <i>Lee</i> did not address this issue, and does not govern this case.</p>\n<p>The government has insisted in this appeal that the bundled allegations merely specify \"alternate means of committing a crime,\" and therefore no specific unanimity instruction was required. As we have noted, it is true that a jury does not need to agree upon \"a single means of commission\" of a crime. <i>See </i><i>Schad v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112637\"><a href=\"/opinion/112637/schad-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 631, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112637\"><a href=\"/opinion/112637/schad-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, it does not follow from the fact that unanimity is not required with respect to alternative means of committing <i>one and the same</i> criminal act that unanimity is not required with respect to multiple instances of the same <i>type</i> of criminal act.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> B. Unanimity as to a crime's instances</h2>\n<p>The transactions detailed in counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 occurred on various dates and involved misapplications from various sources. Count two, for instance, merely specifies that at some point between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2003, Newell misapplied some funds from the BIA and also some other funds from the Indian Township Housing Authority. The question now is how many statutory violations the alleged conduct states.</p>\n<p>We cannot evade this question because the Supreme Court has indicated, on at least two separate occasions, that the jury is required to unanimously agree as to which instances of a crime the defendant committed. In <i>Schad,</i> the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to Arizona's murder statute, which permitted conviction on a theory of either premeditation or felony murder. In his concurrence, Justice Scalia concurred with the plurality largely on grounds of legal tradition, and disavowed the plurality's explanation for why \"it is permissible to combine in one count killing in the course of robbery and killing by premeditation.\" <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 651, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112637\"><a href=\"/opinion/112637/schad-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span> (Scalia, J., concurring). After all, despite their \"moral equivalence,\" Justice Scalia noted that \"[w]e would not permit . . . an indictment charging that the defendant assaulted either X on Tuesday or Y on Wednesday.\"<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Later, in <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 815, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span> (1999), the Court held that a jury must agree unanimously as to the individual violations making up the \"series of violations\" element under the federal continuing criminal enterprise statute (\"CCE\"), 21 U.S.C. § 848(a). The majority specifically cited Justice Scalia's warning in <i>Schad</i> as authority for the proposition that \"the Constitution itself limits a State's power to define crimes in ways that would permit juries to convict while disagreeing about means, at least where that definition risks serious unfairness and lacks support in history or tradition.\" <i>Id.</i> at 820, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We have described the type of indictment singled out by Justice Scalia in <i>Schad,</i> and subsequently emphasized in <i>Richardson,</i> as duplicitousthat is, as one that \"join[s] in a single count . . . two or more distinct and separate offenses.\" <i>United States v. Canas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364748\"><a href=\"/opinion/364748/united-states-v-jose-manuel-martinez-canas/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.1979). We must, therefore, now turn our attention squarely to the question of whether the transactions bundled under counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 were duplicitousthat is, whether they described distinct violations of §§ 666(a)(1)(A) and 669. If they did, then the failure to give specific unanimity instructions was error. If not, then not.</p>\n<p>Determining whether the challenged counts were duplicitous is no easy matter.<sup>[23]</sup> In some cases the standard for individuating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> crimes is obviouswe count murders, for instance, by counting bodies. But in other cases, determining how many crimes were committed is much less clear. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rivera Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511569\"><a href=\"/opinion/511569/united-states-v-raul-rivera-ramos-aka-raulito/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 422-23 (1st Cir.1988). The text of § 666 offers little guidance. Section 666(a)(1)(A) refers to \"property that is valued at $5000 or more and is owned by, or is under the care, custody or control of\" qualifying institutions. Section 669 refers to \"any of the moneys, funds, securities, premiums, credits, property, or other assets of a health care benefits program.\" Neither clearly specifies the baseline unit of prosecution. Although the statute is conditioned upon the organization's receipt of over $10,000 in benefits from a Federal program \"in any one year period,\" § 666(b), this is consistent with either (a) treating all qualifying transactions within a one-year period as aggregated together to state <i>one</i> offense under § 666(a)(1)(A), or (b) treating each qualifying transaction as an independent offense. The text of the statute thus fails to specify the allowable unit of prosecution.</p>\n<p>The legislative history of § 666 indicates that it was enacted as part of the Comprehensive Crime Bill of 1984, and that it was</p>\n<blockquote>designed to create new offenses to augment the ability of the United States to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and bribery involving Federal monies which are disbursed to private organizations or State and local governments pursuant to a Federal program.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v.

Nov. 4, 2008). We have previously held that the government may aggregate transactions occurring within a one-year time period in order to meet the $5000 jurisdictional minimum of § 666(a)(1)(A). <i>United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201519\"><a href=\"/opinion/201519/united-states-v-cruzado-laureano/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 484 (1st Cir.2005). <i>Cruzado-Laureano</i> relied on a case from the Sixth Circuit, <i>United States v. Sanderson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span>, 189 (6th Cir.1992), which concluded that aggregation to meet the jurisdictional minimum is permissible when the transactions are part of a single scheme. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Hines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1441559\"><a href=\"/opinion/1441559/united-states-v-hines/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 837 (8th Cir.2008) (interpreting aggregation of transactions for purpose of § 666 generally); <i>United States v.

These cases were concerned with the propriety of aggregation when the transactions involved sums which fell below the jurisdictional minimum and hence did not make out independent violations of § 666. However, one of the rationales for allowing aggregation under such circumstances is to ensure that poorly motivated officials do not evade liability under § 666 simply by stealing less than $5000 at a time. <i>See </i><i>Webb,</i> 691 F.Supp. at 1168; <i>Sanderson,</i> 966 F.2d at 189. Worries about opportunistic evasion of liability do not apply to transactions that involve sums larger than the statutory minimum. Since most of the bundled transactions in this case involved sums <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> greater than $5000, it is not clear whether this line of precedent would support the aggregation that occurred in this case. <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Urlacher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1907443\"><a href=\"/opinion/1907443/united-states-v-urlacher/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In <i>Verrecchia,</i> an undercover sting caught the defendant attempting to fence stolen firearms. When he was arrested, the police discovered weapons in both his truck and in the adjacent barn. Verrecchia was subsequently charged with (among other things) one count related to the two weapons found in the truck and another for the twenty-one weapons found in the barn, under the auspices of the federal felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 296.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span> (1955), and in part on the overwhelming consensus from other courts of appeals that \"the simultaneous possession of multiple firearms . . . constitutes only one crime.\" <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bell,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized the \"presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code against the imposition of harsher punishment.\" <i>Bell,</i> 349 U.S. at 83, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105299\"><a href=\"/opinion/105299/bell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, \"if Congress does not fix the punishment for a federal offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105299\"><a href=\"/opinion/105299/bell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>. Accordingly, after finding that the language of § 922(g)(1) (referring to \"any firearm\") was, like the language of the Mann Act at issue in <i>Bell</i> (18 U.S.C. § 2421, referring to \"any woman or girl\"), ambiguous as to the allowable unit of prosecution, and finding no indication of Congress's clear intent \"to treat each possession of a firearm as a separate violation,\" we applied <i>Bell</i> in holding that the government properly charged him with two offenses rather than twenty-threeone for the two guns found in the truck and the other for the twenty-one guns found in the shed. <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p>The government cites <i>Verrecchia</i> for the proposition that \"[w]here separate instances of the same act are grouped in a single count . . . there is no duplicity.\" This is a serious misunderstanding of <i>Verrecchia.</i> After all, on this view, the indictment in <i>Verrecchia</i> should have contained only <i>one</i> count, encompassing all twenty-three guns. But we quite clearly held that \"the indictment here correctly grouped the firearms into counts based on the place of possession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 298. Moreover, <i>Bell,</i> on which we relied, did not say that every instance of the same type of criminal act could be lumped together under one count. It said that, for the sake of lenity, a <i>single transaction</i> should not be split up into multiple offenses. The focus on the transaction as the unit of prosecution explains <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> why there were two counts in <i>Verrecchia,</i> rather than either one or twenty-three: possession of the guns in the truck counted as one transaction, and possession of the guns in the shed counted as another. Thus, <i>Verrecchia</i> permitted bundling of guns <i>by transaction,</i> not simply <i>qua</i> instances of the same type of criminal act. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Waldman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358028\"><a href=\"/opinion/358028/united-states-v-robert-waldman-and-david-e-dick/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 654 (1st Cir.1978) (identifying appropriate unit of prosecution under 15 U.S.C. § 77(q)a to be \"separate transactions accompanied by the use of the mails\"). <i>But see United States v. Campbell,</i> No. 90-1130, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">151318</span></span>, at *1-2 (1st Cir. July 19, 1990) (treating unit of prosecution under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) as possession of the \"individual firearm\").<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>But if, as we held in <i>Verrecchia,</i> the fact that some guns are stored in a shed and others in a truck parked next to it is sufficient to constitute two distinct transactions, then there is a compelling claim that misapplying funds from agency A in March and misapplying funds from agency B in July is <i>also</i> sufficient to constitute two distinct transactions. Thus, far from supporting the government's position, <i>Verrecchia</i> appears to seriously undermine it. In light of <i>Verrecchia,</i> insofar as the conduct aggregated under counts 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 involved distinct transactions, the counts must be deemed to bundle within their ambit multiple distinct violations of § 666(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>There is thus reason to believe that the indictment brought against Newell and Parisi was constitutionally infirm. For the only sense in which it is true that a duplicitous count merely specifies \"alternate means of committing\" some crime is in the sense in which it is true that an indictment that alleges that A killed B on Monday, C on Tuesday and D on Wednesday specifies \"alternate means\" of committing a single instance of the crime of murder. The Supreme Court has made quite clear that this form of indictment violates a defendant's right to a unanimous verdict. <i>See </i><i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 820, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2491</span></a></span> (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Other circuits have come to similar conclusions. In <i>United States v. Holley</i><i>,</i> the Fifth Circuit held that an indictment that charged counts of perjury on the basis of multiple statements required a specific unanimity instruction, as the \"government was required to prove dissimilar facts to show the knowing falsity of each statement.\" <i>Holley,</i> 942 F.2d at 928-29. The <i>Holley</i> court specifically relied on Justice Scalia's warning against duplicitous indictments in <i>Schad. Id.</i> at 927; <i>see also </i><i>Bins v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"264208\"><a href=\"/opinion/264208/renee-bins-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 393 (5th Cir. 1964) (noting that a two-count indictment, each count of which alleged multiple acts of uttering and publishing false documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1010, was duplicitous, as \"[t]he filing of each false document would constitute a crime, and each should be alleged in a separate and distinct count of the indictment.\"). The Third Circuit has held that the unanimity requirement extends to an indictment that includes \"several transactions or occurrences, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> any of which could constitute one of the acts proscribed by the charged statutes.\" <i>United States v. Beros,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497286\"><a href=\"/opinion/497286/the-united-states-v-james-beros-titus-mccue-aka-tim-mccune-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 460-61 (3d Cir.1987). The <i>Beros</i> court noted that \"just as the sixth amendment requires jury unanimity in federal criminal cases on each delineated offense that it finds a defendant culpable . . . it must also require unanimity regarding the specific act or acts which constitutes that offense. Absent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too little protection in too many instances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 461. The Seventh Circuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to <i>Holley. See </i><i>United States v. Fawley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751803\"><a href=\"/opinion/751803/united-states-v-scott-m-fawley/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 471 (7th Cir.1998). <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Margiotta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389472\"><a href=\"/opinion/389472/united-states-v-joseph-m-margiotta/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 733 (2d Cir.1981) (holding that the \"policy\" considerations behind the unanimity requirement suggest \"that a single count of an indictment should not be found impermissibly duplicitous whenever it contains several allegations that could have been stated as separate offenses . . . but only when the failure to do so risks unfairness to the defendant.\").</p>\n<p>The risks of serious unfairness presented by a duplicitous indictment are apparent. In conditions where jurors disagree among themselves as to just which offenses the evidence supports, the defendant may nevertheless wind up convicted because the jurors agree that the evidence showed that he had committed <i>an</i> offense, even if it was ambiguous as to which one. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Valerio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195933\"><a href=\"/opinion/195933/united-states-v-valerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.1995). In other words, although a jury may return a guilty verdict even if the jurors disagree about how a specific crime was committed, this is quite different from allowing a jury to return a guilty verdict when they disagree even as to <i>which</i> crime or crimes were committed. The Supreme Court emphasized just this kind of danger in <i>Richardson,</i> warning that the lack of a unanimity instruction could cover up \"wide disagreement among the jurors about just what the defendant did, or did not, do.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span>; <i>see also </i><i>Beros,</i> 833 F.2d at 460 (observing that a general unanimity instruction is likely to be inadequate \"where the complexity of the case, or other factors, creates the potential that the jury will be confused.\").</p>\n<p>Secondly, in criminal cases, the government is still ostensibly required to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ayewoh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180960\"><a href=\"/opinion/180960/united-states-v-ayewoh/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 930 (1st Cir.2010) (Thompson, J., dissenting). In aggregating multiple instances of the same crime, the prosecution may bundle together alleged offenses that are strongly supported by the evidence with ones that are only moderately, or even weakly, supported by the evidence. If a jury does not specifically indicate that it has assented to each alleged offense, then by assenting to the bundle it has done no more than indicate its agreement with the proposition that the defendant is guilty of <i>some,</i> though perhaps not all, of the charged conduct. (And it may not have even indicated that much, if the jurors did not agree which offense was committedwhich, again, we simply do not know without an specific jury instruction). The consequences of conviction on that count may potentially lead to punishment over and above what the government's proof actually sustains. This is a danger we have stressed before, albeit in the context of unanimity as to a crime's elements rather than duplicity <i>per se. See </i><i>Lee,</i> 317 F.3d at 36 (noting that \"the unanimity requirement. . . helps to ensure that no defendant will be convicted unless the government has carried its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and that \"leaving jurors free to convict despite disagreements about critical facts will imperil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> the integrity of the reasonable doubt standard.\").</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we hold that charges 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 29 and 30 were duplicitous, and that the failure to provide a specific unanimity instruction was error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. If there was error, was it plain?</h2>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite our concern about the form of the indictment in this case, we cannot lose sight of the fact that these issues were not raised below and so are before us on plain error review. As we have noted on an earlier occasion, the hurdle of plain error \"nowhere looms larger than in the context of alleged instructional errors.\" <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773399\"><a href=\"/opinion/773399/united-states-v-daniel-paniagua-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 246 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Although we have concluded that the failure to provide a specific unanimity instruction was error and violated the appellants' right to a unanimous jury verdict, this alone is not sufficient to satisfy the rigors of plain error review. To prevail under plain error requires showing, among other things, that any error of law was plainthat is, that it was \"obvious and clear under current law.\" <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198473\"><a href=\"/opinion/198473/smith-v-k-mart-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>We cannot say that the error here met that standard. We note that this court has previously rejected a claim substantially similar to that brought by the appellants, albeit with fairly minimal analysis. <i>See </i><i>Pagan-Santini,</i> 451 F.3d at 267. Moreover, as we noted in <i>Pagan-Santini,</i> \"the law is less clear than it might be as to when juror unanimity is required in the face of alternative paths to a verdict.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2002) (declining to find plain error in trial court's failure to give specific unanimity instruction with respect to charge of conspiracy to murder thirteen individuals on grounds of the \"unsettled state of the law.\") It appears not to have gotten any clearer since then.</p>\n<p>In light of the presence of some, even if not exactly overwhelming, countervailing authority, and because of the lack of doctrinal clarity in this areathe relevant unit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A), the crucial issue underpinning the appellants' claim, appears not to have been hitherto addressed by this circuitwe cannot say with confidence that any error here was plain.</p>\n<p>We emphasize, however, that because we hold that the indictment was impermissibly duplicitous, plain error review may prove to be cold comfort for similarly defective charging instruments going forward.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. Should Newell have been sentenced under § 450d?</h2>\n<p>Newell claims that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 666 and 669 rather than 25 U.S.C. § 450d, despite the fact that he was charged with, and convicted of, violating only the former statutes. Section 666 criminalizes the intentional misapplication of funds by an official of an organization receiving over $10,000 per year in federal funds, and carries a maximum sentence of ten years; § 669 criminalizes intentional misapplication of the assets of \"health care benefit program,\" again setting a statutory cap of ten years imprisonment. By contrast, § 450d imposes a maximum sentence of two years for tribal officers who are convicted of misapplying funds received under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Section 450d is, Newell insists, specifically directed to Indian officials unlike the general purpose §§ 666 and 669 statutes. Newell argues that the rule of lenity, as well as the principle of statutory construction favoring specific statutes over general statutes, require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> that he be sentenced under § 450d, notwithstanding that one is usually sentenced under the statute that one is accused of violating.</p>\n<p>\"[Q]uestions of statutory interpretation that bear on sentencing\" engender <i>de novo</i> review. <i>United States v. Vidal-Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203760\"><a href=\"/opinion/203760/united-states-v-vidal-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>In support of his position, Newell cites the dissenting opinion in <i>United States v. Largo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460132\"><a href=\"/opinion/460132/united-states-v-earl-largo/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1985) (McKay, J., dissenting). In <i>Largo,</i> the majority upheld the defendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 641 for misapplying federal funds, rejecting the argument that the defendant should have been sentenced under § 450d. <i>Id.</i> at 1102. The dissenting judge disagreed, explaining that, because § 450d specifically applied to tribal officers and carried a lighter maximum sentence, remand for resentencing under 25 U.S.C. § 450d was required. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Newell's argument is not persuasive. The statute under which Newell was charged explicitly applies to tribal officers, undermining Newell's contention that Congress intended prosecution of tribal officers to be governed <i>exclusively</i> by 25 U.S.C. § 450d. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1) (referring specifically to \"agent[s] of . . . Indian tribal government.\"). Moreover, Newell's proposed application of the rule of lenity is questionable. The rule of lenity, which favors narrow construction of ambiguous criminal statutes, is of little import in choosing between the application of overlapping criminal statutes. In any case, absent a discriminatory motive on the part of prosecutors, \"what charge to file . . . generally rests entirely in the prosecutor's discretion.\" <i>United States v. Bucci,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204000\"><a href=\"/opinion/204000/united-states-v-bucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 113 (1st Cir.2009) (internal citations and alterations omitted). Consequently, we discern no error and reject Newell's request for resentencing under 25 U.S.C. § 450d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII. Calculation of the restitution order</h2>\n<p>Parisi objects to the restitution order of approximately $1.6 million that was entered against him. He contends that the restitution order should be remanded to the district court to correct a multitude of alleged errors. We address Parisi's contentions one by one. As is well-established, \"[w]e review restitution orders for abuse of discretion and the subsidiary findings of fact for clear error. If the appellant's challenge is based on a legal conclusion, we review that conclusion <i>de novo.</i> Where the defendant has failed to object below . . . we review only for plain error.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 83-84 (1st Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Who were the victims?</h2>\n<p>Parisi argues that \"to the extent there were any victims, they were the [tribal] programs which did not have use of the funds.\" The federal agencies to whom Parisi is required to make restitution are not \"victims\" of his conduct, he claims, because even if \"the federal government's funds were not utilized as intended, the federal government turned over the right to possess those funds when it transferred the funds to\" the Tribe.</p>\n<p>The restitution order is governed by the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3663. As it happens, the statute includes a definition of \"victim\": \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> We have noted, as Parisi concedes, that governmental entities may, \"without dispute,\" be considered victims under the MVRA. <i>United States v. Janosko,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"214497\"><a href=\"/opinion/214497/united-states-v-janosko/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2011). What, then, is the basis of Parisi's claim that the agencies were not victims of his conduct? The closest he comes to pressing the point is his assertion, noted above, that the agencies lost any right to possess the relevant funds once they were granted to the Tribe. But this contention misses the point entirely. If the federal agencies were harmed, it was not by losing possession of the fundsthese were, after all, <i>grants</i>but rather by not having the funds go to the designated programs.<sup>[25]</sup> For Parisi to have so much as a shadow of a claim that the federal agencies were not his victims, he would have to show why <i>that</i> kind of frustrated expectation is not a cognizable harm under the MVRA.<sup>[26]</sup> But he nowhere makes any such allegation. We therefore consider the claim waived, and do not address it.</p>\n<p>Parisi spends a good deal of his discussion of restitution claiming that a restitution order would work a \"fundamental unfairness.\" Parisi claims that misuse of federal grant money was standard practice at the Tribe long before he arrived on the scene, and that the tribal council was well aware of this fact. Parisi claims that the tribal council acknowledged, in a May 2004 meeting, both that they were seriously overspending their budget and that federal SAMHSA grant money was being siphoned off to pay their own salaries. In short, Parisi's claim is that the tribal council was entirely aware of and complicit in Newell's financial shenanigans, and that he should not be made to compensate the Tribe for the financial consequences of \"decisions of the tribal political leadership, including the governor and tribal council members,\" particularly when he, as a tribal outsider, had no say in making these decisions.</p>\n<p>This is an argument about whether or not what he did ought to be considered a crime, or perhaps whether it is fair to punish him while not punishing the other allegedly complicit parties. It does not appear to be an argument about whether there was error in calculating the restitution order. Parisi had an opportunity to present this argument to a jury of his peers. We will not reopen the matter now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. How harmful was it?</h2>\n<p>Parisi next challenges the inclusion of specific amounts in the restitution order. Parisi disputes the following five amounts: (1) $129,044 relating to the SAMHSA funds at issue in counts three and five; (2) $33,000 spent on a Racino referendum effort, as well as other transfers from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> health center's budget over which he had no control; (3) $15,900 of housing authority funds; and (4) a $30,000 DOJ COPS grant.<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>Before we address these contentions, however, we must first determine whether these claims were preserved. The government claims that Parisi did not properly object to some, and possibly any, of the specified amounts at sentencing. The government claims that Parisi only objected at sentencing to (3), the Racino expenditures, and that it was raised only with respect to the guidelines calculation rather than the size of the restitution order itself. Paragraphs 71-72 of the PSR detailed the use of health center funds to pay for the Racino effort. Parisi objected to paragraph 71 on the ground that he had no authority to initiate or stop the use of the $33,000 for the Racino effort, and he repeated this contention at the sentencing hearing. The government's position appears to be that although Parisi objected to the inclusion of the Racino funds, he did not object to the \"amount\" imposed.</p>\n<p>We do not know what to make of this contention. Parisi's claim was that the Racino funds should not have been included at all, from which it follows that in his view the correct amount was zero. Moreover, the government's contention that \"[t]he sentencing transcript reveals only one reference to any of the four\" disputed amounts is belied by the record. Parisi's objections to the PSR's inclusion of the $129,044 in SAMHSA funds can be found on pages 8-10 of the sentencing transcript. His objections to the DOJ COPS grant can be found on pages 15-16. The discussion of Parisi's involvement with transfers from the Housing Authority, although more elliptical, can be found on page 8. The objections were preserved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. $129,044 of SAMHSA funds</h2>\n<p>Parisi first contests the inclusion of the $129,044 deriving from the misapplication of SAMHSA funds used to pay ghost employee salaries in the early part of 2004. Parisi argues that he was not the cause of this loss under the standard announced in <i>United States v. Vaknin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197346\"><a href=\"/opinion/197346/united-states-v-vaknin/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 589 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>In <i>Vaknin,</i> we held that a \"modified but for standard of causation is appropriate for restitution under the [Victim and Witness Protection Act],\" meaning that \"the government must show not only that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the conduct underlying the offense of conviction, but also that the causal nexus between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated (either factually or temporally).\" <i>Id.</i> at 589-90. We cautioned that \"what constitutes sufficient causation can only be determined case by case, in a fact-specific probe.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> Parisi was acquitted of count three, which alleged the actual misapplication, but was convicted of count five, which alleged filing false statements with HHS relating to the misuse of the SAMHSA funds.<sup>[29]</sup> Although the timing is not entirely clear, it appears that the funds were disbursed no later than May 2004, i.e., before the falsified 269 forms were filed with HHS. The form therefore could not have been a \"but for\" cause in causing HHS to disburse the funds. <i>See id.</i> at 589 (\"Restitution should not be ordered in respect to a loss which would have occurred regardless of the defendant's conduct.\"). This sum therefore should not have been included under <i>Vaknin.</i><sup>[30]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. $33,000 Racino effort and Health Center transfers</h2>\n<p>Parisi also contests the inclusion of $33,000 used by the tribal government to pay for expenses stemming from an effort to get a referendum question on the November 2007 ballot asking for voter approval of a Racino. Less specifically, he challenges the inclusion of any of the \"transfers from the Health Center account used to make PTIT's payroll.\" Parisi does not provide a specific dollar amount, but the challenge appears to account for over $1 million of the $1.6 million restitution order.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the gist of Parisi's argument is that he was not the \"cause\" of these losses, as the decision to make those illicit transfers was made by Newell and other members of the Tribe's political leadership. Newell, in many cases with the tribal council's express consent, made the decision to transfer funds from federal grants to pay for, among other things, the council members' own salaries. Similarly, the $33,000 check to the Joint Tribal Council to cover the cost of the Racino referendum effort was authorized by Newell and approved by three separate council members. It was delivered to the Joint Tribal Council by Joe Socobasin, the Tribe's lieutenant governor at the time. It does not appear that Parisi had any say in deciding whether to support the Racino effort in the first place, or where the funds to do so would come from. The entirety of Parisi's involvement with this check appears to be that Newell ordered him to have it drawn up, an order that he in turn conveyed to Frances Neptune, the Tribe's IHS bookkeeper. The Tribe's habit of playing fast and loose with federal grant money, Parisi argues, was present \"before [Parisi] arrived. . . and continued after he left.\" Therefore, he contends, he was not a cause of the losses under <i>Vaknin.</i></p>\n<p>The uncontroverted evidence in the record does indeed suggest that Parisi may have been set up by Newell to take the fall for the Tribe's corrupt financial practices. Unfortunately for Parisi, however, it is well established that defendants can be required to pay restitution for the reasonably foreseeable offenses of their co-conspirators. <i>Collins,</i> 209 F.3d at 4. As <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> we noted above, even if Parisi's role was as limited as he suggestscarrying out or transmitting Newell's ordersthat is sufficient to support his conviction for conspiring with Newell to misapply federal funds. Since at some point the financial impropriety must have been glaringly obvious, and since there is no question that Parisi's co-conspirator, Newell, caused the transfers, Parisi's challenge to the inclusion of these amounts must be denied.</p>\n<p>Parisi's reliance on <i>United States v. Neal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1200-01 (1st Cir.1994), is misplaced. It is true that we held in <i>Neal</i> that a person who aided others in committing a bank robbery, but did not actually participate in the robbery itself, could not be required on that basis alone to make restitution for the full amount of the loss suffered by the bank. However, as we made clear in <i>Neal,</i> Congress has insisted on a different standard when a defendant has been convicted of a federal crime that \"require[s] proof of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1200; <i>see also </i><i>Collins,</i> 209 F.3d at 3.<sup>[31]</sup> Unlike the defendant in <i>Neal,</i> Parisi was most definitely convicted of such a crime. Therefore, the reckoning of the losses that may be laid at his doorstep is substantially broader than it otherwise would have been.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. $15,900 Indian Township Housing Authority</h2>\n<p>Parisi claims that the district court erred in including $15,900 based on transfers from the Indian Township Housing Authority. The district court, Parisi argues, explicitly conceded that Parisi was not involved in these transfers but went ahead and included them in the restitution order anyway. Our review is for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Parisi claims that the district court found that Parisi \"had nothing to do\" with the transfers from the Housing Authority. It is not clear from the record whether or not the district court made such a finding. The portion of the sentencing transcript on which Parisi relies shows that the parties were disputing another matterParisi's contention that the PSR should reflect that he never transferred money to accounts outside the tribal government's control. The court overruled Parisi's objection, and stated that it \"takes into account the parenthetical added to paragraph 26, and with that addition believes the paragraph to be accurate.\"<sup>[32]</sup> However, while the referenced parenthetical does include Parisi's insistence that he had nothing to do with the Housing Authority transfers, no actual discussion of that claim is reflected in the sentencing transcript, as the discussion instead was focused on the issue of his responsibility for transferring money to non-tribal accounts.</p>\n<p>Also bearing on our analysis here is the fact that many of these transfers from the Housing Authority's funds appear to have been undertaken exclusively by Newell for his own purposese.g., a \"donation\" for the marriage of \"Mr. and Mrs. Tammy Newell,\" unspecified \"loans\" in small amounts, compensation to Newell himself for \"mileage,\" and medical assistance to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> Tribe members whose relationship to Newell and/or Parisi is unexplained. In the absence of an explicit ruling by the district court, we are left uncertain whether the district court viewed these transfers as not within the scope of the (tacit) agreement between Newell and Parisi, but mistakenly did not deduct them from the overall restitution order, or if the court concluded that they were, appearances notwithstanding, indeed part of the overall conspiracy. Particularly in light of the extensive number of transactions involved, and the factual complexity of the case, both possibilities seem equally plausible. Because of the ambiguity in the record, we remand the restitution order to the district court to clarify its disposition of the $15,900 Indian Township Housing Authority transfers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. $30,000 DOJ COPS grant</h2>\n<p>Parisi raises a similar contention in his reply brief as to the inclusion of $30,000 based on the misapplication of a DOJ COPS grant. The district court stated that \"[b]oth sides seem to agree that the PSR is inaccurate to the extent it states that Mr. Parisi requested the transfer of those funds. The statement will not be considered by the court.\" Nevertheless, the restitution order included this amount. Parisi's suggestion is that this was an oversight. The government's somewhat gnostic counter-suggestion is that the district court ruled only that it \"would not consider at sentencing\" the PSR's claim that Parisi had requested the transfer, but that it nevertheless intended to include the $30,000 in the restitution order.</p>\n<p>Once again, it is simply unclear on the record what the district court intended. It is possible that the district court concluded that the $30,000 DOJ COPS transfer was to be excluded from consideration. But we are not in a position to assert as much with any confidence.</p>\n<p>However, Parisi only raised this issue in his reply brief. As we have noted, \"issues raised for the first time in an appellant's reply brief are generally deemed waived.\" <i>United States v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1998). Parisi attempts to circumvent this rule by characterizing the DOJ COPS grant issue as merely another instance of the restitution order including \"acquitted conduct.\" But Parisi was not in fact acquitted of this conduct. He was convicted of count 30, which, among other things, alleged misapplication of the COPS grant. The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Repayment of misapplied funds</h2>\n<p>Parisi next argues that the district court failed to consider \"amounts that were misapplied but subsequently repaid.\" As before, our review is for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Parisi argues that some of the moneys that were transferred from the federal grants into the Tribe's general accounts were subsequently repaid by the Tribe. Therefore, it was error to base the restitution order on the initial quantity transferred rather than the amount net repayments. Parisi argues that the restitution order \"grossly exaggerates\" the actual losses, and notes that restitution must be gauged by \"actual loss\" to the victim, <i>United States v. Galloway,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170060\"><a href=\"/opinion/170060/united-states-v-galloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></a></span>, 1253 (10th Cir.2007), and that the burden is on the government to establish the amount of the loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Parisi fails to provide any details about the alleged repayments. He fails to specify to whom the payments were made, who they were made by, when they were made, or how much was repaid. At sentencing, the district court heard from the parties as to whether those Tribe members whose retirement accounts had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> been affected by the misuse of earmarked money had been compensated, and that the government conceded that \"five or six\" such individuals had in fact been repaid. Neither party put forward a specific dollar amount that had been repaid.<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p>The MVRA stipulates that \"[a]ny dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3664(e). As it does not appear that Parisi disputed the inclusion of allegedly repaid amounts in the PSR or at sentencing, we do not discern any abuse of discretion on this score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. The Excessive Fines clause</h2>\n<p>Finally, Parisi claims that the imposition of the approximately $1.6 million restitution order is a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment because (a) the funds were spent on tribal government expenses, (b) Parisi did not personally benefit from the funds in question, (c) he does not have the resources to repay such an amount, and (d) the size of the order will \"prevent him from achieving any reasonable livelihood.\"</p>\n<p>We have never held that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to restitution. The circuits that have considered challenges to restitution orders under the Excessive Fines clause have held that where the restitution order reflects the amount of the victim's loss no constitutional violation has occurred. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lessner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287811\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287811/united-states-v-lessner/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 205-06 (3d Cir.2007); <i>United States v.

Dubose,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755348\"><a href=\"/opinion/755348/98-cal-daily-op-serv-5080-98-cal-daily-op-serv-6780-98-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span>, 1145 (9th Cir.1998) (noting that \"[w]here the amount of restitution is geared directly to the amount of the victim's loss caused by the defendant's illegal activity, proportionality is already built in.\"). This is not surprising, as restitution is inherently proportional, insofar as the point of restitution is to restore the victim to the status <i>quo ante.</i> Restitution is distinct in this regard from forfeiture, as Parisi concedes.</p>\n<p>In this case, the amount of restitution ordered was the sum of the moneys that Parisi was found to have misapplied or for which he submitted false claims. Even assuming that restitution orders may be challenged under the Excessive Fines clause, the restitution ordered in this case would not therefore violate Parisi's rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VIII. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the reasons given above, we vacate Parisi's conviction on count five, reduce the restitution order entered against him by $129,044, remand for further clarification of whether the Indian Township Housing Authority transfers were meant to be included in the restitution order, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and Remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  There are two Passamaquoddy reservations; this case concerns solely the Indian Township reservation located near Princeton, Maine.</p>\n<p>[2]  A tribe receiving BIA funds under a \"638 contract\" may reallocate funds intended for one program to another program funded by the contract unless the funds have a separate funding code. However, BIA funds cannot be diverted to non-BIA programs.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Tribe's General Assistance Office was set up to provide cash assistance and other forms of assistance to needy tribal members. All general assistance had to be approved by the governor.</p>\n<p>[4]  The individuals that Newell and Parisi paid through these grants worked for the tribal government, just not for the programs that were funded by the federal grants. In other cases, the \"ghost\" employees were employed at least part-time with the relevant programs.</p>\n<p>[5]  Ronald Smith, the Tribe's outside auditor, testified at trial that interfund transfers were a \"necessary part of the business\" in light of the complexity of tribal finances, and that he had advised Newell and Parisi that they were consistent with accepted government practices, provided the money was returned and accounted for within \"a reasonable time frame.\" Smith did not specify precisely what such a time frame would be, but suggested \"a week\" as an example.</p>\n<p>[6]  For reference, a summary of the charges brought against Newell and Parisi is attached as an appendix.</p>\n<p>[7]  Newell's restitution order was composed of: (1) $305,693.77 to the IHS; (2) $195,895.35 to HHS; (3) $782,693 to the BIA; (4) $45,230.05 to the EPA; (5) $30,000 to the DOJ COPS program; (6) $23,796,96 to the Maine Office of Substance Abuse; (7) $43,367.50 to the Tribe's retirement fund; (8) $215,199.55 to the tribal government; and (9) $100,000 to On Point underwriting.\n</p>\n<p>Parisi's restitution order was identical, except for (4) and (8). The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Parisi was not responsible for the losses to the EPA, and deducted amounts tied to \"acquitted conduct\" from (8), lessening the amount he was required to pay the tribal government to $121,069.55.</p>\n<p>[8]  There is some support for the government's interpretation. Prior to trial, Newell presented a motion to dismiss asserting a \"privilege based upon the sovereignty and sovereign immunity of the Passamaquoddy Tribe.\" The motion, which was ultimately denied by the district court, cited the same statutory authority to support the \"tribal sovereign immunity\" claim as the (allegedly) jurisdictional argument before us on appeal. The sovereign immunity argument presented there appears to have transmogrified into an argument anent subject matter jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p>[9]  Section 666(a)(1)(A) reads: \"Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section existsbeing an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereofembezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies property that is valued at $5000 or more, and is owned by, or is under the care, custody, or control of such organization, government, or agency . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\" 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A). The referred to circumstance is \"that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.\" <i>Id.</i> § 666(b).</p>\n<p>[10]  We do not say that there could never be a challenge to the enforcement of § 666(a)(1)(A) against the Penobscot or Passamaquoddy Tribes. Although conditioned on the receipt of federal funds, § 666(a)(1)(A) does not actually require the misapplied funds to themselves <i>be</i> federal funds. The jurisdictional question would thus be more difficult if the indictment alleged misapplication of settlement fund income, the use or disposition of which is specifically exempted by the Implementing Act. <i>See</i> 30 M.S.R.A. § 6206 (\"[T]he use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\").\n</p>\n<p>However, Newell has alleged only that \"tribal income includes,\" and that the \"statute reaches\" settlement fund income, but has not provided any more precise explanation of how counts 1, 2, 29 and 30 do so. What is evident is that these counts contain specific allegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States and the intentional misapplication of the Indian Township Housing Authority's Project Income and NAHASDA accounts, the Tribe's BIA 638 contract, the tribal employees' retirement fund, and a DOJ COPS grant. It is possible that some of these sources (perhaps the Tribe's retirement funds and/or the Housing Authority's Project Income account) were made up of settlement fund income. But we simply cannot say from the record whether this is so. Moreover, because Newell did not raise this issue below, there are no relevant factual findings.</p>\n<p>We have never considered whether there might, on some facts, be a conflict between § 666(a)(1)(A) and 30 M.S.R.A. § 6206. In light of the undeveloped factual basis for the claims, we do not decide the issue today.</p>\n<p>[11]  The other two <i>Akins</i> factorswhether the practice concerns the Tribe's use of its lands, or natural resources from the landsdo not apply here.</p>\n<p>[12]  The governing conspiracy statute is 18 U.S.C. § 371, which reads, in pertinent part, \"If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"</p>\n<p>[13]  Parisi insists that he was not conspiring with Newell but rather \"merely doing what Newell instructed him to do.\" This misconstrues the issue. The issue is not <i>why</i> Parisi may have agreed to participate in Newell's schemes; it is <i>whether</i> he so agreed. The answer to that question is not affected one way or the other by the observation that Parisi's only reason for being involved was because he was employed by the Tribe.</p>\n<p>[14]  Section 1001(a)(2) provides that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully . . . (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or . . . or both.\"</p>\n<p>[15]  Because we vacate the conviction, Parisi's additional contention that the 269 form was not \"material\" because it was incomplete and was not relied upon by agency officials is moot. It is in any case without merit, for the reasons noted in section C, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[16]  \"Whoever makes or presents to any person or officer in the civil, military, or naval service of the United States, or to any department or agency thereof, any claim upon or against the United States, or any department or agency thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent, shall be imprisoned not more than five years and shall be subject to a fine in the amount provided in this title.\" 18 U.S.C. § 287.</p>\n<p>[17]  Perhaps one might wonder whether this understanding of materialitytaken from the context of § 1001is appropriate in the context of § 287. Parisi, however, is in no position to raise this argument. Parisi's argument for reading materiality into § 287 in the first place rests on the putative statutory history of §§ 287 and 1001. He argues that § 1001 includes an explicit reference to materiality because it was designed to address false statements, which, unlike the false claims penalized in § 287, was not a common law term of art that already implicitly incorporated a materiality requirement. Therefore, § 287 does not include a reference to materiality simply becauseaccording to Parisidoing so would have been otiose. We express no view on the veracity of this account of the distinction between §§ 287 and 1001, but note that if Parisi is correct, then it stands to reason that materiality under § 1001 ought to be identical to that under § 287, as the former (allegedly) only makes explicit what is anyway implicit in the latter.</p>\n<p>[18]  The false claims at issue in counts 12-15 were requests for reimbursement from SAMHSA for the salaries of the same three tribal council members that were the subject of counts 3 and 5. None of these council members worked for the Wonahkik program. Although it is plausible that Parisi did not know of the fraudulent nature of these claims with respect to the initial 269 formfiled shortly after he began working at the Tribethese forms were filed more than a year after he was hired. Parisi does not contend that he did not know, at this point, that these individuals did not work for Wonahkik and so were not eligible to have their salaries paid by SAMHSA.</p>\n<p>[19]  Our conclusion here means that there is no need to dwell on Parisi's complaint (which Newell joins) that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on materiality with respect to counts 12-15 (the counts alleging violations of § 287). Even assuming that materiality is an element under § 287, the failure to instruct the jury on materiality is subject to harmless error review. <i>See </i><i>Neder v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span> (1999) (\"Unlike such defects as the complete deprivation of counsel or trial before a biased judge, an instruction that omits an element of the offense does not <i>necessarily</i> render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\"). Harmless error review requires ascertaining \"whether it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1827</span></a></span> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our conclusion entails that even if the district court erred in not giving the requested materiality instructionand we certainly do not say it didthat error was harmless as the evidence of materiality was more than sufficient to support the convictions under this standard.</p>\n<p>[20]  The other material statute in the challenged counts is § 669. Oddly, however, the parties focus their discussion exclusively on § 666(a)(1)(A). Our analysis, accordingly, is also focused exclusively on § 666(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[21]  To conclude otherwise would be to conflate two distinct senses of \"alternate means of committing a crime.\" The distinction is easily illustrated. Suppose, for instance, that there is some doubt as to whether A robbed B with a knife or a pistol. The government may obtain a conviction for armed robbery even if some of the jurors believe A used a knife and others believe he used a gun. But one thing the government certainly could not do is to charge A with <i>two</i> armed robberiesonce with the knife, and once with the gun. The appellants' complaint in this case raises the latter concern, but the government's response addresses the former.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, were the facts sufficient to support two distinct armed robberiesif, say, A robbed B with a knife and then, feeling peckish, returned at a later point and robbed B again with a pistolthe jury would be required to unanimously agree which of the crimes the government had proven. The point of specific unanimity instructions is, presumably, to preserve this right to a unanimous verdict regardless of whether the government decides to charge the two armed robberies in separate counts or to instead fold them into a single duplicitous one.</p>\n<p>[22]  <i>Schad</i> was decided by a plurality. Hence, Justice Scalia's vote was necessary to the outcome.</p>\n<p>[23]  We have not always needed to engage in extended analysis of the allowable unit of prosecution under plain error. For instance, in <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 409-10 (1st Cir.2007), we were able to sidestep analysis of this thorny question because First Circuit precedent had already established the unit of prosecution under the relevant statute. This is not the case here; the unit of prosecution under § 666(a)(1)(A) appears not to have been previously considered by this court.</p>\n<p>[24]  Focus on the transaction as the unit of prosecution, at least when Congress has left the issue open, is consistent with how we have treated claims of multiplicity in an indictment. Multiplicity is the converse of duplicity: it alleges that the government seeks multiple punishments for the same offense via an impermissibly repetitive indictment. In addressing multiplicity challenges, we have noted that \"an inquiring court must determine whether the facts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit of prosecution.\" <i>United States v. Pires,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"214118\"><a href=\"/opinion/214118/united-states-v-pires/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2011). In applying this test, we focus on whether there is evidence that might establish that the conduct in question constitutes \"separate and distinct transactions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[25]  The legislative history of § 666 makes this point clear, as § 666 was designed to cover the situation in which \"even though title to the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such program funds.\" <i>Cicco,</i> 938 F.2d at 445 (quoting S.Rep. No. 225, at 369 (1983), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510).</p>\n<p>[26]  This is consistent with <i>United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200912\"><a href=\"/opinion/200912/united-states-v-cornier-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2004), in which we vacated a restitution order requiring the defendant, who had been convicted under § 666(a)(1)(A), to compensate HUD for intentionally misapplied funds. There, we emphasized that even though the defendant had intentionally misapplied the funds, the work that the funds were meant to pay for had actually been completed, a fact pointed out by the government's own witness. <i>Id.</i> at 42. In light of the lack of evidence as to any actual loss, ordering restitution under these circumstances would, we found, \"be an unfair windfall to HUD.\" <i>Id.</i> In this case, however, although the misapplied funds were arguably used for the benefit of the Tribe, they were used in contravention of their specified purposes.</p>\n<p>[27]  In his opening brief, Parisi contested the inclusion of $229,000 from count eleven, claiming that he had been acquitted on that count. The government pointed out that Parisi was in fact convicted on count eleven. Parisi conceded the point in his reply brief, but then substituted a challenge to the $30,000 COPS grant instead.</p>\n<p>[28]  <i>Vaknin</i> interpreted the predecessor to the MVRA, the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\"VWPA\"). However, we have noted that \"the causation language of the MVRA is the same as that in the VWPA, making it appropriate for us to turn to <i>Vaknin</i> for guidance\" in interpreting the MVRA. <i>United States v. Cutter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200233\"><a href=\"/opinion/200233/united-states-v-cutter/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2002). There is a further wrinkle, however, insofar as the VWPA was amended after <i>Vaknin</i> to clarify that restitution may be ordered for harms caused not just by a defendant personally, but also by his or her co-conspirators as well, at least so long as those harms were \"reasonably foreseeable.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1999). Similar language is contained in the MVRA. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). Nevertheless, even if the eligible sources of harm are more numerous now than they were under <i>Vaknin,</i> this is a distinct issue from what it takes to count as having <i>caused</i> the harm, on which <i>Vaknin</i> remains authoritative.</p>\n<p>[29]  As noted above, we vacate Parisi's conviction on this count on grounds of insufficient evidence that he knew the forms to be false.</p>\n<p>[30]  To be clear, we do not base our conclusion here on our holding that the evidence was insufficient to convict Parisi for knowingly making false statements to HHS. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

He only transferred federal funds between [Tribe]-controlled accounts, and always at the Governor's direction. Parisi had nothing to do with Housing Authority transfers.\"</p>\n<p>[33]  Count 30 of the indictment charged Newell and Parisi of misapplying $45,824 from the Tribe's retirement fund; the judgment entered against Parisi ordered restitution in the amount of $43,367.50.</p>\n\n</div>",
