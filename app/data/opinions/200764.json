Wortman, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellees.\n\n\n                            December 9, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the     Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. This case requires us to determine\n\nwhether the district court correctly attributed more than one\n\nkilogram   of   heroin   to   defendant-appellant   Victor    Laboy   when\n\nsentencing him on a drug distribution charge.             We must also\n\ndetermine whether the district court correctly imposed a leadership\n\nrole adjustment for Laboy's gang activities. Finding no error, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           From the spring of 1999 until early 2000, the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation monitored a street gang in Lawrence,\n\nMassachusetts known as the Latin Gangsta' Disciples (\"LGD\").           The\n\nFBI suspected that LGD members were, among other activities,\n\nselling heroin in the Lawrence, Massachusetts area.          The FBI used\n\nsurveillance devices to monitor LGD meetings and used cooperating\n\nwitnesses (\"CWs\") to make controlled purchases of heroin from\n\nsuspected LGD members.\n\n           In the summer of 1999, appellant Victor Laboy made three\n\ndocumented heroin sales to CWs.1          On July 9, 1999, Laboy sold\n\nheroin to a CW who originally wanted to buy from Luis Flores, the\n\nhighest ranking member of the LGD.       Laboy told the CW that he could\n\ntake care of the CW from his own supply; that he and Flores were\n\npartners; and that their source of heroin was the same.           Indeed,\n\n\n     1\n       The total weight of the heroin that Laboy sold on these\nthree occasions was approximately 2.54 grams.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe markings on the packages that Laboy sold that day matched those\n\non packages that Flores sold on previous occasions.   At one point,\n\nLaboy suggested that he and the CW join together to sell heroin in\n\nnearby Haverhill, Massachusetts. After the sale, he called Flores,\n\nin the CW's presence, in an attempt to replenish his stock.\n\n          This scene repeated itself three days later when a CW,\n\nagain unable to find Flores, instead sought out Laboy. Laboy again\n\nsupplied heroin and stated that he and Flores were partners.\n\nAgain, he expressed interest in partnering with the CW to sell\n\nheroin in another city.\n\n          On July 23, 1999, a CW made a third purchase from Laboy.\n\nAt this meeting, Laboy stated that he was no longer in partnership\n\nwith Flores because Flores' source was selling inferior quality\n\nheroin and Laboy was losing money on it.    Now he was running his\n\nown operation and had at least one person working for him.    Again,\n\nhe tried to recruit the CW to sell heroin on his behalf.\n\n          On July 28, 1999, a CW accompanied Laboy in an attempt to\n\ncollect money from yet another person who was dealing heroin for\n\nLaboy.   During their conversation, Laboy told the CW about his\n\n\"regular customers,\" including one who \"comes every two days... for\n\nsix or seven [bundles].\"2   They proceeded to search for Wilberto\n\n\n     2\n      The district court estimated that the average bundle of\nheroin sold by LGD members during the investigation was\napproximately .23 grams. The average weight per bundle of heroin\nthat Laboy sold during the three controlled buys was slightly less,\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fColon, whom Laboy identified as one of his suppliers. They planned\n\nto purchase 10 grams from Colon that day, and Laboy indicated that\n\nhe had purchased as much as 20 grams from Colon in the past.\n\nEventually they discarded the idea because Laboy discovered that\n\nColon had just made a sale of 20 grams.              In Laboy's estimation,\n\nthere would not be a ready market for more heroin that day.\n\n           Laboy was not the only member of the LGD that sold heroin\n\nduring the summer and fall of 1999.           The FBI documented more than\n\n100 grams of direct heroin sales by Laboy's associates during its\n\ninvestigation.       Several     of    these      members      acknowledged   a\n\nrelationship with Laboy.         Wilberto Colon discussed his heroin\n\nbusiness with a CW in Laboy's presence and stated that he sold to\n\n\"Papito,\" Laboy's street name.              Two CWs stated that they sold\n\nseveral bundles a day on Laboy's behalf.\n\n           By the fall of 1999, Laboy had moved to Salem, New\n\nHampshire - a town about six miles from Lawrence. Nevertheless, he\n\nreturned   to   Lawrence   to   attend      LGD   meetings.3     During   these\n\nmeetings, LGD members discussed the distribution of drug proceeds.\n\nFlores demanded that he receive $50 from each sale by LGD members:\n\n\n\nat .17 grams per bundle. Using either figure, the customer to whom\nLaboy refers would have been buying more than a gram of heroin\nevery two days.\n     3\n      The FBI recorded four LGD meeting between September 12, 1999,\nand October 24, 1999. Laboy attended at least two - one on\nSeptember 29, 1999, and one on October 24, 1999.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f\"We got a business on Park Street... I give you a bundle [of\n\nheroin], I want fifty bucks out of it... if I'm paying for it, you\n\ngonna give me my money regardless....\"    They discussed the failure\n\nof some members to contribute money to the gang \"fundle\" - a fund\n\nused to purchase firearms and bail out gang members who had been\n\narrested.   Members recounted violence against other gangs, and the\n\nneed to protect LGD's \"turf\" in Lawrence from anyone else who would\n\ntry to sell drugs in the area.\n\n            At one meeting, LGD member Manuel Rivera referred to\n\nLaboy as one of several leaders of the gang, saying to LGD\n\n\"captain\" Edgardo Colon:\n\n            you, T-Roc [Flores], Pinchy [Santiago] and []\n            Bocerro [Laboy]... you [] are the ones running\n            this... you [] supposed to communicate at all\n            times and let each other know what's going\n            on... we an organization.\n\nFlores also referred to Laboy as one of several leaders of the\n\ngang, stating that, if anything happens, \"I want it brought to\n\nme... if not brought to me, brought to one of the heads,... Pinchy\n\n[Antonio Santiago,]... Galdi [Edgardo Colon] or Bocerro [Laboy]...\n\nor Chupacabra [Juan Matias].\"\n\n            Based on the controlled drug sales and surveillance tapes\n\nof the gang meetings, the FBI arrested Laboy and several other LGD\n\nmembers in January 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                  II.\n\n             On October 9, 2000, Laboy pleaded guilty to three counts\n\nof heroin distribution for the three controlled purchases he made\n\nto CWs.4      At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard\n\ntestimony from an FBI agent and a CW about the inner workings of\n\nthe LGD and its members' drug dealing.       It also considered the\n\nadmissions made by other LGD members who had pleaded guilty to\n\nheroin distribution, including information about quantities and\n\nfrequency of sales.     The court examined Laboy's relationship with\n\nother LGD members, both through the gang and individually.\n\n             The court found, by clear and convincing evidence,5 that\n\nLaboy and other LGD members had \"jointly undertaken\" various\n\nactivities, within the meaning of U.S.S.G. ยง 1B1.3,6 to advance\n\ntheir collective heroin business. Because of this cooperation, the\n\ncourt held Laboy accountable for all heroin distributed by other\n\nLGD members during the course of the FBI's investigation.          It\n\nfurther found that LGD members had distributed, and thus that Laboy\n\nwas responsible for, more than one kilogram of heroin. Finally, it\n\n\n     4\n      The Government dropped several other charges.       Charges of\nconspiracy were severed from the proceeding.\n     5\n      The district court was only required to make these findings\nby a preponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Lombard,\n102 F.3d 1, 4-5, (1st Cir. 1996). Nevertheless, it chose to apply\nboth standards, apparently to emphasize the strength of the\nevidence.\n     6\n         See infra Part III.A.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffound that Laboy, through his role in the LGD, was an organizer or\n\nleader of an \"otherwise extensive\" organization, under U.S.S.G. ยง\n\n3B1.1.   The court applied a base offense level of 32, with a 4\n\npoint adjustment for Laboy's role in the offense, and a three point\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility.     It sentenced him to\n\n168 months in prison, 3 years supervised release and a $300 special\n\nassessment.\n\n                               III.\n\n          On appeal, Laboy offers two arguments: first, that the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding him responsible for more than one\n\nkilogram of heroin, and second, that it erred in adjusting his\n\nsentence for his leadership role in the LGD.     We address each of\n\nthese arguments in turn.\n\nA. Calculation of Drug Quantity\n\n          The district court need only determine drug quantities by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.      United States v. Batista, 239\n\nF.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 850 (2001). We\n\nreview such determinations for clear error.7 Id.\n\n\n     7\n      Appellee argues that since Appellant did not object to the\ndistrict court's method of drug calculation at sentencing, we\nshould review only for plain error. See, e.g., United States v.\nMojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 306 (1st Cir. 2000)(applying plain error\nstandard where objections made at sentencing did not address the\nissues on appeal). Appellant replies that he could not object at\nsentencing because the specific method of quantity calculation was\nrevealed only in a subsequent memorandum from the court. Because\nwe find that the district court's quantity calculations meet the\nclearly erroneous standard in any event, we need not decide the\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f            Laboy first argues that he should be held accountable\n\nonly for the drug quantities involved in his three sales to CWs and\n\nnot for quantities sold by other LGD members.                     Drug quantity\n\ndeterminations are not limited to the amounts involved in the\n\noffense of conviction. Rather, a defendant may be held responsible\n\nfor drug quantities involved in his \"relevant conduct.\"                  U.S.S.G.\n\nยง 1B1.3.     Such conduct may include a defendant's own acts or the\n\nacts of others: the sentencing guidelines provide responsibility\n\nfor the acts of others in the case of \"jointly undertaken criminal\n\nactivity\", which includes any \"criminal plan, scheme, endeavor or\n\nenterprise       undertaken     by   defendant    in   concert    with   others.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. ยง 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).           The guidelines state that a defendant\n\nmay be held responsible for\n\n            all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions\n            of others in furtherance of the jointly\n            undertaken criminal activity, that occurred\n            during the commission of the offense of\n            conviction, in preparation for that offense,\n            or in the course of attempting to avoid\n            detection or responsibility for that offense.\n\n\nId.   In   the    case   of     controlled    substances,   the    defendant   is\n\nresponsible       for    \"all     reasonably     foreseeable      quantities   of\n\ncontraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that\n\n\n\n\nstandard of review issue.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fhe jointly undertook.\"       U.S.S.G. ยง 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2).8         Thus, a\n\ndrug dealer who engages in criminal activity with others to further\n\ntheir collective interests may be held liable for the quantities of\n\ndrugs sold by his partners, if those sales were a reasonably\n\nforeseeable consequence of the jointly undertaken actions.\n\n            This type of liability, however, has its limit: mere\n\nknowledge of another's activity is not enough to show liability\n\nunder U.S.S.G.     ยง   1B1.3.    Rather,     \"the   central   concept...   is\n\nforeseeability.\"       United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1023\n\n(1st Cir. 1992). The defendant is only responsible for foreseeable\n\nconduct within the scope of his own explicit or implicit agreement.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)(\"So as to keep the criminal responsibility within bounds, ยง\n\n1B1.3 requires sentencing courts to ascertain on an individual\n\nbasis the scope of the criminal activity that the particular\n\ndefendant   agreed     jointly   to    undertake.\");    United   States    v.\n\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 488-89 (1st Cir. 1993)(\"[E]ach member of\n\na drug conspiracy may be held accountable at sentencing for a\n\ndifferent quantity of narcotics, depending on the circumstances of\n\neach defendant's involvement.\").            While a conspiracy charge may\n\n\n\n     8\n      \"[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or\nexplains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the\nConstitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a\nplainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\" Stinson v. United\nStates, 508 U.S. 36, 38 (1993).\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fencompass   all   acts   by   co-conspirators     in   furtherance    of   the\n\nconspiracy, see Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647\n\n(1946), \"relevant conduct\" is limited to the foreseeable acts\n\nresulting from the defendant's particular agreement.                Thus, the\n\nscope of relevant conduct is \"not necessarily the same as the scope\n\nof the entire conspiracy.\"      U.S.S.G. ยง 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2).\n\n            The record shows that Laboy was a high-level gang member\n\nwho fully participated in the LGD's drug trade.9           He was one of the\n\n\"heads\"   of   the   gang   charged    with   overseeing   gang    activities\n\ndesigned to protect the LGD's heroin operation.                   Through his\n\nleadership in the LGD he helped to keep other dealers out of LGD\n\n\"turf,\" ensuring that only he and his fellow LGD members would be\n\nable to deal heroin in the area.        He stepped in to supply Flores's\n\ncustomers when the LGD \"Lord\" was out of town.             He had other LGD\n\nmembers sell drugs on his behalf.        Indeed, Laboy's actions closely\n\nresemble an example from the guidelines:\n\n            Defendant Q, [a] street-level drug dealer,\n            pools his resources and profits with four\n            other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q\n            is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal\n            activity and, therefore, he is accountable\n\n\n     9\n      Laboy argues that he had stopped selling heroin and had\nvirtually severed all ties with the LGD by August 1999 and thus\ncannot be held accountable for any drugs sold after that point.\nThe record, however, does not support this argument.     As noted\nabove, see supra note 3, FBI videotapes recorded Laboy's presence\nat LGD meetings on September 29, 1999 and October 24, 1999.\nLaboy's participation in these meetings is evidence of his\ncontinuing involvement with the LGD after August of 1999.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f           under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities\n           of drugs sold by the four other dealers during\n           the course of his joint undertaking with them\n           because those sales were in furtherance of the\n           jointly undertaken criminal activity and\n           reasonably foreseeable in connection with that\n           criminal activity.\n\nU.S.S.G. ยง 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2, illus. (c)(6)).           Given the record of\n\nLaboy's cooperation with other LGD members involved in the heroin\n\ntrade,   the    district   court   correctly    considered   their   jointly\n\nundertaken criminal activity in determining the quantity of drugs\n\nfor which Laboy was responsible.\n\n           In challenging the drug quantity calculation, Laboy next\n\nargues   that    the   district    court    impermissibly   multiplied   drug\n\namounts from single sales by the estimated frequency of those sales\n\nto arrive at a total of more than one kilogram.                Indeed, rote\n\nmultiplication of quantities from a single exchange is, taken\n\nalone, an improper method for determining overall drug quantities.\n\nSee United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 233 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   This is especially true where an estimate of quantity is\n\nmultiplied by an estimate of frequency.            Rather, drug quantities\n\nmust find specific support in the record, and \"where significant\n\nuncertainty exists, those findings [must] err on the side of\n\ncaution.\" Id.\n\n           However, when \"the amount [of drugs] seized does not\n\nrepresent the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the\n\nquantity of the controlled substance.\"             U.S.S.G. ยง 2D1.1, cmt.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f(n.12).     We have held that, when \"it is impossible or impractical\n\nto   obtain     an   exact    drug    quantity      for    sentencing         purposes,   a\n\nreasoned estimate will suffice.\"                 United States v. Morrill, 8 F.3d\n\n864, 871 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Huddleston, 194\n\nF.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir. 1999)(upholding a \"reasoned approximation\n\nof   drug      quantity,     well    supported      by    a    preponderance      of    the\n\nevidence\"); United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 149 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)(upholding a \"reasoned, if not conservative, estimate of the\n\ndrug quantity involved\" in the offense).                      We have upheld findings\n\nthat are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and are based\n\non a \"conservative approach.\"               U.S. v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 113-14\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).          Thus, the mere fact that a district court used\n\nestimates to determine drug quantities does not, alone, constitute\n\nreversible error.\n\n               In making its estimates, the district court looked both\n\nat gang activities and at Laboy's direct involvement with various\n\ndealers. First, the court accounted for sales by LGD members Kenny\n\nCruz and       Roberto     Pagan,     who    worked      directly   for       another   LGD\n\n\"captain,\"       Edgardo     Colon.         In   pleading      guilty    to    conspiracy\n\ncharges, Cruz admitted that he was directly responsible for 750\n\ngrams     of    heroin.        Pagan    similarly         pleaded       guilty,    taking\n\nresponsibility for at least 1000 grams of heroin. These admissions\n\nalone account for almost twice the court's one kilogram finding.\n\nHowever, to ensure a conservative estimate, the court reduced the\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\famounts attributed to Pagan and Cruz to between 542-828 and 427-499\n\ngrams respectively.\n\n           The court also looked at sales by members of the LGD\n\nleadership.   Edgardo Colon sold heroin to a CW and gave out his\n\nbrother Wilberto's beeper number to set up future sales.          Another\n\ncaptain, Antonio Santiago, admitted to selling more than 100 grams.\n\nThe LGD \"Lord,\" Luis Flores, sold heroin to a CW, tried to recruit\n\nthe CW to sell heroin on his behalf, and admitted to selling \"rock\"\n\n24 hours a day.    He stated at the September 26 LGD meeting: \"My\n\nlife... all I do is sell my drugs....\"     All told, CWs purchased 108\n\ngrams of heroin from LGD members in controlled buys, undoubtedly a\n\nsmall fraction of what its members were distributing to other\n\nsources.\n\n           This extensive record of individual sales by LGD members,\n\nadded to Laboy's own activities, supports attributing one kilogram\n\nof heroin to Laboy.      Indeed, it is a conservative estimate.        In\n\nopposition,   Laboy    contends   that   some   of   the   testimony   and\n\nadmissions used by the district court in making its determination\n\nwere unreliable.      However, \"[t]he appraisal of amount depends on\n\ninference drawing and perhaps credibility and we are not only loath\n\nbut forbidden to substitute our own de novo assessment for that of\n\nthe judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first hand.\"\n\nU.S. v. Picanso, 333 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2003).          Thus we find no\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\ferror in the court's decision to hold Laboy responsible for one\n\nkilogram of heroin.\n\nB. Role Adjustment\n\n              Laboy also argues that the district court erred in\n\nenhancing his sentence by finding that he was               an \"organizer or a\n\nleader   of     a    criminal    activity     that    involved       five   or   more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive\" under U.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1.\n\nIn applying U.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1, \"a district court must make both a\n\nstatus determination - a finding that the defendant acted as a\n\nleader   or    organizer    of   the   criminal      activity    -    and   a    scope\n\ndetermination - a finding that the criminal activity met either the\n\nnumerosity      or     extensiveness    benchmarks       established        by     the\n\nguidelines.\"         United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 111\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).        Determining the defendant's role in the offense\n\nis necessarily a \"fact-specific task.\"               Id. at 110.      We review the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings for clear error, giving \"due\n\ndeference to the district court's application of the guidelines to\n\nthe facts.\"         United States v. Joyce, 70 F.3d 679, 681 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).   We review its legal interpretation of the guidelines de\n\nnovo. See, e.g., United States v. Brennick, 337 F.3d 107, 110 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n              As with the determination of drug quantities, the court\n\nmay draw on all \"relevant conduct\" when determining whether the\n\ndefendant was an \"organizer or leader\" for the purposes of the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fguidelines.    See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz-Batista, 956 F.2d\n\n351, 353-54 (1st Cir. 1992).    The guidelines direct the sentencing\n\ncourt to a variety of factors in making this determination.\n\n            Factors the court should consider include the\n            exercise of decision making authority, the\n            nature of participation in the commission of\n            the offense, the recruitment of accomplices,\n            the claimed right to a larger share of the\n            fruits   of   the   crime,  the   degree   of\n            participation in planning or organizing the\n            offense, the nature and scope of the illegal\n            activity, and the degree of control and\n            authority exercised over others.\n\nU.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1, cmt. (n.4).     The record demonstrates that Laboy\n\nengaged in several of these activities.        He attended LGD meetings\n\nand was identified as a leader in the gang, ranking just below the\n\nLGD \"Lord.\"    Lower level gang members were directed to take their\n\nproblems to Laboy and the other \"heads\" of the LGD.                The LGD\n\nclaimed a share of heroin proceeds to be placed in the \"fundle.\"\n\nLaboy had several gang members selling drugs on his behalf.              He\n\neven attempted to recruit at least one CW to sell heroin for him.\n\nBased on this record, we cannot say that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding that Laboy was a leader or organizer of the LGD.\n\n            While conceding that the district court may look to all\n\n\"relevant conduct\" when determining the \"organizer\" or \"leader\"\n\nelements,   appellant   would   have    us   limit   the   \"five   or   more\n\nparticipants\" and \"otherwise extensive\" elements solely to the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\foffenses of conviction.10              In essence, appellant argues that the\n\nnumerosity/extensiveness requirement must be satisfied only by\n\npeople directly involved in the three drug sales to which Laboy\n\npleaded         guilty,    and   not   by   the     people   or   organization   that\n\ncontributed to the \"relevant conduct\" surrounding those specific\n\noffenses.\n\n                 Our precedent does not support such an approach. Rather,\n\nwe have said that the extensiveness requirement depends on \"the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, including... the width, breadth,\n\nscope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.\" Deitz, 950 F.2d at\n\n53.        On    several    occasions,      we     have   found   the   extensiveness\n\nrequirement met by the relevant conduct surrounding the offense of\n\nconviction.         See, e.g., Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 113 (finding\n\nthat a scheme to smuggle illegal immigrants met the extensiveness\n\n\n\n      10\n      The \"five or more participants\" and \"otherwise extensive\"\nelements are alternative means of finding the required scope under\nยง 3B1.1. The sentencing court need only find one or the other, not\nboth. See U.S. v. Deitz, 950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1991)(finding\nthat the \"otherwise extensive\" element is distinct from and does\nnot necessarily incorporate the \"five or more participants\"\nelement); Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 113 (1st Cir. 1995)(\"[T]he\ncriminal activity must meet either the extensiveness or the\nnumerosity benchmark, not necessarily both....\"). Nevertheless,\nthe district court found that both elements were satisfied: \"[t]he\n'five or more participants' standard is met by reviewing the\nattendees at gang meetings, who plainly facilitated the\ndistribution of drugs at the direction of the President and\nCaptains at LGD. The 'otherwise extensive' standard is met by the\ncomplexity of the organizational structure of the LGD, its reach\ninto the community etc.\" United States v. Flores, 230 F. Supp.2d\n138, 150 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\frequirement because of \"the breadth of the activities, whether\n\nmeasured in terms of duration, number of clients, or geographic\n\nreach....\"); United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 76 n.7 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)(finding the extensiveness requirement met by \"a ledger\n\nthat   established    a   wide-ranging         pattern      of   drug    trafficking\n\nactivities, and a trash bag containing thousands of empty vials\n\nused to package crack cocaine.\").\n\n           Further,     the   commentary        to   the    guidelines      does    not\n\nsupport   appellant's     reading.        The    introductory          commentary    to\n\nChapter 3, part B simply states that the \"defendant's role in the\n\noffense is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope\n\nof ยง 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)... and not solely on the basis of\n\nelements and acts cited in the count of conviction.\"                        U.S.S.G.\n\nCh.3, Pt.B, intro. cmt.       It does not distinguish between any of the\n\nvarious elements that may lead to a role in the offense adjustment.\n\nFurther, the commentary to ยง 3B1.1 refers to determining whether an\n\n\"organization\" involved in a crime, rather than the crime itself,\n\nis otherwise extensive.          U.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1, cmt. (n.3).               It also\n\nstates that the sentence should increase with \"the size of a\n\ncriminal organization,\" without expressly limiting extensiveness or\n\ncomplexity to the crime of conviction.                 U.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1, cmt.\n\n(backg'd.).     Thus,     both    our    precedent         and   the    commission's\n\ncommentary indicate that district courts may consider relevant\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fconduct     beyond   the   crime   of    conviction     when   determining   the\n\nnumerosity and extensiveness requirements.\n\n             The relevant conduct surrounding Laboy's heroin sales\n\nincluded \"five or more participants\" and demonstrated that the LGD\n\nwas an \"otherwise extensive\" organization under U.S.S.G. ยง 3B1.1.\n\nThe LGD consisted of more than 20 members, organized to protect\n\ngang \"turf\" and prevent any other gangs from competing with their\n\nheroin \"business\" in the Lawrence area.              Lower level gang members,\n\nor \"soldiers,\" were required to go on \"missions\" to carry out gang\n\nobjectives.     Members pooled funds from their individual drug sales\n\nto ensure that LGD members could be bailed out of jail and have\n\naccess to firearms.        Finally, the LGD had a clear hierarchy, with\n\nLuis Flores as the \"Lord\" of the gang, and several \"captains\",\n\nincluding Laboy, who collectively directed gang activity.                    This\n\nrecord is more than sufficient to support a determination that the\n\nLGD   was    \"otherwise     extensive\"         or   included   \"five   or    more\n\nparticipants.\"\n\n                                        IV.\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the\n\ndistrict court's sentence.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f",

Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the spring of 1999 until early 2000, the Federal Bureau of Investigation monitored a street gang in Lawrence, Massachusetts known as the Latin Gangsta' Disciples (\"LGD\"). The FBI suspected that LGD members were, among other activities, selling heroin in the Lawrence, Massachusetts area. The FBI used surveillance devices to monitor LGD meetings and used cooperating witnesses (\"CWs\") to make controlled purchases of heroin from suspected LGD members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1999, appellant Victor Laboy made three documented heroin sales to CWs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On July 9, 1999, Laboy sold heroin to a CW who originally wanted to buy from Luis Flores, the highest ranking member of the LGD. Laboy told the CW that he could take care of the CW from his own supply; that he and Flores were partners; and that their source of heroin was the same. Indeed, the markings on the packages that Laboy sold that day matched those on packages that Flores sold on previous occasions. At one point, Laboy suggested that he and the CW join together to sell heroin in nearby Haverhill, Massachusetts. After the sale, he called Flores, in the CW's presence, in an attempt to replenish his stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This scene repeated itself three days later when a CW, again unable to find Flores, instead sought out Laboy. Laboy again supplied heroin and stated that he and Flores were partners. Again, he expressed interest in partnering with the CW to sell heroin in another city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1999, a CW made a third purchase from Laboy. At this meeting, Laboy stated that he was no longer in partnership with Flores because Flores' source was selling inferior quality heroin and Laboy was losing money on it. Now he was running his own operation and had at least one person working for him. Again, he tried to recruit the CW to sell heroin on his behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 28, 1999, a CW accompanied Laboy in an attempt to collect money from yet another person who was dealing heroin for Laboy. During their conversation, Laboy told the CW about his \"regular customers,\" including one who \"comes every two days ... for six or seven [bundles].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> They proceeded to search for Wilberto Colon, whom Laboy identified as one of his suppliers. They planned to purchase 10 grams from Colon that day, and Laboy indicated that he had purchased as much as 20 grams from Colon in the past. Eventually they discarded the idea because Laboy discovered that Colon had just made a sale of 20 grams. In Laboy's estimation, there would not be a ready market for more heroin that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy was not the only member of the LGD that sold heroin during the summer and fall of 1999. The FBI documented more than 100 grams of direct heroin sales by Laboy's associates during its investigation. Several of these members acknowledged a relationship with Laboy. Wilberto Colon discussed his heroin business with a CW in Laboy's presence and stated that he sold to \"Papito,\" Laboy's street name. Two CWs stated that they sold several bundles a day on Laboy's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the fall of 1999, Laboy had moved to Salem, New Hampshire &#8212; a town about six miles from Lawrence. Nevertheless, he returned to Lawrence to attend LGD meetings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> During these meetings, LGD members discussed the distribution of drug proceeds. Flores demanded that he receive $50 from each sale by LGD members: \"We got a business on Park Street... I give you a bundle [of heroin], I want fifty bucks out of it ... if I'm paying for it, you gonna give me my money regardless....\" They discussed the failure of some members to contribute money to the gang \"fundle\" &#8212; a fund used to purchase firearms and bail out gang members who had been arrested. Members recounted violence against other gangs, and the need to protect LGD's \"turf\" in Lawrence from anyone else who would try to sell drugs in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one meeting, LGD member Manuel Rivera referred to Laboy as one of several leaders of the gang, saying to LGD \"captain\" Edgardo Colon:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">you, T &#8212; Roc [Flores], Pinchy [Santiago] and [ ] Bocerro [Laboy] ... you [ ] are the ones running this ... you [ ] supposed to communicate at all times and let each other know what's going on ... we an organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores also referred to Laboy as one of several leaders of the gang, stating that, if anything happens, \"I want it brought to me ... if not brought to me, brought to one of the heads, ... Pinchy [Antonio Santiago,]... Galdi [Edgardo Colon] or Bocerro [Laboy] ... or Chupacabra [Juan Matias].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the controlled drug sales and surveillance tapes of the gang meetings, the FBI arrested Laboy and several other LGD members in January 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 9, 2000, Laboy pleaded guilty to three counts of heroin distribution for the three controlled purchases he made to CWs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard testimony from an FBI agent and a CW about the inner workings of the LGD and its members' drug dealing. It also considered the admissions made by other LGD members who had pleaded guilty to heroin distribution, including information about quantities and frequency of sales. The court examined Laboy's relationship with other LGD members, both through the gang and individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found, by clear and convincing evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that Laboy and other LGD members had \"jointly undertaken\" various activities, within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to advance their collective heroin business. Because of this cooperation, the court held Laboy accountable for all heroin distributed by other LGD members during the course of the FBI's investigation. It further found that LGD members had distributed, and thus that Laboy was responsible for, more than one kilogram of heroin. Finally, it found that Laboy, through his role in the LGD, was an organizer or leader of an \"otherwise extensive\" organization, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. The court applied a base offense level of 32, with a 4 point adjustment for Laboy's role in the offense, and a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. It sentenced him to 168 months in prison, 3 years supervised release and a $300 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Laboy offers two arguments: first, that the district court erred in holding him responsible for more than one kilogram of heroin, and second, that it erred in adjusting his sentence for his leadership role in the LGD. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Calculation of Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court need only determine drug quantities by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Batista,</i> 239 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 850, 122 S.Ct. 117, 151 L.Ed.2d 73 (2001). We review such determinations for clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy first argues that he should be held accountable only for the drug quantities involved in his three sales to CWs and not for quantities sold by other LGD members. Drug quantity determinations are not limited to the amounts involved in the offense of conviction. Rather, a defendant may be held responsible for drug quantities involved in his \"relevant conduct.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. Such conduct may include a defendant's own acts or the acts of others: the sentencing guidelines provide responsibility for the acts of others in the case of \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\", which includes any \"criminal plan, scheme, endeavor or enterprise undertaken by defendant in concert with others.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). The guidelines state that a defendant may be held responsible for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> In the case of controlled substances, the defendant is responsible for \"all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, a drug dealer who engages in criminal activity with others to further their collective interests may be held liable for the quantities of drugs sold by his partners, if those sales were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the jointly undertaken actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This type of liability, however, has its limit: mere knowledge of another's activity is not enough to show liability under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. Rather, \"the central concept... is foreseeability.\" <i>United States v. O'Campo,</i> 973 F.2d 1015, 1023 (1st Cir.1992). The defendant is only responsible for foreseeable conduct within the scope of his own explicit or implicit agreement. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carrozza,</i> 4 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.1993)(\"So as to keep the criminal responsibility within bounds, &#167; 1B1.3 requires sentencing courts to ascertain on an individual basis the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant agreed jointly to undertake.\"); <i>United States v. Innamorati,</i> 996 F.2d 456, 488-89 (1st Cir.1993)(\"[E]ach member of a drug conspiracy may be held accountable at sentencing for a different quantity of narcotics, depending on the circumstances of each defendant's involvement.\"). While a conspiracy charge may encompass all acts by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy, <i>see Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 647, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), \"relevant conduct\" is limited to the foreseeable acts resulting from the defendant's particular agreement. Thus, the scope of relevant conduct is \"not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Laboy was a high-level gang member who fully participated in the LGD's drug trade.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> He was one of the \"heads\" of the gang charged with overseeing gang activities designed to protect the LGD's heroin operation. Through his leadership in the LGD he helped to keep other dealers out of LGD \"turf,\" ensuring that only he and his fellow LGD members would be able to deal heroin in the area. He stepped in to supply Flores's customers when the LGD \"Lord\" was out of town. He had other LGD members sell drugs on his behalf. Indeed, Laboy's actions closely resemble an example from the guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Q, [a] street-level drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2, illus.(c)(6)). Given the record of Laboy's cooperation with other LGD members involved in the heroin trade, the district court correctly considered their jointly undertaken criminal activity in determining the quantity of drugs for which Laboy was responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the drug quantity calculation, Laboy next argues that the district court impermissibly multiplied drug amounts from single sales by the estimated frequency of those sales to arrive at a total of more than one kilogram. Indeed, rote multiplication of quantities from a <i>single</i> exchange is, taken alone, an improper method for determining overall drug quantities. <i>See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d 224, 233 (1st Cir.1999). This is especially true where an estimate of quantity is multiplied by an estimate of frequency. Rather, drug quantities must find specific support in the record, and \"where significant uncertainty exists, those findings [must] err on the side of caution.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when \"the amount [of drugs] seized does not represent the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). We have held that, when \"it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes, a reasoned estimate will suffice.\" <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also United States v. Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir.1999)(upholding a \"reasoned approximation of drug quantity, well supported by a preponderance of the evidence\"); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 162 F.3d 135, 149 (1st Cir.1998)(upholding a \"reasoned, if not conservative, estimate of the drug quantity involved\" in the offense). We have upheld findings that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and are based on a \"conservative approach.\" <i>U.S. v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 113-14 (1st Cir.1990). Thus, the mere fact that a district court used estimates to determine drug quantities does not, alone, constitute reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its estimates, the district court looked both at gang activities and at Laboy's direct involvement with various dealers. First, the court accounted for sales by LGD members Kenny Cruz and Roberto Pagan, who worked directly for another LGD \"captain,\" Edgardo Colon. In pleading guilty to conspiracy charges, Cruz admitted that he was directly responsible for 750 grams of heroin. Pagan similarly pleaded guilty, taking responsibility for at least 1000 grams of heroin. These admissions alone account for almost twice the court's one kilogram finding. However, to ensure a conservative estimate, the court reduced the amounts attributed to Pagan and Cruz to between 542-828 and 427-499 grams respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also looked at sales by members of the LGD leadership. Edgardo Colon sold heroin to a CW and gave out his brother Wilberto's beeper number to set up future sales. Another captain, Antonio Santiago, admitted to selling more than 100 grams. The LGD \"Lord,\" Luis Flores, sold heroin to a CW, tried to recruit the CW to sell heroin on his behalf, and admitted to selling \"rock\" 24 hours a day. He stated at the September 26 LGD meeting: \"My life ... all I do is sell my drugs....\" All told, CWs purchased 108 grams of heroin from LGD members in controlled buys, undoubtedly a small fraction of what its members were distributing to other sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This extensive record of individual sales by LGD members, added to Laboy's own activities, supports attributing one kilogram of heroin to Laboy. Indeed, it is a conservative estimate. In opposition, Laboy contends that some of the testimony and admissions used by the district court in making its determination were unreliable. However, \"[t]he appraisal of amount depends on inference drawing and perhaps credibility and we are not only loath but forbidden to substitute our own <i>de novo</i> assessment for that of the judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first hand.\" <i>U.S. v. Picanso,</i> 333 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.2003). Thus we find no error in the court's decision to hold Laboy responsible for one kilogram of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Role Adjustment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy also argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by finding that he was an \"organizer or a leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. In applying U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, \"a district court must make both a status determination &#8212; a finding that the defendant acted as a leader or organizer of the criminal activity &#8212; and a scope determination &#8212; a finding that the criminal activity met either the numerosity or extensiveness benchmarks established by the guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1995). Determining the defendant's role in the offense is necessarily a \"fact-specific task.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110. We review the district court's factual findings for clear error, giving \"due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" <i>United States v. Joyce,</i> 70 F.3d 679, 681 (1st Cir.1995). We review its legal interpretation of the guidelines de novo. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Brennick,</i> 337 F.3d 107, 110 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with the determination of drug quantities, the court may draw on all \"relevant conduct\" when determining whether the defendant was an \"organizer or leader\" for the purposes of the guidelines. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz-Batista,</i> 956 F.2d 351, 353-54 (1st Cir.1992). The guidelines direct the sentencing court to a variety of factors in making this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. (n.4). The record demonstrates that Laboy engaged in several of these activities. He attended LGD meetings and was identified as a leader in the gang, ranking just below the LGD \"Lord.\" Lower level gang members were directed to take their problems to Laboy and the other \"heads\" of the LGD. The LGD claimed a share of heroin proceeds to be placed in the \"fundle.\" Laboy had several gang members selling drugs on his behalf. He even attempted to recruit at least one CW to sell heroin for him. Based on this record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Laboy was a leader or organizer of the LGD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While conceding that the district court may look to all \"relevant conduct\" when determining the \"organizer\" or \"leader\" elements, appellant would have us limit the \"five or more participants\" and \"otherwise extensive\" elements solely to the offenses of conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> In essence, appellant argues that the numerosity/extensiveness requirement must be satisfied only by people directly involved in the three drug sales to which Laboy pleaded guilty, and not by the people or organization that contributed to the \"relevant conduct\" surrounding those specific offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our precedent does not support such an approach. Rather, we have said that the extensiveness requirement depends on \"the totality of the circumstances, including... the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.\" <i>Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d at 53. On several occasions, we have found the extensiveness requirement met by the relevant conduct surrounding the offense of conviction. <i>See, e.g., Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d at 113 (finding that a scheme to smuggle illegal immigrants met the extensiveness requirement because of \"the breadth of the activities, whether measured in terms of duration, number of clients, or geographic reach....\"); <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 76 n. 7 (1st Cir.1995)(finding the extensiveness requirement met by \"a ledger that established a wide-ranging pattern of drug trafficking activities, and a trash bag containing thousands of empty vials used to package crack cocaine.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the commentary to the guidelines does not support appellant's reading. The introductory commentary to Chapter 3, part B simply states that the \"defendant's role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of &#167; 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)... and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.\" U.S.S.G. Ch.3, Pt.B, intro. cmt. It does not distinguish between any of the various elements that may lead to a role in the offense adjustment. Further, the commentary to &#167; 3B1.1 refers to determining whether an \"organization\" involved in a crime, rather than the crime itself, is otherwise extensive. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. (n.3). It also states that the sentence should increase with \"the size of a criminal organization,\" without expressly limiting extensiveness or complexity to the crime of conviction. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. (backg'd.). Thus, both our precedent and the commission's commentary indicate that district courts may consider relevant conduct beyond the crime of conviction when determining the numerosity and extensiveness requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant conduct surrounding Laboy's heroin sales included \"five or more participants\" and demonstrated that the LGD was an \"otherwise extensive\" organization under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. The LGD consisted of more than 20 members, organized to protect gang \"turf\" and prevent any other gangs from competing with their heroin \"business\" in the Lawrence area. Lower level gang members, or \"soldiers,\" were required to go on \"missions\" to carry out gang objectives. Members pooled funds from their individual drug sales to ensure that LGD members could be bailed out of jail and have access to firearms. Finally, the LGD had a clear hierarchy, with Luis Flores as the \"Lord\" of the gang, and several \"captains\", including Laboy, who collectively directed gang activity. This record is more than sufficient to support a determination that the LGD was \"otherwise extensive\" or included \"five or more participants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the district court's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The total weight of the heroin that Laboy sold on these three occasions was approximately 2.54 grams</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court estimated that the average bundle of heroin sold by LGD members during the investigation was approximately .23 grams.

The FBI suspected that LGD members were, among other activities, selling heroin in the Lawrence, Massachusetts area. The FBI used surveillance devices to monitor LGD meetings and used cooperating witnesses (\"CWs\") to make controlled purchases of heroin from suspected LGD members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1999, appellant Victor Laboy made three documented heroin sales to CWs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On July 9, 1999, Laboy sold heroin to a CW who originally wanted to buy from Luis Flores, the highest ranking member of the LGD. Laboy told the CW that he could take care of the CW from his own supply; that he and Flores were partners; and that their source of heroin was the same. Indeed, the markings on the packages that Laboy sold that day matched those on packages that Flores sold on previous occasions. At one point, Laboy suggested that he and the CW join together to sell heroin in nearby Haverhill, Massachusetts. After the sale, he called Flores, in the CW's presence, in an attempt to replenish his stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This scene repeated itself three days later when a CW, again unable to find Flores, instead sought out Laboy. Laboy again supplied heroin and stated that he and Flores were partners. Again, he expressed interest in partnering with the CW to sell heroin in another city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 1999, a CW made a third purchase from Laboy. At this meeting, Laboy stated that he was no longer in partnership with Flores because Flores' source was selling inferior quality heroin and Laboy was losing money on it. Now he was running his own operation and had at least one person working for him. Again, he tried to recruit the CW to sell heroin on his behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 28, 1999, a CW accompanied Laboy in an attempt to collect money from yet another person who was dealing heroin for Laboy. During their conversation, Laboy told the CW about his \"regular customers,\" including one who \"comes every two days ... for six or seven [bundles].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> They proceeded to search for Wilberto Colon, whom Laboy identified as one of his suppliers. They planned to purchase 10 grams from Colon that day, and Laboy indicated that he had purchased as much as 20 grams from Colon in the past. Eventually they discarded the idea because Laboy discovered that Colon had just made a sale of 20 grams. In Laboy's estimation, there would not be a ready market for more heroin that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy was not the only member of the LGD that sold heroin during the summer and fall of 1999. The FBI documented more than 100 grams of direct heroin sales by Laboy's associates during its investigation. Several of these members acknowledged a relationship with Laboy. Wilberto Colon discussed his heroin business with a CW in Laboy's presence and stated that he sold to \"Papito,\" Laboy's street name. Two CWs stated that they sold several bundles a day on Laboy's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the fall of 1999, Laboy had moved to Salem, New Hampshire &#8212; a town about six miles from Lawrence. Nevertheless, he returned to Lawrence to attend LGD meetings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> During these meetings, LGD members discussed the distribution of drug proceeds. Flores demanded that he receive $50 from each sale by LGD members: \"We got a business on Park Street... I give you a bundle [of heroin], I want fifty bucks out of it ... if I'm paying for it, you gonna give me my money regardless....\" They discussed the failure of some members to contribute money to the gang \"fundle\" &#8212; a fund used to purchase firearms and bail out gang members who had been arrested.

It also considered the admissions made by other LGD members who had pleaded guilty to heroin distribution, including information about quantities and frequency of sales. The court examined Laboy's relationship with other LGD members, both through the gang and individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found, by clear and convincing evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that Laboy and other LGD members had \"jointly undertaken\" various activities, within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to advance their collective heroin business. Because of this cooperation, the court held Laboy accountable for all heroin distributed by other LGD members during the course of the FBI's investigation. It further found that LGD members had distributed, and thus that Laboy was responsible for, more than one kilogram of heroin. Finally, it found that Laboy, through his role in the LGD, was an organizer or leader of an \"otherwise extensive\" organization, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. The court applied a base offense level of 32, with a 4 point adjustment for Laboy's role in the offense, and a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. It sentenced him to 168 months in prison, 3 years supervised release and a $300 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Laboy offers two arguments: first, that the district court erred in holding him responsible for more than one kilogram of heroin, and second, that it erred in adjusting his sentence for his leadership role in the LGD.

Drug quantity determinations are not limited to the amounts involved in the offense of conviction. Rather, a defendant may be held responsible for drug quantities involved in his \"relevant conduct.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3. Such conduct may include a defendant's own acts or the acts of others: the sentencing guidelines provide responsibility for the acts of others in the case of \"jointly undertaken criminal activity\", which includes any \"criminal plan, scheme, endeavor or enterprise undertaken by defendant in concert with others.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). The guidelines state that a defendant may be held responsible for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> In the case of controlled substances, the defendant is responsible for \"all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt.

Thus, the scope of relevant conduct is \"not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that Laboy was a high-level gang member who fully participated in the LGD's drug trade.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> He was one of the \"heads\" of the gang charged with overseeing gang activities designed to protect the LGD's heroin operation. Through his leadership in the LGD he helped to keep other dealers out of LGD \"turf,\" ensuring that only he and his fellow LGD members would be able to deal heroin in the area. He stepped in to supply Flores's customers when the LGD \"Lord\" was out of town. He had other LGD members sell drugs on his behalf. Indeed, Laboy's actions closely resemble an example from the guidelines:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Q, [a] street-level drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, cmt. (n.2, illus.(c)(6)). Given the record of Laboy's cooperation with other LGD members involved in the heroin trade, the district court correctly considered their jointly undertaken criminal activity in determining the quantity of drugs for which Laboy was responsible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the drug quantity calculation, Laboy next argues that the district court impermissibly multiplied drug amounts from single sales by the estimated frequency of those sales to arrive at a total of more than one kilogram. Indeed, rote multiplication of quantities from a <i>single</i> exchange is, taken alone, an improper method for determining overall drug quantities. <i>See United States v. Rivera-Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198682\"><a href=\"/opinion/198682/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 233 (1st Cir.1999). This is especially true where an estimate of quantity is multiplied by an estimate of frequency. Rather, drug quantities must find specific support in the record, and \"where significant uncertainty exists, those findings [must] err on the side of caution.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when \"the amount [of drugs] seized does not represent the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). We have held that, when \"it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes, a reasoned estimate will suffice.\" <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 871 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also United States v.

We have upheld findings that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and are based on a \"conservative approach.\" <i>U.S. v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 113-14 (1st Cir.1990). Thus, the mere fact that a district court used estimates to determine drug quantities does not, alone, constitute reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making its estimates, the district court looked both at gang activities and at Laboy's direct involvement with various dealers. First, the court accounted for sales by LGD members Kenny Cruz and Roberto Pagan, who worked directly for another LGD \"captain,\" Edgardo Colon. In pleading guilty to conspiracy charges, Cruz admitted that he was directly responsible for 750 grams of heroin. Pagan similarly pleaded guilty, taking responsibility for at least 1000 grams of heroin. These admissions alone account for almost twice the court's one kilogram finding. However, to ensure a conservative estimate, the court reduced the amounts attributed to Pagan and Cruz to between 542-828 and 427-499 grams respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also looked at sales by members of the LGD leadership. Edgardo Colon sold heroin to a CW and gave out his brother Wilberto's beeper number to set up future sales. Another captain, Antonio Santiago, admitted to selling more than 100 grams. The LGD \"Lord,\" Luis Flores, sold heroin to a CW, tried to recruit the CW to sell heroin on his behalf, and admitted to selling \"rock\" 24 hours a day. He stated at the September 26 LGD meeting: \"My life ... all I do is sell my drugs....\" All told, CWs purchased 108 grams of heroin from LGD members in controlled buys, undoubtedly a small fraction of what its members were distributing to other sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This extensive record of individual sales by LGD members, added to Laboy's own activities, supports attributing one kilogram of heroin to Laboy. Indeed, it is a conservative estimate. In opposition, Laboy contends that some of the testimony and admissions used by the district court in making its determination were unreliable. However, \"[t]he appraisal of amount depends on inference drawing and perhaps credibility and we are not only loath but forbidden to substitute our own <i>de novo</i> assessment for that of the judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first hand.\" <i>U.S. v. Picanso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200513\"><a href=\"/opinion/200513/united-states-v-picanso/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2003). Thus we find no error in the court's decision to hold Laboy responsible for one kilogram of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Role Adjustment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboy also argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by finding that he was an \"organizer or a leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. In applying U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, \"a district court must make both a status determination &#8212; a finding that the defendant acted as a leader or organizer of the criminal activity &#8212; and a scope determination &#8212; a finding that the criminal activity met either the numerosity or extensiveness benchmarks established by the guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.1995). Determining the defendant's role in the offense is necessarily a \"fact-specific task.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110. We review the district court's factual findings for clear error, giving \"due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\" <i>United States v. Joyce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196428\"><a href=\"/opinion/196428/united-states-v-joyce/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span>, 681 (1st Cir.1995). We review its legal interpretation of the guidelines de novo. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Brennick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200579\"><a href=\"/opinion/200579/united-states-v-brennick/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with the determination of drug quantities, the court may draw on all \"relevant conduct\" when determining whether the defendant was an \"organizer or leader\" for the purposes of the guidelines. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz-Batista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577675\"><a href=\"/opinion/577675/united-states-v-elvis-leonidas-ruiz-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 353-54 (1st Cir.1992). The guidelines direct the sentencing court to a variety of factors in making this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. (n.4). The record demonstrates that Laboy engaged in several of these activities. He attended LGD meetings and was identified as a leader in the gang, ranking just below the LGD \"Lord.\" Lower level gang members were directed to take their problems to Laboy and the other \"heads\" of the LGD. The LGD claimed a share of heroin proceeds to be placed in the \"fundle.\" Laboy had several gang members selling drugs on his behalf. He even attempted to recruit at least one CW to sell heroin for him. Based on this record, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Laboy was a leader or organizer of the LGD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While conceding that the district court may look to all \"relevant conduct\" when determining the \"organizer\" or \"leader\" elements, appellant would have us limit the \"five or more participants\" and \"otherwise extensive\" elements solely to the offenses of conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> In essence, appellant argues that the numerosity/extensiveness requirement must be satisfied only by people directly involved in the three drug sales to which Laboy pleaded guilty, and not by the people or organization that contributed to the \"relevant conduct\" surrounding those specific offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our precedent does not support such an approach. Rather, we have said that the extensiveness requirement depends on \"the totality of the circumstances, including... the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.\" <i>Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d at 53. On several occasions, we have found the extensiveness requirement met by the relevant conduct surrounding the offense of conviction. <i>See, e.g., Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d at 113 (finding that a scheme to smuggle illegal immigrants met the extensiveness requirement because of \"the breadth of the activities, whether measured in terms of duration, number of clients, or geographic reach....\"); <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 76 n. 7 (1st Cir.1995)(finding the extensiveness requirement met by \"a ledger that established a wide-ranging pattern of drug trafficking activities, and a trash bag containing thousands of empty vials used to package crack cocaine.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the commentary to the guidelines does not support appellant's reading. The introductory commentary to Chapter 3, part B simply states that the \"defendant's role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of &#167; 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)... and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.\" U.S.S.G. Ch.3, Pt.B, intro. cmt. It does not distinguish between any of the various elements that may lead to a role in the offense adjustment. Further, the commentary to &#167; 3B1.1 refers to determining whether an \"organization\" involved in a crime, rather than the crime itself, is otherwise extensive. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. (n.3). It also states that the sentence should increase with \"the size of a criminal organization,\" without expressly limiting extensiveness or complexity to the crime of conviction. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, cmt. (backg'd.). Thus, both our precedent and the commission's commentary indicate that district courts may consider relevant conduct beyond the crime of conviction when determining the numerosity and extensiveness requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant conduct surrounding Laboy's heroin sales included \"five or more participants\" and demonstrated that the LGD was an \"otherwise extensive\" organization under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1. The LGD consisted of more than 20 members, organized to protect gang \"turf\" and prevent any other gangs from competing with their heroin \"business\" in the Lawrence area. Lower level gang members, or \"soldiers,\" were required to go on \"missions\" to carry out gang objectives. Members pooled funds from their individual drug sales to ensure that LGD members could be bailed out of jail and have access to firearms. Finally, the LGD had a clear hierarchy, with Luis Flores as the \"Lord\" of the gang, and several \"captains\", including Laboy, who collectively directed gang activity. This record is more than sufficient to support a determination that the LGD was \"otherwise extensive\" or included \"five or more participants.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the district court's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The total weight of the heroin that Laboy sold on these three occasions was approximately 2.54 grams</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court estimated that the average bundle of heroin sold by LGD members during the investigation was approximately .23 grams.

Appellant replies that he could not object at sentencing because the specific method of quantity calculation was revealed only in a subsequent memorandum from the court.

The record, however, does not support this argument. As noted above,<i>see supra</i> note 3, FBI videotapes recorded Laboy's presence at LGD meetings on September 29, 1999 and October 24, 1999.
