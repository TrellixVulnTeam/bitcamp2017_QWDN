Michael   A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Kenneth Ira Spigle on brief for appellant.\n     Peter H. Martin, Assistant City Solicitor, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                          July 23, 2002\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge.         On July 18, 2000, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Tower Ventures, Inc. (Ventures) applied to the Westfield,\n\nMassachusetts, planning board for permission to build a wireless\n\ncommunication tower at a specified site.          After the planning board\n\nvoted to deny the permit, Ventures brought suit in the federal\n\ndistrict court against the city and various municipal officials.\n\nVentures alleged that the planning board's decision was arbitrary\n\nand effectively prevented it from providing cellular coverage in a\n\nsignificant area, thus violating both the Massachusetts Zoning Act,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, § 17, and the Telecommunications Act of\n\n1996, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c). The defendants denied these allegations.\n\n          On May 30, 2001, the district court entered a scheduling\n\norder that, inter alia, required Ventures, on or before July 16,\n\n2001, to effectuate certain basic discovery, designate its expert\n\nwitnesses, and disclose specified information about those witnesses\n\nand their findings.       See Fed. R. Civ. P 16(b), 26(a)(2).          The\n\ndeadline came and went without any discernible effort by Ventures\n\nto produce the materials required by the scheduling order.\n\n          On August 14, 2001, the parties jointly moved to revise\n\nthe scheduling order. In that motion, Ventures represented that it\n\nhad been unable to comply with the order because of its counsel's\n\nengagements   elsewhere    and   the    \"summer    vacations   of   certain\n\nindividuals needed to provide information to assist in providing\n\ndiscovery responses.\"      The motion asked the court to extend the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdate for furnishing discovery materials to August 17, 2001, and to\n\nset a deadline of October 19, 2001 for the filing of Ventures's\n\nanticipated summary judgment motion.                 The court acquiesced and\n\nimmediately entered an order memorializing the proposed time line.\n\nDespite the court's order, nothing happened.\n\n           On   November     6     —    eighty-one    days   after     the      revised\n\ndeadline for Ventures to serve its expert witness disclosure and\n\nresponses to discovery, and eighteen days after Ventures's summary\n\njudgment motion was due — the district court, citing Ventures's\n\nserial   violations    of    the       court's     scheduling      order,       directed\n\nVentures to show cause why the action should not be dismissed with\n\nprejudice.      On   the    same       date,    Ventures   moved    for     a    further\n\nextension of the lapsed due dates because of \"unexpected delays in\n\nassembling the information\" necessary to comply with its discovery\n\nobligations.1\n\n             Ventures filed a timely response to the show-cause order,\n\nasserting that it had furnished some draft discovery; that the\n\ndefendants had not objected to the requested extension of the\n\nscheduling order;2 and that, in all events, the defendants would\n\nnot be prejudiced by a further delay.                      Pertinently, however,\n\n\n\n     1\n      The court's show-cause order and Ventures's motion for a\nfurther extension of time apparently crossed in the mail.\n     2\n      This is not to say that there was an agreement among counsel.\nThe defendants simply elected to leave the matter to the district\ncourt's discretion.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fVentures gave no reason for its noncompliance beyond a general\n\nstatement that its counsel had been preoccupied with the handling\n\nof other matters.\n\n             On November 21, 2001, the district court dismissed the\n\ncase   for    failure   to   comply   with    court    orders   and   want   of\n\nprosecution.     Tower Ventures, Inc.        v. City of Westfield, No. 00-\n\n30196, slip op. at 4 (D. Mass. Nov. 21, 2001) (unpublished).                 The\n\ncourt's rescript emphasized that Ventures had failed to provide an\n\nadequate explanation for its noncompliance:              \"all the court has\n\nbeen told is that [Ventures] has, on two occasions now, simply\n\nignored      court-ordered   deadlines       because   of   difficulties      in\n\nproviding basic discovery.\"       Id. at 3.\n\n             Ventures moved for reconsideration, arguing, inter alia,\n\nthat it had belatedly furnished the overdue discovery materials.\n\nThe district court summarily denied the motion.                  This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n             In an era of burgeoning case loads and thronged dockets,\n\neffective case management has become an essential tool for handling\n\ncivil litigation.       The Civil Rules recognize this reality; they\n\nafford district courts substantial authority to enforce case-\n\nmanagement orders.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f); see also Jones v.\n\nWinnepesaukee Realty, 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             We have made it plain that \"a litigant who ignores case-\n\nmanagement deadlines does so at his peril.\"                 Rosario-Diaz v.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fGonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).             Consequently, when\n\nnoncompliance occurs, the court may choose from a broad universe of\n\npossible sanctions.      This flexibility is necessary because the\n\ncircumstances attendant to noncompliance are apt to differ widely.\n\nIn the last analysis, then, the choice of an appropriate sanction\n\nmust be handled on a case-by-case basis. See Robson v. Hallenbeck,\n\n81 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that this exercise\n\n\"def[ies] mechanical rules\").\n\n           From a plaintiff's standpoint, the most dreaded sanction\n\nis dismissal with prejudice. Although this is strong medicine, not\n\ncasually   to     be   dispensed,    a    court     may,      in    appropriate\n\ncircumstances, dismiss a case with prejudice for violation of a\n\njudicial order without consideration of lesser sanctions.                    See,\n\ne.g., Top Entertainment Inc. v. Ortega, 285 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1990);\n\nsee also Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962).\n\nAlthough dismissal ordinarily should be employed only when a\n\nplaintiff's     misconduct     is   extreme,       see     Enlace    Mercantil\n\nInternacional, Inc. v. Senior Indus., Inc., 848 F.2d 315, 317 (1st\n\nCir. 1988),     disobedience   of   court    orders,     in   and   of   itself,\n\nconstitutes extreme misconduct (and, thus, warrants dismissal), see\n\nCosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           This   principle    applies      with   undiminished      force    to\n\nscheduling orders.     To manage a crowded calendar efficiently and\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\feffectively, a trial court must take an active role in case\n\nmanagement.   Scheduling orders are essential tools in that process\n\n— and a party's disregard of such orders robs them of their\n\nutility.    For that reason, litigants have an \"unflagging duty to\n\ncomply with clearly communicated case-management orders.\" Rosario-\n\nDiaz, 140   F.3d at 315.\n\n            This   does   not   mean    either   that   every   breach   of   a\n\nscheduling order warrants dismissal or that appellate courts will\n\nrubber-stamp the use of dismissal as a sanction, no matter how\n\narbitrary. We review a trial court's choice of sanction, dismissal\n\nincluded, for abuse of discretion.           Nat'l Hockey League v. Metro.\n\nHockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976) (per curiam); Jones, 990 F.2d\n\nat 5.   We caution, however, that this standard of review is not\n\nappellant-friendly — and a disgruntled litigant bears a heavy\n\nburden in attempting to show that an abuse occurred. United States\n\nv. One 1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir. 1993); Spiller v.\n\nU.S.V. Labs., Inc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the facts at hand.\n\nVentures maintains that dismissal is too harsh a sanction because\n\nits infractions were neither willful nor egregious.             It views this\n\nas a case in which counsel on both sides tacitly agreed to conduct\n\ndiscovery at their own pace, and emphasizes that the resultant\n\ndelay did not prejudice the defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          The difficulty with this argument is that it ignores the\n\ncourt's independent interest in administering its docket.               That\n\ninterest is strong, and the court's efforts at stewardship are\n\nundermined where, as here, a party cavalierly flouts the court's\n\nscheduling orders.      Unexcused misconduct of that stripe places the\n\nchoice of sanction (up to, and including, dismissal) within the\n\nsound discretion of the district court. See Top Entertainment, 285\n\nF.3d at 118; Barreto v. Citibank, N.A., 907 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n          To be sure, violation of a scheduling order may be\n\nexcused if good cause exists for the offender's failure to comply.\n\nSee Robson, 81 F.3d at 3.        Here, however, the district court's\n\nshow-cause order gave Ventures an opportunity to explain its serial\n\nfailures to honor the discovery schedule. Ventures responded in\n\nempty generalities, stating only that its counsel had encountered\n\n\"unexpected delays\" in assembling discovery. This conclusory reply\n\nwas wholly uninformative.       As the lower court aptly observed, the\n\n\"[p]laintiff's explanation explain[ed] nothing.\"         Tower Ventures,\n\nslip op. at 3.    If there was a legitimate reason for Ventures's\n\nfailure   to   comply    with   the    scheduling   order,   it   was    not\n\ncommunicated to the district court.3\n\n\n\n     3\n      Certainly, the fact that Ventures's counsel was busy with\nother cases is no excuse. See, e.g., Mendez v. Banco Popular de\nP.R., 900 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1990); Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA, 574\nF.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (per curiam).\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            When, as in this case, a non-complying party has been\n\nafforded an opportunity to explain its failure to abide by a court\n\norder, we give a wide berth to the presider's judgment that, under\n\nall the circumstances, the proffered justification is insufficient.\n\nSee Robson 81 F.3d at 5.        So it is here:     the absence of a\n\nlegitimate reason, coupled with the fact that the court previously\n\nhad granted Ventures an extension, made dismissal an appropriate\n\nsanction.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the second extension request are damning.\n\nThe initial motion to extend the timetable set by the scheduling\n\norder was filed on August 14, 2001.     In it, the parties requested\n\nthat the time for Ventures's responses to discovery and designation\n\nof experts be extended to August 17 — a mere three days later.   The\n\ncourt had every right to expect, when it granted the requested\n\nextension, that Ventures would comply immediately.      But Ventures\n\nthen proceeded to ignore the August 17 deadline that it had\n\nsuggested.     That is unacceptable.     When a litigant seeks an\n\nextension of time and proposes a compliance date, the court is\n\nentitled to expect that the litigant will meet its self-imposed\n\ndeadline.    Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R., 900 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   In the absence of excusatory circumstances — and none have\n\nbeen identified here — the litigant's failure to do so warrants an\n\ninference of deliberate manipulation.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f                In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,\n\nVentures argues that the defendants were not prejudiced by its\n\nprocrastination, and, therefore, that dismissal is inapropos. That\n\nassessment is far too glib.            Although prejudice to the defendants\n\ncan be a factor in determining whether dismissal is a condign\n\nsanction,       see,    e.g.,   Robson,   81    F.3d   at   3,   the   analysis   is\n\nmultifaceted, and the presence or absence of prejudice is not\n\ndeterminative.          To hold otherwise would devalue the judiciary's\n\nstrong institutional interest in ensuring that litigants honor\n\ncourt orders.          See Legault v. Zambarano, 105 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); see also Damiani v. R.I. Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1983).\n\n                We need go no further.4         In National Hockey League, the\n\nSupreme Court explained that sanctions for discovery violations\n\nhave a dual purpose:            they serve not only to punish the offender\n\nbut also to deter others from similar misconduct.                  427 U.S. at 642-\n\n43.       The    sanction    imposed   here     achieves    both    ends.    It   is\n\nreasonably commensurate to the infraction, and its imposition sends\n\na clear signal to others that court orders must be obeyed.                  See id.\n\nat 643 (suggesting that dismissal as a sanction may prevent other\n\nlitigants from \"feel[ing] freer than we think . . . they should\n\n\n      4\n      Inasmuch as the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin dismissing this action on the basis of Ventures's failure to\ncomply with the scheduling order, we do not consider whether it\nwould have been an abuse of discretion to dismiss for want of\nprosecution.\n\n                                          -9-\n\ffeel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts\").\n\nViewed in this light, the dismissal of this case for noncompliance\n\nwith the scheduling order was well within the ambit of the trial\n\ncourt's discretion.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

(Ventures) applied to the Westfield, Massachusetts, planning board for permission to build a wireless communication tower at a specified site. After the planning board voted to deny the permit, Ventures brought suit in the federal district court against the city and various municipal officials. Ventures alleged that the planning board's decision was arbitrary and effectively prevented it from providing cellular coverage in a significant area, thus violating both the Massachusetts Zoning Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &#167; 17, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 332(c). The defendants denied these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, the district court entered a scheduling order that, inter alia, required Ventures, on or before July 16, 2001, to effectuate certain basic discovery, designate its expert witnesses, and disclose specified information about those witnesses and their findings. <i>See</i> Fed. R. Civ. P 16(b), 26(a)(2).

In that motion, Ventures represented that it had been unable to comply with the order because of its counsel's engagements elsewhere and the \"summer vacations of certain individuals needed to provide information to assist in providing discovery responses.\" The motion asked the court to extend the date for furnishing discovery materials to August 17, 2001, and to set a deadline of October 19, 2001 for the filing of Ventures's anticipated summary judgment motion. The court acquiesced and immediately entered an order memorializing the proposed time line.

On the same date, Ventures moved for a further extension of the lapsed due dates because of \"unexpected delays in assembling the information\" necessary to comply with its discovery obligations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ventures filed a timely response to the show-cause order, asserting that it had furnished some draft discovery; that the defendants had not objected to the requested extension of the scheduling order;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and that, in all events, the defendants would not be prejudiced by a further delay.

City of Westfield,</i> No. 00-30196, slip op. at 4 (D.Mass. Nov. 21, 2001) (unpublished). The court's rescript emphasized that Ventures had failed to provide an adequate explanation for its noncompliance: \"all the court has been told is that [Ventures] has, on two occasions now, simply ignored court-ordered deadlines because of difficulties in providing basic discovery.\" <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ventures moved for reconsideration, arguing, inter alia, that it had belatedly furnished the overdue discovery materials.

Consequently, when noncompliance occurs, the court may choose from a broad universe of possible sanctions. This flexibility is necessary because the circumstances attendant to noncompliance are apt to differ widely. In the last analysis, then, the choice of an appropriate sanction must be handled on a case-by-case basis. <i>See Robson v. Hallenbeck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196677\"><a href=\"/opinion/196677/robson-v-hallenbeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that this exercise \"def[ies] mechanical rules\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From a plaintiff's standpoint, the most dreaded sanction is dismissal with prejudice.

In the absence of excusatory circumstances &#8212; and none have been identified here &#8212; the litigant's failure to do so warrants an inference of deliberate manipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Ventures argues that the defendants were not prejudiced by its procrastination, and, therefore, that dismissal is inapropos. That assessment is far too glib. Although prejudice to the defendants can be a factor in determining whether dismissal is a condign sanction, <i>see, e.g., Robson,</i> 81 F.3d at 3, the analysis is multifaceted, and the presence or absence of prejudice is not determinative. To hold otherwise would devalue the judiciary's strong institutional interest in ensuring that litigants honor court orders. <i>See Legault v. Zambarano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197179\"><a href=\"/opinion/197179/legault-v-arusso/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1997); <i>see also Damiani v.
