Courtney for appellant.\n     Maura D. McLaughlin, Assistant Massachusetts Attorney General,\nwith whom Thomas F. Reilly, Massachusetts Attorney General, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 26, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation\n\f            Stafford,   Senior   District     Judge.       In   1991,   a\n\nMassachusetts    Superior   Court    jury   convicted    Michael   Caputo\n\n(\"Caputo\") on two counts of first-degree murder.          Caputo appeals\n\nthe district court's order denying his petition for writ of habeas\n\ncorpus by a person in state custody.          Because the state court\n\ndecision affirming his conviction was neither contrary to, nor an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            In the early morning hours of November 2, 1989, two\n\nBoston police officers were dispatched to a second-floor apartment\n\nin the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.2          In the apartment's\n\nbedroom, the police found the bodies of Caputo's estranged wife and\n\nmother-in-law.    Caputo's wife had been stabbed twenty-two times,\n\nhis mother-in-law seventeen times.        Caputo's two young daughters,\n\nwho were unharmed, were also found in the apartment.\n\n            Noting an open kitchen window that led to the back porch,\n\nthe police discovered that the telephone wires to the apartment had\n\nbeen cut.    There was no sign of forced entry.        On the dining room\n\ntable, the police found a protective order dated July 31, 1989,\n\nordering Caputo to refrain from abusing his wife and to stay away\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The facts, which are not challenged by Caputo, are taken from\nthe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's recitation of the facts.\nCommonwealth v. Caputo, 786 N.E.2d 352, 355-58 (Mass. 2003).\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffrom the Jamaica Plain apartment.         The order contained Caputo's\n\naddress in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\n            After the Boston police notified the Plymouth Police\n\nDepartment that Caputo was a suspect in a double homicide, six\n\nPlymouth    police   officers,    including     Sergeant    Thornton   Morse\n\n(\"Morse\")   and   Sergeant   Richard   Dorman    (\"Dorman\"),    arrived   at\n\nCaputo's house.      Caputo opened the front door after the officers\n\nrepeatedly knocked on the front and rear doors.            Morse and Dorman\n\nintroduced themselves, then asked whether they could enter the\n\nhouse to speak with Caputo.      Caputo acquiesced.\n\n            Once inside the house, Dorman informed Caputo that they\n\nwere investigating a double homicide on behalf of the Boston Police\n\nDepartment.    From a printed card, Dorman read Caputo his rights\n\nunder Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 467-73 (1966). When Dorman\n\nasked Caputo whether he understood his rights, Caputo initially\n\nreplied: \"No.\"    Dorman then repeated each right, asking after each\n\nwhether Caputo understood.       Caputo replied affirmatively to each,\n\nthen said that he thought it best if he said nothing further.             The\n\nofficers immediately stopped all questioning of Caputo.           They were\n\nnot, however, asked to leave the house.\n\n            After Dorman informed Caputo that they were investigating\n\na double homicide, Caputo asked Dorman who had died.                   Dorman\n\nreplied that he did not know.      Soon thereafter, wanting to obtain\n\nmore information about the investigation to pass along to Caputo,\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fMorse asked whether he could use Caputo's telephone to call the\n\nPlymouth police station.        Caputo agreed that Morse could use his\n\nphone.      At the conclusion of his call to the station, Morse\n\ninformed Caputo that the Plymouth police could not then supply any\n\nadditional information about the double homicide.\n\n             Leaving some of the officers inside the house, Dorman\n\nwent outside to examine the automobile parked in Caputo's driveway.\n\nThe vehicle matched the description given to the Plymouth police.\n\nThe hood was warm to the touch, and a registration plate with a\n\nnumber     other    than   Caputo's    registration        number    covered    the\n\nautomobile's assigned registration plate.                  It was later learned\n\nthat the outer registration plate had been stolen from a vehicle in\n\nthe Jamaica Plain section of Boston.\n\n             When he re-entered the house, Dorman asked whether he\n\ncould use Caputo's telephone to again call the Plymouth police\n\nstation.     Caputo again agreed.           Within Caputo's hearing, Dorman\n\ninformed    the    lieutenant   on    the    line   that    Caputo   was   at   his\n\nresidence, that the engine of Caputo's automobile was warm, and that\n\nthere were two different registration plates on the automobile.\n\nSpontaneously, Caputo stated that he did not want to incriminate\n\nhimself but that he had a story to tell.            He then proceeded to tell\n\nthe officers that two men kidnapped him after forcing their way into\n\nhis home the night before and that he later awoke \"in a daze\" in the\n\nBraintree area wearing only his underwear. The officers did not ask\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fany questions in response to Caputo's unelicited statements.\n\n           At   the   request    of   the   officers,   Caputo   agreed   to\n\naccompany the officers to the Plymouth police station.              At the\n\nstation, Caputo was once more advised of his Miranda rights.\n\nIndeed, he was given a written copy delineating each right.          Caputo\n\nread the form, making a check mark after each right.             When asked\n\nwhether he wished to talk to the officers, Caputo replied: \"I'm not\n\nsure; I don’t know if I should say anything or not.         What should I\n\ndo?\"   Morse responded: \"I can’t tell you that, but I want you to be\n\naware of your rights and that you do not have to say anything to\n\nme.\"\n\n           Yet again, Morse informed Caputo of his Miranda rights,\n\nascertained that Caputo understood his rights, and asked Caputo\n\nwhether he wished to speak to the police.          Then, and only then,\n\nCaputo began to elaborate on the statement he had previously made\n\nin his home.    Among other things, Caputo told the officers that he\n\nremembered having blood on him, throwing an object out of his\n\nautomobile, and, at some point during the night, being outside his\n\nmother-in-law's home.\n\n           At approximately 9:20 A.M., Sergeant Detective Charles\n\nHorsley (\"Horsley\") of the Boston Police Department arrived at the\n\nPlymouth police station.        Informed that Caputo had been read his\n\nMiranda rights, Horsley interviewed Caputo for approximately forty-\n\nfive minutes.    When asked whether he had anything to do with the\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmurders, Caputo became upset and stopped talking.            Caputo asked to\n\nleave the police station but was informed that he was under arrest.\n\n             Later that same afternoon, the police executed a search\n\nwarrant at Caputo's residence.         They recovered a knife set from\n\nwhich one knife was missing.          A pair of \"tin snips\" capable of\n\ncutting telephone wires was found in Caputo's automobile.\n\n             On   November    17,   1989,   Caputo   was    charged    in   two\n\nindictments with the first-degree murders of his wife and mother-in-\n\nlaw.   Before trial, Caputo moved to suppress the statements that he\n\nmade at his home and at the police station.           After an evidentiary\n\nhearing, the motion judge denied Caputo's motions.           The judge found\n\nthat, on entering Caputo's house, the officers immediately informed\n\nCaputo of his Miranda rights, then ceased all questioning when\n\nCaputo indicated that he did not want to speak to them.               The judge\n\nalso found that, at the Plymouth police station, after he again\n\nreceived full and complete Miranda warnings, Caputo knowingly waived\n\nhis Miranda rights before he voluntarily answered police questions.\n\n             On March 21, 1991, a jury found Caputo guilty of two\n\ncounts of first-degree murder.        He was sentenced that same day to\n\ntwo consecutive life sentences.       The judgments were affirmed by the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") on April 15, 2003.\n\n             In   rejecting    Caputo's     claims   on    appeal,    the   SJC\n\nexplained:\n\n             First, before he made any statement, [Caputo]\n             received and acknowledged that he understood\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          his Miranda rights.    Second, when [Caputo]\n          indicated a wish not to speak to the police,\n          all questioning ceased. It was only after he\n          overheard   the   police   conversation   that\n          [Caputo] stated, unprovoked, that he had been\n          kidnapped the previous night. We do not agree\n          with [Caputo] that his statement should be\n          suppressed because the police officer's\n          request to use his telephone was \"reasonably\n          likely to elicit an incriminating response\"\n          from [Caputo], and therefore the \"functional\n          equivalent\" of an interrogation.           The\n          telephone call was a report and request for\n          further information, an action \"normally\n          attendant\" to police procedures. [Caputo's]\n          statement occurred only after and apparently\n          because he had overheard the telephone\n          conversation that tended to implicate him, not\n          because of any \"interrogation.\"\n\n               . . . [Caputo] gave his consent to the\n          police to enter his home, he did not ask them\n          to leave, and spoke to them only after he\n          recognized   that   the    police   had   seen\n          potentially incriminating evidence outside.\n          A defendant who is \"nervous\" because he is in\n          the presence of police within hours of\n          committing murder and who chooses to give\n          false information to the police in an attempt,\n          however clumsy, to throw them off the trail as\n          he perceives their attention focusing on him\n          as a suspect, cannot resort later to a claim\n          of coercion.\n\n                . . .\n\n               Because we reject [Caputo's] claims that\n          his statements to the police at his home\n          should have been suppressed, we need not\n          consider   his   argument   that  his   later\n          statements should have been suppressed as\n          \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n\nCommonwealth   v.   Caputo,   786   N.E.2d   352,   358-59   (Mass.   2003)\n\n(footnote and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            On April 12, 2004, Caputo filed a petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus in federal court. The district court entered judgment\n\nfor the respondent on December 5, 2005, and this timely appeal\n\nfollowed.    The district court thereafter issued a certificate of\n\nappealability, limiting the appeal to Caputo's claim that his\n\nprivilege    against    self-incrimination        was   violated    when   his\n\nstatements were introduced at trial.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            We review the federal district court's denial of Caputo's\n\npetition for writ of habeas corpus de novo.             Correia v. Hall, 364\n\nF.3d 385, 387 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Because Caputo's habeas petition was filed after April\n\n24, 1996, this court's review is governed by the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\n\n110 Stat. 1214 (1996).          As amended, AEDPA precludes the granting\n\nof habeas relief to a state prisoner unless the state court decision\n\n(1) \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\" or (2)\n\nresulted    in   a   decision    that     was   based   on   an   unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n\nState court proceeding.     28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).        Notably, the federal\n\nhabeas court shall presume that the state court's determination of\n\nfactual issues is correct, although the petitioner may rebut the\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpresumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.              Id.\n\n            A state court acts \"contrary to\" clearly established\n\nSupreme Court precedent if it \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to\n\nthat reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law\" or if it\n\n\"decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set\n\nof materially indistinguishable facts.\"            Williams v. Taylor, 529\n\nU.S. 362, 413 (2000) (Justice O'Connor's Part II majority opinion).\n\nA state court's decision involves an \"unreasonable application\" of\n\nclearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the\n\ngoverning legal principle from the Supreme Court's decisions but\n\nthen unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\n\nprisoner's case.       Id.   An \"unreasonable\" application, moreover, is\n\nan \"objectively unreasonable\" application.           Id., 529 U.S. at 409.\n\n                                        III.\n\n            Caputo contends that his conviction was obtained through\n\nevidence that was obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination. Specifically, he argues that\n\nthe statements he gave to the police at his house were not the\n\nproduct of a voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights but were the\n\nproduct of police tactics intended to elicit an incriminating\n\nresponse from him.       He also argues that the statements he made at\n\nthe police station, after he signed a waiver form, were the \"fruit\n\nof   the   poisonous    tree,\"    his    earlier   statements   having   been\n\ninvoluntarily made.\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f             In Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467-73, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat a person in custody must be warned prior to interrogation that\n\nhe has certain rights, including the right to remain silent.            Once\n\na person in custody invokes his Miranda protections, the government\n\ncannot use any evidence obtained through custodial interrogation\n\nunless the suspect knowingly waives his rights.        Id. at 479.      The\n\nterm \"interrogation\" under Miranda refers not only to express\n\nquestioning but also \"to any words or actions on the part of the\n\npolice (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody)\n\nthat the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an\n\nincriminating response from the suspect.\"       Rhode Island v. Innis,\n\n446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980).\n\n             Here, Caputo contends that the police officer's use of\n\nCaputo's telephone, in Caputo's presence, to relay information about\n\nwhat the officers found at Caputo's residence was the functional\n\nequivalent of interrogation because it was \"reasonably likely to\n\nelicit an incriminating response\" from Caputo after he had claimed\n\nhis right to remain silent.     Citing Miranda, Caputo maintains that\n\nthe story he blurted out upon hearing the officer's telephone\n\nconversation should have been suppressed as the product of that\n\nallegedly    unlawful   interrogation.   Like   the   SJC,   we   are   not\n\npersuaded.\n\n             In Innis, in the presence of a man arrested on suspicion\n\nof armed robbery, while conversing about the missing shotgun used\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fin the robbery, two police officers expressed concern that a child\n\nmight injure herself if, by chance, she found the missing weapon.\n\nThis musing between the officers prompted the suspect to reveal the\n\nlocation of the weapon. In holding that the police officers did not\n\nengage in the functional equivalent of interrogation, the Supreme\n\nCourt wrote:\n\n           The case thus boils down to whether, in the\n           context of a brief conversation, the officers\n           should have known that the respondent would\n           suddenly be moved to make a self-incriminating\n           response. Given the fact that the entire\n           conversation appears to have consisted of no\n           more than a few off hand remarks, we cannot\n           say that the officers should have known that\n           it was reasonably likely that Innis would so\n           respond. This is not a case where the police\n           carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence\n           of the suspect. Nor does the record support\n           the respondent's contention that, under the\n           circumstances, the officers' comments were\n           particularly \"evocative.\" It is our view,\n           therefore, that the respondent was not\n           subjected by the police to words or actions\n           that the police should have known were\n           reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating\n           response from him.\n\nInnis, 446 U.S. at 303.\n\n           Since Innis, a number of courts have considered whether\n\npolice may confront a suspect with evidence against him without\n\nengaging   in   the   functional   equivalent   of   interrogation.   For\n\nexample, in United States v. Payne, 954 F.2d 199 (4th Cir. 1992),\n\ncert. denied, 503 U.S. 988 (1992), the defendant made incriminating\n\nstatements after a law enforcement officer informed the defendant\n\nthat the FBI possessed inculpatory evidence against him. Rejecting\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe defendant's argument that the officer's statement constituted\n\nthe functional equivalent of interrogation, the Fourth Circuit\n\nobserved: \"[T]he Innis definition of interrogation is not so broad\n\nas to capture within Miranda's reach all declaratory statements by\n\npolice officers concerning the nature of the charges against the\n\nsuspect and the evidence relating to those charges.\"              Id. at 202.\n\nThe court went on to explain:\n\n                 That no comment on the evidence in a case\n             will ever issue in the presence of a criminal\n             suspect seems to us neither realistic nor\n             desirable as an absolute rule derived from the\n             Fifth Amendment. Indeed, it may even be in\n             the interest of a defendant to be kept\n             informed about matters relating to the charges\n             against him. . . . Information about the\n             evidence against a suspect may also contribute\n             to the intelligent exercise of his judgment\n             regarding what course of conduct to follow.\n\nId.; see also United States v. Thomas, 11 F.3d 1392, 1397 (7th Cir.\n\n1993) (finding no functional equivalent of interrogation where a\n\npolice   officer   provided     information   about   the    results   of   his\n\ninvestigation to a suspect who had herself asked the officer to let\n\nher know such results).\n\n             Similarly, in Plazinich v. Lynaugh, 843 F.2d 836 (5th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1031 (1989), the Fifth Circuit\n\nrejected the defendant's argument that a policeman engaged in the\n\nfunctional    equivalent   of    interrogation   when       he   informed   the\n\ndefendant-–after the defendant invoked his Miranda rights--that the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdefendant's accomplice had attempted suicide by slashing her wrists\n\nin the jail.

In the brief and\n            informal context in which it was made, the\n            comment could at most be characterized as\n            offering [the defendant] food for thought\n            rather   than    seeking   to    provoke   an\n            incriminating response.\n\nId. at 840 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Enoch v.\n\nGramley, 70 F.3d 1490, 1500 (7th Cir. 1995) (finding no functional\n\nequivalent of interrogation where the police identified the victim\n\nto the suspect and briefly stated the evidence against him), cert.\n\ndenied, 519 U.S. 829 (1996).\n\n            In   this      case,   Caputo     volunteered      false    exculpatory\n\ninformation after hearing Dorman report to his shift commander that\n\nCaputo was at his residence, that the engine of Caputo's automobile\n\nwas warm, and that there were two different registration plates on\n\nthe automobile.      Dorman did not pose any questions to Caputo, and\n\nhe did not otherwise engage in subtle efforts to get Caputo to talk.\n\nInstead, he simply related to another law enforcement officer non-\n\nevocative facts about what he saw at Caputo's residence. Dorman had\n\nno reason to know or even suspect that, in response to his brief\n\ntelephone   call    to     the    Plymouth    police   station,        Caputo    would\n\nspontaneously      blurt    out    a   fabricated      story    intended        to   be\n\nexculpatory and explanatory.           Consistent with the case law set out\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fabove, the SJC determined that Caputo was not subjected to the\n\nfunctional equivalent of interrogation, and his Fifth Amendment\n\nright against compelled self-incrimination was not violated, when\n\nDorman used Caputo's telephone, in Caputo's presence, to report what\n\nwas found at Caputo's residence.            Finding no Fifth Amendment\n\nviolation   when   Caputo   made   his    initial   statements,   the   SJC\n\ndetermined that Caputo's later statements could not have been \"fruit\n\nof the poisonous tree.\"      The SJC thus upheld the trial court's\n\ndenial of Caputo's motion to suppress.\n\n            When reviewing the SJC's decision upon Caputo's petition\n\nfor federal habeas corpus relief, the district court concluded that\n\nthe SJC properly applied the holdings of Miranda and Innis and,\n\nconsequently, reached a decision that was neither contrary to, nor\n\nan unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent.          We agree\n\nwith the district court's conclusion and, accordingly, AFFIRM the\n\njudgment of the district court, denying Caputo's petition for writ\n\nof habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f",

Caputo appeals the district court's order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody. Because the state court decision affirming his conviction was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of November 2, 1989, two Boston police officers were dispatched to a second-floor apartment in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the apartment's bedroom, the police found the bodies of Caputo's estranged wife and mother-in-law. Caputo's wife had been stabbed twenty-two times, his mother-in-law seventeen times. Caputo's two young daughters, who were unharmed, were also found in the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting an open kitchen window that led to the back porch, the police discovered that the telephone wires to the apartment had been cut. There was no sign of forced entry. On the dining room table, the police found a protective order dated July 31, 1989, ordering Caputo to refrain from abusing his wife and to stay away from the Jamaica Plain apartment. The order contained Caputo's address in Plymouth, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Boston police notified the Plymouth Police Department that Caputo was a suspect in a double homicide, six Plymouth police officers, including Sergeant Thornton Morse (\"Morse\") and Sergeant Richard Dorman (\"Dorman\"), arrived at Caputo's house. Caputo opened the front door after the officers repeatedly knocked on the front and rear doors. Morse and Dorman introduced themselves, then asked whether they could enter the house to speak with Caputo. Caputo acquiesced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside the house, Dorman informed Caputo that they were investigating a double homicide on behalf of the Boston Police Department. From a printed card, Dorman read Caputo his rights under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 467-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). When Dorman asked Caputo whether he understood his rights, Caputo initially replied: \"No.\" Dorman then repeated each right, asking after each whether Caputo understood. Caputo replied affirmatively to each, then said that he thought it best if he said nothing further. The officers immediately stopped all questioning of Caputo. They were not, however, asked to leave the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Dorman informed Caputo that they were investigating a double homicide, Caputo asked Dorman who had died. Dorman replied that he did not know. Soon thereafter, wanting to obtain more information about the investigation to pass along to Caputo, Morse asked whether he could use Caputo's telephone to call the Plymouth police station. Caputo agreed that Morse could use his phone. At the conclusion of his call to the station, Morse informed Caputo that the Plymouth police could not then supply any additional information about the double homicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving some of the officers inside the house, Dorman went outside to examine the automobile parked in Caputo's driveway. The vehicle matched the description given to the Plymouth police. The hood was warm to the touch, and a registration plate with a number other than Caputo's registration number covered the automobile's assigned registration plate. It was later learned that the outer registration plate had been stolen from a vehicle in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he re-entered the house, Dorman asked whether he could use Caputo's telephone to again call the Plymouth police station. Caputo again agreed. Within Caputo's hearing, Dorman informed the lieutenant on the line that Caputo was at his residence, that the engine of Caputo's automobile was warm, and that there were two different registration plates on the automobile. Spontaneously, Caputo stated that he did not want to incriminate himself but that he had a story to tell. He then proceeded to tell the officers that two men kidnapped him after forcing their way into his home the night before and that he later awoke \"in a daze\" in the Braintree area wearing only his underwear. The officers did not ask any questions in response to Caputo's unelicited statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of the officers, Caputo agreed to accompany the officers to the Plymouth police station. At the station, Caputo was once more advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Indeed, he was given a written copy delineating each right. Caputo read the form, making a check mark after each right. When asked whether he wished to talk to the officers, Caputo replied: \"I'm not sure; I don't know if I should say anything or not. What should I do?\" Morse responded: \"I can't tell you that, but I want you to be aware of your rights and that you do not have to say anything to me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet again, Morse informed Caputo of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, ascertained that Caputo understood his rights, and asked Caputo whether he wished to speak to the police. Then, and only then, Caputo began to elaborate on the statement he had previously made in his home. Among other things, Caputo told the officers that he remembered having blood on him, throwing an object out of his automobile, and, at some point during the night, being outside his mother-in-law's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 9:20 A.M., Sergeant Detective Charles Horsley (\"Horsley\") of the Boston Police Department arrived at the Plymouth police station. Informed that Caputo had been read his <i>Miranda</i> rights, Horsley interviewed Caputo for approximately forty-five minutes. When asked whether he had anything to do with the murders, Caputo became upset and stopped talking. Caputo asked to leave the police station but was informed that he was under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same afternoon, the police executed a search warrant at Caputo's residence. They recovered a knife set from which one knife was missing. A pair of \"tin snips\" capable of cutting telephone wires was found in Caputo's automobile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 1989, Caputo was charged in two indictments with the first-degree murders of his wife and mother-in-law. Before trial, Caputo moved to suppress the statements that he made at his home and at the police station. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge denied Caputo's motions. The judge found that, on entering Caputo's house, the officers immediately informed Caputo of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, then ceased all questioning when Caputo indicated that he did not want to speak to them. The judge also found that, at the Plymouth police station, after he again received full and complete <i>Miranda</i> warnings, Caputo knowingly waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights before he voluntarily answered police questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 21, 1991, a jury found Caputo guilty of two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced that same day to two consecutive life sentences. The judgments were affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") on April 15, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting Caputo's claims on appeal, the SJC explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, before he made any statement, [Caputo] received and acknowledged that he understood his Miranda rights. Second, when [Caputo] indicated a wish not to speak to the police, all questioning ceased. It was only after he overheard the police conversation that [Caputo] stated, unprovoked, that he had been kidnapped the previous night. We do not agree with [Caputo] that his statement should be suppressed because the police officer's request to use his telephone was \"reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\" from [Caputo], and therefore the \"functional equivalent\" of an interrogation. The telephone call was a report and request for further information, an action \"normally attendant\" to police procedures. [Caputo's] statement occurred only after and apparently because he had overheard the telephone conversation that tended to implicate him, not because of any \"interrogation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [Caputo] gave his consent to the police to enter his home, he did not ask them to leave, and spoke to them only after he recognized that the police had seen potentially incriminating evidence outside. A defendant who is \"nervous\" because he is in the presence of police within hours of committing murder and who chooses to give false information to the police in an attempt, however clumsy, to throw them off the trail as he perceives their attention focusing on him as a suspect, cannot resort later to a claim of coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we reject [Caputo's] claims that his statements to the police at his home should have been suppressed, we need not consider his argument that his later statements should have been suppressed as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Commonwealth v.

The district court entered judgment for the respondent on December 5, 2005, and this timely appeal followed. The district court thereafter issued a certificate of appealability, limiting the appeal to Caputo's claim that his privilege against self-incrimination was violated when his statements were introduced at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the federal district court's denial of Caputo's petition for writ of habeas corpus <i>de novo. Correia v. Hall,</i> 364 F.3d 385, 387 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Caputo's habeas petition was filed after April 24, 1996, this court's review is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). As amended, AEDPA precludes the granting of habeas relief to a state prisoner unless the state court decision (1) \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\" or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). Notably, the federal habeas court shall presume that the state court's determination of factual issues is correct, although the petitioner may rebut the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state court acts \"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court precedent if it \"arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law\" or if it \"decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (Justice O'Connor's Part II majority opinion). A state court's decision involves an \"unreasonable application\" of clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal principle from the Supreme Court's decisions but then unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case. <i>Id.</i> An \"unreasonable\" application, moreover, is an \"objectively unreasonable\" application. <i>Id.,</i> 529 U.S. at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caputo contends that his conviction was obtained through evidence that was obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Specifically, he argues that the statements he gave to the police at his house were not the product of a voluntary waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights but were the product of police tactics intended to elicit an incriminating response from him. He also argues that the statements he made at the police station, after he signed a waiver form, were the \"fruit of the poisonous tree,\" his earlier statements having been involuntarily made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 467-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602, the Supreme Court held that a person in custody must be warned prior to interrogation that he has certain rights, including the right to remain silent. Once a person in custody invokes his <i>Miranda</i> protections, the government cannot use any evidence obtained through custodial interrogation unless the suspect knowingly waives his rights. <i>Id.</i> at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The term \"interrogation\" under <i>Miranda</i> refers not only to express questioning but also \"to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\" <i>Rhode Island v. Innis,</i> 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Caputo contends that the police officer's use of Caputo's telephone, in Caputo's presence, to relay information about what the officers found at Caputo's residence was the functional equivalent of interrogation because it was \"reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\" from Caputo after he had claimed his right to remain silent. Citing <i>Miranda,</i> Caputo maintains that the story he blurted out upon hearing the officer's telephone conversation should have been suppressed as the product of that allegedly unlawful interrogation. Like the SJC, we are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Innis,</i> in the presence of a man arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, while conversing about the missing shotgun used in the robbery, two police officers expressed concern that a child might injure herself if, by chance, she found the missing weapon. This musing between the officers prompted the suspect to reveal the location of the weapon. In holding that the police officers did not engage in the functional equivalent of interrogation, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case thus boils down to whether, in the context of a brief conversation, the officers should have known that the respondent would suddenly be moved to make a self-incriminating response. Given the fact that the entire conversation appears to have consisted of no more than a few off hand remarks, we cannot say that the officers should have known that it was reasonably likely that Innis would so respond. This is not a case where the police carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect. Nor does the record support the respondent's contention that, under the circumstances, the officers' comments were particularly \"evocative.\" It is our view, therefore, that the respondent was not subjected by the police to words or actions that the police should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Innis,</i> 446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Innis,</i> a number of courts have considered whether police may confront a suspect with evidence against him without engaging in the functional equivalent of interrogation. For example, in <i>United States v. Payne,</i> 954 F.2d 199 (4th Cir. 1992), <i>cert. denied,</i> 503 U.S. 988, 112 S.Ct. 1680, 118 L.Ed.2d 396 (1992), the defendant made incriminating statements after a law enforcement officer informed the defendant that the FBI possessed inculpatory evidence against him. Rejecting the defendant's argument that the officer's statement constituted the functional equivalent of interrogation, the Fourth Circuit observed: \"[T]he <i>Innis</i> definition of interrogation is not so broad as to capture within <i>Miranda's</i> reach all declaratory statements by police officers concerning the nature of the charges against the suspect and the evidence relating to those charges.\" <i>Id.</i> at 202. The court went on to explain:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That no comment on the evidence in a case will ever issue in the presence of a criminal suspect seems to us neither realistic nor desirable as an absolute rule derived from the Fifth Amendment. Indeed, it may even be in the interest of a defendant to be kept informed about matters relating to the charges against him.. . . Information about the evidence against a suspect may also contribute to the intelligent exercise of his judgment regarding what course of conduct to follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.; see also United States v.

Dorman did not pose any questions to Caputo, and he did not otherwise engage in subtle efforts to get Caputo to talk. Instead, he simply related to another law enforcement officer non-evocative facts about what he saw at Caputo's residence. Dorman had no reason to know or even suspect that, in response to his brief telephone call to the Plymouth police station, Caputo would spontaneously blurt out a fabricated story intended to be exculpatory and explanatory. Consistent with the case law set out above, the SJC determined that Caputo was <i>not</i> subjected to the functional equivalent of interrogation, and his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination was <i>not</i> violated, when Dorman used Caputo's telephone, in Caputo's presence, to report what was found at Caputo's residence.

Caputo appeals the district court's order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody. Because the state court decision affirming his conviction was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of November 2, 1989, two Boston police officers were dispatched to a second-floor apartment in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the apartment's bedroom, the police found the bodies of Caputo's estranged wife and mother-in-law. Caputo's wife had been stabbed twenty-two times, his mother-in-law seventeen times. Caputo's two young daughters, who were unharmed, were also found in the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting an open kitchen window that led to the back porch, the police discovered that the telephone wires to the apartment had been cut. There was no sign of forced entry. On the dining room table, the police found a protective order dated July 31, 1989, ordering Caputo to refrain from abusing his wife and to stay away from the Jamaica Plain apartment. The order contained Caputo's address in Plymouth, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Boston police notified the Plymouth Police Department that Caputo was a suspect in a double homicide, six Plymouth police officers, including Sergeant Thornton Morse (\"Morse\") and Sergeant Richard Dorman (\"Dorman\"), arrived at Caputo's house. Caputo opened the front door after the officers repeatedly knocked on the front and rear doors. Morse and Dorman introduced themselves, then asked whether they could enter the house to speak with Caputo. Caputo acquiesced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside the house, Dorman informed Caputo that they were investigating a double homicide on behalf of the Boston Police Department. From a printed card, Dorman read Caputo his rights under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 467-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966). When Dorman asked Caputo whether he understood his rights, Caputo initially replied: \"No.\" Dorman then repeated each right, asking after each whether Caputo understood. Caputo replied affirmatively to each, then said that he thought it best if he said nothing further. The officers immediately stopped all questioning of Caputo. They were not, however, asked to leave the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Dorman informed Caputo that they were investigating a double homicide, Caputo asked Dorman who had died. Dorman replied that he did not know. Soon thereafter, wanting to obtain more information about the investigation to pass along to Caputo, Morse asked whether he could use Caputo's telephone to call the Plymouth police station. Caputo agreed that Morse could use his phone. At the conclusion of his call to the station, Morse informed Caputo that the Plymouth police could not then supply any additional information about the double homicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving some of the officers inside the house, Dorman went outside to examine the automobile parked in Caputo's driveway. The vehicle matched the description given to the Plymouth police. The hood was warm to the touch, and a registration plate with a number other than Caputo's registration number covered the automobile's assigned registration plate. It was later learned that the outer registration plate had been stolen from a vehicle in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he re-entered the house, Dorman asked whether he could use Caputo's telephone to again call the Plymouth police station. Caputo again agreed. Within Caputo's hearing, Dorman informed the lieutenant on the line that Caputo was at his residence, that the engine of Caputo's automobile was warm, and that there were two different registration plates on the automobile. Spontaneously, Caputo stated that he did not want to incriminate himself but that he had a story to tell. He then proceeded to tell the officers that two men kidnapped him after forcing their way into his home the night before and that he later awoke \"in a daze\" in the Braintree area wearing only his underwear. The officers did not ask any questions in response to Caputo's unelicited statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of the officers, Caputo agreed to accompany the officers to the Plymouth police station. At the station, Caputo was once more advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Indeed, he was given a written copy delineating each right. Caputo read the form, making a check mark after each right. When asked whether he wished to talk to the officers, Caputo replied: \"I'm not sure; I don't know if I should say anything or not. What should I do?\" Morse responded: \"I can't tell you that, but I want you to be aware of your rights and that you do not have to say anything to me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet again, Morse informed Caputo of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, ascertained that Caputo understood his rights, and asked Caputo whether he wished to speak to the police. Then, and only then, Caputo began to elaborate on the statement he had previously made in his home. Among other things, Caputo told the officers that he remembered having blood on him, throwing an object out of his automobile, and, at some point during the night, being outside his mother-in-law's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 9:20 A.M., Sergeant Detective Charles Horsley (\"Horsley\") of the Boston Police Department arrived at the Plymouth police station. Informed that Caputo had been read his <i>Miranda</i> rights, Horsley interviewed Caputo for approximately forty-five minutes. When asked whether he had anything to do with the murders, Caputo became upset and stopped talking. Caputo asked to leave the police station but was informed that he was under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same afternoon, the police executed a search warrant at Caputo's residence. They recovered a knife set from which one knife was missing. A pair of \"tin snips\" capable of cutting telephone wires was found in Caputo's automobile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 1989, Caputo was charged in two indictments with the first-degree murders of his wife and mother-in-law. Before trial, Caputo moved to suppress the statements that he made at his home and at the police station. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge denied Caputo's motions. The judge found that, on entering Caputo's house, the officers immediately informed Caputo of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, then ceased all questioning when Caputo indicated that he did not want to speak to them. The judge also found that, at the Plymouth police station, after he again received full and complete <i>Miranda</i> warnings, Caputo knowingly waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights before he voluntarily answered police questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 21, 1991, a jury found Caputo guilty of two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced that same day to two consecutive life sentences. The judgments were affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\") on April 15, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting Caputo's claims on appeal, the SJC explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, before he made any statement, [Caputo] received and acknowledged that he understood his Miranda rights. Second, when [Caputo] indicated a wish not to speak to the police, all questioning ceased. It was only after he overheard the police conversation that [Caputo] stated, unprovoked, that he had been kidnapped the previous night. We do not agree with [Caputo] that his statement should be suppressed because the police officer's request to use his telephone was \"reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\" from [Caputo], and therefore the \"functional equivalent\" of an interrogation. The telephone call was a report and request for further information, an action \"normally attendant\" to police procedures. [Caputo's] statement occurred only after and apparently because he had overheard the telephone conversation that tended to implicate him, not because of any \"interrogation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... [Caputo] gave his consent to the police to enter his home, he did not ask them to leave, and spoke to them only after he recognized that the police had seen potentially incriminating evidence outside. A defendant who is \"nervous\" because he is in the presence of police within hours of committing murder and who chooses to give false information to the police in an attempt, however clumsy, to throw them off the trail as he perceives their attention focusing on him as a suspect, cannot resort later to a claim of coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we reject [Caputo's] claims that his statements to the police at his home should have been suppressed, we need not consider his argument that his later statements should have been suppressed as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Commonwealth v.

As amended, AEDPA precludes the granting of habeas relief to a state prisoner unless the state court decision (1) \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\" or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d).

Citing <i>Miranda,</i> Caputo maintains that the story he blurted out upon hearing the officer's telephone conversation should have been suppressed as the product of that allegedly unlawful interrogation. Like the SJC, we are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Innis,</i> in the presence of a man arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, while conversing about the missing shotgun used in the robbery, two police officers expressed concern that a child might injure herself if, by chance, she found the missing weapon. This musing between the officers prompted the suspect to reveal the location of the weapon. In holding that the police officers did not engage in the functional equivalent of interrogation, the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case thus boils down to whether, in the context of a brief conversation, the officers should have known that the respondent would suddenly be moved to make a self-incriminating response. Given the fact that the entire conversation appears to have consisted of no more than a few off hand remarks, we cannot say that the officers should have known that it was reasonably likely that Innis would so respond. This is not a case where the police carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect. Nor does the record support the respondent's contention that, under the circumstances, the officers' comments were particularly \"evocative.\" It is our view, therefore, that the respondent was not subjected by the police to words or actions that the police should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Innis,</i> 446 U.S. at 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rejecting the defendant's argument that the officer's statement constituted the functional equivalent of interrogation, the Fourth Circuit observed: \"[T]he <i>Innis</i> definition of interrogation is not so broad as to capture within <i>Miranda's</i> reach all declaratory statements by police officers concerning the nature of the charges against the suspect and the evidence relating to those charges.\" <i>Id.</i> at 202.

Dorman did not pose any questions to Caputo, and he did not otherwise engage in subtle efforts to get Caputo to talk. Instead, he simply related to another law enforcement officer non-evocative facts about what he saw at Caputo's residence. Dorman had no reason to know or even suspect that, in response to his brief telephone call to the Plymouth police station, Caputo would spontaneously blurt out a fabricated story intended to be exculpatory and explanatory. Consistent with the case law set out above, the SJC determined that Caputo was <i>not</i> subjected to the functional equivalent of interrogation, and his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination was <i>not</i> violated, when Dorman used Caputo's telephone, in Caputo's presence, to report what was found at Caputo's residence. Finding no Fifth Amendment violation when Caputo made his initial statements, the SJC determined that Caputo's later statements could not have been \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" The SJC thus upheld the trial court's denial of Caputo's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When reviewing the SJC's decision upon Caputo's petition for federal habeas corpus relief, the district court concluded that the SJC properly applied the holdings of <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Innis</i> and, consequently, reached a decision that was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. We agree with the district court's conclusion and, accordingly, AFFIRM the judgment of the district court, denying Caputo's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The facts, which are not challenged by Caputo, are taken from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's recitation of the facts<i>Commonwealth v.
