In 1995, Rigoberto Valdés was convicted\n\nafter a guilty plea of a drug crime.              By petition under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 (2000), brought on August 4, 1999, Valdés had his right to\nappeal reinstated because the district court found that Valdés's\n\nsecond trial     counsel    failed     to    file   a    timely   appeal     despite\nValdés's instructions to do so.             Valdés now takes that appeal and\n\nuses it to argue that his first trial counsel, who represented him\n\nduring    the    early     stages     of     plea       negotiations,       provided\nconstitutionally defective legal representation. See Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\n\n            Valdés     claims   that        his   first     trial       counsel   was\nineffective because that counsel did not tell him of an earlier,\nmore beneficial offer of a shorter sentence that the government\n\nallegedly made during the plea bargaining.                 Valdés says he became\n\naware of this earlier plea offer on the day he accepted the less\nfavorable plea, April 4, 1995.         The first time he raised this as a\n\nlegal    issue   was   almost   six    years      later,    at    the    March    2001\n\nevidentiary hearing on his pro se § 2255 petition, when he made a\npro se motion to amend his § 2255 petition to add the ineffective\n\nassistance claim based on his first counsel's performance.                        This\npro se motion to amend was brought nineteen months after the\n\ninitial petition.        The magistrate judge outlined the factual\nallegations of Valdés's new claim in his report and recommendation,\nbut said that \"[t]he matter was not considered\" in his report.\n\nInstead, he recommended that Valdés be resentenced to reinstate his\nright to direct appeal.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            At resentencing, Valdés's counsel submitted a motion\n\npresenting grounds for a lesser sentence, including the allegation\nthat Valdés's first counsel had not communicated the initial\n\ngovernment offer.     At the hearing, counsel attempted to raise the\n\nissue, but was cut short by the           district judge, who stated \"that\nis an issue for appeal, if you think.                I think the Magistrate\n\ntouched on it a little bit but that would be an issue on appeal.\"\n\nBased on this colloquy and the magistrate judge's report, it is not\nclear whether the district court ever denied Valdés's motion to\n\namend his § 2255 petition to include the ineffective assistance\n\nclaim, or whether it merely deferred disposition of the motion.\n             We typically require that an ineffective assistance claim\nbe     presented   first   to    the    district    court   in    a   collateral\n\nproceeding, not on direct appeal, so that the pertinent facts may\n\nbe developed and found by the district court.               United States v.\n\nRamirez-Benitez, No. 00-1497, 2002 WL 1079361, *7 (1st Cir. June 4,\n\n2002).      Both   parties      urge   that   we   nonetheless    consider   the\n\nineffective assistance claim because, in their view, the facts are\nsimple.     The parties are wrong because, whether the facts are\n\nsimple or complex, they are disputed, and that dispute needs to be\nresolved by the district court in a collateral proceeding, if at\n\nall.    The government, for its part, has quite improperly submitted\nan   affidavit,    which   was    never   presented    to   the   trial   court,\ndirectly to this court. This court, as the government should know,\n\nis not the initial trier of fact, particularly when the facts are\ndisputed. Benham v. Lenox Sav. Bank, No. 01-2101, 2002 WL 1080718,\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f*2 (1st Cir. June 4, 2002).   Valdés has also asked us to remand the\n\ndirect appeal to the district court for further fact-finding, but\nthat is not the correct procedural mechanism for an ineffective\nassistance claim that was not raised in his initial petition.\n\n          We dismiss the direct appeal as premature on the merits\n\nof the ineffective assistance claim, subject to one limitation.\nBased on the colloquy between the district judge and Valdés's\nattorney at the sentencing hearing, we construe Valdés's appeal to\ninclude an appeal of the district court's denial or deferral of his\nmotion to amend the § 2255 petition.   Because the factual record is\n\ninsufficiently developed for us to consider the merits of the\n\nineffective assistance claim on direct appeal, we remand the case\n\nfor a determination on whether to allow Valdés's motion to amend\nhis § 2255 claim. Cf. Rodriguez v. United States, 286 F.3d 972,\n\n980-81 (7th Cir. 2002) (motion to amend habeas petition is untimely\n\nunless it is filed within one year statute of limitations, or\nrelates back to the original filing). If the district court allows\n\nthe motion to amend, it should determine the merits of Valdés's\n\nineffective assistance claim under § 2255. That merits order would\n\nbe subject to appeal, as would be an order denying the motion to\n\namend.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
