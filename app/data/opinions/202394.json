Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                     Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Robert M. Greenspan on brief for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, Lee H.\nVilker, Assistant United States Attorney, and Robert Clark\nCorrente, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            September 6, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam.      After pleading guilty to being a felon in\n\npossession of a gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and\n\nafter admitting that the offense involved shooting the gun in a\n\nresidential area to scare someone, defendant Louis Segalla was\n\nsentenced to 120 months' imprisonment, the statutory maximum, which\n\nfell in the middle of the advisory guidelines range.1                       In the\n\ndistrict court, Segalla sought a below-guidelines sentence of 72\n\nmonths,   under   United    States   v.       Booker,   543   U.S.   220    (2005),\n\nprimarily on the ground that he had been physically abused as a\n\nchild.    On appeal, he argues, in addition, that the 120-month\n\nsentence imposed was unreasonable in light of the nature of the\n\noffense, which he characterizes as relatively minor, that the\n\nsentence is longer than necessary to deal with his admitted need\n\nfor   rehabilitation,      and   that     his    criminal     history      category\n\noverstates the seriousness of his criminal record.                   Finally, he\n\nargues that United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc), which articulated the sentencing protocols to be\n\nfollowed by the district courts in this circuit and the standards\n\n\n\n      1\n      That range, which was ultimately undisputed in the district\ncourt and is not challenged on appeal, was computed as follows:\ntotal offense level of 25 (base offense level of 24, U.S.S.G.\n§ 2K2.1(a)(2); plus 4 levels for possessing the gun in connection\nwith another felony offense--i.e., assault with a dangerous weapon,\nid. § 2K2.1(b)(5); minus 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility,\nid. § 3E1.1(a) & (b)), combined with a criminal history category of\nVI (27 criminal history points, id., ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing\nTable)), resulting in a guidelines sentencing range of 110 to 137\nmonths, id.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fof appellate review of sentences post-Booker, was wrongly decided.2\n\nFor    the   reasons     detailed   below,     we   find    the   sentence    to    be\n\nadequately explained and substantively reasonable in light of the\n\nfactors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).               Accordingly, we reject\n\nSegalla's arguments to the contrary and affirm the sentence.\n\n              The district judge expressly took into account each of\n\nthe    mitigating       factors   that   defense     counsel      brought    to    her\n\nattention but found them unpersuasive or outweighed by other\n\nlegitimate considerations. As to Segalla's history of child abuse,\n\nthe judge      stated that, \"although [she] was very familiar with the\n\nkind of childhood [he] had[,] [t]hat information . . . only goes so\n\nfar.       There comes a point in one's life where you have to take\n\nresponsibility for your own actions.\"                As to the nature of the\n\noffense, which involved riding a motorcycle while drunk and firing\n\na gun in a residential area, the judge repeatedly commented on the\n\ndanger that conduct posed to the public and to Segalla himself,\n\nwhich made it significantly more serious than the ordinary felon-\n\nin-possession case.         As to Segalla's need for rehabilitation, the\n\nsentence      imposed    was   expressly     designed      to   address   Segalla's\n\nrecognized need for mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n\nFinally, as to Segalla's criminal history--which included several\n\ninstances of violence, particularly against women, and resulted in\n\n\n       2\n      As Segalla concedes, this panel is powerless to overrule the\ncourt's en banc opinion in Jiménez-Beltre. We therefore do not\naddress his criticisms of that decision.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fmore than twice as many criminal history points as needed to place\n\nhim in the highest criminal history category--the judge commented\n\nthat Segalla's history makes him a \"menace to society,\" and that,\n\nif her discretion were not limited by the statutory maximum, she\n\nwould have imposed a higher sentence based on that factor alone.\n\nIn addition, the judge expressly considered the statutory factors,\n\nincluding     the   need    for   punishment,   deterrence,      and   public\n\nprotection.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(d)(A), (B), (C).\n\n            In sum, because we find the court's reasoning to be\n\nplausible,    and   the    resulting   sentence,   at   least,   defensible,\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519, we summarily affirm the sentence.\n\nSee 1st Cir.
