Defendant-Appellant Puerto\n\nRico Highway and Transportation Authority (\"the Authority\") appeals\n\nthe district court's denial of its claim of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity as an arm of the state.1        After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n             On    December   14,     2001,   plaintiff-appellee      Redondo\n\nConstruction Company (\"Redondo\") filed a complaint against the\n\nAuthority and other defendants in the district court, alleging\n\nnumerous constitutional violations and breach of contract under\n\nstate law.        The factual background of this underlying lawsuit,\n\nwhich   is   but    one   action    amongst   an   array   of   administrative\n\nproceedings and litigation in both Commonwealth and federal courts,\n\nis irrelevant to the single issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nbefore us.\n\n             On October 30, 2002, the district court denied injunctive\n\nrelief and dismissed all of Redondo's constitutional claims except\n\nthose relating to interference with present contractual relations.\n\nRegarding the Authority's sovereign immunity claim, the district\n\ncourt analyzed the factors outlined in Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v.\n\nPuerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\nand Univ. of Rhode Island v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d 1200 (1st\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is treated as a state for\npurposes of the Eleventh Amendment. De León López v. Corporación\nInsular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fCir. 1993), and concluded that the Authority was not entitled to\n\nimmunity as an arm of the state.\n\n          The Authority sought reconsideration of the district\n\ncourt's opinion in a Motion to Amend Judgment filed on November 12,\n\n2002, which was denied by the district court on February 25, 2003.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 15, 2003, the district court partially\n\ngranted   the   Authority's   request     to   stay   the   federal   court\n\nproceedings in response to a November 12, 2002 decision of the\n\nPuerto Rico Court of Appeals confirming that the Department of\n\nTransportation and Public Works had primary jurisdiction in the\n\nadministrative proceedings under way.\n\n           In the interim, the Authority has filed this appeal to\n\nrequest review of the district court's sovereign immunity decision\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine.       Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer\n\nAuth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147 (1993) (state\n\nentity claiming to be arm of the state may take advantage of\n\ncollateral order doctrine to appeal a district court order denying\n\na claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n                              II.   Analysis\n\n          We review de novo the district court's denial of Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.    Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto\n\nRico, 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          After the district court opinion was issued, this court\n\nreformulated its arm-of-the-state analysis for Eleventh Amendment\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fimmunity    in    response   to   intervening     Supreme     Court   precedent.\n\nFresenius Med. Care Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. v. Puerto Rico\n\n& the Caribbean Cardiovascular Ctr. Corp., 322 F.3d 56 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), cert. denied, 124 S.Ct. 296 (2003) (\"Fresenius\"). Fresenius\n\napplied the two-stage framework of Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson\n\nCorp., 513 U.S. 30 (1994), to the question of whether a special-\n\npurpose public corporation established by a state should enjoy\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.           Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 64-68.       Under\n\nFresenius, a court must first determine whether the state has\n\nindicated    an    intention      --   either    explicitly    by     statute   or\n\nimplicitly through the structure of the entity -- that the entity\n\nshare the state's sovereign immunity.             Id. at 65.    If no explicit\n\nindication       exists,   the    court   must    consider     the     structural\n\nindicators of the state's intention.             If these point in different\n\ndirections, the court must proceed to the second stage and consider\n\nwhether the state's treasury would be at risk in the event of an\n\nadverse judgment.      Id.\n\n            This two-stage framework thus \"explicitly recognizes the\n\nEleventh Amendment's twin interests: protection of the fisc and the\n\ndignity of the states.\"        Id. at 64-65 (citing Hess, 513 U.S. at 39-\n\n40).   The Supreme Court has recently stressed that, distinct from\n\nfinancial concerns, the state \"also has a 'dignity' interest as a\n\nsovereign in not being haled into federal court.\"                      Id. at 63\n\n(citing Federal Marine Comm'n v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f743 (2002)).    Similarly, the state has both dignitary and fiscal\n\ninterests in identifying which state entities are not to share its\n\nimmunity.    Id. (\"It would be every bit as much an affront to the\n\nstate's dignity and fiscal interests were a federal court to find\n\nerroneously that an entity was an arm of the state.\").       A state's\n\nchoice to establish an entity excluded from the protection of its\n\nsovereign immunity implicates important policy concerns:\n\n                   Not all entities created by states are\n            meant to share state sovereignty.         Some\n            entities may be part of an effort at\n            privatization, representing an assessment by\n            the state that the private sector may perform\n            a function better than the state.         Some\n            entities may be meant to be commercial\n            enterprises, viable and competitive in the\n            marketplace in which they operate.        Such\n            enterprises may need incentives to encourage\n            others to contract with them, such as the\n            incentives of application of usual legal\n            standards between private contracting parties.\n            The dollar cap on recovery found in many state\n            sovereign immunity statutes would be a\n            powerful disincentive to a private party to\n            contract with an entity, unless the private\n            party first obtained a waiver of immunity from\n            the entity.    In Puerto Rico, a breach of\n            contract action against the Commonwealth is\n            capped at $75,000.\n\n                   . . . In sum, states set up entities\n            for many reasons.   An erroneous arm-of-the-\n            state decision may frustrate, not advance, a\n            state's dignity and its interests.\n\nId. at 64 (internal citations omitted).     The first stage of the\n\narm-of-the-state analysis thus \"pays deference to the state's\n\ndignitary interest in extending or withholding Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity from an entity.\"    Id. at 65.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            The Authority argues that, inter alia, the extent of the\n\nCommonwealth's control over the Authority and the Authority's\n\ninvolvement in the traditional governmental function of building\n\npublic roads clearly indicate a legislative intention to structure\n\nthe Authority as an arm of the state, despite the Authority's\n\nability to make expenditures, to charge tolls and fees, to own and\n\ndispose of property, to make contracts, to sue and be sued, and to\n\nissue   bonds    that   create    no    obligation   on   the    part       of   the\n\nCommonwealth.       The district court considered these, and other,\n\nindicators of the Authority's relationship to the Commonwealth and\n\nconcluded    that    the   Authority's       administrative     and    financial\n\nindependence excluded it from Eleventh Amendment protection.\n\n            On   appeal,   Redondo     contends   that    the   Commonwealth's\n\nintention to deny the Authority the protection of state sovereign\n\nimmunity has been clearly established by two decisions in which the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico held that the statutory structure of\n\nthe Authority indicates that it was designed to operate as a\n\nprivate   enterprise,      not   as    an   instrumentality     of    the   state.\n\nMorales Morales v. Autoridad de Carreteras, 140 D.P.R. 1 (1996);\n\nUnión Asociación de Empleados Profesionales y Clericales de la\n\nAutoridad de Carreteras v. Labor Relations Bd. of Puerto Rico, 19\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 139 (1987).          We agree.\n\n            The precise role of state court decisions in determining\n\nan entity's entitlement to Eleventh Amendment immunity has not been\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdefined. Fresenius, 322 F.3d at 68 n.12. While Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity is without doubt a question of federal law, \"that federal\n\nquestion can be answered only after considering the provisions of\n\nstate law that define the agency's character.\"                 Regents of the\n\nUniv. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429 n.5 (1997).               In a similar\n\ncontext, the Supreme Court has found the opinion of the state's\n\nhighest court highly persuasive: \"But even if our own examination\n\n[of the status of counties under California state law] were not\n\nsufficient for present purposes, we have the clearest indication\n\npossible   from   California's      Supreme      Court    of   the   status   of\n\nCalifornia's counties.\"     Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693,\n\n720 (1973) (holding that counties have sufficiently independent\n\ncorporate character to be treated as citizens of California for\n\ndiversity purposes).\n\n           This   court   has    previously      stated   that    \"[w]hile    not\n\ndispositive,   consistent       decisions   of   a   state's     highest   court\n\nconstruing an agency's or institution's relationship with the\n\ncentral government are important guideposts in a reasoned attempt\n\nto locate the agency's or institution's place within the scheme of\n\nthings.\"   Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 942.          In the context of state\n\nwaivers of Eleventh Amendment immunity, we have confirmed that\n\n\"legislative intent is a matter of state law, on which the highest\n\ncourt of a state speaks with finality.\"              Della Grotta v. Rhode\n\nIsland, 781 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir. 1986)(citing Mullaney v.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fWilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 690-91 (1975)).       \"Where the highest court of\n\na state has construed a state statute as intending to waive the\n\nstate's immunity to suit in federal court, the state's intent is\n\njust as clear as if the waiver were made explicit in the state\n\nstatute.\"     Id.   Here, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has twice\n\nheld   that   the   statutory   structure   of   the   Authority   clearly\n\nindicates a legislative intent that the Authority act as a private\n\nenterprise outside the protection of the Commonwealth's immunity.\n\nMorales Morales, 140 D.P.R. 1; Unión Asociación de Empleados, 19\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 139.2 The Commonwealth's intention thus clearly\n\nexpressed, and the first part of the Fresenius test thus met, we\n\nneed not proceed to consider the structural indicators of the\n\nentity's status or the risk to the Commonwealth's treasury.            The\n\nCommonwealth's highest court has held that the statutory structure\n\nof the Authority indicates that Puerto Rico did not intend it to be\n\n\n\n\n2\n  State court decisions offering only conclusory determinations of\nan entity's legal character or failing to engage in an inquiry\nbased on analogous jurisprudential concerns might prove less\npersuasive. Univ. of Rhode Island, 2 F.3d at 1205 n.8 (treating as\ninconclusive state court decisions failing to \"engage[] in an\nextended   analysis   of   the    Board's   corporate   powers   or\ncharacteristics\"); Moor, 411 U.S. at 721 n.54 (questioning the\npersuasive power of state court decision that failed to undertake\nan independent analysis of the legal character of the entity);\nJacintoport Corp. v. Greater Baton Rouge Port Comm'n, 762 F.2d 435,\n438 (5th Cir. 1985)(refusing to follow state court opinions because\nthey \"did not deal with the precise question before us, nor was\ntheir inquiry based on even analogous jurisprudential concerns\").\nHowever, that is not the case here.\n\n                                   -8-\n\ftreated as an arm of the state, and we see no reason to decide\n\notherwise.3\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision that the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation\n\nAuthority is not an arm of the state and thus is not entitled to\n\nimmunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    The deference here afforded to the determination of state\nlegislative intent by the state's highest court does not suggest\nthat a similar deference would be merited in the converse scenario\nof a state court determination that an entity shares the state's\nimmunity. When the vindication of federal rights is at issue, a\nstate court determination that the state intends an entity to share\nits immunity, while worthy of consideration among other indicators,\ndoes not substitute for an independent analysis under the federal\nstandard to determine whether the entity should indeed benefit from\nthe Eleventh Amendment's protection. See, e.g., Hess, 513 U.S. at\n45 (denying immunity to a bi-state entity despite state court\ndecisions describing it as an agency of the states).\n\n                                -9-\n\f",
