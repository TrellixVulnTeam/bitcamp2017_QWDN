The Puerto Rico Association of\n\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation (\"PRAPMR\") is a group of\n\nmedical doctors practicing in Puerto Rico. It, and several doctors\n\nand patients, sued to challenge a regulation restricting Medicare\n\nreimbursement for physical therapy services.               The district court\n\ndismissed the case, relying on statutory provisions that preclude\n\nall actions \"brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to\n\nrecover on any claim arising under\" the Medicare Act.               42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 405(h), 1395ii (2000).      This appeal followed.\n\n           The federal Medicare program has several components.            At\n\nissue here is Medicare Part B, which offers voluntary supplemental\n\nhealth insurance for \"aged and disabled individuals who elect to\n\nenroll   under   such   program.\"        42   U.S.C.   §   1395j.    Enrolled\n\nbeneficiaries    are    entitled    to   recover   reimbursement     (usually\n\npartial) for covered medical costs; they may alternatively assign\n\nreimbursement rights to their physicians or other health care\n\nproviders, who may then pursue the claims. 42 C.F.R. § 422.574(b).\n\n           Among the medical costs covered by Medicare are those for\n\nservices \"furnished as an incident to a physician's professional\n\nservice, of kinds which are commonly furnished in physicians'\n\noffices and are commonly either rendered without charge or included\n\nin the physicians' bills.\"     42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s)(2)(A).          But under\n\na regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices in 2004, physical therapy services provided in this\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f\"incident-to\" fashion can only be reimbursed if the individual\n\nproviding      the    therapy    meets     certain      educational      and   training\n\nrequirements.          42     C.F.R.     §§   410.60(a)(3)(iii),          484.4.      The\n\nregulation means that medical doctors may no longer bill Medicare\n\nfor physical therapy services provided in their offices by, for\n\nexample, athletic trainers who lack the approved, specialized\n\ntraining in physical therapy.\n\n            The      regulation       implemented       a    statutory   prohibition,\n\nenacted by Congress in 1997, that precludes payment for physical\n\ntherapy services provided \"incident to\" a doctor's services unless\n\nsuch   services       \"meet     the    standards     and      conditions\"      that   the\n\nSecretary is authorized to impose to govern physical therapy\n\nservices provided independently, e.g. in a physical therapist's\n\nprivate office. 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(20); see also id. § 1395x(p).\n\nEssentially, the new regulations require that whether therapy is\n\nbilled as \"incident to\" a doctor's services or as an independent\n\nmedical   service,       those        providing    the      therapy   meet     the    same\n\nqualifications.\n\n            In March 2006, some eight months after the regulation\n\ntook effect, PRAPMR submitted a self-styled \"Administrative Appeal\"\n\nto the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), the\n\nagency that administers Medicare on behalf of the Secretary.                          The\n\nsubmission argued that the regulation was arbitrary, unauthorized\n\nby   statute    and    unconstitutional;          CMS       responded,   advising      the\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fdoctors that their letter had \"no legal bearing on CMS\" and\n\nsuggesting       that    they      \"pursue    whatever       other    administrative\n\nprocesses are available.\"             PRAPMR then filed this suit in Puerto\n\nRico's    federal       district     court,      premised    on     federal   question\n\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2000), seeking declaratory and\n\ninjunctive       relief      on     the    same     medley     of     statutory   and\n\nconstitutional grounds.\n\n               In dismissing the suit, the district court agreed with\n\nthe agency that any challenge to the regulation must be channeled\n\nthrough a multi-step administrative review process before a federal\n\ncourt    may    pass    on   it.      A   patient   or   provider      may,   under   a\n\nstatutorily prescribed regime, seek administrative review wherever\n\na claim for reimbursement for a service is rejected, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395ff(b)(1)(A); and, if the agency outcome is adverse, obtain\n\nfederal court review.              Id. § 405(g).     The district court ruling\n\nmeant that the regulation could be challenged but only through this\n\nstatutory \"exhaustion of remedies\" procedure.\n\n               There is no uniform rule governing when and how agency\n\naction can be judicially reviewed; the proper process depends,\n\ninter alia, on which agency is involved, what type of claim is\n\npressed, statutory provisions and court-created doctrine.                          For\n\nexample,       courts     have      constructed     doctrines        requiring    that\n\nadministrative remedies be exhausted before judicial review is\n\nsought, Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f(1938), and that claims be \"ripe\" for review, Abbott Labs. v.\n\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967), although both rules are\n\nsubject to multiple exceptions.         E.g., McCarthy v. Madigan, 503\n\nU.S. 140, 147-48 (1992) (futility exception); Abbott Labs., 387\n\nU.S. at 149 (hardship exception).\n\n           In the case of the Medicare Act, Congress has enacted a\n\nstatute that \"reaches beyond ordinary administrative law principles\n\nof   'ripeness'   and   'exhaustion   of   administrative   remedies'.\"\n\nShalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 12\n\n(2000).   Under 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), which in terms relates to the\n\nSocial Security program but is incorporated mutatis mutandis into\n\nthe Medicare Act, id. § 1395ii, neither federal question nor\n\nfederal defendant jurisdiction is available for suits \"to recover\n\non any claim arising under\" the Act.          Separate provisions, id.\n\n§§ 405(g), 1395ff(b)(1)(A), allow for judicial review once a\n\nspecified agency appeals process is completed.\n\n           Were we writing on a blank slate, the scope of section\n\n405(h) would raise interesting questions.         But we are not: the\n\nSupreme Court has interpreted broadly the section 405(h) bar,\n\nholding that a claim \"arises under\" the Social Security or Medicare\n\nAct if \"the standing and the substantive basis\" for the claim\n\nderive from that statute.    Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 760-\n\n61 (1975); see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 615 (1984).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fThe provision thus mandates the \"'channeling' of virtually all\n\nlegal attacks through the agency.\"            Ill. Council, 529 U.S. at 13.\n\n               Although PRAPMR's suit challenges a regulation and does\n\nnot directly request payment for a specific service, it seeks at\n\nits heart the extension of Medicare benefits; accordingly, it would\n\nappear barred by section 405(h) as construed by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe regulation being challenged is simply a limitation on the\n\nclaims that Medicare will pay and so foreshadows the denial of such\n\nclaims.        The government concedes that--if a specific claim is\n\ndenied    on    account   of   the   regulation--the      regulation     may   be\n\nchallenged in court on review of the denial of a specific claim\n\nafter administrative remedies are exhausted. See Ill. Council, 529\n\nU.S. at 23 (so holding).\n\n               PRAPMR   responds   with   heavy   reliance   on    the   Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians,\n\n476 U.S. 667 (1986).         When that case was decided, the Medicare Act\n\ndid not provide for any judicial review of determinations made\n\nunder Medicare Part B, and the Court refused to assume that\n\nCongress \"intended no review at all of substantial statutory and\n\nconstitutional challenges to the Secretary's administration\" of\n\nthat program.       Id. at 680.      Invoking the canon of constitutional\n\navoidance, the Court distinguished \"amount\" challenges (i.e., fact-\n\nbased    challenges     to   particular      decisions)   from    \"methodology\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fchallenges (i.e., legal attacks on statutes, regulations and the\n\nlike), and permitted the latter to proceed directly to court.              Id.\n\n             PRAPMR's claim is, under that dichotomy, a \"methodology\"\n\nattack.     But only a few months after Michigan Academy, Congress\n\nprovided explicitly that Part B determinations can be challenged in\n\ncourt after administrative remedies have been exhausted.               Omnibus\n\nBudget     Reconciliation    Act     of    1986,   Pub.    L.    No.   99-509,\n\n§ 9341(a)(1), (b), 100 Stat. 1874, 2037-38 (codified at 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395ff).    So, as clarified in Illinois Council, Michigan Academy\n\nmeans only that section 405(h) does not apply if \"its application\n\nto a particular category of cases . . . would not lead to a\n\nchanneling of review through the agency, but would mean no review\n\nat all.\"     Ill. Council, 529 U.S. 1, 17 (2000).1\n\n             That   PRAPMR   seeks    to    challenge     an    administrative\n\nregulation rather than a particular factual determination thus does\n\nnot matter.    The precedents \"foreclose distinctions based upon the\n\n'potential future' versus the 'actual present' nature of the claim,\n\nthe 'general legal' versus the 'fact-specific' nature of the\n\n\n\n     1\n      There was initial uncertainty as to whether the Michigan\nAcademy exception retained its full force after the amendments.\nMost circuits said no, given that the decision's rationale had been\nentirely undermined, see Fanning v. United States, 346 F.3d 386,\n397-98 (3d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 919 (2004), but one\ncourt insisted that \"inferior courts are not authorized to declare\nthe reasoning of [Supreme Court] opinions outdated.\" Ill. Council\non Long Term Care, Inc. v. Shalala, 143 F.3d 1072, 1076 (7th Cir.\n1998). On review, that uncertainty was resolved by the Supreme\nCourt.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fchallenge,\" and so on.   Ill. Council, 529 U.S. at 13-14.   What does\n\nmatter is whether PRAPMR can, at some point, using some process,\n\nobtain judicial review of its claims.      Accord Am. Chiropractic\n\nAssoc., Inc. v. Leavitt, 431 F.3d 812, 816 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\nPRAPMR insists that barring its federal law suit would mean \"no\n\nreview at all\" for its claims, Ill. Council, 529 U.S. at 17,\n\n\"because there has been no payment claim denials yet.\"   But this is\n\nnot a denial of review, merely its postponement until a payment\n\nclaim has been denied.\n\n          Appellants complain that, in the meanwhile, the supply of\n\ntherapists may dry up, and doctors may be unwilling to supply (or\n\npatients unwilling to accept) services that do not qualify, fearing\n\nthat they may be asked to reimburse the agency later.        But the\n\ndoctors and therapists certainly have ample economic incentive to\n\nframe and support a test case. Appellants could provide service to\n\na couple of patients through therapists who do not qualify, submit\n\nclaims for reimbursement, and candidly admit in their filings that\n\ntheir only challenge is to the regulation.\n\n          We therefore need not decide whether or when irreparable\n\ninjury \"turns what appears to be simply a channeling requirement\n\ninto complete preclusion of judicial review,\" Ill. Council, 529\n\nU.S. at 22-23, nor whether Illinois Council's exception applies to\n\nstatutory as well as constitutional claims; but it should be\n\nremembered that the litigation process itself imposes risks and\n\n\n                                -9-\n\funrecoverable costs and there is little doubt that Congress can, in\n\nthe context of a complex administrative scheme, preclude pre-\n\nenforcement challenges without creating a hardship exception.              Cf.\n\nNat'l Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Okla. Tax Comm'n, 515 U.S.\n\n582, 591 (1995) (no federal right to declaratory or injunctive\n\nrelief from unconstitutional state taxes if state law offers ex\n\npost refund).\n\n           Further, the problem of irreparable injury does not only\n\naffect one side.      It is likely that section 405's insistence on\n\nexhaustion    owes   something   to    the    fear    that    the   Secretary's\n\ndecisions restricting payment might otherwise be promiscuously\n\nenjoined at great cost to the government.            Channeling review makes\n\ncertain that the agency determinations are thoroughly developed\n\nthrough the administrative process and that payments are not\n\ncompelled until judicial review has been undertaken.\n\n           At oral argument, PRAPMR suggested that the agency was\n\napproving noncompliant claims notwithstanding the regulation, but\n\ngovernment counsel said he was unaware of any program of deliberate\n\nnon-enforcement. We need not consider whether a pattern of conduct\n\ndesigned     to   frustrate   test    cases   brought    to    challenge   the\n\nregulation would trigger the \"no review at all\" exception of\n\nIllinois Council; neither in the district court nor on appeal have\n\nthe appellants offered anything more than speculation or even\n\nprovided the legal analysis necessary to develop such an argument.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Finally, PRAPMR argues that the submission of its self-\n\nstyled \"Administrative Appeal\" to the agency should somehow change\n\nthe analysis.     But it concedes that it has not appealed any\n\nMedicare claim denial, and that is the only way, under the statute\n\nand regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 1395ff(b)(1)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 405.801,\n\nto initiate the multi-step appeal process that culminates in\n\nfederal court review.   We add only that it is in the government's\n\ninterest, as well as the appellants', to get such a claim served up\n\npromptly.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

It, and several doctors and patients, sued to challenge a regulation restricting Medicare reimbursement for physical therapy services. The district court dismissed the case, relying on statutory provisions that preclude all actions \"brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under\" the Medicare Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(h), 1395ii (2000). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>The federal Medicare program has several components. At issue here is Medicare Part B, which offers voluntary supplemental health insurance for \"aged and disabled individuals who elect to enroll under such program.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395j. Enrolled beneficiaries are entitled to recover reimbursement (usually partial) for covered medical costs; they may alternatively assign reimbursement rights to their physicians or other health care providers, who may then pursue the claims. 42 C.F.R. § 422.574(b).</p>\n<p>Among the medical costs covered by Medicare are those for services \"furnished as an incident to a physician's professional service, of kinds which are commonly furnished in physicians' offices and are commonly either rendered without charge or included in the physicians' bills.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s)(2)(A). But under a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in 2004, physical therapy services provided in this \"incident-to\" fashion can only be reimbursed if the individual providing the therapy meets certain educational and training requirements. 42 C.F.R. §§ 410.60(a)(3)(iii), 484.4. The regulation means that medical doctors may no longer bill Medicare for physical therapy services provided in their offices by, for example, athletic trainers who lack the approved, specialized training in physical therapy.</p>\n<p>The regulation implemented a statutory prohibition, enacted by Congress in 1997, that precludes payment for physical therapy services provided \"incident to\" a doctor's services unless such services \"meet the standards and conditions\" that the Secretary is authorized to impose to govern physical therapy services provided independently, <i>e.g.</i> in a physical therapist's private office. 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(20); <i>see also id.</i> § 1395x(p). Essentially, the new regulations require that whether therapy is billed as \"incident to\" a doctor's services or as an independent medical service, those providing the therapy meet the same qualifications.</p>\n<p>In March 2006, some eight months after the regulation took effect, PRAPMR submitted a self-styled \"Administrative Appeal\" to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), the agency that administers Medicare on behalf of the Secretary. The submission argued that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the regulation was arbitrary, unauthorized by statute and unconstitutional; CMS responded, advising the doctors that their letter had \"no legal bearing on CMS\" and suggesting that they \"pursue whatever other administrative processes are available.\" PRAPMR then filed this suit in Puerto Rico's federal district court, premised on federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2000), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the same medley of statutory and constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p>In dismissing the suit, the district court agreed with the agency that any challenge to the regulation must be channeled through a multi-step administrative review process before a federal court may pass on it. A patient or provider may, under a statutorily prescribed regime, seek administrative review wherever a claim for reimbursement for a service is rejected, 42 U.S.C. § 1395ff(b)(1)(A); and, if the agency outcome is adverse, obtain federal court review. <i>Id.</i> § 405(g). The district court ruling meant that the regulation could be challenged but only through this statutory \"exhaustion of remedies\" procedure.</p>\n<p>There is no uniform rule governing when and how agency action can be judicially reviewed; the proper process depends, <i>inter alia,</i> on which agency is involved, what type of claim is pressed, statutory provisions and court-created doctrine. For example, courts have constructed doctrines requiring that administrative remedies be exhausted before judicial review is sought, <i>Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.,</i> 303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938), and that claims be \"ripe\" for review, <i>Abbott Labs, v.

Under 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), which in terms relates to the Social Security program but is incorporated <i>mutatis mutandis</i> into the Medicare Act, <i>id.</i> § 1395ii, neither federal question nor federal defendant jurisdiction is available for suits \"to recover on any claim arising under\" the Act.

The regulation being challenged is simply a limitation on the claims that Medicare will pay and so foreshadows the denial of such claims. The government concedes that  if a specific claim is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> denied on account of the regulation  the regulation may be challenged in court on review of the denial of a specific claim after administrative remedies are exhausted. <i>See </i><i>Ill. Council,</i> 529 U.S. at 23, 120 S.Ct. 1084 (so holding).</p>\n<p>PEAPMR responds with heavy reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians,</i> 476 U.S. 667, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986). When that case was decided, the Medicare Act did not provide for <i>any</i> judicial review of determinations made under Medicare Part B, and the Court refused to assume that Congress \"intended no review at all of substantial statutory and constitutional challenges to the Secretary's administration\" of that program. <i>Id.</i> at 680, 106 S.Ct. 2133. Invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance, the Court distinguished \"amount\" challenges (<i>i.e.,</i> fact-based challenges to particular decisions) from \"methodology\" challenges (<i>i.e.,</i> legal attacks on statutes, regulations and the like), and permitted the latter to proceed directly to court. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>PRAPMR's claim is, under that dichotomy, a \"methodology\" attack. But only a few months after <i>Michigan Academy,</i> Congress provided explicitly that Part B determinations <i>can</i> be challenged in court after administrative remedies have been exhausted. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-509, § 9341(a)(1), (b), 100 Stat. 1874, 2037-38 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395ff). So, as clarified in <i>Illinois Council, Michigan Academy</i> means only that section 405(h) does not apply if \"its application to a particular category of cases . . . would not lead to a channeling of review through the agency, but would mean no review at all.\" <i>Ill Council,</i> 529 U.S. 1, 17, 120 S.Ct. 1084, 146 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>That PRAPMR seeks to challenge an administrative regulation rather than a particular factual determination thus does not matter. The precedents \"foreclose distinctions based upon the `potential future' versus the `actual present' nature of the claim, the `general legal' versus the `fact-specific' nature of the challenge,\" and so on. <i>Ill. Council,</i> 529 U.S. at 13-14, 120 S.Ct. 1084. What does matter is whether PRAPMR can, at some point, using some process, obtain judicial review of its claims. <i>Accord </i><i>Am. Chiropractic Assoc., Inc. v. Leavitt,</i> 431 F.3d 812, 816 (D.C.Cir.2005). PRAPMR insists that barring its federal law suit would mean \"no review at all\" for its claims, <i>Ill. Council,</i> 529 U.S. at 17, 120 S.Ct. 1084, \"because there has been no payment claim denials yet.\" But this is not a denial of review, merely its postponement until a payment claim has been denied.</p>\n<p>Appellants complain that, in the meanwhile, the supply of therapists may dry up, and doctors may be unwilling to supply (or patients unwilling to accept) services that do not qualify, fearing that they may be asked to reimburse the agency later. But the doctors and therapists certainly have ample economic incentive to frame and support a test case. Appellants could provide service to a couple of patients through therapists who do not qualify, submit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> claims for reimbursement, and candidly admit in their filings that their only challenge is to the regulation.</p>\n<p>We therefore need not decide whether or when irreparable injury \"turns what appears to be simply a channeling requirement into <i>complete</i> preclusion of judicial review,\" <i>Ill. Council,</i> 529 U.S. at 22-23, 120 S.Ct. 1084, nor whether <i>Illinois Council's</i> exception applies to statutory as well as constitutional claims; but it should be remembered that the litigation process itself imposes risks and unrecoverable costs and there is little doubt that Congress can, in the context of a complex administrative scheme, preclude pre-enforcement challenges without creating a hardship exception. <i>Cf. </i><i>Nat'l Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Okla. Tax Comm'n,</i> 515 U.S. 582, 591, 115 S.Ct. 2351, 132 L.Ed.2d 509 (1995) (no federal right to declaratory or injunctive relief from unconstitutional state taxes if state law offers <i>ex post</i> refund).</p>\n<p>Further, the problem of irreparable injury does not only affect one side. It is likely that section 405's insistence on exhaustion owes something to the fear that the Secretary's decisions restricting payment might otherwise be promiscuously enjoined at great cost to the government. Channeling review makes certain that the agency determinations are thoroughly developed through the administrative process and that payments are not compelled until judicial review has been undertaken.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, PRAPMR suggested that the agency was approving noncompliant claims notwithstanding the regulation, but government counsel said he, was unaware of any program of deliberate nonenforcement. We need not consider whether a pattern of conduct designed to frustrate test cases brought to challenge the regulation would trigger the \"no review at all\" exception of <i>Illinois Council</i>; neither in the district court nor on appeal have the appellants offered anything more than speculation or even provided the legal analysis necessary to develop such an argument.</p>\n<p>Finally, PRAPMR argues that the submission of its self-styled \"Administrative Appeal\" to the agency should somehow change the analysis. But it concedes that it has not appealed any Medicare claim denial, and that is the only way, under the statute and regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 1395ff(b)(1)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 405.801, to initiate the multi-step appeal process that culminates in federal court review. We add only that it is in the government's interest, as well as the appellants', to get such a claim served up promptly.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  There was initial uncertainty as to whether the <i>Michigan Academy</i> exception retained its full force after the amendments.

It, and several doctors and patients, sued to challenge a regulation restricting Medicare reimbursement for physical therapy services. The district court dismissed the case, relying on statutory provisions that preclude all actions \"brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under\" the Medicare Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(h), 1395ii (2000). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>The federal Medicare program has several components. At issue here is Medicare Part B, which offers voluntary supplemental health insurance for \"aged and disabled individuals who elect to enroll under such program.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395j. Enrolled beneficiaries are entitled to recover reimbursement (usually partial) for covered medical costs; they may alternatively assign reimbursement rights to their physicians or other health care providers, who may then pursue the claims. 42 C.F.R. § 422.574(b).</p>\n<p>Among the medical costs covered by Medicare are those for services \"furnished as an incident to a physician's professional service, of kinds which are commonly furnished in physicians' offices and are commonly either rendered without charge or included in the physicians' bills.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(s)(2)(A). But under a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in 2004, physical therapy services provided in this \"incident-to\" fashion can only be reimbursed if the individual providing the therapy meets certain educational and training requirements. 42 C.F.R. §§ 410.60(a)(3)(iii), 484.4. The regulation means that medical doctors may no longer bill Medicare for physical therapy services provided in their offices by, for example, athletic trainers who lack the approved, specialized training in physical therapy.</p>\n<p>The regulation implemented a statutory prohibition, enacted by Congress in 1997, that precludes payment for physical therapy services provided \"incident to\" a doctor's services unless such services \"meet the standards and conditions\" that the Secretary is authorized to impose to govern physical therapy services provided independently, <i>e.g.</i> in a physical therapist's private office. 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(a)(20); <i>see also id.</i> § 1395x(p). Essentially, the new regulations require that whether therapy is billed as \"incident to\" a doctor's services or as an independent medical service, those providing the therapy meet the same qualifications.</p>\n<p>In March 2006, some eight months after the regulation took effect, PRAPMR submitted a self-styled \"Administrative Appeal\" to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), the agency that administers Medicare on behalf of the Secretary. The submission argued that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the regulation was arbitrary, unauthorized by statute and unconstitutional; CMS responded, advising the doctors that their letter had \"no legal bearing on CMS\" and suggesting that they \"pursue whatever other administrative processes are available.\" PRAPMR then filed this suit in Puerto Rico's federal district court, premised on federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2000), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the same medley of statutory and constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p>In dismissing the suit, the district court agreed with the agency that any challenge to the regulation must be channeled through a multi-step administrative review process before a federal court may pass on it. A patient or provider may, under a statutorily prescribed regime, seek administrative review wherever a claim for reimbursement for a service is rejected, 42 U.S.C. § 1395ff(b)(1)(A); and, if the agency outcome is adverse, obtain federal court review. <i>Id.</i> § 405(g). The district court ruling meant that the regulation could be challenged but only through this statutory \"exhaustion of remedies\" procedure.</p>\n<p>There is no uniform rule governing when and how agency action can be judicially reviewed; the proper process depends, <i>inter alia,</i> on which agency is involved, what type of claim is pressed, statutory provisions and court-created doctrine. For example, courts have constructed doctrines requiring that administrative remedies be exhausted before judicial review is sought, <i>Myers v.

Appellants could provide service to a couple of patients through therapists who do not qualify, submit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> claims for reimbursement, and candidly admit in their filings that their only challenge is to the regulation.</p>\n<p>We therefore need not decide whether or when irreparable injury \"turns what appears to be simply a channeling requirement into <i>complete</i> preclusion of judicial review,\" <i>Ill. Council,</i> 529 U.S. at 22-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118342\"><a href=\"/opinion/118342/shalala-v-illinois-council-on-long-term-care-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span>, nor whether <i>Illinois Council's</i> exception applies to statutory as well as constitutional claims; but it should be remembered that the litigation process itself imposes risks and unrecoverable costs and there is little doubt that Congress can, in the context of a complex administrative scheme, preclude pre-enforcement challenges without creating a hardship exception. <i>Cf. </i><i>Nat'l Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Okla. Tax Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117961\"><a href=\"/opinion/117961/national-private-truck-council-inc-v-oklahoma-tax-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 591, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117961\"><a href=\"/opinion/117961/national-private-truck-council-inc-v-oklahoma-tax-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is likely that section 405's insistence on exhaustion owes something to the fear that the Secretary's decisions restricting payment might otherwise be promiscuously enjoined at great cost to the government. Channeling review makes certain that the agency determinations are thoroughly developed through the administrative process and that payments are not compelled until judicial review has been undertaken.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, PRAPMR suggested that the agency was approving noncompliant claims notwithstanding the regulation, but government counsel said he, was unaware of any program of deliberate nonenforcement. We need not consider whether a pattern of conduct designed to frustrate test cases brought to challenge the regulation would trigger the \"no review at all\" exception of <i>Illinois Council</i>; neither in the district court nor on appeal have the appellants offered anything more than speculation or even provided the legal analysis necessary to develop such an argument.</p>\n<p>Finally, PRAPMR argues that the submission of its self-styled \"Administrative Appeal\" to the agency should somehow change the analysis. But it concedes that it has not appealed any Medicare claim denial, and that is the only way, under the statute and regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 1395ff(b)(1)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 405.801, to initiate the multi-step appeal process that culminates in federal court review. We add only that it is in the government's interest, as well as the appellants', to get such a claim served up promptly.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  There was initial uncertainty as to whether the <i>Michigan Academy</i> exception retained its full force after the amendments.
