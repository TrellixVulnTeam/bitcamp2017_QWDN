R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-1456\n\n                         MARC RICHARD ADAMS,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                   COMMISSIONER, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n               DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n          [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Marc Richard Adams on brief pro se.\n     Peter W. Heed, Attorney General and Nancy J. Smith, Senior\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          November 17, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam.   Pro se inmate Marc Adams appeals the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of his civil rights complaint for failure to\n\nexhaust   administrative   remedies,   as   required   by   the   Prisoner\n\nLitigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C ยง 1997e(a).              We have\n\nreviewed the record and the parties' submissions and conclude that,\n\ncontrary to appellant's contentions, the district court applied the\n\nproper standards of law and correctly concluded that appellant had\n\nfailed to exhaust his PLRA remedies.          To the extent appellant\n\nargues that defendants waived or should have been estopped from\n\nasserting the failure-to-exhaust defense, his arguments are legally\n\nand factually unfounded.\n\n     Affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
