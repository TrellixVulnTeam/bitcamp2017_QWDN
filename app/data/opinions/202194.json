On July 6, 1995, Uwagboe Orumwense\n\nLawrence--a Nigerian citizen who was a lawful permanent resident of\n\nthe United States--pled guilty in the South Boston District Court\n\nto a charge of larceny in the amount of roughly $18,000, apparently\n\nbased on the writing of bad checks.                  He received a two-year\n\nsentence, which was suspended, and completed probation without\n\nincident.       What followed were the federal government's efforts to\n\ndeport Lawrence, leading to the proceedings now before us.\n\n               In May 1998, the former Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\") began removal proceedings against Lawrence as an\n\nalien       convicted    of    an   aggravated   felony    under   8   U.S.C.A.   §\n\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (West Supp. 1998).              As that provision stood in\n\n1995, Lawrence's offense had not been an aggravated felony, because\n\nthe term of imprisonment imposed was less than five years.                        8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994).             By 1998, Congress had broadened\n\nthe definition to include theft convictions involving sentences of\n\none year or more.         8 U.S.C.A. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (West Supp. 1998).1\n\n               Seeking    to    avoid    deportation      under    this   expanded\n\ndefinition, Lawrence asked the South Boston District Court to\n\n\n\n        1\n      Retroactive applications of the immigration laws are\npermissible if Congress clearly intends such applications, INS v.\nSt. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 316 (2001), as deportation is treated as\npart of Congress' power to regulate immigration civilly and not as\npunishment for crime, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038\n(1984).    Here, the broadened definition was to be applied\n\"regardless of whether the conviction was entered before, on, or\nafter\" the statute's enactment date. 8 U.S.C.A. § 1101(a)(43).\n\n                                         -2-\n\frevise and revoke his prior sentence, or, in the alternative, to\n\norder a new trial.    The court granted a new trial, and on July 30,\n\n1998, it accepted Lawrence's new guilty plea and sentenced him to\n\n338 days of probation--just below the one-year floor established by\n\nthe new definition.    The apparent basis for the new trial was that\n\nhis original guilty plea was made without warning of the possible\n\ndeportation consequences.       See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, § 29D\n\n(1994).\n\n          The   INS   then   amended    its   charge    against    Lawrence,\n\nalleging that he was in any event removable as an alien convicted\n\nof a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one\n\nyear or longer may be imposed. 8 U.S.C.A. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) (West\n\nSupp. 1998).    After a hearing, an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found\n\nthat Lawrence was removable under this provision, but granted\n\nLawrence time so he could file an asylum petition (which Lawrence\n\nsubsequently submitted and then later withdrew).\n\n          Proceedings    were    then    delayed       pending    the   INS's\n\nadjudication of an I-130 petition filed on Lawrence's behalf by his\n\nwife, who is a United States citizen.2        After the INS approved the\n\npetition on February 2, 2000--which is merely a first step--\n\nLawrence submitted an application for an adjustment of status and\n\n\n\n     2\n      The I-130 petition allows a citizen or permanent resident of\nthe United States to establish a connection with certain eligible\nnon-citizen relatives (for example, a spouse or a child) so that\nthese relatives may seek a visa or adjustment of status.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fan   application   for     a    discretionary        waiver     of     a    ground    of\n\ninadmissibility    under       section    212(h)     of   the     Immigration        and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\").           8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) (2000).                    Section\n\n212(h), which is not at issue in this appeal, permits waivers in\n\ncertain situations involving family hardship.3\n\n            On October 24, 2001, after a hearing, the IJ ordered\n\nLawrence to be deported to Nigeria and denied his applications for\n\nan adjustment of status and for a discretionary waiver under\n\nsection 212(h). The IJ's removal order rested solely on the ground\n\nthat Lawrence had been convicted of a crime involving \"moral\n\nturpitude\" within five years of his admission into the United\n\nStates.     Lawrence filed a motion to reopen and reconsider these\n\ndenials, but the IJ denied the motion, noting that Lawrence's\n\ncriminal    history,     false     statements        in   aid     of       his    asylum\n\napplication, and fraudulent activity outweighed competing claims of\n\nhardship.\n\n            Lawrence   then      appealed      to   the   Board      of    Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\"), which, on July 2, 2002, affirmed the IJ's decision\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      This provision allows the Attorney General to waive\ndeportation in certain cases if, among other things, an alien is\n\"the spouse, parent, son, or daughter\" of a citizen or permanent\nresident and \"it is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney\nGeneral that the alien's denial of admission would result in\nextreme hardship to the United States citizen or lawfully resident\nspouse, parent, son, or daughter of such alien.\"        8 U.S.C. §\n1182(h) (2000).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fwithout opinion.     An initial motion to reopen and reconsider was\n\ndenied, and a second one rejected as untimely.\n\n          Thereafter, Lawrence was detained pending his removal in\n\nNorth Dartmouth, Massachusetts, by the Bureau of Immigration and\n\nCustoms Enforcement.    In April 2003, he petitioned for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus in the district court in Massachusetts and sought a\n\nstay of deportation, which the district court granted. On June 24,\n\n2005, while Lawrence's habeas petition was still pending, the\n\ndistrict court ordered it to be transferred to this court pursuant\n\nto section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13,\n\nDiv. B, 119 Stat. 302, 311 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5)).\n\n          On April 26, 2005, Lawrence filed a special motion with\n\nthe BIA to reopen his case in order to seek relief under former\n\nsection 212(c) of the INA (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994)).4\n\nThe BIA denied Lawrence's motion on June 30, 2005, finding that he\n\nwas ineligible for the requested relief.       Lawrence then filed the\n\npresent petition for judicial review of the BIA's decision.           We\n\nconsolidated   the   petition   for   review   with   Lawrence's   habeas\n\nproceeding, which had already been transferred to this court by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n     4\n      This section, prior to its repeal in 1996, provided that\n\"[a]liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily\nproceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,\nand who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven\nconsecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the\nAttorney General.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994).\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          In his petition for review, Lawrence challenges the BIA's\n\ndenial of his April 2005 motion to reopen his case.   Review of such\n\na denial is for \"abuse of discretion,\" but this rubric includes\n\nerrors of law, Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 26-27 (1st Cir.\n\n2004), which are reviewed de novo, \"according due weight to the\n\nBIA's expertise in construing the statutory framework that it\n\nadministers.\"   Orehhova v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (quoting Radkov v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).\n\n          Lawrence does not dispute that he is removable because\n\nhis crime was one of moral turpitude (and meets the other statutory\n\nconditions for removability on this ground), but he says that the\n\nBIA erred in ruling that, as a matter of law, section 212(c) relief\n\nis unavailable to him.   Read literally, section 212(c) appears to\n\nbe limited solely to persons seeking to reenter the United States,\n\nbut it has been judicially enlarged to cover persons already inside\n\nthe United States who are similarly situated.5\n\n          Lawrence's problem is that this waiver authority was\n\nitself repealed in 1996--before his application. But in INS v. St.\n\nCyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), the Supreme Court held that because\n\n\n\n     5\n      Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 281 (1st Cir. 1999).       See\ngenerally Francis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir. 1976). The waiver\nauthority, whether for reentrants or residents, is limited to those\nwith \"a lawful unrelinquished domicile [in the U.S.] of seven\nconsecutive years,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994); Lawrence falls\nwithin this category.\n\n                                -6-\n\fCongress was unclear as to retroactive application of the repeal,\n\napplication for such relief could still be made even after repeal\n\nby those aliens \"whose convictions were obtained through plea\n\nagreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have\n\nbeen eligible for § 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under\n\nthe law then in effect.\"      Id. at 326.\n\n            The Court's rationale for this prudential line-drawing\n\nwas that \"[p]lea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a\n\ncriminal defendant and the government,\" id. at 321--that is, the\n\navailability of potential section 212(c) relief might have been\n\nrelied on by the defendant, id. at 322-23.          To implement St. Cyr,\n\nthe Justice Department provides that withholding relief may be\n\nsought if the alien \"[a]greed to plead guilty or nolo contendere to\n\nan offense rendering the alien deportable or removable, pursuant to\n\na   plea   agreement   made   before   April   1,   1997.\"   8   C.F.R.   §\n\n1003.44(b)(2) (2006).\n\n            Although the Attorney General's decision whether to grant\n\nwithholding remains discretionary,6 the BIA's refusal to entertain\n\nLawrence's request is based on a ruling of law--namely, that the\n\n1998 conviction and plea represent the pertinent date for judging\n\n\n\n      6\n      As a discretionary decision, it would be only doubtfully\nreviewable under the standard provisions of the Administrative\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) (2000), but in any event 8\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B) makes it crystal clear that we would be\nwithout authority to review this discretionary decision except for\na mistaken premise of law, id. § 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fwhether the exception in St. Cyr and the regulation apply.              This\n\nruling is itself reviewable under the venerable principle of\n\nService v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 372 (1957), even though the\n\nAttorney General would thereafter be free to deny withholding on\n\ndiscretionary grounds.\n\n          The   BIA's   decision   that    Lawrence   is   ineligible   for\n\nsection 212(c) relief is correct.         St. Cyr allows section 212(c)\n\nrelief to be sought, despite the repeal of the section, by those\n\nwho would have been eligible \"at the time of their plea under the\n\nlaw then in effect.\"      533 U.S. at 326 (emphasis added).             The\n\nregulation, which applies St. Cyr, refines this language, stating\n\nthat the alien must have pled guilty \"pursuant to a plea agreement\n\nmade before April 1, 1997.\"        8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(b)(2) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          The potential discrepancy between the two tests does not\n\nmatter here.    Lawrence's currently effective plea and conviction\n\noccurred in July 1998, well after the April 1997 cutoff date.            At\n\nthe time he pled guilty, section 212(c) had been repealed.         He had\n\nno basis for assuming (as part of his plea or otherwise) that\n\nsection 212(c) relief would be potentially available as part of the\n\nquid pro quo for the plea.\n\n          Lawrence says that the availability of section 212(c)\n\nrelief should be determined based upon when the conduct underlying\n\nhis conviction took place.     This is the test used in an ex post\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\ffacto analysis where punishment is increased for a pre-existing\n\ncrime, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 594 (1952), but ex\n\npost facto principles do not apply to removal proceedings, Galvan\n\nv. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954).             Instead, St. Cyr and the\n\nregulations control, and, for their tests, the date of the criminal\n\nconduct is irrelevant.\n\n           Lawrence also argues that his 1995 conviction should fix\n\nthe pertinent date because the superceding 1998 conviction was\n\nobtained solely for strategic purposes--i.e., to avoid the expanded\n\naggravated felony definition. St. Cyr's concern is with whether an\n\nalien   entering   a   plea   could   be    relying   in   his   plea   on   the\n\navailability of section 212(c) relief--not with why an alien was\n\ninterested in entering a plea in the first place.           By 1998, section\n\n212(c) was repealed, and under St. Cyr, a post-repeal plea bars an\n\nalien from seeking relief under that provision.\n\n           This brings us to Lawrence's habeas petition, in which he\n\ncollaterally attacked the removal proceeding.              He claimed inter\n\nalia that the IJ took inappropriate judicial notice of certain\n\nfacts, that the IJ did not conduct the hearings in accordance with\n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements, and that Lawrence's counsel\n\nwas ineffective.       Citing the REAL ID Act, the district court\n\ntransferred the petition to us.\n\n           The REAL ID Act did not give us habeas jurisdiction.\n\nRather, the statute says (with an exception not here relevant) that\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f\"a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals\n\n. . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of\n\nan order of removal.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5) (emphasis added).         At\n\nmost, a habeas petition seeking to attack such an order becomes\n\nupon transfer a petition for review, REAL ID Act, tit. I, § 106(c),\n\n119 Stat. at 311, allowing us to consider whatever claims might be\n\nreviewable by ordinary petition to review a BIA removal order.\n\n            However, Lawrence's entire brief in this court is devoted\n\nto arguing the section 212(c) claim already discussed.           The single\n\nreference   in   his   brief   to   arguments   presented   in   the   habeas\n\nproceeding is this: \"On all other issues raised before the District\n\nCourt in Petitioner's Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus (as\n\namended Sept. 20, 2004), Petitioner rests on his filings before the\n\nDistrict Court.\" There is no discussion whatsoever in the brief in\n\nthis court of the quite different attacks on the removal order made\n\nin the district court.\n\n            Such an attempt to incorporate by cross-reference does\n\nnot comport with our ordinary rule that claims made to this court\n\nmust be presented fully in an appellate brief and not by cross-\n\nreference to claims made in the district court.             Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(a)(9)(A); R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d\n\n31, 48 n.6 (1st Cir. 2002).         Indeed, because the statute now makes\n\nthe petition for review process the exclusive method of review for\n\nremoval orders, there is no warrant for this kind of habeas filing.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            In the future, claims presented by cross-reference to a\n\ntransferred habeas petition are likely to be summarily disregarded.\n\nBut the notion of transferring a habeas petition under the REAL ID\n\nAct is relatively new.     Possibly Lawrence's counsel thought that\n\nthe petition, having been transferred, could itself be regarded as\n\nthe equivalent of an appellate brief, even though it complies with\n\nnone of the formalities specified in the Federal Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure or our own local rules.\n\n            In any case, this court may review a final removal order\n\nonly as to claims that have been properly exhausted through the\n\nadministrative process.     8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).   Lawrence never\n\npresented to the BIA his claims that the IJ took inappropriate\n\njudicial notice of certain facts and did not properly conduct the\n\nhearings.    As for any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nLawrence failed to comply with the procedures required by Matter of\n\nLozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).\n\n             The fact that Lawrence had filed a separate habeas\n\npetition at some point after the BIA proceedings does not affect\n\nthe application of the statutory exhaustion provision governing\n\npetitions for review.    See, e.g., Bonhometre v. Gonzales, 414 F.3d\n\n442, 445-48 (3d Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1362 (2006).\n\nLawrence had the opportunity to raise before the BIA the claims now\n\nmade in his habeas petition, yet he failed to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            There is one loose end.    Lawrence included in his habeas\n\npetition a further claim of a different kind: he argued that,\n\nhaving been detained for longer than 90 days, he should be released\n\nfrom detention as he awaits deportation. The statute prescribes 90\n\ndays as the presumptive period of detention pending deportation, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A), but allows for extension of this period\n\nunder certain circumstances, id. § 1231(a)(6).             This challenge to\n\ndetention    is   arguably   not   governed    by    the   exclusive   review\n\nprovision of the REAL ID Act.\n\n            In any case, Lawrence's argument would fail on the\n\nmerits.     Because Lawrence was found to be removable under the\n\n\"crime     involving   moral   turpitude\"      provision,       8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1227(a)(2)(A)(i), the statute explicitly states that he \"may be\n\ndetained beyond the [90-day] removal period,\" id. § 1231(a)(6).\n\nWhile the statute on its face provides no limits for this detention\n\npower, the Supreme Court has read the statute as \"limit[ing] an\n\nalien's    post-removal-period     detention    to    a    period   reasonably\n\nnecessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United\n\nStates.\"    Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001).\n\n            Lawrence's continued detention here occurred pursuant to\n\nhis own procuring of stays incident to his legal challenges to the\n\nremoval order; it is beyond dispute that this period of time was\n\nnecessary to bring about Lawrence's removal, which--now that the\n\ncurrent litigation is resolved--is presumably imminent.              A remand\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fon the issue of the length of detention, which has not been\n\nrequested, would be wholly fruitless.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.

He received a two-year sentence, which was suspended, and completed probation without incident. What followed were the federal government's efforts to deport Lawrence, leading to the proceedings now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1998, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") began removal proceedings against Lawrence as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (West Supp.1998). As that provision stood in 1995, Lawrence's offense had not been an aggravated felony, because the term of imprisonment imposed was less than five years. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994). By 1998, Congress had broadened the definition to include theft convictions involving sentences of one year or more. 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(G) (West Supp.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to avoid deportation under this expanded definition, Lawrence asked the South Boston District Court to revise and revoke his prior sentence, or, in the alternative, to order a new trial. The court granted a new trial, and on July 30, 1998, it accepted Lawrence's new guilty plea and sentenced him to 338 days of probation &#8212; just below the one-year floor established by the new definition. The apparent basis for the new trial was that his original guilty plea was made without warning of the possible deportation consequences. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &#167; 29D (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS then amended its charge against Lawrence, alleging that he was in any event removable as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer <i>may</i> be imposed. 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) (West Supp.1998). After a hearing, an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Lawrence was removable under this provision, but granted Lawrence time so he could file an asylum petition (which Lawrence subsequently submitted and then later withdrew).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings were then delayed pending the INS's adjudication of an I-130 petition filed on Lawrence's behalf by his wife, who is a United States citizen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> After the INS approved the petition on February 2, 2000 &#8212; which is merely a first step &#8212; Lawrence submitted an application for an adjustment of status and an application for a discretionary waiver of a ground of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h) (2000). Section 212(h), which is not at issue in this appeal, permits waivers in certain situations involving family hardship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, 2001, after a hearing, the IJ ordered Lawrence to be deported to Nigeria and denied his applications for an adjustment of status and for a discretionary waiver under section 212(h). The IJ's removal order rested solely on the ground that Lawrence had been convicted of a crime involving \"moral turpitude\" within five years of his admission into the United States. Lawrence filed a motion to reopen and reconsider these denials, but the IJ denied the motion, noting that Lawrence's criminal history, false statements in aid of his asylum application, and fraudulent activity outweighed competing claims of hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which, on July 2, 2002, affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion. An initial motion to reopen and reconsider was denied, and a second one rejected as untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Lawrence was detained pending his removal in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April 2003, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court in Massachusetts and sought a stay of deportation, which the district court granted. On June 24, 2005, while Lawrence's habeas petition was still pending, the district court ordered it to be transferred to this court pursuant to section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 302, 311 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(5)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2005, Lawrence filed a special motion with the BIA to reopen his case in order to seek relief under former section 212(c) of the INA (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1994)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The BIA denied Lawrence's motion on June 30, 2005, finding that he was ineligible for the requested relief. Lawrence then filed the present petition for judicial review of the BIA's decision. We consolidated the petition for review with Lawrence's habeas proceeding, which had already been transferred to this court by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his petition for review, Lawrence challenges the BIA's denial of his April 2005 motion to reopen his case. Review of such a denial is for \"abuse of discretion,\" but this rubric includes errors of law, <i>Wang v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 25, 26-27 (1st Cir.2004), which are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> \"according due weight to the BIA's expertise in construing the statutory framework that it administers.\" <i>Orehhova v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Radkov v. Ashcroft,</i> 375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence does not dispute that he is removable because his crime was one of moral turpitude (and meets the other statutory conditions for removability on this ground), but he says that the BIA erred in ruling that, as a matter of law, section 212(c) relief is unavailable to him. Read literally, section 212(c) appears to be limited solely to persons seeking to reenter the United States, but it has been judicially enlarged to cover persons already inside the United States who are similarly situated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence's problem is that this waiver authority was itself repealed in 1996 &#8212; before his application. But in <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court held that because Congress was unclear as to retroactive application of the repeal, application for such relief could still be made even after repeal by those aliens \"whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court's rationale for this prudential line-drawing was that \"[p]lea agreements involve a <i>quid pro quo</i> between a criminal defendant and the government,\" <i>id.</i> at 321, 121 S.Ct. 2271 &#8212; that is, the availability of potential section 212(c) relief might have been relied on by the defendant, <i>id.</i> at 322-23, 121 S.Ct. 2271. To implement <i>St. Cyr,</i> the Justice Department provides that withholding relief may be sought if the alien \"[a]greed to plead guilty or nolo contendere to an offense rendering the alien deportable or removable, pursuant to a plea agreement made before April 1, 1997.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.44(b)(2) (2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Attorney General's decision whether to grant withholding remains discretionary,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the BIA's refusal to <i>entertain</i> Lawrence's request is based on a ruling of law &#8212; namely, that the 1998 conviction and plea represent the pertinent date for judging whether the exception in <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulation apply. This ruling is itself reviewable under the venerable principle of <i>Service v. Dulles,</i> 354 U.S. 363, 372, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957), even though the Attorney General would thereafter be free to deny withholding on discretionary grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's decision that Lawrence is ineligible for section 212(c) relief is correct. <i>St. Cyr</i> allows section 212(c) relief to be sought, despite the repeal of the section, by those who would have been eligible \"at the time of their <i>plea</i> under the law then in effect.\" 533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (emphasis added). The regulation, which applies <i>St. Cyr,</i> refines this language, stating that the alien must have pled guilty \"pursuant to a <i>plea agreement</i> made before April 1, 1997.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.44(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The potential discrepancy between the two tests does not matter here. Lawrence's currently effective plea and conviction occurred in July 1998, well after the April 1997 cutoff date. At the time he pled guilty, section 212(c) had been repealed. He had no basis for assuming (as part of his plea or otherwise) that section 212(c) relief would be potentially available as part of the <i>quid pro quo</i> for the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence says that the availability of section 212(c) relief should be determined based upon when the <i>conduct</i> underlying his conviction took place. This is the test used in an <i>ex post facto</i> analysis where punishment is increased for a pre-existing crime, <i>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy,</i> 342 U.S. 580, 594, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952), but <i>ex post facto</i> principles do not apply to removal proceedings, <i>Galvan v. Press,</i> 347 U.S. 522, 531, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954). Instead, <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulations control, and, for their tests, the date of the criminal conduct is irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence also argues that his 1995 conviction should fix the pertinent date because the superceding 1998 conviction was obtained solely for strategic purposes &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> to avoid the expanded aggravated felony definition. <i>St. Cyr's</i> concern is with whether an alien entering a plea could be relying in his plea on the availability of section 212(c) relief &#8212; not with why an alien was interested in entering a plea in the first place. By 1998, section 212(c) was repealed, and under <i>St. Cyr,</i> a post-repeal plea bars an alien from seeking relief under that provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Lawrence's habeas petition, in which he collaterally attacked the removal proceeding. He claimed <i>inter alia</i> that the IJ took inappropriate judicial notice of certain facts, that the IJ did not conduct the hearings in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, and that Lawrence's counsel was ineffective. Citing the REAL ID Act, the district court transferred the petition to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The REAL ID Act did not give us habeas jurisdiction. Rather, the statute says (with an exception not here relevant) that \"a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be the <i>sole and exclusive means</i> for judicial review of an order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(5) (emphasis added). At most, a habeas petition seeking to attack such an order becomes upon transfer a petition for review, REAL ID Act, tit. I, &#167; 106(c), 119 Stat. at 311, allowing us to consider whatever claims might be reviewable by ordinary petition to review a BIA removal order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Lawrence's entire brief in this court is devoted to arguing the section 212(c) claim already discussed. The single reference in his brief to arguments presented in the habeas proceeding is this: \"On all other issues raised before the District Court in Petitioner's Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus (as amended Sept. 20, 2004), Petitioner rests on his filings before the District Court.\" There is no discussion whatsoever in the brief in this court of the quite different attacks on the removal order made in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an attempt to incorporate by cross-reference does not comport with our ordinary rule that claims made to this court must be presented fully in an appellate brief and not by cross-reference to claims made in the district court. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <i>R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States,</i> 304 F.3d 31, 48 n. 6 (1st Cir.2002). Indeed, because the statute now makes the petition for review process the exclusive method of review for removal orders, there is no warrant for this kind of habeas filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the future, claims presented by cross-reference to a transferred habeas petition are likely to be summarily disregarded. But the notion of transferring a habeas petition under the REAL ID Act is relatively new. Possibly Lawrence's counsel thought that the petition, having been transferred, could itself be regarded as the equivalent of an appellate brief, even though it complies with none of the formalities specified in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure or our own local rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, this court may review a final removal order only as to claims that have been properly exhausted through the administrative process. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1). Lawrence never presented to the BIA his claims that the IJ took inappropriate judicial notice of certain facts and did not properly conduct the hearings. As for any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Lawrence failed to comply with the procedures required by <i>Matter of Lozada,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Lawrence had filed a separate habeas petition at some point after the BIA proceedings does not affect the application of the statutory exhaustion provision governing petitions for review. <i>See, e.g., Bonhometre v. Gonzales,</i> 414 F.3d 442, 445-48 (3d Cir.2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1362, 164 L.Ed.2d 72 (2006). Lawrence had the opportunity to raise before the BIA the claims now made in his habeas petition, yet he failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one loose end. Lawrence included in his habeas petition a further claim of a different kind: he argued that, having been detained for longer than 90 days, he should be released from detention as he awaits deportation. The statute prescribes 90 days as the presumptive period of detention pending deportation, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(1)(A), but allows for extension of this period under certain circumstances, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1231(a)(6). This challenge to detention is arguably not governed by the exclusive review provision of the REAL ID Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, Lawrence's argument would fail on the merits. Because Lawrence was found to be removable under the \"crime involving moral turpitude\" provision, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), the statute explicitly states that he \"may be detained beyond the [90-day] removal period,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1231(a)(6). While the statute on its face provides no limits for this detention power, the Supreme Court has read the statute as \"limit[ing] an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States.\" <i>Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 689, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence's continued detention here occurred pursuant to his own procuring of stays incident to his legal challenges to the removal order; it is beyond dispute that this period of time was necessary to bring about Lawrence's removal, which &#8212; now that the current litigation is resolved &#8212; is presumably imminent. A remand on the issue of the length of detention, which has not been requested, would be wholly fruitless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i> The stays of removal previously entered will be <i>vacated</i> automatically and without further order upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Retroactive applications of the immigration laws are permissible if Congress clearly intends such applications,<i>INS v.

Scadron, Assistant Director, on consolidated brief for respondent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 1995, Uwagboe Orumwense Lawrence &#8212; a Nigerian citizen who was a lawful permanent resident of the United States &#8212; pled guilty in the South Boston District Court to a charge of larceny in the amount of roughly $18,000, apparently based on the writing of bad checks. He received a two-year sentence, which was suspended, and completed probation without incident. What followed were the federal government's efforts to deport Lawrence, leading to the proceedings now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1998, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") began removal proceedings against Lawrence as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (West Supp.1998). As that provision stood in 1995, Lawrence's offense had not been an aggravated felony, because the term of imprisonment imposed was less than five years. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(G) (1994). By 1998, Congress had broadened the definition to include theft convictions involving sentences of one year or more. 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(G) (West Supp.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to avoid deportation under this expanded definition, Lawrence asked the South Boston District Court to revise and revoke his prior sentence, or, in the alternative, to order a new trial. The court granted a new trial, and on July 30, 1998, it accepted Lawrence's new guilty plea and sentenced him to 338 days of probation &#8212; just below the one-year floor established by the new definition. The apparent basis for the new trial was that his original guilty plea was made without warning of the possible deportation consequences. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &#167; 29D (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS then amended its charge against Lawrence, alleging that he was in any event removable as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer <i>may</i> be imposed. 8 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) (West Supp.1998). After a hearing, an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Lawrence was removable under this provision, but granted Lawrence time so he could file an asylum petition (which Lawrence subsequently submitted and then later withdrew).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings were then delayed pending the INS's adjudication of an I-130 petition filed on Lawrence's behalf by his wife, who is a United States citizen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> After the INS approved the petition on February 2, 2000 &#8212; which is merely a first step &#8212; Lawrence submitted an application for an adjustment of status and an application for a discretionary waiver of a ground of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h) (2000). Section 212(h), which is not at issue in this appeal, permits waivers in certain situations involving family hardship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, 2001, after a hearing, the IJ ordered Lawrence to be deported to Nigeria and denied his applications for an adjustment of status and for a discretionary waiver under section 212(h). The IJ's removal order rested solely on the ground that Lawrence had been convicted of a crime involving \"moral turpitude\" within five years of his admission into the United States. Lawrence filed a motion to reopen and reconsider these denials, but the IJ denied the motion, noting that Lawrence's criminal history, false statements in aid of his asylum application, and fraudulent activity outweighed competing claims of hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which, on July 2, 2002, affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion. An initial motion to reopen and reconsider was denied, and a second one rejected as untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Lawrence was detained pending his removal in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April 2003, he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court in Massachusetts and sought a stay of deportation, which the district court granted. On June 24, 2005, while Lawrence's habeas petition was still pending, the district court ordered it to be transferred to this court pursuant to section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 302, 311 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(5)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2005, Lawrence filed a special motion with the BIA to reopen his case in order to seek relief under former section 212(c) of the INA (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1994)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The BIA denied Lawrence's motion on June 30, 2005, finding that he was ineligible for the requested relief. Lawrence then filed the present petition for judicial review of the BIA's decision.

Read literally, section 212(c) appears to be limited solely to persons seeking to reenter the United States, but it has been judicially enlarged to cover persons already inside the United States who are similarly situated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence's problem is that this waiver authority was itself repealed in 1996 &#8212; before his application.

To implement <i>St. Cyr,</i> the Justice Department provides that withholding relief may be sought if the alien \"[a]greed to plead guilty or nolo contendere to an offense rendering the alien deportable or removable, pursuant to a plea agreement made before April 1, 1997.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.44(b)(2) (2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Attorney General's decision whether to grant withholding remains discretionary,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the BIA's refusal to <i>entertain</i> Lawrence's request is based on a ruling of law &#8212; namely, that the 1998 conviction and plea represent the pertinent date for judging whether the exception in <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulation apply. This ruling is itself reviewable under the venerable principle of <i>Service v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2271</span></a></span> (emphasis added). The regulation, which applies <i>St. Cyr,</i> refines this language, stating that the alien must have pled guilty \"pursuant to a <i>plea agreement</i> made before April 1, 1997.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.44(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The potential discrepancy between the two tests does not matter here. Lawrence's currently effective plea and conviction occurred in July 1998, well after the April 1997 cutoff date. At the time he pled guilty, section 212(c) had been repealed. He had no basis for assuming (as part of his plea or otherwise) that section 212(c) relief would be potentially available as part of the <i>quid pro quo</i> for the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence says that the availability of section 212(c) relief should be determined based upon when the <i>conduct</i> underlying his conviction took place. This is the test used in an <i>ex post facto</i> analysis where punishment is increased for a pre-existing crime, <i>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span>, 594, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead, <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulations control, and, for their tests, the date of the criminal conduct is irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lawrence also argues that his 1995 conviction should fix the pertinent date because the superceding 1998 conviction was obtained solely for strategic purposes &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> to avoid the expanded aggravated felony definition. <i>St. Cyr's</i> concern is with whether an alien entering a plea could be relying in his plea on the availability of section 212(c) relief &#8212; not with why an alien was interested in entering a plea in the first place. By 1998, section 212(c) was repealed, and under <i>St. Cyr,</i> a post-repeal plea bars an alien from seeking relief under that provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Lawrence's habeas petition, in which he collaterally attacked the removal proceeding. He claimed <i>inter alia</i> that the IJ took inappropriate judicial notice of certain facts, that the IJ did not conduct the hearings in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, and that Lawrence's counsel was ineffective. Citing the REAL ID Act, the district court transferred the petition to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The REAL ID Act did not give us habeas jurisdiction. Rather, the statute says (with an exception not here relevant) that \"a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be the <i>sole and exclusive means</i> for judicial review of an order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(5) (emphasis added). At most, a habeas petition seeking to attack such an order becomes upon transfer a petition for review, REAL ID Act, tit. I, &#167; 106(c), 119 Stat. at 311, allowing us to consider whatever claims might be reviewable by ordinary petition to review a BIA removal order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Lawrence's entire brief in this court is devoted to arguing the section 212(c) claim already discussed. The single reference in his brief to arguments presented in the habeas proceeding is this: \"On all other issues raised before the District Court in Petitioner's Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus (as amended Sept. 20, 2004), Petitioner rests on his filings before the District Court.\" There is no discussion whatsoever in the brief in this court of the quite different attacks on the removal order made in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an attempt to incorporate by cross-reference does not comport with our ordinary rule that claims made to this court must be presented fully in an appellate brief and not by cross-reference to claims made in the district court. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <i>R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779179\"><a href=\"/opinion/779179/rhode-island-department-of-environmental-management-state-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 48 n. 6 (1st Cir.2002). Indeed, because the statute now makes the petition for review process the exclusive method of review for removal orders, there is no warrant for this kind of habeas filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the future, claims presented by cross-reference to a transferred habeas petition are likely to be summarily disregarded. But the notion of transferring a habeas petition under the REAL ID Act is relatively new. Possibly Lawrence's counsel thought that the petition, having been transferred, could itself be regarded as the equivalent of an appellate brief, even though it complies with none of the formalities specified in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure or our own local rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, this court may review a final removal order only as to claims that have been properly exhausted through the administrative process. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1). Lawrence never presented to the BIA his claims that the IJ took inappropriate judicial notice of certain facts and did not properly conduct the hearings. As for any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Lawrence failed to comply with the procedures required by <i>Matter of Lozada,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Lawrence had filed a separate habeas petition at some point after the BIA proceedings does not affect the application of the statutory exhaustion provision governing petitions for review. <i>See, e.g., Bonhometre v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790930\"><a href=\"/opinion/790930/frebert-bonhometre-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 445-48 (3d Cir.2005), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992934\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992934/bonhometre-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span> (2006). Lawrence had the opportunity to raise before the BIA the claims now made in his habeas petition, yet he failed to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one loose end. Lawrence included in his habeas petition a further claim of a different kind: he argued that, having been detained for longer than 90 days, he should be released from detention as he awaits deportation. The statute prescribes 90 days as the presumptive period of detention pending deportation, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(1)(A), but allows for extension of this period under certain circumstances, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1231(a)(6). This challenge to detention is arguably not governed by the exclusive review provision of the REAL ID Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, Lawrence's argument would fail on the merits. Because Lawrence was found to be removable under the \"crime involving moral turpitude\" provision, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), the statute explicitly states that he \"may be detained beyond the [90-day] removal period,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1231(a)(6). While the statute on its face provides no limits for this detention power, the Supreme Court has read the statute as \"limit[ing] an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States.\" <i>Zadvydas v.
