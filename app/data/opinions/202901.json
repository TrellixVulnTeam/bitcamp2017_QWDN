Young, Attorney, National Labor Relations\nBoard, with whom Fred B. Jacob, Supervisory Attorney, Ronald\nMeisburg, General Counsel, John E. Higgins, Jr., Deputy General\nCounsel, John H. Ferguson, Associate General Counsel, and Aileen A.\nArmstrong, Deputy Associate General Counsel, were on brief, for\npetitioner.\n     Robert Weihrauch for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           August 17, 2007\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. The slow grinding of the wheels of\n\njustice is a major theme in this National Labor Relations Board\n\n(\"NLRB\") compliance case.\n\n            In 2006, the NLRB awarded remedies for unfair labor\n\npractices committed by Harding Glass Company (\"Harding\") in 1993.\n\nHarding Glass Co. (Harding III), 347 N.L.R.B. No. 102, at 2 (Aug.\n\n29, 2006).    Those remedies awarded over $144,000 in back pay to\n\nnine employees and over $360,000 to four union funds, with accrued\n\ninterest.    Id.   The Board seeks enforcement; the company says that\n\nenforcement should be denied, arguing that it would be driven out\n\nof business by enforcement of the order and that the sums owed\n\nshould, at the least, be discounted for the delay in the resolution\n\nof this matter.\n\n            The case has cautionary lessons for counsel about the\n\ncosts of minimalist responses to Board allegations.           Here, the\n\ncompany failed to comply with the Board's rules for answering\n\ncompliance specifications.        Those rules require highly specific\n\ninformation, going well beyond the requirements for answers in\n\ncivil   actions    in   federal    courts.    Additionally,    although\n\ninteresting legal issues may lurk as to the limits of the Board's\n\nability to order payment to union funds, the company has failed to\n\nprovide any facts, thus rendering the questions hypothetical.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           We reject the company's arguments and enforce the Board's\n\norder.   We note that the Board has offered to work with the company\n\non a payment plan, should that be necessary.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           This    saga,      unfortunately,   has   taken   fourteen   years.\n\nHarding sells and installs glass for automobiles and commercial\n\nbuildings in Worcester, Massachusetts.                In October 1993, the\n\ncompany employed two glaziers and three glassworkers. The glaziers\n\nrepaired and installed industrial and commercial glass, while the\n\nglassworkers repaired and replaced automobile glass.                  Glaziers\n\nLocal 1044, International Brotherhood of Painters & Allied Trades,\n\nAFL-CIO (\"the Union\"), represented both sets of employees.\n\n           Several months before the expiration of the then-current\n\ncollective bargaining agreement on October 16, 1993, the parties,\n\nat Harding's request, entered into negotiations for a successor\n\nagreement.      The company proposed to reduce the glaziers' pay rate\n\nfrom   $22.05    per   hour    to   $13.73   per   hour,   while   raising   the\n\nglassworkers' pay rate from $13.23 per hour to $13.73 per hour.\n\nThe company also proposed eliminating all contributions to the\n\nUnion's health, welfare, pension, and annuity funds; it proposed\n\nreplacing only the health fund with another insurance plan.                  The\n\nUnion put forward a counterproposal, which Harding rejected.                  On\n\nOctober 17, the glaziers voted to reject Harding's offer and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fstrike.      They established a picket line the next day.                           The\n\nglassworkers initially respected the glaziers' picket line.\n\n            The parties met again on October 22 but failed to reach\n\nan agreement.      On October 23, Harding implemented its final offer.\n\nThe company offered the glassworkers the wage and benefit package\n\nit   had   initially   offered     the    Union,       while   at   the    same   time\n\nthreatening to replace them.        The three glassworkers resigned from\n\nthe Union and resumed working for Harding.                      The two glaziers\n\nmaintained their picket line, and the company hired a new glazier\n\nunder its new terms and conditions of employment.                   The Union filed\n\nunfair labor practice charges against Harding alleging that the\n\ncompany had, inter alia, unilaterally implemented its final offer\n\nin the absence of a bona fide impasse in collective bargaining.\n\n            The Board, on March 31, 1995, held that the company had,\n\nby its actions, violated section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor\n\nRelations    Act   (\"NLRA\")   by    implementing         unilateral       changes    in\n\nemployment    conditions   without        a    valid    impasse     in    bargaining.\n\nHarding Glass Co. (Harding I), 316 N.L.R.B. 985, 985 (1995).                      This\n\ncourt, on March 27, 1996, enforced that portion of the Board's\n\norder.1    NLRB v. Harding Glass Co., 80 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n      1\n          The court denied enforcement of another portion of the\norder, disagreeing with the Board that the economic strike, begun\non October 18, 1993, had been converted to an unfair labor practice\nstrike on October 25, 1993, the date union representatives informed\nthe striking glaziers of Harding's implementation of unilateral\nchanges. NLRB v. Harding Glass Co., 80 F.3d 7, 11, 13 (1st Cir.\n1996).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fUnder the relevant provisions of the Board's order, the company was\n\ndirected to restore all terms and conditions of employment to the\n\nstatus quo as of October 23, 1993 and to make whole all employees\n\nand union funds for the losses they had suffered.           Harding I, 316\n\nN.L.R.B. at 986.     It is this make-whole obligation for the 1993\n\nevents that is the subject matter of the proceedings before us.\n\n            Once it had the enforcement order, the agency did not act\n\npromptly.     The   Regional   Office   did   not   issue    a   Compliance\n\nSpecification until July 1, 1997.       Thereafter, it issued a First\n\nAmended Compliance Specification on January 20, 2000.                After\n\nvarious proceedings, the Board issued an order on August 1, 2002,\n\ngranting in large part the General Counsel's motion to strike\n\nportions of Harding's answer for failure to comply with the Board's\n\nrules.   Those rules require respondents who dispute compliance\n\nallegations to provide supporting figures or information.              The\n\nBoard, having struck most of Harding's answer, then granted, with\n\none exception, summary judgment against the company on the pay\n\nrates and the method of back pay calculation alleged by the General\n\nCounsel to apply to the affected employees.           Harding Glass Co.\n\n(Harding II), 337 N.L.R.B. No. 175, at 2-4 (Aug. 1, 2002).             The\n\nBoard denied the motion for summary judgment as to employee James\n\nTritone and left open for litigation the issue of whether Tritone's\n\nback pay should be based on the full contract rate for a glazier,\n\n$22.05 per hour, at the time of Tritone's reinstatement after\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\frecovering from a work-related injury.               Id. at 2-3.   For the period\n\nin question, from March 28 to April 15, 1994, Harding had paid\n\nTritone at the rate of $13.73 per hour.                The Board also left open\n\nfor litigation the parties' dispute over the date on which the\n\neconomic strike ended.           Id. at 3-4.\n\n               In its 2002 order, the Board rejected the company's\n\naffirmative      defense   that     the   amended     compliance   specification\n\nshould be dismissed in its entirety because of delay by the\n\nRegional Office.       The Board was not moved by the two-and-a-half-\n\nyear     gap    between    the     issuance     of    the   initial   Compliance\n\nSpecification and the First Amended Compliance Specification.                The\n\nBoard similarly rejected Harding's defense that it was entitled to\n\noffset on the payments due to the union funds for the value of\n\nalternative benefit payments made by the company.                      The Board\n\nordered that both affirmative defenses be stricken. Id. Thus, the\n\n2002 Board order resolved most, but not all, of the remedial issues\n\nand remanded the remaining matters to an administrative law judge\n\n(\"ALJ\") for hearing.        Id.\n\n               The company, instead of trying to expedite the remaining\n\nproceedings, took the opposite tack.             It did not ask the Board to\n\nenter final judgment in 2002 on the matters then resolved. Rather,\n\nHarding chose to petition for review of the Board's interlocutory\n\norder.     The predictable result was that this court granted, on\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fNovember 25, 2002, the Board's motion to dismiss on the ground that\n\nwe lacked jurisdiction because there was no final order.\n\n              Again there was delay by the Regional Office as to the\n\nissues remanded to the ALJ.        The Regional Office, over two years\n\nlater, issued a Second Amended Compliance Specification on December\n\n22,   2004.      That   was   updated    by   a   Third   Amended   Compliance\n\nSpecification on January 19, 2005.\n\n              On April 12, 2005, the General Counsel filed a motion in\n\nlimine to preclude Harding from rearguing issues that had already\n\nbeen resolved against the company in the underlying unfair labor\n\npractice proceedings.         On April 27, 2005, the ALJ granted the\n\nmotion, over the company's objection.\n\n              On June 29, 2005, the ALJ issued a supplemental decision\n\nagreeing with the Regional Director's back pay calculations for the\n\nindividual employees as well as for monies due to the union funds.\n\nThe ALJ agreed with the Regional Director that the economic strike\n\nended on June 4, 1996, and that the back pay period for replacement\n\nworkers began on the following day, June 5, 1996.             As to the issue\n\nof back pay for Tritone, the ALJ found that he was entitled to the\n\nfull contract rate for glaziers, and awarded back pay to Tritone in\n\nthe amount of $975.89 plus interest.              In total, the ALJ ordered\n\nHarding to pay lost wages of $144,074.95 plus interest to nine\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\femployees2 and $360,067.37 plus interest to four union funds.3   The\n\ncompany sought review by the Board.\n\n            On August 29, 2006, the Board rejected the company's\n\nexceptions, adopted the ALJ's rulings, and directed Harding to pay\n\nthe specified amounts plus interest to the employees and the union\n\nfunds.   Harding III, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 102, at 1-2.   With respect to\n\nthe calculation of Tritone's back pay, the Board agreed with the\n\nALJ that Tritone was entitled to the contractual glazier rate of\n\n$22.05 per hour for the period from March 28 to April 15, 1994.\n\nId. at 2.\n\n            On October 25, 2006, the Board petitioned for enforcement\n\nof its order in full.    Harding did not cross-petition for review,\n\nbut it did assert in its answer to the enforcement application that\n\nthe Board's decision and order \"are without foundation in law or\n\nfact and are erroneous as a matter of law\" and \"are not supported\n\nby substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\"\n\n                                 II.\n\nA.          The Board's 1995 Order\n\n            On several occasions, Harding has attempted to relitigate\n\nissues already decided against it in the Board's March 31, 1995\n\n\n\n     2\n          The employees are Robert Mosely, James Tritone, Richard\nPoirer, James Gabrielle, Richard VonMerta, David Elworthy,\nChristopher Carle, Christopher Pelletier, and Kenneth Bullock.\n     3\n          The funds are the Health and Welfare Fund, the Pension\nFund, the Annuity Fund, and the Apprenticeship Fund.\n\n                                 -8-\n\forder.    The Board and the ALJ justifiably rejected these efforts.\n\nSee Transport Serv. Co., 314 N.L.R.B. 458, 459 (1994) (\"Issues\n\nlitigated and decided in an unfair labor practice proceeding may\n\nnot be relitigated in the ensuing backpay proceeding.\").\n\n            To the extent Harding argues before this court that it\n\ndid not unilaterally implement its last and final offer in the\n\nabsence    of   a   valid   impasse   in    bargaining,   that    argument   is\n\nforeclosed.         The   Board's   1995    order   concluded    that   Harding\n\nimplemented unilateral changes without having reached a bona fide\n\nimpasse.    Harding I, 316 N.L.R.B. at 985.            A different panel of\n\nthis court affirmed that conclusion. Harding Glass Co., 80 F.3d at\n\n10, 13.    We will not reconsider the issue here.         The company is not\n\nfree to relitigate in an enforcement proceeding the underlying\n\nfinding of liability already decided by this court.\n\nB.          The Board's 2002 Entry of Summary Judgment and Striking\n            of Affirmative Defenses\n\n            Harding argues that the Board erred (1) in sua sponte\n\ngranting summary judgment for the Regional Director on certain\n\nclaims (e.g., dates pertaining to employees' back pay periods and\n\nthe status of eight employees as strike replacement workers) which\n\nwould otherwise have been litigated; (2) in allowing the Director's\n\nrequest for summary judgment that two employees, David Elworthy and\n\nChristopher Pelletier, were entitled to the glassworkers' pay rate;\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fand (3) in striking the company's affirmative defense of mitigation\n\nof liability to the union funds.4\n\n          What all three claims have in common is Harding's failure\n\nto understand or meet its responsibilities in answering compliance\n\nspecifications issued by the Regional Director.       The applicable\n\nrules, contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, provide:\n\n          The answer shall specifically admit, deny, or\n          explain each and every allegation of the\n          specification,    unless    the   respondent   is\n          without   knowledge,     in   which    case   the\n          respondent shall so state, such statement\n          operating as a denial. Denials shall fairly\n          meet the substance of the allegations of the\n          specification at issue. . . . As to all\n          matters   within     the    knowledge    of   the\n          respondent, including but not limited to the\n          various factors entering into the computation\n          of gross backpay, a general denial shall not\n          suffice.     As to such matters, if the\n          respondent disputes either the accuracy of the\n          figures in the specification or the premises\n          on which they are based, the answer shall\n          specifically   state     the   basis   for   such\n          disagreement, setting forth in detail the\n          respondent's position as to the applicable\n          premises   and   furnishing     the   appropriate\n          supporting figures.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 102.56(b) (emphasis added).\n\n          Harding responded to the Regional Director's compliance\n\nspecification with general denials and inadequate explanations. It\n\ndid not, for example, in its answers and amended answers dispute\n\n\n     4\n          Harding also argues that it should have been permitted to\nintroduce evidence regarding its affirmative defense that the delay\nin initiating the compliance proceedings resulted in an\nimpermissible punitive and confiscatory order, and thus the\njudgment should be modified. We discuss this claim below.\n\n                                -10-\n\fthe running of the back pay period by providing alternate dates and\n\na rationale.   Nor did it sufficiently explain the basis for its\n\nclaim that eight employees were strike replacement workers not\n\nentitled to the earnings and benefits of the 1991-1993 collective\n\nbargaining agreement.   As for the Regional Director's allegation\n\nthat Elworthy and Pelletier were glassworkers, it was not enough\n\nfor Harding simply to deny that this was so.    As the Board noted,\n\nHarding did not explain what jobs these employees performed, if\n\nthey were not glassworkers.   Nor did the company state the basis\n\nfor its disagreement with the job classification alleged in the\n\ncompliance specification.\n\n          Under the Board's rules, when a respondent fails to deny\n\nallegations with the required specificity, those allegations are\n\n\"deemed to be admitted to be true, and may be so found by the Board\n\nwithout the taking of evidence supporting such allegation[s], and\n\nthe respondent shall be precluded from introducing any evidence\n\ncontroverting the allegation[s].\"     Id. § 102.56(c).   Harding had\n\nfair notice of the costs of its evasiveness.         The Board was\n\njustified in striking portions of Harding's answer and awarding\n\npartial summary judgment based on the allegations that were deemed\n\nadmitted to be true.\n\n          Harding nonetheless complains of the sua sponte nature of\n\nthe Board's award of summary judgment on issues that the Regional\n\nDirector was prepared to litigate.    Harding never raised a word of\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fprotest about the sua sponte nature of the ruling to the Board,\n\nthough it could have sought reconsideration on this basis. We will\n\nnot hear such a procedural objection for the first time.      See 29\n\nU.S.C. § 160(e) (\"No objection that has not been urged before the\n\nBoard, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the\n\ncourt, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall\n\nbe excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"); see also\n\nWoelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 665 (1982);\n\nE.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB, 359 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Somewhat different is Harding's argument that the    Board\n\nerred in requiring it to make contributions of over $360,000 to\n\nfour union funds.   The company asserts broadly that it offered\n\nhealth insurance coverage to the employees during this period and\n\nso it would be a windfall to the funds to pay back to them the full\n\namount of the contributions Harding withheld. Harding asserts that\n\nit should be able to offset the contributions it made for the\n\nhealth plan it unilaterally established for employees against the\n\nordered payments to union funds.\n\n          This court has not addressed this issue, on which the\n\ncircuit courts appear to have differing views.       One court of\n\nappeals apparently has taken the view that the company is not\n\nentitled to an offset because it was the company's unlawful choice\n\nto set up a private substitute insurance program.   See Stone Boat\n\nYard v. NLRB, 715 F.2d 441, 446 (9th Cir. 1983).     Under such an\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fapproach, Harding's contributions to a separate insurance program\n\nare immaterial, and its evidence is irrelevant.\n\n           In NLRB v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Buffalo, 191 F.3d\n\n316 (2d Cir. 1999), the court held that make-whole remedial relief\n\nmay include contributions to union funds insofar as the employees\n\nhave a future interest in the financial strength of the funds.    Id.\n\nat 324.   Under the Coca-Cola Bottling rationale, the limitation on\n\nthe Board's ability to order fund contributions derives from the\n\n\"essentially remedial\" policies of the NLRA.    Id.; cf. Sure-Tan,\n\nInc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 900 (1984) (\"[A] backpay remedy must be\n\nsufficiently tailored to expunge only the actual, and not merely\n\nspeculative, consequences of the unfair labor practices.\").      This\n\napproach is supported by the Board's view that contributions to\n\nunion funds may be ordered, at least where employees have an\n\ninterest in the future viability of those funds. See 1849 Sedgwick\n\nRealty LLC, 337 N.L.R.B. 245, 248 n.8 (2001) (stating that the\n\nBoard has never \"held that fund contributions may be ordered in the\n\nabsence of [a future] interest\"); Manhattan Eye Ear & Throat Hosp.,\n\n300 N.L.R.B. 201, 201-02 (1990) (adopting order of ALJ that company\n\nmake fund contributions on rationale that employees had \"a clear\n\neconomic stake in the viability of funds to which part of their\n\ncompensation [was] remitted\"), enforcement denied, 942 F.2d 151 (2d\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f          In some instances, courts have directed the Board, in\n\ncircumstances where the employer provided alternative benefits, to\n\npermit an employer an opportunity to show that payments to union\n\nfunds would be punitive, and not remedial.      These courts have\n\nremanded to permit the company to show that such reimbursement\n\nwould fail to benefit employees or would result in windfalls to\n\nunion funds.   See Grondorf, Field, Black & Co. v. NLRB, 107 F.3d\n\n882, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Manhattan Eye Ear & Throat Hosp. v.\n\nNLRB, 942 F.2d 151, 159-60 (2d Cir. 1991).\n\n          We take no position on the issue because Harding failed\n\nto provide sufficient facts in support of its argument.     At most,\n\nthe company asserted that the employees in question were provided\n\nwith health and medical insurance at no cost to them.    Harding did\n\nnot put forward any other relevant facts.      The company did not\n\nexplain how payment to the union funds would fail to benefit\n\nemployees or would result in a windfall, nor did it assert the\n\nspecific amount it was seeking as an offset.   To the extent (if at\n\nall) the argument is viable, it is the employer who bears the\n\nburden of putting necessary facts into the record.      See Banknote\n\nCorp. of Am., 327 N.L.R.B. 625, 625 (1999); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 102.56(b)-(c). In the absence of such facts, the company's claim\n\nnecessarily fails.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fC.        The Board's 2006 Back Pay Award\n\n          The Board has broad remedial powers under section 10(c)\n\nof the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 160(c).               Sure-Tan, 467 U.S. at 898-99.\n\nThe Board has discretion both to determine that back pay is\n\nappropriate to restore the economic status quo and to compute the\n\nback pay amount.    See Va. Elec. & Power Co. v. NLRB, 319 U.S. 533,\n\n540-41 (1943); Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 198\n\n(1941).\n\n          The only real issue here is the amount of the back pay\n\naward.    Harding     does   not   dispute      the    method   of    calculation.\n\nRather, it argues that the back pay period should be shorter.                     It\n\nattacks the date of June 5, 1996 as the                      starting point for\n\ncalculating back pay for replacement employees.                    The usual rule\n\napplies that the Board's findings must stand unless there is no\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting them.             See Hosp. Cristo Redentor,\n\nInc. v. NLRB, 488 F.3d 513, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2007).                    The Board's\n\nchoice of date is more than adequately supported by the evidence.\n\n          The   ALJ    picked      June   5,    1996    on   the     basis   of   his\n\ndetermination that the economic strike ended on June 4, 1996. This\n\nfinding was based on a letter dated June 4, 1996 that Harding\n\nreceived from the Union, which stated that the strike against the\n\ncompany had concluded by January 1, 1994.               The reasons given were\n\nthat (1) all striking employees -- that is, the glaziers -- who\n\nwere able to work had found other jobs and were not seeking\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\freinstatement with Harding, and (2) the Union had stopped picketing\n\nby that January date.\n\n                 Despite the fact that the Union's position covered all\n\nemployees, Harding argued to the Board that the strike was ongoing\n\nbecause it had not received explicit notice of whether one of the\n\nstriking employees, Charles Jones, had unequivocally abandoned his\n\nright       to   future   employment   with   the   company   or     had    made   an\n\nunconditional offer to return to work for Harding.                     The Board\n\nreasonably        rejected   the   company's    argument      that    the    strike\n\ncontinued beyond June 4, 1996.5               As the company knew from the\n\nUnion's letter, Jones fit in the category of those who had found\n\nother employment.          Harding's position is based on a fundamental\n\nmisapprehension of labor law.          It is the union that speaks for its\n\nstriking employees, and silence from a particular employee can\n\nhardly justify the company's position.              See Metro. Edison Co. v.\n\nNLRB, 460 U.S. 693, 705 (1983) (recognizing that a union may waive\n\na represented employee's right to strike); Plumbers & Pipefitters\n\nLocal Union No. 520 v. NLRB, 955 F.2d 744, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"Among the rights that may be modified or waived [by the union] is\n\nthe right to strike.\").         The case on which Harding relies, Service\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          The ALJ used the date of the Union's June 4, 1996 letter\nas the ending date for the strike, even though the letter's\ncontents indicated that the strike had ended by January 1, 1994.\nThe ALJ's use of the June 4, 1996 date therefore favored Harding.\n\n                                       -16-\n\fElec. Co., 281 N.L.R.B. 633, 636-37 (1986), has very different\n\nfacts and is self-evidently inapplicable.\n\n             That leaves the company's objection to the back pay award\n\nto Tritone for the period from March 28 to April 15, 1994.                  The\n\nBoard rejected Harding's argument that Tritone, who performed\n\nglazier work when the strike started, was not entitled to back pay\n\nat the full contract glazier's rate because he could not upon\n\nreinstatement perform the same work that he did prior to the\n\nstrike.     Harding III, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 102, at 1-2.\n\n             The Board applied its usual rule that an employee is\n\nentitled to reinstatement to the position he was in at the time of\n\nthe strike unless the company shows changed circumstances.                   See\n\nTransport Serv. Co., 314 N.L.R.B. at 459; cf. NLRB v. Rockwood &\n\nCo., 834 F.2d 837, 841 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding that economic\n\nstriker was \"entitled to reinstatement to his former position, to\n\none    substantially   equivalent,   or     to    one   for   which   he    was\n\nqualified\").    The Board found that the work Tritone performed upon\n\nreinstatement was glazier's work, notwithstanding the fact that the\n\nwork was not the same as before.          Harding III, 347 N.L.R.B. No.\n\n102, at 1.     The evidence shows that Tritone returned to work in a\n\n\"temporary modified duty position,\" as described in a company\n\nletter dated March 21, 1994. Tritone also testified before the ALJ\n\nthat   he   \"measure[d]   store   fronts\"   for    possible    future      glass\n\nreplacement and brought cars back to the workshop during the\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fapplicable period, and that he performed these same tasks as part\n\nof   his    previous      work   as    a   glazier.      Further,     the   workers'\n\ncompensation insurance provided under the collective bargaining\n\nagreement        supported    the     characterization      of     Tritone's     post-\n\nreinstatement work as glazier's work that was entitled to the full\n\ncontract rate.       Harding's own Modified-Duty Policy provided \"full\n\nwages for an injured employee during recovery\" (emphasis added).\n\nJoseph Guiliano, the Union's business manager, also testified that\n\nthere      was    never   \"an    agreement        with   Harding    Glass   or     its\n\nrepresentatives that Harding could pay the glaziers less than the\n\nfull contract rate while they were on any kind of light duty.\"\n\nAgain, the Board's order is more than adequately supported.\n\nD.           Delay\n\n             Harding argues that it should not have to bear the\n\nconsequences of the interest payments (at least) accruing during\n\nthe long pendency of this action.                 Several different concerns are\n\nraised by the delay in this case.\n\n             First, those primarily hurt by the delay are those\n\nemployees who did not receive the back pay or benefits to which\n\nthey were entitled.          See NLRB v. J.H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U.S.\n\n258, 264 (1969) (\"Wronged employees are at least as much injured by\n\nthe Board's delay in collecting their back pay as is the wrongdoing\n\nemployer.\").        There is no basis to excuse Harding from providing\n\nthe relief which has been ordered.                  Delay in a labor proceeding\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fcannot be a basis on which to deny a remedy to the victims of the\n\ncompany's unfair labor practice.       See NLRB v. Int'l Ass'n of\n\nBridge, Structural & Ornamental Ironworkers, Local 480, 466 U.S.\n\n720, 724-25 (1984) (per curiam) (\"It is well established . . . that\n\nthe Court of Appeals may not refuse to enforce a backpay order\n\nmerely because of the Board's delay subsequent to that order in\n\nformulating a backpay specification.\"); J.H. Rutter-Rex, 396 U.S.\n\nat 265 (\"[T]he Board is not required to place the consequences of\n\nits own delay, even if inordinate, upon wronged employees to the\n\nbenefit of wrongdoing employers.\").\n\n          Second, Harding is itself responsible for delay, as this\n\nopinion shows, and so the company has little basis to seek refuge\n\nin equitable arguments.   The company has had the use of the money\n\nthe entire time.   It has also had the option of establishing a\n\nreserve to fund its contingent obligation.    In any event, while it\n\nis true that the dollar amounts have risen over time, the company\n\nhas the option of trying to work out a payment plan.\n\n          Third, none of this lets the NLRB off the hook for the\n\nextraordinary length of time it took to resolve a relatively simple\n\nlabor issue.    Not only has the delay hurt the employees, it\n\nundermines confidence in the agency.    At oral argument, the court\n\ndirected Board counsel to file a supplemental memorandum explaining\n\nmeasures the agency is taking to improve its compliance procedures\n\nto avoid lengthy delays in case processing.   On June 20, 2007, the\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fOffice of the General Counsel filed a letter with us outlining four\n\nmeasures the agency has taken to reduce delays in compliance\n\nproceedings.   We hope that such egregious delay will not recur.\n\n          We grant the Board's petition for enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f",

The slow grinding of the wheels of\n\njustice is a major theme in this National Labor Relations Board\n\n(\"NLRB\") compliance case.\n\n            In 2006, the NLRB awarded remedies for unfair labor\n\npractices committed by Harding Glass Company (\"Harding\") in 1993.\n\nHarding Glass Co. (Harding III), 347 N.L.R.B. No. 102, at 2 (Aug.\n\n29, 2006).    Those remedies awarded over $144,000 in back pay to\n\nnine employees and over $360,000 to four union funds, with accrued\n\ninterest.    Id.   The Board seeks enforcement; the company says that\n\nenforcement should be denied, arguing that it would be driven out\n\nof business by enforcement of the order and that the sums owed\n\nshould, at the least, be discounted for the delay in the resolution\n\nof this matter.\n\n            The case has cautionary lessons for counsel about the\n\ncosts of minimalist responses to Board allegations.           Here, the\n\ncompany failed to comply with the Board's rules for answering\n\ncompliance specifications.        Those rules require highly specific\n\ninformation, going well beyond the requirements for answers in\n\ncivil   actions    in   federal    courts.    Additionally,    although\n\ninteresting legal issues may lurk as to the limits of the Board's\n\nability to order payment to union funds, the company has failed to\n\nprovide any facts, thus rendering the questions hypothetical.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           We reject the company's arguments and enforce the Board's\n\norder.   We note that the Board has offered to work with the company\n\non a payment plan, should that be necessary.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           This    saga,      unfortunately,   has   taken   fourteen   years.\n\nHarding sells and installs glass for automobiles and commercial\n\nbuildings in Worcester, Massachusetts.                In October 1993, the\n\ncompany employed two glaziers and three glassworkers. The glaziers\n\nrepaired and installed industrial and commercial glass, while the\n\nglassworkers repaired and replaced automobile glass.                  Glaziers\n\nLocal 1044, International Brotherhood of Painters & Allied Trades,\n\nAFL-CIO (\"the Union\"), represented both sets of employees.\n\n           Several months before the expiration of the then-current\n\ncollective bargaining agreement on October 16, 1993, the parties,\n\nat Harding's request, entered into negotiations for a successor\n\nagreement.      The company proposed to reduce the glaziers' pay rate\n\nfrom   $22.05    per   hour    to   $13.73   per   hour,   while   raising   the\n\nglassworkers' pay rate from $13.23 per hour to $13.73 per hour.\n\nThe company also proposed eliminating all contributions to the\n\nUnion's health, welfare, pension, and annuity funds; it proposed\n\nreplacing only the health fund with another insurance plan.                  The\n\nUnion put forward a counterproposal, which Harding rejected.                  On\n\nOctober 17, the glaziers voted to reject Harding's offer and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fstrike.      They established a picket line the next day.                           The\n\nglassworkers initially respected the glaziers' picket line.\n\n            The parties met again on October 22 but failed to reach\n\nan agreement.      On October 23, Harding implemented its final offer.\n\nThe company offered the glassworkers the wage and benefit package\n\nit   had   initially   offered     the    Union,       while   at   the    same   time\n\nthreatening to replace them.        The three glassworkers resigned from\n\nthe Union and resumed working for Harding.                      The two glaziers\n\nmaintained their picket line, and the company hired a new glazier\n\nunder its new terms and conditions of employment.                   The Union filed\n\nunfair labor practice charges against Harding alleging that the\n\ncompany had, inter alia, unilaterally implemented its final offer\n\nin the absence of a bona fide impasse in collective bargaining.\n\n            The Board, on March 31, 1995, held that the company had,\n\nby its actions, violated section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor\n\nRelations    Act   (\"NLRA\")   by    implementing         unilateral       changes    in\n\nemployment    conditions   without        a    valid    impasse     in    bargaining.\n\nHarding Glass Co. (Harding I), 316 N.L.R.B. 985, 985 (1995).                      This\n\ncourt, on March 27, 1996, enforced that portion of the Board's\n\norder.1    NLRB v.

Harding I, 316\n\nN.L.R.B. at 986.     It is this make-whole obligation for the 1993\n\nevents that is the subject matter of the proceedings before us.\n\n            Once it had the enforcement order, the agency did not act\n\npromptly.     The   Regional   Office   did   not   issue    a   Compliance\n\nSpecification until July 1, 1997.       Thereafter, it issued a First\n\nAmended Compliance Specification on January 20, 2000.                After\n\nvarious proceedings, the Board issued an order on August 1, 2002,\n\ngranting in large part the General Counsel's motion to strike\n\nportions of Harding's answer for failure to comply with the Board's\n\nrules.   Those rules require respondents who dispute compliance\n\nallegations to provide supporting figures or information.              The\n\nBoard, having struck most of Harding's answer, then granted, with\n\none exception, summary judgment against the company on the pay\n\nrates and the method of back pay calculation alleged by the General\n\nCounsel to apply to the affected employees.           Harding Glass Co.\n\n(Harding II), 337 N.L.R.B. No. 175, at 2-4 (Aug. 1, 2002).             The\n\nBoard denied the motion for summary judgment as to employee James\n\nTritone and left open for litigation the issue of whether Tritone's\n\nback pay should be based on the full contract rate for a glazier,\n\n$22.05 per hour, at the time of Tritone's reinstatement after\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\frecovering from a work-related injury.               Id. at 2-3.   For the period\n\nin question, from March 28 to April 15, 1994, Harding had paid\n\nTritone at the rate of $13.73 per hour.                The Board also left open\n\nfor litigation the parties' dispute over the date on which the\n\neconomic strike ended.           Id. at 3-4.\n\n               In its 2002 order, the Board rejected the company's\n\naffirmative      defense   that     the   amended     compliance   specification\n\nshould be dismissed in its entirety because of delay by the\n\nRegional Office.       The Board was not moved by the two-and-a-half-\n\nyear     gap    between    the     issuance     of    the   initial   Compliance\n\nSpecification and the First Amended Compliance Specification.                The\n\nBoard similarly rejected Harding's defense that it was entitled to\n\noffset on the payments due to the union funds for the value of\n\nalternative benefit payments made by the company.                      The Board\n\nordered that both affirmative defenses be stricken. Id. Thus, the\n\n2002 Board order resolved most, but not all, of the remedial issues\n\nand remanded the remaining matters to an administrative law judge\n\n(\"ALJ\") for hearing.        Id.\n\n               The company, instead of trying to expedite the remaining\n\nproceedings, took the opposite tack.             It did not ask the Board to\n\nenter final judgment in 2002 on the matters then resolved. Rather,\n\nHarding chose to petition for review of the Board's interlocutory\n\norder.     The predictable result was that this court granted, on\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fNovember 25, 2002, the Board's motion to dismiss on the ground that\n\nwe lacked jurisdiction because there was no final order.\n\n              Again there was delay by the Regional Office as to the\n\nissues remanded to the ALJ.        The Regional Office, over two years\n\nlater, issued a Second Amended Compliance Specification on December\n\n22,   2004.      That   was   updated    by   a   Third   Amended   Compliance\n\nSpecification on January 19, 2005.\n\n              On April 12, 2005, the General Counsel filed a motion in\n\nlimine to preclude Harding from rearguing issues that had already\n\nbeen resolved against the company in the underlying unfair labor\n\npractice proceedings.         On April 27, 2005, the ALJ granted the\n\nmotion, over the company's objection.\n\n              On June 29, 2005, the ALJ issued a supplemental decision\n\nagreeing with the Regional Director's back pay calculations for the\n\nindividual employees as well as for monies due to the union funds.\n\nThe ALJ agreed with the Regional Director that the economic strike\n\nended on June 4, 1996, and that the back pay period for replacement\n\nworkers began on the following day, June 5, 1996.             As to the issue\n\nof back pay for Tritone, the ALJ found that he was entitled to the\n\nfull contract rate for glaziers, and awarded back pay to Tritone in\n\nthe amount of $975.89 plus interest.              In total, the ALJ ordered\n\nHarding to pay lost wages of $144,074.95 plus interest to nine\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\femployees2 and $360,067.37 plus interest to four union funds.3   The\n\ncompany sought review by the Board.\n\n            On August 29, 2006, the Board rejected the company's\n\nexceptions, adopted the ALJ's rulings, and directed Harding to pay\n\nthe specified amounts plus interest to the employees and the union\n\nfunds.   Harding III, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 102, at 1-2.   With respect to\n\nthe calculation of Tritone's back pay, the Board agreed with the\n\nALJ that Tritone was entitled to the contractual glazier rate of\n\n$22.05 per hour for the period from March 28 to April 15, 1994.\n\nId. at 2.\n\n            On October 25, 2006, the Board petitioned for enforcement\n\nof its order in full.    Harding did not cross-petition for review,\n\nbut it did assert in its answer to the enforcement application that\n\nthe Board's decision and order \"are without foundation in law or\n\nfact and are erroneous as a matter of law\" and \"are not supported\n\nby substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\"\n\n                                 II.\n\nA.          The Board's 1995 Order\n\n            On several occasions, Harding has attempted to relitigate\n\nissues already decided against it in the Board's March 31, 1995\n\n\n\n     2\n          The employees are Robert Mosely, James Tritone, Richard\nPoirer, James Gabrielle, Richard VonMerta, David Elworthy,\nChristopher Carle, Christopher Pelletier, and Kenneth Bullock.\n     3\n          The funds are the Health and Welfare Fund, the Pension\nFund, the Annuity Fund, and the Apprenticeship Fund.\n\n                                 -8-\n\forder.    The Board and the ALJ justifiably rejected these efforts.\n\nSee Transport Serv. Co., 314 N.L.R.B. 458, 459 (1994) (\"Issues\n\nlitigated and decided in an unfair labor practice proceeding may\n\nnot be relitigated in the ensuing backpay proceeding.\").\n\n            To the extent Harding argues before this court that it\n\ndid not unilaterally implement its last and final offer in the\n\nabsence    of   a   valid   impasse   in    bargaining,   that    argument   is\n\nforeclosed.         The   Board's   1995    order   concluded    that   Harding\n\nimplemented unilateral changes without having reached a bona fide\n\nimpasse.    Harding I, 316 N.L.R.B. at 985.            A different panel of\n\nthis court affirmed that conclusion. Harding Glass Co., 80 F.3d at\n\n10, 13.    We will not reconsider the issue here.         The company is not\n\nfree to relitigate in an enforcement proceeding the underlying\n\nfinding of liability already decided by this court.\n\nB.          The Board's 2002 Entry of Summary Judgment and Striking\n            of Affirmative Defenses\n\n            Harding argues that the Board erred (1) in sua sponte\n\ngranting summary judgment for the Regional Director on certain\n\nclaims (e.g., dates pertaining to employees' back pay periods and\n\nthe status of eight employees as strike replacement workers) which\n\nwould otherwise have been litigated; (2) in allowing the Director's\n\nrequest for summary judgment that two employees, David Elworthy and\n\nChristopher Pelletier, were entitled to the glassworkers' pay rate;\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fand (3) in striking the company's affirmative defense of mitigation\n\nof liability to the union funds.4\n\n          What all three claims have in common is Harding's failure\n\nto understand or meet its responsibilities in answering compliance\n\nspecifications issued by the Regional Director.       The applicable\n\nrules, contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, provide:\n\n          The answer shall specifically admit, deny, or\n          explain each and every allegation of the\n          specification,    unless    the   respondent   is\n          without   knowledge,     in   which    case   the\n          respondent shall so state, such statement\n          operating as a denial. Denials shall fairly\n          meet the substance of the allegations of the\n          specification at issue. . . . As to all\n          matters   within     the    knowledge    of   the\n          respondent, including but not limited to the\n          various factors entering into the computation\n          of gross backpay, a general denial shall not\n          suffice.     As to such matters, if the\n          respondent disputes either the accuracy of the\n          figures in the specification or the premises\n          on which they are based, the answer shall\n          specifically   state     the   basis   for   such\n          disagreement, setting forth in detail the\n          respondent's position as to the applicable\n          premises   and   furnishing     the   appropriate\n          supporting figures.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 102.56(b) (emphasis added).\n\n          Harding responded to the Regional Director's compliance\n\nspecification with general denials and inadequate explanations. It\n\ndid not, for example, in its answers and amended answers dispute\n\n\n     4\n          Harding also argues that it should have been permitted to\nintroduce evidence regarding its affirmative defense that the delay\nin initiating the compliance proceedings resulted in an\nimpermissible punitive and confiscatory order, and thus the\njudgment should be modified. We discuss this claim below.\n\n                                -10-\n\fthe running of the back pay period by providing alternate dates and\n\na rationale.   Nor did it sufficiently explain the basis for its\n\nclaim that eight employees were strike replacement workers not\n\nentitled to the earnings and benefits of the 1991-1993 collective\n\nbargaining agreement.   As for the Regional Director's allegation\n\nthat Elworthy and Pelletier were glassworkers, it was not enough\n\nfor Harding simply to deny that this was so.    As the Board noted,\n\nHarding did not explain what jobs these employees performed, if\n\nthey were not glassworkers.   Nor did the company state the basis\n\nfor its disagreement with the job classification alleged in the\n\ncompliance specification.\n\n          Under the Board's rules, when a respondent fails to deny\n\nallegations with the required specificity, those allegations are\n\n\"deemed to be admitted to be true, and may be so found by the Board\n\nwithout the taking of evidence supporting such allegation[s], and\n\nthe respondent shall be precluded from introducing any evidence\n\ncontroverting the allegation[s].\"     Id. § 102.56(c).   Harding had\n\nfair notice of the costs of its evasiveness.         The Board was\n\njustified in striking portions of Harding's answer and awarding\n\npartial summary judgment based on the allegations that were deemed\n\nadmitted to be true.\n\n          Harding nonetheless complains of the sua sponte nature of\n\nthe Board's award of summary judgment on issues that the Regional\n\nDirector was prepared to litigate.    Harding never raised a word of\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fprotest about the sua sponte nature of the ruling to the Board,\n\nthough it could have sought reconsideration on this basis. We will\n\nnot hear such a procedural objection for the first time.      See 29\n\nU.S.C. § 160(e) (\"No objection that has not been urged before the\n\nBoard, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the\n\ncourt, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall\n\nbe excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\"); see also\n\nWoelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v.

The company asserts broadly that it offered\n\nhealth insurance coverage to the employees during this period and\n\nso it would be a windfall to the funds to pay back to them the full\n\namount of the contributions Harding withheld. Harding asserts that\n\nit should be able to offset the contributions it made for the\n\nhealth plan it unilaterally established for employees against the\n\nordered payments to union funds.\n\n          This court has not addressed this issue, on which the\n\ncircuit courts appear to have differing views.       One court of\n\nappeals apparently has taken the view that the company is not\n\nentitled to an offset because it was the company's unlawful choice\n\nto set up a private substitute insurance program.

At most,\n\nthe company asserted that the employees in question were provided\n\nwith health and medical insurance at no cost to them.    Harding did\n\nnot put forward any other relevant facts.      The company did not\n\nexplain how payment to the union funds would fail to benefit\n\nemployees or would result in a windfall, nor did it assert the\n\nspecific amount it was seeking as an offset.   To the extent (if at\n\nall) the argument is viable, it is the employer who bears the\n\nburden of putting necessary facts into the record.      See Banknote\n\nCorp. of Am., 327 N.L.R.B. 625, 625 (1999); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 102.56(b)-(c).

Harding     does   not   dispute      the    method   of    calculation.\n\nRather, it argues that the back pay period should be shorter.                     It\n\nattacks the date of June 5, 1996 as the                      starting point for\n\ncalculating back pay for replacement employees.                    The usual rule\n\napplies that the Board's findings must stand unless there is no\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting them.             See Hosp. Cristo Redentor,\n\nInc. v.

The Board's\n\nchoice of date is more than adequately supported by the evidence.\n\n          The   ALJ    picked      June   5,    1996    on   the     basis   of   his\n\ndetermination that the economic strike ended on June 4, 1996. This\n\nfinding was based on a letter dated June 4, 1996 that Harding\n\nreceived from the Union, which stated that the strike against the\n\ncompany had concluded by January 1, 1994.               The reasons given were\n\nthat (1) all striking employees -- that is, the glaziers -- who\n\nwere able to work had found other jobs and were not seeking\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\freinstatement with Harding, and (2) the Union had stopped picketing\n\nby that January date.\n\n                 Despite the fact that the Union's position covered all\n\nemployees, Harding argued to the Board that the strike was ongoing\n\nbecause it had not received explicit notice of whether one of the\n\nstriking employees, Charles Jones, had unequivocally abandoned his\n\nright       to   future   employment   with   the   company   or     had    made   an\n\nunconditional offer to return to work for Harding.                     The Board\n\nreasonably        rejected   the   company's    argument      that    the    strike\n\ncontinued beyond June 4, 1996.5               As the company knew from the\n\nUnion's letter, Jones fit in the category of those who had found\n\nother employment.          Harding's position is based on a fundamental\n\nmisapprehension of labor law.          It is the union that speaks for its\n\nstriking employees, and silence from a particular employee can\n\nhardly justify the company's position.              See Metro.

Tritone also testified before the ALJ\n\nthat   he   \"measure[d]   store   fronts\"   for    possible    future      glass\n\nreplacement and brought cars back to the workshop during the\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fapplicable period, and that he performed these same tasks as part\n\nof   his    previous      work   as    a   glazier.      Further,     the   workers'\n\ncompensation insurance provided under the collective bargaining\n\nagreement        supported    the     characterization      of     Tritone's     post-\n\nreinstatement work as glazier's work that was entitled to the full\n\ncontract rate.       Harding's own Modified-Duty Policy provided \"full\n\nwages for an injured employee during recovery\" (emphasis added).\n\nJoseph Guiliano, the Union's business manager, also testified that\n\nthere      was    never   \"an    agreement        with   Harding    Glass   or     its\n\nrepresentatives that Harding could pay the glaziers less than the\n\nfull contract rate while they were on any kind of light duty.\"\n\nAgain, the Board's order is more than adequately supported.\n\nD.           Delay\n\n             Harding argues that it should not have to bear the\n\nconsequences of the interest payments (at least) accruing during\n\nthe long pendency of this action.                 Several different concerns are\n\nraised by the delay in this case.\n\n             First, those primarily hurt by the delay are those\n\nemployees who did not receive the back pay or benefits to which\n\nthey were entitled.          See NLRB v. J.H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">258</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (1969) (\"Wronged employees are at least as much injured by\n\nthe Board's delay in collecting their back pay as is the wrongdoing\n\nemployer.\").        There is no basis to excuse Harding from providing\n\nthe relief which has been ordered.                  Delay in a labor proceeding\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fcannot be a basis on which to deny a remedy to the victims of the\n\ncompany's unfair labor practice.       See NLRB v. Int'l Ass'n of\n\nBridge, Structural & Ornamental Ironworkers, Local 480, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111171\"><a href=\"/opinion/111171/nlrb-v-ironworkers/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 724-25 (1984) (per curiam) (\"It is well established . . . that\n\nthe Court of Appeals may not refuse to enforce a backpay order\n\nmerely because of the Board's delay subsequent to that order in\n\nformulating a backpay specification.\"); J.H. Rutter-Rex, 396 U.S.\n\nat 265 (\"[T]he Board is not required to place the consequences of\n\nits own delay, even if inordinate, upon wronged employees to the\n\nbenefit of wrongdoing employers.\").\n\n          Second, Harding is itself responsible for delay, as this\n\nopinion shows, and so the company has little basis to seek refuge\n\nin equitable arguments.   The company has had the use of the money\n\nthe entire time.   It has also had the option of establishing a\n\nreserve to fund its contingent obligation.    In any event, while it\n\nis true that the dollar amounts have risen over time, the company\n\nhas the option of trying to work out a payment plan.\n\n          Third, none of this lets the NLRB off the hook for the\n\nextraordinary length of time it took to resolve a relatively simple\n\nlabor issue.    Not only has the delay hurt the employees, it\n\nundermines confidence in the agency.    At oral argument, the court\n\ndirected Board counsel to file a supplemental memorandum explaining\n\nmeasures the agency is taking to improve its compliance procedures\n\nto avoid lengthy delays in case processing.   On June 20, 2007, the\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fOffice of the General Counsel filed a letter with us outlining four\n\nmeasures the agency has taken to reduce delays in compliance\n\nproceedings.   We hope that such egregious delay will not recur.\n\n          We grant the Board's petition for enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f</pre>",
