Gormley, P.C. were on brief, for appellant John P.\nBulger.\n\n          Richard L. Hoffman, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on the\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 14, 2003\n\f          LYNCH,   Circuit    Judge.    Three    individuals     moved   to\n\nintervene in a long-closed civil forfeiture action. They sought to\n\nassert claims to a one-sixth share of a $14.3 million winning state\n\nlottery ticket, still in payout, which had belonged to James\n\n\"Whitey\" Bulger.       Two of the claimants, Olga Davis and Marion\n\nHussey, are mothers of young women whom Whitey Bulger allegedly\n\nmurdered in the 1980s; the other is one of his brothers, John\n\nBulger.\n\n          In 1995, Whitey Bulger was indicted for crimes related to\n\nhis alleged leadership of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston.         He went\n\ninto hiding and is on the FBI's list of the \"ten most wanted\"\n\nfugitives. Later that year, the government brought an in rem civil\n\nforfeiture action against Bulger's share of the prize, based upon\n\nthe theory that he had purchased the ticket as a money-laundering\n\ndevice.   The district court entered a default judgment forfeiting\n\nthe property in January 1996.\n\n          In   2001,    the   government,   to   its   credit,   filed    a\n\nsubmission with the district court based on new information about\n\nthe lottery ticket which cast doubt on its money-laundering theory.\n\nIn its submission, the government argued that the forfeiture\n\nremained valid and should not be disturbed.       Later that year, the\n\nthree claimants, none of whom was previously involved in the\n\nforfeiture proceedings, moved to intervene and to reopen the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fDavis and Hussey also brought wrongful death actions in state court\n\nagainst Whitey Bulger in 2001.\n\n          The district court found that the motions were filed on\n\nthe basis of newly-discovered evidence, and therefore were barred\n\nby the one-year limit for moving to vacate a judgment on this\n\nbasis.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).    We do not reach the Rule 60\n\nissue.   Instead, we hold that none of the claimants has either\n\nstanding to intervene or a viable claim, and so affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          The lottery ticket was a \"season ticket,\" which enters\n\nthe owner's selected numbers into every drawing for a year.     In\n\nJuly 1991, the ticket won a $14.3 million jackpot, payable in\n\ntwenty annual installments. The registered owner, Michael Linskey,\n\nclaimed the prize.   He also submitted to the Massachusetts State\n\nLottery Commission a written agreement between himself and three\n\npartners whom he said had contributed to the $100 price of the\n\nticket and co-owned it.     According to the agreement, Michael\n\nLinskey owned half of the ticket.       The other half was evenly\n\ndivided between his brother, Patrick Linskey; Kevin Weeks; and\n\nWhitey Bulger.   All three of these men were allegedly affiliated\n\nwith the Winter Hill Gang, whose criminal activities are described\n\nin greater detail in United States v. Flemmi, 225 F.3d 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2000), and United States v. Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141 (D. Mass.\n\n1999).\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          From 1991 through 1994, annual winnings and the attendant\n\ntax liability were duly apportioned to the four co-owners of the\n\nticket.      The Lottery Commission paid the winnings to Michael\n\nLinskey, who arranged for the South Boston Savings Bank to disburse\n\nthe funds among the four owners. Under this arrangement, Whitey\n\nBulger's share, $119,408 a year before taxes, was deposited in a\n\njoint account he held at that bank with John Bulger.                     The total\n\namount of the payments due to Whitey Bulger from 1995 through the\n\nfinal payment in 2010 was nearly two million dollars before taxes.\n\n          In    January         1995,   Whitey    Bulger    was    indicted    for\n\nracketeering and other offenses related to his alleged organized\n\ncrime activities. He disappeared and has not been apprehended. On\n\nJuly 17, 1995, the federal government brought a verified in rem\n\ncomplaint for civil forfeiture of Whitey Bulger's share of the\n\nticket under 18 U.S.C. ยง 981(a)(1)(A) (1994) (amended 2000).                     A\n\nsupporting affidavit provided information from two confidential\n\ninformants    who       said   that   Whitey    Bulger   paid   Michael    Linskey\n\n$700,000 in cash for his share of the ticket after it won the\n\njackpot, thus laundering illegal criminal proceeds by replacing the\n\ntainted funds with apparently legitimate payments from the Lottery\n\nCommission.         A    magistrate     judge    found   that     this   complaint\n\nestablished probable cause and issued a warrant and monition\n\nauthorizing the seizure from the Lottery Commission of \"such one-\n\nsixth share of the gross amount otherwise due and payable to\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fMichael Linskey.\"    Both the complaint and the warrant defined the\n\ndefendant res as \"the one-sixth share of James J. Bulger in all\n\npresent and future proceeds of Mass Millions Lottery Ticket No.\n\nM246233, registered in the name of Michael Linskey.\"    The seizure\n\nwas widely reported in the media and was front-page news in both of\n\nBoston's major newspapers.\n\n           Whitey Bulger never appeared to contest the lottery\n\nforfeiture.    Later evidence established his awareness of the\n\nforfeiture action.   His sister, Jean Holland, filed a claim to the\n\none-sixth share on behalf of herself and his other heirs.   She also\n\nasked the state probate court to appoint her as his receiver, but\n\nthe request was rejected.     Since she was not his receiver, the\n\nfederal court dismissed Holland's claim for lack of standing. This\n\ncourt affirmed the dismissal for lack of standing in an unpublished\n\nopinion.   United States v. One-Sixth Share, 101 F.3d 106 (table),\n\n1996 WL 662459 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam).    Holland pursued her\n\nstate litigation to be appointed as Whitey Bulger's receiver for\n\nseveral more years; it was finally dismissed with prejudice by the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court in October 2000.     John Bulger was not a\n\nparty in either of these state or federal cases.\n\n           Two weeks after dismissing Holland's claim, and in the\n\nabsence of any other claimants in the six months since the case was\n\nfiled, the district court entered a default judgment ordering the\n\none-sixth share forfeited to the government on January 26, 1996.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fThe order defined the res, or \"Defendant Property,\" in exactly the\n\nsame language as the complaint and the warrant.              It stated that\n\n\"all other persons and entities claiming any right, title or\n\ninterest in or to the Defendant Property . . . are held in\n\ndefault.\"     It also stated, \"This shall be, and is, the full and\n\nfinal disposition of this civil forfeiture action with regard to\n\nthe Defendant Property.\"\n\n             The United States sought forfeiture of Whitey Bulger's\n\nother assets as well.           It secured an in rem default judgment\n\nagainst his Florida condominium.           The government also seized the\n\nfunds in the account at the South Boston Savings Bank held jointly\n\nin the names of both John and Whitey Bulger; John Bulger filed a\n\ntimely claim in that litigation. This court ultimately found that,\n\nbecause John Bulger had possession of the funds and exercised\n\nsufficient dominion and control over the joint account, he had\n\nstanding to contest this forfeiture. United States v. $81,000, 189\n\nF.3d   28,   39   (1st   Cir.   1999).     John   Bulger   later   reached   a\n\nsettlement dividing the money in the account equally between\n\nhimself and the government.\n\n             The lottery ticket forfeiture case remained closed for\n\nover five years.         During that time, ticket co-owner Weeks was\n\nindicted, pled guilty, and entered into a cooperation agreement\n\nwith the government.      In his debriefings, Weeks stated that he and\n\nWhitey Bulger had never paid anything for their shares of the\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwinning ticket. Rather, Weeks said, they had spread the story that\n\nthey were laundering money in order to assuage the temper of\n\nanother criminal associate, Stephen Flemmi, who was angry at being\n\nexcluded   from      the   lottery    winnings.       This   new   information\n\nundermined the government's money-laundering theory, which it had\n\nused to demonstrate probable cause for seizure and to justify\n\nforfeiture.     In February 2001, the government filed a submission\n\nwith the district court which reported this new evidence, but also\n\nargued that Weeks's revelation was not a basis for disturbing the\n\ndefault judgment. Among other reasons, it made arguments (which we\n\ndo not resolve) that there were alternative bases for civil and\n\ncriminal forfeiture of the one-sixth share.\n\n           Weeks also implicated Whitey Bulger in a number of\n\nmurders, including those of Davis's daughter in 1982 and Hussey's\n\ndaughter   in   1985.       Weeks    provided   information    that    led   the\n\nauthorities to their bodies.          A superseding indictment unveiled in\n\nSeptember 2000 charged Whitey Bulger with these homicides.                  Davis\n\nand Hussey filed wrongful death actions against Whitey Bulger in\n\nstate   court   in    February      2001.    Whitey   Bulger   has    now    been\n\nimplicated in a total of nineteen murders.\n\n           Within a few months of the government's 2001 submission\n\nconcerning the Weeks debriefings, Davis, Hussey, and John Bulger\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\feach moved in district court to set aside the default judgment\n\nforfeiting the lottery proceeds payable to Whitey Bulger.1\n\n           The day before oral argument on these motions in the\n\ndistrict court, Davis and Hussey went before the state judge\n\npresiding over their wrongful death actions and secured what is\n\nstyled an equitable lien, subject to some limitations, on the one-\n\nsixth share.    The United States was not a party in the state\n\nproceeding and did not appear, although the state court took\n\njudicial notice of the federal civil forfeiture.         The state court\n\nfound Davis and Hussey \"are entitled to as strong an equitable lien\n\non said proceeds as this Court, pursuant to its general equitable\n\npowers, may grant.\"      It ordered the Lottery Commission to hold\n\nfuture   payments   to   Whitey   Bulger   in   escrow   \"to   the   extent\n\npermissible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\" It made\n\nthe same order, nunc pro tunc, with respect to prior payments going\n\nback to 1995, \"to the extent possible with the civil forfeiture\n\ncurrently in place.\"\n\n           The federal district court denied the claimants' motions.\n\nUnited States v. One-Sixth Share, No. 95-11513, 2002 WL 550405 (D.\n\nMass. March 28, 2002).    While the court noted the potential lack of\n\n\n     1\n          The three motions were based on slightly different\nprocedural mechanisms. Davis moved to intervene under Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 24. Hussey styled her motion as a request for an extension of\nthe deadline to file a claim and a motion to set aside the default\njudgment under Rule 60(b). John Bulger moved both to intervene and\nto set aside the judgment. For purposes of the standing analysis,\nthese differences are not relevant.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fstanding, it did not consider that issue and rested its judgment on\n\nthe untimeliness of the motions.               Id. at *3-*4.2     The claimants\n\nappealed.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Standing is a threshold consideration in all cases,\n\nincluding civil forfeiture cases.                See United States v. Cambio\n\nExacto, S.A., 166 F.3d 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1999); see also McInnis-\n\nMisenor v. Me. Med. Ctr., 319 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 2003).                 Because\n\ncivil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding, the property subject to\n\nforfeiture is the defendant. Thus, defenses against the forfeiture\n\ncan   be   brought   only    by   third        parties,   who   must    intervene.\n\nGenerally, an intervenor must have independent standing if the\n\nintervenor   would   be     the   only    party    litigating    a     case.   See\n\nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 64-65\n\n(1997); Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 61 & n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          Motions for relief from judgment must be made within a\n\"reasonable time,\" which is limited to one year in certain\ncircumstances, including newly-discovered evidence. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(b). The district court held that the motions were based\non newly-discovered evidence, the Weeks information, and that no\n\"exceptional circumstances\" justified an extension of the resulting\none-year deadline.   One-Sixth Share, 2002 WL 550405, at *4-*5.\nNormally we would reverse these determinations only if the court\nhad abused its wide discretion to so decide. See Farm Credit Bank\nv. Ferrera-Goitia, 316 F.3d 62, 65 (1st Cir. 2003). Because we\nbase our ruling on standing alone, we do not review them.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Standing    in   such    cases    has     both    constitutional     and\n\nstatutory aspects.       See Cambio Exacto, 166 F.3d at 526; United\n\nStates v. One 1985 Cadillac Seville, 866 F.2d 1142, 1148 (9th Cir.\n\n1989); 1 D.B. Smith, Prosecution and Defense of Forfeiture Cases\n\nยถ    9.04(2)(a),   at   9-68      (2002).       But    cf.     United   States   v.\n\n$557,933.89, 287 F.3d 66, 79 & n.9 (2d Cir. 2002) (questioning\n\nwhether claimant needs to demonstrate Article III standing since\n\nplaintiff typically bears burden to show standing and government is\n\nplaintiff).\n\n            The federal forfeiture statute defines rules as to who\n\nmay intervene and when they must do it.               By virtue of the roots of\n\nin    rem   jurisdiction     in     admiralty    law,        the   procedures    for\n\nintervention in civil forfeitures are governed by the Supplemental\n\nRules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims.                   See 18 U.S.C. ยง\n\n981(b)(2) (1994) (amended 2000); United States v. One Dairy Farm,\n\n918 F.2d 310, 311 (1st Cir. 1990).            Supplemental Rule C(6), as it\n\nread in 1995, required a party to submit a \"claim\" to the property\n\nwithin ten days.3       \"A party who fails to file a claim normally\n\n\n\n      3\n          A substantial overhaul of federal civil asset forfeiture\nlaws was enacted in 2000. See Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of\n2000 (CAFRA), Pub. L. 106-185, 114 Stat. 202. These changes took\neffect long after the events at issue in this case. See id. ยง 21,\n114 Stat. at 225 (effective date).       Among its changes, CAFRA\nextended the time limit for claimants to file, leading to amendment\nof the Supplemental Rules. Another change is one of nomenclature:\nthe \"claim\" is now called a \"statement of interest or right.\" We\napply both the rules and the terminology that were in force at the\ntime of the forfeiture.\n\n                                       -11-\n\flacks standing to contest a forfeiture.\"    One Dairy Farm, 918 F.2d\n\nat 311; see, e.g., United States v. 3,888 Lbs. of Atlantic Sea\n\nScallops,    857 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1988) (failure to file timely\n\nclaim disqualifies would-be intervenor); see also United States v.\n\nOne Urban Lot, 885 F.2d 994, 998-1000 (1st Cir. 1989) (allowing\n\nstanding without claim where verified answer was timely filed and\n\nthere was no prejudice to government from delay, but dismissing\n\nwhere claimant filed neither claim nor answer).\n\n            As to constitutional standing, \"It is well established\n\nthat a party seeking to challenge a forfeiture of property must\n\nfirst demonstrate an ownership or possessory interest in the seized\n\nproperty in order to have standing to contest the forfeiture.\"\n\nUnited States v. 116 Emerson St., 942 F.2d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(quotation omitted).     Courts should not, however, conflate the\n\nconstitutional standing inquiry with the merits determination that\n\ncomes later.    See United States v. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d\n\n1017, 1023-24 (7th Cir. 2000) (criticizing tests of straw ownership\n\nthat deny standing rather than denying claims on their merits).\n\n            At the initial stage of intervention, the requirements\n\nfor a claimant to demonstrate constitutional standing are very\n\nforgiving.     In general, any colorable claim on the defendant\n\nproperty suffices.    $81,000, 189 F.3d at 35 (\"Courts generally do\n\nnot deny standing to a claimant who is either the colorable owner\n\nof the res or who has any colorable possessory interest in it.\");\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fsee United States v. 7725 Unity Ave. N., 294 F.3d 954, 957 (8th\n\nCir. 2002) (\"The claimant need only show a colorable interest in\n\nthe property, redressable, at least in part, by a return of the\n\nproperty.\"); 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd., 233 F.3d at 1023 (claimant must\n\nshow only \"actual stake in the outcome\" of forfeiture); Cambio\n\nExacto,    166   F.3d   at   527   (\"[W]hile   ownership     and   possession\n\ngenerally may provide evidence of standing, it is injury to the\n\nparty seeking standing that remains the ultimate focus.\"); United\n\nStates v.

John Bulger\n\n            John Bulger's failure to file a timely claim as required\n\nby Supplemental Rule C(6) -- or indeed any claim at all until years\n\nafter the judgment -- is sufficient on its own to disqualify him\n\nfrom intervention now. There is no reason to forgive that failure.\n\nHe filed a timely claim in the forfeiture action against the joint\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fbank       account,   litigated    that    case    vigorously,    and    ultimately\n\nreached a settlement with the government.                It is beyond serious\n\ndispute that he was aware of the parallel forfeiture action against\n\nthe lottery proceeds.          See $81,000, 189 F.3d at 32 (describing how\n\nJohn       Bulger   learned   of   the    lottery    forfeiture    complaint    and\n\nwithdrew cash from the joint account, \"motivated by a concern that\n\nfurther forfeiture proceedings might be in the offing\").                     Yet he\n\ndid not submit a similar claim in the lottery case, or even\n\nparticipate in his sister's efforts to intervene.                       His knowing\n\nfailure to file anything at that time, whether because he chose not\n\nto do so or because he recognized his lack of standing, leaves him\n\nwith no good excuse for his tardiness.              See One Urban Lot, 885 F.2d\n\nat 999 (dismissing where neither claim nor answer was filed).\n\n               John    Bulger      actually       concedes   that       he   lacked\n\nconstitutional standing to bring the case in 1995, in order to\n\nexplain why he could not appeal from the original default judgment\n\nand to thereby distinguish his case from United States v. One Rural\n\nLot, 238 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam).4                  He suggests that\n\nthe intervening event that cured this admitted lack of standing was\n\nthe Weeks evidence.           This effort fails.       Nothing about the Weeks\n\n\n       4\n          In that case, claimants' failure to appeal the original\njudgment was held to bar relief under Rule 60(b)(4), because it was\ntheir own choice not to appeal.     Id. at 79; see also Cotto v.\nUnited States, 993 F.2d 274, 277-78 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding that\na failure to appeal barred Rule 60 relief).      Here, John Bulger\nchose to make no attempt whatsoever to intervene in the case at the\nappropriate time.\n\n                                          -14-\n\fevidence    changed   John   Bulger's   relationship   to    the   forfeited\n\nproperty or the injury he suffered as a result of forfeiture.             The\n\nnew information may have affected the arguments he could make, but\n\nnot his standing to make them.\n\n            He advances a final argument, saying that since he had\n\nstanding to contest the forfeiture of the joint bank account, see\n\n$81,000, 189 F.3d at 39, he must have standing here.           Not so.     In\n\nthis case, as in that one, he relies on his connection to the joint\n\nbank account as the basis for his claim of interest.               He argues\n\nhere that, because the annual payments were deposited into the\n\njoint account, they would have come under his control shortly after\n\ntheir disbursement. He also argues that, but for the forfeiture of\n\nthe lottery proceeds, the joint account would have contained an\n\nadditional $480,020.16 in lottery payments at the time of his May\n\n2000 settlement with the government in the $81,000 litigation,\n\npresumably resulting in a larger share for him.\n\n            In   $81,000,    this   court   meticulously    reviewed    facts\n\npointing in different directions to conclude that, on balance, John\n\nBulger had standing to contest the forfeiture of money that was\n\nalready in the joint bank account, despite numerous indications\n\nthat it actually belonged to Whitey Bulger, because John Bulger had\n\npossession of that money and dominion and control over it.             See id.\n\nat 36-39.   In contrast, here John Bulger never possessed any of the\n\nlottery payments after 1994.        He had no influence whatsoever over\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthe payments, at least until they were deposited into the account.\n\nBy seizing the funds before they made their way into the joint\n\naccount, the government removed any possession or control John\n\nBulger had over them, thus tipping the $81,000 analysis against\n\nhim.     See 18 U.S.C. ยง 981(f) (2000) (giving United States \"[a]ll\n\nright, title, and interest\" in forfeited property).\n\nB.     Davis and Hussey\n\n               Davis and Hussey are in a more sympathetic position.\n\nUnlike John Bulger, at the time of the default judgment, they did\n\nnot know that they might possess any relevant right or interest in\n\nthe lottery forfeiture case.            The whole theory of their current\n\nattempt to intervene is that this court should forgive their\n\nfailure to establish statutory standing at that time and should\n\nturn back the clock to allow them to file claims now.                   It is true\n\nthat    this    court   has   used    its   equitable   powers     to    read   the\n\nrequirements for filing claims somewhat broadly in the interests of\n\njustice.       See 116 Emerson St., 942 F.2d at 77-78 (\"Whether a\n\nbelated claim will be recognized often depends on the existence of\n\nmitigating      factors.\");    One    Urban   Lot,    885   F.2d   at    999-1001\n\n(applying      admiralty   law's     traditional     liberal   construction     of\n\nprocedural practices to in rem civil forfeiture case).                    For the\n\nreasons that follow, the doctrine does not help Davis and Hussey,\n\nbecause even were we to ignore the failure to file, they do not\n\nhave the requisite interest in the property to assert a claim.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           Davis and Hussey rely on the purported lien they secured\n\nfrom state court.    Normally, a lien against the defendant property\n\nwould establish     standing.      See   18    U.S.C.   ยง    981(a)(2)   (1994)\n\n(amended 2000) (barring forfeiture of property \"to the extent of\n\nthe interest of an owner or lienholder\" who was uninvolved in the\n\ncriminal activity); In re Metmor Fin., Inc., 819 F.2d 446, 448 &\n\nn.2 (4th Cir. 1987) (\"There is no question\" that holder of mortgage\n\nis entitled to innocent owner status to extent of interest); Town\n\nof Sanford v. United States, 961 F. Supp. 16, 16-17, (D. Me. 1997),\n\naff'd 140 F.3d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1998) (lien for back taxes on\n\nforfeited property entitles town to innocent owner defense). Given\n\nthe generous standards for constitutional standing, it is arguable\n\nthat they had a colorable claim once the state court acted.\n\n           There    are   two   problems      with   their   purported   lien,\n\nhowever.   First, at the time the state court acted in 2001, \"[a]ll\n\nright, title, and interest\" in the property had already vested in\n\nthe United States over five years earlier.              18 U.S.C. ยง 981(f).\n\nThere was no share of the lottery proceeds left in Whitey Bulger's\n\nname.   The Lottery Commission informed the district court in July\n\n2001 that it believed the forfeiture order applied to one-sixth of\n\nthe entire prize, and that the state court order was inconsistent\n\nwith the federal forfeiture.      State court jurisdiction over Whitey\n\nBulger would have been inadequate to confer authority for disposing\n\nof property that he no longer owned, and the state court did not\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fhave or purport to exercise jurisdiction over the United States.\n\nCf. Fierro v. Reno, 217 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2000) (refusing to\n\nrecognize state court's nunc pro tunc order modifying twenty-year-\n\nold child custody order for purposes of defining immigration status\n\nof deportee).\n\n           Second, the state court was aware of the issue and\n\nincluded broad language in its order to exclude any interest that\n\nthe federal government already had in the property by virtue of the\n\ncivil forfeiture.   The equitable lien is only enforceable \"to the\n\nextent permissible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\"\n\nThis exception swallows up whatever hold the lien would otherwise\n\nprovide over the res.     Davis and Hussey can hardly displace a\n\nfirst-in-time final judgment by virtue of an equitable lien which\n\nexplicitly excludes property subject to that judgment.\n\n           Without the lien to provide standing connected to the res\n\nitself, Davis and Hussey must fall back on their more general\n\nclaims against Whitey Bulger. They have a significant problem here\n\nas well, because they have never demonstrated that they possess any\n\njudgment against him.   They rely on the fact that his default has\n\nbeen entered by the clerk of the state court under Mass. R. Civ. P.\n\n55(a).   As the government points out, however, under Massachusetts\n\nrules this is not the same as a judgment, which must be pursued in\n\ncases of default according to additional procedures under Mass. R.\n\nCiv. P. 55(b).   See Mass. R. Civ. P. 55, reporters' notes (1973)\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f(\"Rule 55 embraces two separate and distinct procedures . . . .\").\n\nIt appears that Davis and Hussey remain mere plaintiffs, rather\n\nthan judgment creditors.     But the problem is more serious than one\n\nof timing -- if they held a judgment, it would not solve the\n\nproblem.\n\n           Even were we to assume that they held a judgment against\n\nWhitey Bulger, it would be only a general in personam judgment, not\n\na secured interest against any particular asset that he owned.          In\n\nmost circumstances, such general creditors are outside the ambit of\n\nthe \"owner or lienholder\" to which the statute then referred.           18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 981(a)(2) (1994) (amended 2000).         \"[T]he federal courts\n\nhave   consistently   held   that   unsecured   creditors   do   not   have\n\nstanding to challenge the civil forfeiture of their debtors'\n\nproperty.\" United States v. $20,193.39, 16 F.3d 344, 346 (9th Cir.\n\n1994) (collecting cases); see Smith, supra, ยถ 9.04, at 70.6-70.7\n\n(\"A mere equitable interest in the property was historically not\n\ndeemed sufficient to confer standing.\").\n\n           Whether this rule about general creditors may ever be\n\nrelaxed in unusual circumstances is an issue we need not decide.\n\nIn the related context of criminal forfeiture, some circuits have\n\nsaid \"never.\"   For example, a line of cases holds:\n\n           [A] general creditor can never have an interest in\n           specific forfeited property, no matter what the relative\n           size of his claim vis-a-vis the value of the defendant's\n           post-forfeiture estate.   Were it otherwise, the court\n           litigating the forfeiture issue would be converted into\n           a bankruptcy court and would not be able to grant\n\n                                    -19-\n\f          forfeiture to the government until it determined that no\n          general creditor would be unable to satisfy its claim\n          against the defendant.\n\nUnited States v. BCCI Holdings (Lux.), S.A., 46 F.3d 1185, 1191-92\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1995); accord United States v. Watkins, 320 F.3d 1279,\n\n1283 (11th Cir. 2003); United States v. Ribadeneira, 105 F.3d 833,\n\n836-37 (2d Cir. 1997); United States v. Campos, 859 F.2d 1233,\n\n1237-38 (6th Cir. 1988).    Other courts say \"hardly ever.\"    See\n\nUnited States v. Reckmeyer, 836 F.2d 200, 206-08 (4th Cir. 1987)\n\n(general creditors may have claim where criminal forfeiture reaches\n\nall discovered and undiscovered assets of debtor).       Here, the\n\ncompeting general creditors are more than a mere abstraction: in\n\nlight of the other murder allegations, there are at least seventeen\n\nother families of victims with potential wrongful death claims\n\nagainst Whitey Bulger.\n\n          Davis and Hussey offer two rebuttals to these arguments\n\nagainst their standing.    They first argue, without authoritative\n\nsupport, that future lottery payments could not be part of the res\n\nsubject to forfeiture, because \"there is no right to seize cash\n\nwhich does not yet exist\" and in rem jurisdiction is limited to\n\n\"the seizure of a physical object.\"       As a result, they say,\n\npayments other than the one made in 1995 were never seized, and are\n\ntherefore subject to their lien.\n\n          This argument is meritless.   The complaint, the warrant,\n\nand the order all define the res as the \"one-sixth share of James\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fJ. Bulger in all present and future proceeds\" (emphasis added) from\n\nthe winning ticket.    That res was forfeited in its entirety to the\n\nUnited States at the time of the judgment in January 1996.              There\n\nis no meaningful difference between this case and the forfeiture of\n\na share of stock, which includes the right to receive future\n\ndividends.   See, e.g., United States v. 2,538.85 Shares of Stock,\n\n988 F.2d 1281, 1283-84 (1st Cir. 1993) (discussing procedures for\n\nseizing intangible property in civil forfeiture cases).                   The\n\ncontention that a res must be tangible is belied by long-running\n\ndebate   concerning   jurisdiction    over    an   intangible    res.     See\n\ngenerally 4A C.A. Wright & A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure ยง 1071 (3d ed. 2002).\n\n           Davis and Hussey also argue that forfeiture of the right\n\nto lottery payments is impermissible under Massachusetts law making\n\nthem unassignable, or at least that the question is open to doubt\n\nso they should be permitted to litigate it.              In federal civil\n\nforfeiture proceedings, the definition of ownership interests is\n\ngoverned by state law.    See $81,000, 189 F.3d at 33.          However, the\n\nstate law that Davis and Hussey cite hurts them instead of helping\n\nthem.    It provides, \"No right of any person to a prize shall be\n\nassignable except that . . . any person pursuant to an appropriate\n\njudicial order may be paid the prize to which the winner is\n\nentitled . . . .\"        Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 10 ยง 28 (2002).               An\n\n\"appropriate   judicial   order\"     issued   by   a   federal    court   has\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fforfeited a one-sixth share of the prize to the United States,\n\nconsistent with state law.\n\n            The anguish of a parent whose child has been murdered is\n\nunending.     Taking the property of the murderer is incomplete\n\nrecompense,   at   best,   but   may   provide   some   sense   of   justice.\n\nCongress has provided for justice a different way: it has provided\n\nthat the government, which stands for all the citizens, may take\n\nthe criminal's property by forfeiture, and it has limited those who\n\nmay assert competing claims. Courts must adjudicate the laws which\n\nCongress enacts.     If Davis and Hussey wish to pursue the matter,\n\nthey should turn to the executive branch, to which the property was\n\nproperly forfeit.     See 18 U.S.C. ยง 981(d) (\"The Attorney General\n\nshall have sole responsibility for disposing of petitions for\n\nremission or mitigation with respect to property involved in a\n\njudicial forfeiture proceeding.\").\n\n                                   III.\n\n            The district court's judgment is affirmed.          No costs are\n\nawarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f",

They sought to assert claims to a one-sixth share of a $14.3 million winning state lottery ticket, still in payout, which had belonged to James \"Whitey\" Bulger. Two of the claimants, Olga Davis and Marion Hussey, are mothers of young women whom Whitey Bulger allegedly murdered in the 1980s; the other is one of his brothers, John Bulger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Whitey Bulger was indicted for crimes related to his alleged leadership of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston. He went into hiding and is on the FBI's list of the \"ten most wanted\" fugitives. Later that year, the government brought an in rem civil forfeiture action against Bulger's share of the prize, based upon the theory that he had purchased the ticket as a money-laundering device. The district court entered a default judgment forfeiting the property in January 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001, the government, to its credit, filed a submission with the district court based on new information about the lottery ticket which cast doubt on its money-laundering theory. In its submission, the government argued that the forfeiture remained valid and should not be disturbed. Later that year, the three claimants, none of whom was previously involved in the forfeiture proceedings, moved to intervene and to reopen the case. Davis and Hussey also brought wrongful death actions in state court against Whitey Bulger in 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the motions were filed on the basis of newly-discovered evidence, and therefore were barred by the one-year limit for moving to vacate a judgment on this basis. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We do not reach the Rule 60 issue. Instead, we hold that none of the claimants has either standing to intervene or a viable claim, and so affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lottery ticket was a \"season ticket,\" which enters the owner's selected numbers into every drawing for a year. In July 1991, the ticket won a $14.3 million jackpot, payable in twenty annual installments. The registered owner, Michael Linskey, claimed the prize. He also submitted to the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission a written agreement between himself and three partners whom he said had contributed to the $100 price of the ticket and co-owned it. According to the agreement, Michael Linskey owned half of the ticket. The other half was evenly divided between his brother, Patrick Linskey; Kevin Weeks; and Whitey Bulger. All three of these men were allegedly affiliated with the Winter Hill Gang, whose criminal activities are described in greater detail in <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 225 F.3d 78 (1st Cir.2000), and <i>United States v. Salemme,</i> 91 F.Supp.2d 141 (D.Mass.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1991 through 1994, annual winnings and the attendant tax liability were duly apportioned to the four co-owners of the ticket. The Lottery Commission paid the winnings to Michael Linskey, who arranged for the South Boston Savings Bank to disburse the funds among the four owners. Under this arrangement, Whitey Bulger's share, $119,408 a year before taxes, was deposited in a joint account he held at that bank with John Bulger. The total amount of the payments due to Whitey Bulger from 1995 through the final payment in 2010 was nearly two million dollars before taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1995, Whitey Bulger was indicted for racketeering and other offenses related to his alleged organized crime activities. He disappeared and has not been apprehended. On July 17, 1995, the federal government brought a verified in rem complaint for civil forfeiture of Whitey Bulger's share of the ticket under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(a)(1)(A) (1994) (amended 2000). A supporting affidavit provided information from two confidential informants who said that Whitey Bulger paid Michael Linskey $700,000 in cash for his share of the ticket after it won the jackpot, thus laundering illegal criminal proceeds by replacing the tainted funds with apparently legitimate payments from the Lottery Commission. A magistrate judge found that this complaint established probable cause and issued a warrant and monition authorizing the seizure from the Lottery Commission of \"such one-sixth share of the gross amount otherwise due and payable to Michael Linskey.\" Both the complaint and the warrant defined the defendant res as \"the one-sixth share of James J. Bulger in all present and future proceeds of Mass Millions Lottery Ticket No. M246233, registered in the name of Michael Linskey.\" The seizure was widely reported in the media and was front-page news in both of Boston's major newspapers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitey Bulger never appeared to contest the lottery forfeiture. Later evidence established his awareness of the forfeiture action. His sister, Jean Holland, filed a claim to the one-sixth share on behalf of herself and his other heirs. She also asked the state probate court to appoint her as his receiver, but the request was rejected. Since she was not his receiver, the federal court dismissed Holland's claim for lack of standing. This court affirmed the dismissal for lack of standing in an unpublished opinion. <i>United States v. One-Sixth Share,</i> 101 F.3d 106 (table), 1996 WL 662459 (1st Cir.1996) (per curiam). Holland pursued her state litigation to be appointed as Whitey Bulger's receiver for several more years; it was finally dismissed with prejudice by the Supreme Judicial Court in October 2000. John Bulger was not a party in either of these state or federal cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks after dismissing Holland's claim, and in the absence of any other claimants in the six months since the case was filed, the district court entered a default judgment ordering the one-sixth share forfeited to the government on January 26, 1996. The order defined the res, or \"Defendant Property,\" in exactly the same language as the complaint and the warrant. It stated that \"all other persons and entities claiming any right, title or interest in or to the Defendant Property... are held in default.\" It also stated, \"This shall be, and is, the full and final disposition of this civil forfeiture action with regard to the Defendant Property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States sought forfeiture of Whitey Bulger's other assets as well. It secured an in rem default judgment against his Florida condominium. The government also seized the funds in the account at the South Boston Savings Bank held jointly in the names of both John and Whitey Bulger; John Bulger filed a timely claim in that litigation. This court ultimately found that, because John Bulger had possession of the funds and exercised sufficient dominion and control over the joint account, he had standing to contest this forfeiture. <i>United States v. $81,000,</i> 189 F.3d 28, 39 (1st Cir.1999). John Bulger later reached a settlement dividing the money in the account equally between himself and the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lottery ticket forfeiture case remained closed for over five years. During that time, ticket co-owner Weeks was indicted, pled guilty, and entered into a cooperation agreement with the government. In his debriefings, Weeks stated that he and Whitey Bulger had never paid anything for their shares of the winning ticket. Rather, Weeks said, they had spread the story that they were laundering money in order to assuage the temper of another criminal associate, Stephen Flemmi, who was angry at being excluded from the lottery winnings. This new information undermined the government's money-laundering theory, which it had used to demonstrate probable cause for seizure and to justify forfeiture. In February 2001, the government filed a submission with the district court which reported this new evidence, but also argued that Weeks's revelation was not a basis for disturbing the default judgment. Among other reasons, it made arguments (which we do not resolve) that there were alternative bases for civil and criminal forfeiture of the one-sixth share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks also implicated Whitey Bulger in a number of murders, including those of Davis's daughter in 1982 and Hussey's daughter in 1985. Weeks provided information that led the authorities to their bodies. A superseding indictment unveiled in September 2000 charged Whitey Bulger with these homicides. Davis and Hussey filed wrongful death actions against Whitey Bulger in state court in February 2001. Whitey Bulger has now been implicated in a total of nineteen murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a few months of the government's 2001 submission concerning the Weeks debriefings, Davis, Hussey, and John Bulger each moved in district court to set aside the default judgment forfeiting the lottery proceeds payable to Whitey Bulger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day before oral argument on these motions in the district court, Davis and Hussey went before the state judge presiding over their wrongful death actions and secured what is styled an equitable lien, subject to some limitations, on the one-sixth share. The United States was not a party in the state proceeding and did not appear, although the state court took judicial notice of the federal civil forfeiture. The state court found Davis and Hussey \"are entitled to as strong an equitable lien on said proceeds as this Court, pursuant to its general equitable powers, may grant.\" It ordered the Lottery Commission to hold future payments to Whitey Bulger in escrow \"to the extent permissible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\" It made the same order, nunc pro tunc, with respect to prior payments going back to 1995, \"to the extent possible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal district court denied the claimants' motions. <i>United States v.

Because civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding, the property subject to forfeiture is the defendant. Thus, defenses against the forfeiture can be brought only by third parties, who must intervene. Generally, an intervenor must have independent standing if the intervenor would be the only party litigating a case. <i>See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,</i> 520 U.S. 43, 64-65, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997); <i>Mangual v.

By virtue of the roots of in rem jurisdiction in admiralty law, the procedures for intervention in civil forfeitures are governed by the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(b)(2) (1994) (amended 2000); <i>United States v. One Dairy Farm,</i> 918 F.2d 310, 311 (1st Cir.1990). Supplemental Rule C(6), as it read in 1995, required a party to submit a \"claim\" to the property within ten days.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> \"A party who fails to file a claim normally lacks standing to contest a forfeiture.\" <i>One Dairy Farm,</i> 918 F.2d at 311; <i>see, e.g., United States v. 3,888 Lbs. of Atlantic Sea Scallops,</i> 857 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1988) (failure to file timely claim disqualifies would-be intervenor); <i>see also United States v.

Courts should not, however, conflate the constitutional standing inquiry with the merits determination that comes later. <i>See United States v. 5 S 351 Tuthill Rd.,</i> 233 F.3d 1017, 1023-24 (7th Cir.2000) (criticizing tests of straw ownership that deny standing rather than denying claims on their merits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the initial stage of intervention, the requirements for a claimant to demonstrate constitutional standing are very forgiving. In general, any colorable claim on the defendant property suffices. <i>$81,000,</i> 189 F.3d at 35 (\"Courts generally do not deny standing to a claimant who is either the colorable owner of the res or who has any colorable possessory interest in it.\"); <i>see United States v. 7725 Unity Ave. N.,</i> 294 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir.2002) (\"The claimant need only show a colorable interest in the property, redressable, at least in part, by a return of the property.\"); <i>5 S 351 Tuthill Rd.,</i> 233 F.3d at 1023 (claimant must show only \"actual stake in the outcome\" of forfeiture); <i>Cambio Exacto,</i> 166 F.3d at 527 (\"[W]hile ownership and possession generally may provide evidence of standing, it is injury to the party seeking standing that remains the ultimate focus.\"); <i>United States v.

There is no reason to forgive that failure. He filed a timely claim in the forfeiture action against the joint bank account, litigated that case vigorously, and ultimately reached a settlement with the government. It is beyond serious dispute that he was aware of the parallel forfeiture action against the lottery proceeds. <i>See $81,000,</i> 189 F.3d at 32 (describing how John Bulger learned of the lottery forfeiture complaint and withdrew cash from the joint account, \"motivated by a concern that further forfeiture proceedings might be in the offing\"). Yet he did not submit a similar claim in the lottery case, or even participate in his sister's efforts to intervene. His knowing failure to file anything at that time, whether because he chose not to do so or because he recognized his lack of standing, leaves him with no good excuse for his tardiness. <i>See One Urban Lot,</i> 885 F.2d at 999 (dismissing where neither claim nor answer was filed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Bulger actually concedes that he lacked constitutional standing to bring the case in 1995, in order to explain why he could not appeal from the original default judgment and to thereby distinguish his case from <i>United States v. One Rural Lot,</i> 238 F.3d 76 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> He suggests that the intervening event that cured this admitted lack of standing was the Weeks evidence. This effort fails. Nothing about the Weeks evidence changed John Bulger's relationship to the forfeited property or the injury he suffered as a result of forfeiture. The new information may have affected the arguments he could make, but not his standing to make them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He advances a final argument, saying that since he had standing to contest the forfeiture of the joint bank account, <i>see $81,000,</i> 189 F.3d at 39, he must have standing here. Not so. In this case, as in that one, he relies on his connection to the joint bank account as the basis for his claim of interest. He argues here that, because the annual payments were deposited into the joint account, they would have come under his control shortly after their disbursement. He also argues that, but for the forfeiture of the lottery proceeds, the joint account would have contained an additional $480,020.16 in lottery payments at the time of his May 2000 settlement with the government in the <i>$81,000</i> litigation, presumably resulting in a larger share for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>$81,000,</i> this court meticulously reviewed facts pointing in different directions to conclude that, on balance, John Bulger had standing to contest the forfeiture of money that was already in the joint bank account, despite numerous indications that it actually belonged to Whitey Bulger, because John Bulger had possession of that money and dominion and control over it. <i>See id.</i> at 36-39. In contrast, here John Bulger never possessed any of the lottery payments after 1994. He had no influence whatsoever over the payments, at least until they were deposited into the account. By seizing the funds before they made their way into the joint account, the government removed any possession or control John Bulger had over them, thus tipping the <i>$81,000</i> analysis against him. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(f) (2000) (giving United States \"[a]ll right, title, and interest\" in forfeited property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Davis and Hussey</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey are in a more sympathetic position. Unlike John Bulger, at the time of the default judgment, they did not know that they might possess any relevant right or interest in the lottery forfeiture case. The whole theory of their current attempt to intervene is that this court should forgive their failure to establish statutory standing at that time and should turn back the clock to allow them to file claims now. It is true that this court has used its equitable powers to read the requirements for filing claims somewhat broadly in the interests of justice. <i>See 116 Emerson St.,</i> 942 F.2d at 77-78 (\"Whether a belated claim will be recognized often depends on the existence of mitigating factors.\"); <i>One Urban Lot,</i> 885 F.2d at 999-1001 (applying admiralty law's traditional liberal construction of procedural practices to in rem civil forfeiture case). For the reasons that follow, the doctrine does not help Davis and Hussey, because even were we to ignore the failure to file, they do not have the requisite interest in the property to assert a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey rely on the purported lien they secured from state court. Normally, a lien against the defendant property would establish standing. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(a)(2) (1994) (amended 2000) (barring forfeiture of property \"to the extent of the interest of an owner or lienholder\" who was uninvolved in the criminal activity); <i>In re Metmor Fin., Inc.,</i> 819 F.2d 446, 448 &amp; n. 2 (4th Cir.1987) (\"There is no question\" that holder of mortgage is entitled to innocent owner status to extent of interest); <i>Town of Sanford v. United States,</i> 961 F.Supp. 16, 16-17, (D.Me.1997), <i>aff'd</i> 140 F.3d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1998) (lien for back taxes on forfeited property entitles town to innocent owner defense). Given the generous standards for constitutional standing, it is arguable that they had a colorable claim once the state court acted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with their purported lien, however. First, at the time the state court acted in 2001, \"[a]ll right, title, and interest\" in the property had already vested in the United States over five years earlier. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(f). There was no share of the lottery proceeds left in Whitey Bulger's name. The Lottery Commission informed the district court in July 2001 that it believed the forfeiture order applied to one-sixth of the entire prize, and that the state court order was inconsistent with the federal forfeiture. State court jurisdiction over Whitey Bulger would have been inadequate to confer authority for disposing of property that he no longer owned, and the state court did not have or purport to exercise jurisdiction over the United States. <i>Cf. Fierro v. Reno,</i> 217 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2000) (refusing to recognize state court's nunc pro tunc order modifying twenty-year-old child custody order for purposes of defining immigration status of deportee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the state court was aware of the issue and included broad language in its order to exclude any interest that the federal government already had in the property by virtue of the civil forfeiture. The equitable lien is only enforceable \"to the extent permissible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\" This exception swallows up whatever hold the lien would otherwise provide over the res. Davis and Hussey can hardly displace a first-in-time final judgment by virtue of an equitable lien which explicitly excludes property subject to that judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without the lien to provide standing connected to the res itself, Davis and Hussey must fall back on their more general claims against Whitey Bulger. They have a significant problem here as well, because they have never demonstrated that they possess any judgment against him. They rely on the fact that his default has been entered by the clerk of the state court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 55(a). As the government points out, however, under Massachusetts rules this is not the same as a judgment, which must be pursued in cases of default according to additional procedures under Mass. R. Civ. P. 55(b). <i>See</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 55, reporters' notes (1973) (\"Rule 55 embraces two separate and distinct procedures....\"). It appears that Davis and Hussey remain mere plaintiffs, rather than judgment creditors. But the problem is more serious than one of timing &#8212; if they held a judgment, it would not solve the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume that they held a judgment against Whitey Bulger, it would be only a general in personam judgment, not a secured interest against any particular asset that he owned. In most circumstances, such general creditors are outside the ambit of the \"owner or lienholder\" to which the statute then referred. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(a)(2) (1994) (amended 2000). \"[T]he federal courts have consistently held that unsecured creditors do not have standing to challenge the civil forfeiture of their debtors' property.\" <i>United States v. $20,193.39,</i> 16 F.3d 344, 346 (9th Cir.1994) (collecting cases); <i>see</i> Smith, <i>supra,</i> &#182; 9.04, at 70.6-70.7 (\"A mere equitable interest in the property was historically not deemed sufficient to confer standing.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this rule about general creditors may ever be relaxed in unusual circumstances is an issue we need not decide. In the related context of criminal forfeiture, some circuits have said \"never.\" For example, a line of cases holds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] general creditor can never have an interest in specific forfeited property, no matter what the relative size of his claim vis-a-vis the value of the defendant's post-forfeiture estate. Were it otherwise, the court litigating the forfeiture issue would be converted into a bankruptcy court and would not be able to grant forfeiture to the government until it determined that no general creditor would be unable to satisfy its claim against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. BCCI Holdings (Lux.), S.A.,</i> 46 F.3d 1185, 1191-92 (D.C.Cir.1995); <i>accord United States v. Watkins,</i> 320 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Ribadeneira,</i> 105 F.3d 833, 836-37 (2d Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Campos,</i> 859 F.2d 1233, 1237-38 (6th Cir.1988). Other courts say \"hardly ever.\" <i>See United States v. Reckmeyer,</i> 836 F.2d 200, 206-08 (4th Cir.1987) (general creditors may have claim where criminal forfeiture reaches all discovered and undiscovered assets of debtor). Here, the competing general creditors are more than a mere abstraction: in light of the other murder allegations, there are at least seventeen other families of victims with potential wrongful death claims against Whitey Bulger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey offer two rebuttals to these arguments against their standing. They first argue, without authoritative support, that future lottery payments could not be part of the res subject to forfeiture, because \"there is no right to seize cash which does not yet exist\" and in rem jurisdiction is limited to \"the seizure of a physical object.\" As a result, they say, payments other than the one made in 1995 were never seized, and are therefore subject to their lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is meritless. The complaint, the warrant, and the order all define the res as the \"one-sixth share of James J. Bulger in all present <i>and future</i> proceeds\" (emphasis added) from the winning ticket. That res was forfeited in its entirety to the United States at the time of the judgment in January 1996. There is no meaningful difference between this case and the forfeiture of a share of stock, which includes the right to receive future dividends. <i>See, e.g., United States v. 2,538.85 Shares of Stock,</i> 988 F.2d 1281, 1283-84 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing procedures for seizing intangible property in civil forfeiture cases). The contention that a res must be tangible is belied by long-running debate concerning jurisdiction over an intangible res. <i>See generally</i> 4A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1071 (3d ed.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey also argue that forfeiture of the right to lottery payments is impermissible under Massachusetts law making them unassignable, or at least that the question is open to doubt so they should be permitted to litigate it. In federal civil forfeiture proceedings, the definition of ownership interests is governed by state law. <i>See $81,000,</i> 189 F.3d at 33. However, the state law that Davis and Hussey cite hurts them instead of helping them. It provides, \"No right of any person to a prize shall be assignable except that ... any person pursuant to an appropriate judicial order may be paid the prize to which the winner is entitled....\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 10 &#167; 28 (2002). An \"appropriate judicial order\" issued by a federal court has forfeited a one-sixth share of the prize to the United States, consistent with state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anguish of a parent whose child has been murdered is unending. Taking the property of the murderer is incomplete recompense, at best, but may provide some sense of justice. Congress has provided for justice a different way: it has provided that the government, which stands for all the citizens, may take the criminal's property by forfeiture, and it has limited those who may assert competing claims. Courts must adjudicate the laws which Congress enacts. If Davis and Hussey wish to pursue the matter, they should turn to the executive branch, to which the property was properly forfeit. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(d) (\"The Attorney General shall have sole responsibility for disposing of petitions for remission or mitigation with respect to property involved in a judicial forfeiture proceeding.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The three motions were based on slightly different procedural mechanisms.

They sought to assert claims to a one-sixth share of a $14.3 million winning state lottery ticket, still in payout, which had belonged to James \"Whitey\" Bulger. Two of the claimants, Olga Davis and Marion Hussey, are mothers of young women whom Whitey Bulger allegedly murdered in the 1980s; the other is one of his brothers, John Bulger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Whitey Bulger was indicted for crimes related to his alleged leadership of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston. He went into hiding and is on the FBI's list of the \"ten most wanted\" fugitives. Later that year, the government brought an in rem civil forfeiture action against Bulger's share of the prize, based upon the theory that he had purchased the ticket as a money-laundering device. The district court entered a default judgment forfeiting the property in January 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2001, the government, to its credit, filed a submission with the district court based on new information about the lottery ticket which cast doubt on its money-laundering theory. In its submission, the government argued that the forfeiture remained valid and should not be disturbed. Later that year, the three claimants, none of whom was previously involved in the forfeiture proceedings, moved to intervene and to reopen the case. Davis and Hussey also brought wrongful death actions in state court against Whitey Bulger in 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the motions were filed on the basis of newly-discovered evidence, and therefore were barred by the one-year limit for moving to vacate a judgment on this basis. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We do not reach the Rule 60 issue. Instead, we hold that none of the claimants has either standing to intervene or a viable claim, and so affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lottery ticket was a \"season ticket,\" which enters the owner's selected numbers into every drawing for a year. In July 1991, the ticket won a $14.3 million jackpot, payable in twenty annual installments. The registered owner, Michael Linskey, claimed the prize. He also submitted to the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission a written agreement between himself and three partners whom he said had contributed to the $100 price of the ticket and co-owned it. According to the agreement, Michael Linskey owned half of the ticket. The other half was evenly divided between his brother, Patrick Linskey; Kevin Weeks; and Whitey Bulger. All three of these men were allegedly affiliated with the Winter Hill Gang, whose criminal activities are described in greater detail in <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770242\"><a href=\"/opinion/770242/united-states-v-stephen-j-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000), and <i>United States v.

The Lottery Commission paid the winnings to Michael Linskey, who arranged for the South Boston Savings Bank to disburse the funds among the four owners. Under this arrangement, Whitey Bulger's share, $119,408 a year before taxes, was deposited in a joint account he held at that bank with John Bulger. The total amount of the payments due to Whitey Bulger from 1995 through the final payment in 2010 was nearly two million dollars before taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1995, Whitey Bulger was indicted for racketeering and other offenses related to his alleged organized crime activities. He disappeared and has not been apprehended. On July 17, 1995, the federal government brought a verified in rem complaint for civil forfeiture of Whitey Bulger's share of the ticket under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(a)(1)(A) (1994) (amended 2000). A supporting affidavit provided information from two confidential informants who said that Whitey Bulger paid Michael Linskey $700,000 in cash for his share of the ticket after it won the jackpot, thus laundering illegal criminal proceeds by replacing the tainted funds with apparently legitimate payments from the Lottery Commission. A magistrate judge found that this complaint established probable cause and issued a warrant and monition authorizing the seizure from the Lottery Commission of \"such one-sixth share of the gross amount otherwise due and payable to Michael Linskey.\" Both the complaint and the warrant defined the defendant res as \"the one-sixth share of James J. Bulger in all present and future proceeds of Mass Millions Lottery Ticket No. M246233, registered in the name of Michael Linskey.\" The seizure was widely reported in the media and was front-page news in both of Boston's major newspapers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitey Bulger never appeared to contest the lottery forfeiture. Later evidence established his awareness of the forfeiture action. His sister, Jean Holland, filed a claim to the one-sixth share on behalf of herself and his other heirs. She also asked the state probate court to appoint her as his receiver, but the request was rejected. Since she was not his receiver, the federal court dismissed Holland's claim for lack of standing. This court affirmed the dismissal for lack of standing in an unpublished opinion. <i>United States v. One-Sixth Share,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span> (table), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">662459</span></span> (1st Cir.1996) (per curiam). Holland pursued her state litigation to be appointed as Whitey Bulger's receiver for several more years; it was finally dismissed with prejudice by the Supreme Judicial Court in October 2000. John Bulger was not a party in either of these state or federal cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks after dismissing Holland's claim, and in the absence of any other claimants in the six months since the case was filed, the district court entered a default judgment ordering the one-sixth share forfeited to the government on January 26, 1996. The order defined the res, or \"Defendant Property,\" in exactly the same language as the complaint and the warrant. It stated that \"all other persons and entities claiming any right, title or interest in or to the Defendant Property... are held in default.\" It also stated, \"This shall be, and is, the full and final disposition of this civil forfeiture action with regard to the Defendant Property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States sought forfeiture of Whitey Bulger's other assets as well. It secured an in rem default judgment against his Florida condominium. The government also seized the funds in the account at the South Boston Savings Bank held jointly in the names of both John and Whitey Bulger; John Bulger filed a timely claim in that litigation. This court ultimately found that, because John Bulger had possession of the funds and exercised sufficient dominion and control over the joint account, he had standing to contest this forfeiture. <i>United States v. $81,000,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198595\"><a href=\"/opinion/198595/united-states-v-bulger/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1999). John Bulger later reached a settlement dividing the money in the account equally between himself and the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lottery ticket forfeiture case remained closed for over five years. During that time, ticket co-owner Weeks was indicted, pled guilty, and entered into a cooperation agreement with the government. In his debriefings, Weeks stated that he and Whitey Bulger had never paid anything for their shares of the winning ticket. Rather, Weeks said, they had spread the story that they were laundering money in order to assuage the temper of another criminal associate, Stephen Flemmi, who was angry at being excluded from the lottery winnings. This new information undermined the government's money-laundering theory, which it had used to demonstrate probable cause for seizure and to justify forfeiture. In February 2001, the government filed a submission with the district court which reported this new evidence, but also argued that Weeks's revelation was not a basis for disturbing the default judgment. Among other reasons, it made arguments (which we do not resolve) that there were alternative bases for civil and criminal forfeiture of the one-sixth share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks also implicated Whitey Bulger in a number of murders, including those of Davis's daughter in 1982 and Hussey's daughter in 1985. Weeks provided information that led the authorities to their bodies. A superseding indictment unveiled in September 2000 charged Whitey Bulger with these homicides. Davis and Hussey filed wrongful death actions against Whitey Bulger in state court in February 2001. Whitey Bulger has now been implicated in a total of nineteen murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a few months of the government's 2001 submission concerning the Weeks debriefings, Davis, Hussey, and John Bulger each moved in district court to set aside the default judgment forfeiting the lottery proceeds payable to Whitey Bulger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day before oral argument on these motions in the district court, Davis and Hussey went before the state judge presiding over their wrongful death actions and secured what is styled an equitable lien, subject to some limitations, on the one-sixth share. The United States was not a party in the state proceeding and did not appear, although the state court took judicial notice of the federal civil forfeiture. The state court found Davis and Hussey \"are entitled to as strong an equitable lien on said proceeds as this Court, pursuant to its general equitable powers, may grant.\" It ordered the Lottery Commission to hold future payments to Whitey Bulger in escrow \"to the extent permissible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\" It made the same order, nunc pro tunc, with respect to prior payments going back to 1995, \"to the extent possible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal district court denied the claimants' motions. <i>United States v.

Because civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding, the property subject to forfeiture is the defendant. Thus, defenses against the forfeiture can be brought only by third parties, who must intervene.

The new information may have affected the arguments he could make, but not his standing to make them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He advances a final argument, saying that since he had standing to contest the forfeiture of the joint bank account, <i>see $81,000,</i> 189 F.3d at 39, he must have standing here. Not so. In this case, as in that one, he relies on his connection to the joint bank account as the basis for his claim of interest. He argues here that, because the annual payments were deposited into the joint account, they would have come under his control shortly after their disbursement. He also argues that, but for the forfeiture of the lottery proceeds, the joint account would have contained an additional $480,020.16 in lottery payments at the time of his May 2000 settlement with the government in the <i>$81,000</i> litigation, presumably resulting in a larger share for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>$81,000,</i> this court meticulously reviewed facts pointing in different directions to conclude that, on balance, John Bulger had standing to contest the forfeiture of money that was already in the joint bank account, despite numerous indications that it actually belonged to Whitey Bulger, because John Bulger had possession of that money and dominion and control over it. <i>See id.</i> at 36-39. In contrast, here John Bulger never possessed any of the lottery payments after 1994. He had no influence whatsoever over the payments, at least until they were deposited into the account. By seizing the funds before they made their way into the joint account, the government removed any possession or control John Bulger had over them, thus tipping the <i>$81,000</i> analysis against him. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(f) (2000) (giving United States \"[a]ll right, title, and interest\" in forfeited property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Davis and Hussey</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey are in a more sympathetic position. Unlike John Bulger, at the time of the default judgment, they did not know that they might possess any relevant right or interest in the lottery forfeiture case. The whole theory of their current attempt to intervene is that this court should forgive their failure to establish statutory standing at that time and should turn back the clock to allow them to file claims now. It is true that this court has used its equitable powers to read the requirements for filing claims somewhat broadly in the interests of justice. <i>See 116 Emerson St.,</i> 942 F.2d at 77-78 (\"Whether a belated claim will be recognized often depends on the existence of mitigating factors.\"); <i>One Urban Lot,</i> 885 F.2d at 999-1001 (applying admiralty law's traditional liberal construction of procedural practices to in rem civil forfeiture case). For the reasons that follow, the doctrine does not help Davis and Hussey, because even were we to ignore the failure to file, they do not have the requisite interest in the property to assert a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey rely on the purported lien they secured from state court. Normally, a lien against the defendant property would establish standing. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(a)(2) (1994) (amended 2000) (barring forfeiture of property \"to the extent of the interest of an owner or lienholder\" who was uninvolved in the criminal activity); <i>In re Metmor Fin., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488744\"><a href=\"/opinion/488744/no-86-3710/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 448 &amp; n. 2 (4th Cir.1987) (\"There is no question\" that holder of mortgage is entitled to innocent owner status to extent of interest); <i>Town of Sanford v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2282640\"><a href=\"/opinion/2282640/town-of-sanford-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 16-17, (D.Me.1997), <i>aff'd</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197879\"><a href=\"/opinion/197879/town-of-sanford-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1998) (lien for back taxes on forfeited property entitles town to innocent owner defense). Given the generous standards for constitutional standing, it is arguable that they had a colorable claim once the state court acted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with their purported lien, however. First, at the time the state court acted in 2001, \"[a]ll right, title, and interest\" in the property had already vested in the United States over five years earlier. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(f). There was no share of the lottery proceeds left in Whitey Bulger's name. The Lottery Commission informed the district court in July 2001 that it believed the forfeiture order applied to one-sixth of the entire prize, and that the state court order was inconsistent with the federal forfeiture. State court jurisdiction over Whitey Bulger would have been inadequate to confer authority for disposing of property that he no longer owned, and the state court did not have or purport to exercise jurisdiction over the United States. <i>Cf. Fierro v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769234\"><a href=\"/opinion/769234/miguel-noel-fierro-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-miguel-noel-fierro-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir.2000) (refusing to recognize state court's nunc pro tunc order modifying twenty-year-old child custody order for purposes of defining immigration status of deportee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the state court was aware of the issue and included broad language in its order to exclude any interest that the federal government already had in the property by virtue of the civil forfeiture. The equitable lien is only enforceable \"to the extent permissible with the civil forfeiture currently in place.\" This exception swallows up whatever hold the lien would otherwise provide over the res. Davis and Hussey can hardly displace a first-in-time final judgment by virtue of an equitable lien which explicitly excludes property subject to that judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without the lien to provide standing connected to the res itself, Davis and Hussey must fall back on their more general claims against Whitey Bulger. They have a significant problem here as well, because they have never demonstrated that they possess any judgment against him. They rely on the fact that his default has been entered by the clerk of the state court under Mass. R. Civ. P. 55(a). As the government points out, however, under Massachusetts rules this is not the same as a judgment, which must be pursued in cases of default according to additional procedures under Mass. R. Civ. P. 55(b). <i>See</i> Mass. R. Civ. P. 55, reporters' notes (1973) (\"Rule 55 embraces two separate and distinct procedures....\"). It appears that Davis and Hussey remain mere plaintiffs, rather than judgment creditors. But the problem is more serious than one of timing &#8212; if they held a judgment, it would not solve the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume that they held a judgment against Whitey Bulger, it would be only a general in personam judgment, not a secured interest against any particular asset that he owned. In most circumstances, such general creditors are outside the ambit of the \"owner or lienholder\" to which the statute then referred. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(a)(2) (1994) (amended 2000). \"[T]he federal courts have consistently held that unsecured creditors do not have standing to challenge the civil forfeiture of their debtors' property.\" <i>United States v. $20,193.39,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662534\"><a href=\"/opinion/662534/united-states-v-2019339-us-currency-14k-yellow-gold-rings-83/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 346 (9th Cir.1994) (collecting cases); <i>see</i> Smith, <i>supra,</i> &#182; 9.04, at 70.6-70.7 (\"A mere equitable interest in the property was historically not deemed sufficient to confer standing.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this rule about general creditors may ever be relaxed in unusual circumstances is an issue we need not decide. In the related context of criminal forfeiture, some circuits have said \"never.\" For example, a line of cases holds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] general creditor can never have an interest in specific forfeited property, no matter what the relative size of his claim vis-a-vis the value of the defendant's post-forfeiture estate. Were it otherwise, the court litigating the forfeiture issue would be converted into a bankruptcy court and would not be able to grant forfeiture to the government until it determined that no general creditor would be unable to satisfy its claim against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Here, the competing general creditors are more than a mere abstraction: in light of the other murder allegations, there are at least seventeen other families of victims with potential wrongful death claims against Whitey Bulger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey offer two rebuttals to these arguments against their standing. They first argue, without authoritative support, that future lottery payments could not be part of the res subject to forfeiture, because \"there is no right to seize cash which does not yet exist\" and in rem jurisdiction is limited to \"the seizure of a physical object.\" As a result, they say, payments other than the one made in 1995 were never seized, and are therefore subject to their lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is meritless. The complaint, the warrant, and the order all define the res as the \"one-sixth share of James J. Bulger in all present <i>and future</i> proceeds\" (emphasis added) from the winning ticket. That res was forfeited in its entirety to the United States at the time of the judgment in January 1996. There is no meaningful difference between this case and the forfeiture of a share of stock, which includes the right to receive future dividends. <i>See, e.g., United States v. 2,538.85 Shares of Stock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602801\"><a href=\"/opinion/602801/united-states-v-approximately-two-thousand-five-hundred-thirty-eight/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span>, 1283-84 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing procedures for seizing intangible property in civil forfeiture cases). The contention that a res must be tangible is belied by long-running debate concerning jurisdiction over an intangible res. <i>See generally</i> 4A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1071 (3d ed.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis and Hussey also argue that forfeiture of the right to lottery payments is impermissible under Massachusetts law making them unassignable, or at least that the question is open to doubt so they should be permitted to litigate it. In federal civil forfeiture proceedings, the definition of ownership interests is governed by state law. <i>See $81,000,</i> 189 F.3d at 33. However, the state law that Davis and Hussey cite hurts them instead of helping them. It provides, \"No right of any person to a prize shall be assignable except that ... any person pursuant to an appropriate judicial order may be paid the prize to which the winner is entitled....\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 10 &#167; 28 (2002). An \"appropriate judicial order\" issued by a federal court has forfeited a one-sixth share of the prize to the United States, consistent with state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anguish of a parent whose child has been murdered is unending. Taking the property of the murderer is incomplete recompense, at best, but may provide some sense of justice. Congress has provided for justice a different way: it has provided that the government, which stands for all the citizens, may take the criminal's property by forfeiture, and it has limited those who may assert competing claims. Courts must adjudicate the laws which Congress enacts. If Davis and Hussey wish to pursue the matter, they should turn to the executive branch, to which the property was properly forfeit. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 981(d) (\"The Attorney General shall have sole responsibility for disposing of petitions for remission or mitigation with respect to property involved in a judicial forfeiture proceeding.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The three motions were based on slightly different procedural mechanisms.

John Bulger moved both to intervene and to set aside the judgment.
