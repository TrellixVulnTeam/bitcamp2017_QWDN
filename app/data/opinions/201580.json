William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                 and DiClerico, Jr.,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Douglas J.

On July 14, 2003, Rhode Island\n\nState Police executed a search warrant and confiscated inventory at\n\na smoke shop (\"the Smoke Shop\") located on Narragansett tribal\n\nland.   An altercation ensued between members of the Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe (\"the Tribe\" or \"the Narragansetts\") and several State\n\npolice officers, resulting in the arrest of eight tribal members,\n\nincluding the Chief Sachem of the Tribe.\n\n          Following this incident, both the Narragansetts and the\n\nState of Rhode Island filed suits disputing the issue of whether\n\nthe Tribe's operation of a smoke shop and sale of cigarettes on the\n\nTribe's settlement lands are exempt from the application and\n\nenforcement of Rhode Island's cigarette tax laws.        The State\n\ninitially filed its complaint in Rhode Island state court and the\n\nNarragansetts removed the case to federal district court in an\n\nattempt to have it decided together with the Tribe's complaint,\n\nwhich was brought in federal district court.    The district court\n\nfound that it did not have jurisdiction over the state case and\n\nremanded it to the state court.       However, the district court\n\ntreated the State's motion for summary judgment in its case as a\n\nmotion for summary judgment in the Tribe's federal case and decided\n\nthe federal case accordingly.   The district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the State, and the Narragansett Tribe now\n\nbrings the instant appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f              We must decide three questions related to this incident.\n\nFirst, we are asked whether the district court could exercize\n\njurisdiction over the State's complaint.            Second, we must decide\n\nwhether the Narragansett Tribe has sovereign immunity from the\n\nRhode Island tax on cigarettes, focusing on whether the legal\n\nincidence of the cigarette tax falls on the tribe or the consumer\n\nof the cigarettes.        Finally, we must determine whether the State\n\nexceeded its authority in the enforcement of its cigarette tax on\n\nsettlement lands in violation of the Tribe's sovereignty.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n              The parties submitted this case on stipulated facts,\n\nthus,   \"no    evidence   contrary    to    the   facts   stipulated   can   be\n\nconsidered.\" Gómez v. Rodríguez, 34 F.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nWe review the factual findings under the clear-error standard, and\n\nthe \"ultimate application of the law to those facts\" remains\n\n\"subject to de novo review.\"         Reich v. John Alden Life Ins., Co.,\n\n126 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              The Narragansett Indian Tribe is a federally recognized\n\nIndian tribe located in the State of Rhode Island.                 See Final\n\nDetermination for Federal Acknowledgment of Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (Feb. 10, 1983).                    The\n\nTribe is primarily situated on 1800 acres of land known as the\n\nsettlement lands, which were given to the Tribe in the Rhode Island\n\nIndian Claims Settlement Act (\"the Settlement Act\"), 25 U.S.C. §§\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f1701-1716. The relationship between the Narragansett Tribe and the\n\nState of Rhode Island is defined, in a number of ways, by the\n\nSettlement Act.     In the mid-1970s, the Narragansett Indian Tribe\n\nbrought two lawsuits in which they claimed aboriginal entitlement\n\nto 3200 acres of land in Charlestown, Rhode Island.         Narragansett\n\nTribe of Indians v. S. R.I. Land Dev. Corp., 418 F. Supp. 798 (D.\n\nR.I. 1976); Narragansett Tribe of Indians v. Murphy, 426 F. Supp.\n\n132 (D. R.I. 1976).       The Settlement Act implemented the Joint\n\nMemorandum of Understanding (\"the JMOU\") between the Narragansetts\n\nand the State of Rhode Island, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 25-28\n\n(1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1948, 1962-66, that resolved\n\nthese lawsuits.    See H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 5.\n\n           Under the terms of the JMOU and Settlement Act, the State\n\nprovided 900 acres to the Narragansetts and the Federal government\n\nagreed to provide funding for the purchase of an additional 900\n\nacres.   These lands comprise the 1800 acres we refer to as the\n\nsettlement lands.      In exchange for this provision of land to the\n\nTribe,   the   State   negotiated   for   and   received   the   continued\n\napplicability of State law to the settlement lands.         See 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708(a) (\"Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the\n\nsettlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws\n\nand jurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fA.   The Rhode Island Cigarette Tax Scheme\n\n           The sale of cigarettes in Rhode Island is governed by a\n\nnumber of statutory requirements, including taxation provisions.\n\nSee R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 44-20-1 to 44-20-55.   The State's cigarette\n\ntax scheme imposes the following requirements:\n\n                 Every person engaged in the sale of\n          cigarettes in Rhode Island must first obtain a\n          license from the State Tax Administrator.\n          R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-2. In addition to this\n          licensing requirement, Rhode Island imposes an\n          excise tax on cigarettes sold, distributed,\n          held, or consumed within its borders.     R.I.\n          Gen. Laws § 44-20-12.    The tax is collected\n          through the sale of cigarette stamps, which\n          must be affixed to all packages of cigarettes\n          possessed within the State (with limited\n          exceptions). R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-13, 44-\n          20-18, 44-20-30.   State law also requires a\n          retailer to add a sales tax to the sale price\n          of the cigarettes. R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-18-19.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe v. Rhode Island, 296 F. Supp. 2d 153, 163\n\n(D. R.I. 2003).   The excise tax requires that distributors\n\n           affix tax stamps in the proper denominations\n           at the location where their license is issued.\n           The stamps may be affixed to a distributor's\n           cigarettes at any time before transferring the\n           possession of the cigarettes. R.I. Gen. Laws\n           § 44-20-28. When a dealer receives unstamped\n           cigarettes, he or she must affix stamps within\n           twenty-four hours after coming into possession\n           of the cigarettes. R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-29.\n           . . . State law makes it unlawful to sell or\n           possess unstamped cigarettes, see R.I. Gen.\n           Laws §§ 44-20-35, 44-20-36, and cigarettes not\n           bearing stamps that are not exempt are\n           contraband and subject to seizure by the\n           State. R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 44-20-37, 44-20-38.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 163.\n\n                                -5-\n\f             Moreover,    Rhode    Island,   with    the   assistance        of   the\n\nFederal government, has a system by which it collects sales taxes\n\non cigarettes from consumers who reside in the State and purchase\n\ncigarettes from out-of-state dealers.               See The Jenkins Act, 15\n\nU.S.C.   §    375-378    (requiring    persons      shipping    or    delivering\n\ncigarettes to a state that taxes the sale or use of cigarettes to\n\ncomply with various reporting requirements identifying to the state\n\nthe monthly cigarette shipments and the consumers who purchased\n\nthem).\n\nB.   The Dispute\n\n             On July 1, 2003, the Narragansett Indian Tribe's Tribal\n\nCouncil passed a resolution authorizing the opening of a tribally\n\nowned Smoke Shop to sell cigarettes. The Tribe stipulated that the\n\npurpose of opening the Smoke Shop was to provide a means for\n\neconomic development for the Tribal Nation.                The Tribe imported\n\nunstamped     cigarettes    from    other    states    and     stored   them       in\n\nanticipation of the Smoke Shop's opening.             The Smoke Shop, which\n\nopened on July 12, 2003, was located entirely within the Tribe's\n\nsettlement lands.        The Shop offered unstamped, untaxed cigarettes\n\nfor sale to both tribal and non-tribal members without collecting\n\nRhode Island's seven percent retail sales tax from any of its\n\ncustomers.      As   stipulated     before   the     court   below,     \"a    large\n\nproportion of the Shop's customers were not members of the Tribe.\"\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fNarragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 158 (referencing the\n\nJoint Stipulations of the parties).\n\n           The day the Smoke Shop opened, the Rhode Island State\n\nPolice sought a search warrant to search the Smoke Shop for alleged\n\nviolations of Rhode Island's cigarette tax laws, specifically, the\n\npossession and sale of unstamped cigarettes, which is a misdemeanor\n\noffense. See R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 44-20-35, 44-20-36; see also id. at\n\n§§ 44-20-37, 44-20-38 (allowing for the seizure of such cigarettes\n\nas contraband).      The State of Rhode Island District Court issued\n\nthe requested warrant to search the Smoke Shop that same day.               On\n\nJuly 14, 2003, Rhode Island State Police entered the Narragansett\n\nTribe's settlement lands and executed the search warrant on the\n\nChief Sachem of the Narragansett Indian Tribe.             The State Police\n\nconfiscated the Tribe's inventory of unstamped cigarettes as well\n\nas various documents and monies. An altercation ensued between the\n\nState Police and some tribal members, resulting in the arrest of\n\nthe Chief Sachem and seven other tribal members.\n\n           Both the Narragansetts and the State brought suit over\n\nthis incident.      The district court found that it had jurisdiction\n\nover the Tribe's case, which was originally brought in federal\n\ndistrict   court.      See   28   U.S.C.   §   1362   (providing   that   \"The\n\n[federal] district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all\n\ncivil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing\n\nbody duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the\n\n                                     -7-\n\fmatter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or\n\ntreaties of the United States.\").                However, the district court\n\nfound that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the\n\nState's action, which was originally brought in Rhode Island State\n\nSuperior Court and later removed to the federal district court by\n\nthe Tribe.     The State had brought its action pursuant to Rhode\n\nIsland law seeking a declaration that the Tribe's failure to comply\n\nwith Rhode Island's cigarette sales and excise tax scheme was\n\nunlawful.    The district court therefore remanded the State's suit\n\nback to the Washington County Superior Court, but determined that\n\nit would \"treat the State's motion for summary Judgment in the\n\nState's case as a motion for summary judgment in the Tribe's\n\naction.\"    Narragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 160 n.5.\n\n            Faced    with   cross      motions    for   summary    judgment,      the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the State,\n\nholding that: (1) the legal incidence of the State's Cigarette Tax\n\nfalls on the consumer, and not the Tribe; (2) the State did not\n\nviolate    federal   law    or   the    Tribe's    sovereign      rights   when   it\n\nenforced its criminal statutes by executing a search warrant, and\n\nmaking arrests pursuant to that warrant, on tribal land; and (3)\n\nthe Tribe must comply with the Cigarette Tax if it wishes to\n\ncontinue selling cigarette products on the settlement lands.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f                                   II.   Analysis\n\n              We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nappellant.      Fenton v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins., 400 F.3d 83, 87\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).       We will uphold the grant of summary judgment if\n\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact and appellees are\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.                Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nA.    Jurisdiction over the State's Complaint\n\n              The Tribe asserts that the well-pleaded complaint rule\n\ndid not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over the State's\n\ncomplaint, which the Tribe removed from state court to federal\n\ndistrict court.1       The federal district court determined that it did\n\nnot have subject matter jurisdiction over the State's complaint\n\nbecause   (1)    the    State   did      not   bring   its    \"claims   under     the\n\nSettlement Act;\" (2) 28 U.S.C. § 1362 does not provide a viable\n\nbasis for federal jurisdiction because it \"only vests jurisdiction\n\nin a federal court over actions brought by an Indian tribe under\n\nthe laws of the United States;\" and (3) the district court found\n\nthe   cases    cited    by   the    Tribe      in   support   of   removal   to   be\n\n\"unavailing and inapposite.\"             Narragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 160.\n\n\n\n1\n  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, it must be clear from the\nplaintiff's complaint that there is a federal question. Louisville\n& Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 152 (1908).\n\n                                         -9-\n\f          The Tribe argues that the district court should have\n\napplied the \"artful pleading rule\" to the State's complaint.2               But\n\nthe alleged federal issue -- whether the State has authority to tax\n\nthe Tribe under the Settlement Act –- is a defense.                 Even had it\n\nbeen preemptively included and argued against in the State's\n\ncomplaint,   it    would   not   have    given   rise   to    federal   question\n\njurisdiction      over   the   State's    complaint.         See   Louisville   &\n\nNashville R.R., 211 U.S. at 152 (holding that the federal court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction under § 1331 because the federal\n\nissue arose only from the plaintiff's anticipation of a defense\n\nbased on a federal statute).\n\n          It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges\n          some anticipated defense to his cause of\n          action, and asserts that the defense is\n          invalidated   by   some   provision   of   the\n          Constitution of the United States. Although\n          such allegations show that very likely, in the\n          course of the litigation, a question under the\n          Constitution would arise, they do not show\n          that the suit, that is, the plaintiff's\n          original cause of action, arises under the\n          Constitution.\n\nId.   Therefore, we find that the court did not err in failing to\n\napply the artful pleading rule in this instance.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The \"artful pleading rule\" bars a plaintiff from concealing a\nnecessary federal question by omitting it from the complaint.\nFranchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1,\n22 (1983).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fB.   The Legal Incidence of the Cigarette Tax\n\n           The question of whether the legal incidence of Rhode\n\nIsland's cigarette tax scheme falls on the Narragansett Tribe, as\n\ndealers of cigarettes, or merely on the consumer or non-Indian\n\npurchaser of the cigarettes, will likely determine whether the\n\nNarragansetts are required to comply with the tax scheme.      The\n\nNarragansetts argue that the legal incidence of Rhode Island's\n\ncigarette tax falls directly on the Tribe and its members, and that\n\nthe tax may not be enforced against the Tribe without express\n\ncongressional authority. The State, on the other hand, argues that\n\nthe legal incidence of the cigarette tax, as stated in the language\n\nof the Rhode Island statute, rests on the consumer rather than the\n\nTribe. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-53 (\"All taxes paid in pursuance\n\nof this chapter are conclusively presumed to be a direct tax upon\n\nthe retail consumer, precollected for the purpose of convenience\n\nand facility only.\").\n\n           If the legal incidence of the cigarette tax falls on the\n\nTribe itself, it presents serious tribal sovereignty concerns that\n\nmight preclude the State from enforcing its tax due to the United\n\nStates' recognition of the Narragansetts as a sovereign Indian\n\ntribe. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. 450, 458-\n\n59 (1995) (citing Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of\n\nFlathead Reservation, 425 U.S. 463, 483 (1976)).      Such a \"tax\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fcannot be    enforced    absent   clear   congressional   authorization.\"\n\nChickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. at 459.\n\n            The district court determined that the legal incidence of\n\nRhode Island's cigarette tax falls on the consumer and not the\n\nNarragansett Tribe, noting that the pass through provision in Rhode\n\nIsland's statute was plain.         Narragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 167.        The district court stated that \"[w]hile the\n\nSupreme Court has held that a tax scheme does not need to contain\n\nsuch an express statement to place the legal incidence of the tax\n\non the consumer, the Court has enforced such provisions when they\n\nare present.\"    Id.\n\n            In adjudicating matters of state law, federal courts\n\nordinarily defer to the decisions of state courts. For example, in\n\nGurley v. Rhoden, 421 U.S. 200 (1975), a gasoline retailer claimed\n\nthat because the legal incidence of the state's gasoline excise tax\n\nfell on his consumers and he therefore merely collected the tax for\n\nthe state, due process entitled him to deduct the state tax from\n\nthe amount of his sales which were subject to a state sales tax.\n\nThe Mississippi Supreme Court held that the legal incidence of the\n\nexcise tax fell on petitioner.        In deciding Gurley, the Supreme\n\nCourt observed that \"a State's highest court is the final judicial\n\narbiter of the meaning of state statutes,\" and said that \"[w]hen a\n\nstate court has made its own definitive determination as to the\n\noperating incidence, . . . [w]e give this finding great weight in\n\n                                   -12-\n\fdetermining   the    natural    effect   of   a   statute,   and    if   it   is\n\nconsistent with the statute's reasonable interpretation it will be\n\ndeemed conclusive.\"       Id. at 208 (citing American Oil Co. v. Neill,\n\n380 U.S. 451, 455-456 (1965).\n\n           The Narragansett Tribe cites Gurley as the basis for its\n\nargument   that     the   district   court    should   not   have    made      an\n\nindependent determination of the legal incidence under Rhode Island\n\nlaw.   Rather than making an independent determination, the Tribe\n\ncontends, the district court should have given great weight to\n\nDaniels Tobacco Co. v. Norberg, 114 R.I. 502, 506 (1975), a Rhode\n\nIsland State Supreme Court decision regarding the legal incidence\n\nof the cigarette tax.          Daniels involves a ruling by the Rhode\n\nIsland State Tax Administrator ordering a distributor to pay the\n\ntaxes due on cigarettes and tobacco products that were stolen prior\n\nto sale.   The distributor appealed the decision in state courts,\n\narguing that as a distributor he should not be liable for the\n\nimposition of the cigarette tax on the stolen cigarettes because\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-12 does not make a distributor liable for\n\nthe cigarette tax, and furthermore, R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-53\n\nstates that cigarette taxes are a direct tax on the consumer,\n\nprecollected for convenience only.          Daniels, 114 R.I. at 505.         The\n\nRhode Island State Supreme Court ultimately\n\n           determine[d] that the legislative intent in\n           enacting § 44-20-12(1) was to place the risk\n           of loss of cigarettes on the distributor and\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          not on the state,\" noting that \"§ 44-20-28\n          . . . requires a distributor to affix tax\n          stamps to all cigarettes he distributes. In\n          addition, the mere fact that the ultimate\n          economic burden of a tax is one [sic] the\n          consumer   does  not  determine   the  legal\n          incidence of the tax.\n\nId. at 506 (citing   Ferrara v. Director, Div. of Taxation, 127 N.J.\n\nSuper. 240, 317 A.2d 80 (1974)).        Thus, the Tribe argues that\n\nDaniels establishes that the legal incidence falls on the Tribe.\n\n          However, \"[i]n situations wherein federal immunity is\n\naffected by a determination as to which party to a transaction\n\nbears the legal incidence of a state tax, the federal courts 'are\n\nnot bound by the state court's characterization of the tax.'\"\n\nConfederated Tribes of Colville Reservation v. State of Washington,\n\n446 F. Supp. 1339 (E.D. Wash. 1978), (quoting First Agric. Bank v.\n\nTax Comm'n, 392 U.S. 339, 347 (1968), aff'd in part, reversed in\n\npart, 447 U.S. 134, 151 (1980)).       Rather, in cases where courts\n\nmust determine whether the legal incidence of a tax falls on an\n\nIndian tribe, courts apply federal law.      See, e.g., Sac and Fox\n\nNation v. Pierce, 213 F.3d 566, 578 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"For our\n\npurposes, the question of where the legal incidence of the Kansas\n\nmotor fuel tax rests is one of federal law.\"); see also United\n\nStates v. Mississippi Tax Comm'n, 421 U.S. 599, 609 n.7 (1974)).\n\n          The Narragansett Tribe argues that the district court\n\nshould not have applied federal law. Citing Kern-Limerick, Inc. v.\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fScurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the seminal Supreme Court case\n\nunderpinning Gurley and other tax incidence cases, the Tribe notes\n\nthat the Supreme Court instructs federal courts to defer to state\n\ncourts on questions of where the incidence of a state tax falls,\n\nunless the case involves \"federal constitutional issues.\"                  Id. at\n\n121.     The Tribe asserts that the \"federal immunity\" at issue in\n\nKern-Limerick does not encompass tribal immunity because, the Tribe\n\nargues,    tribal    sovereignty     does     not   arise    under    federal     or\n\nconstitutional law, but rather from the inherent sovereignty of the\n\nTribe.    The Narragansetts point to United States v. Lara, 541 U.S.\n\n193 (2004), as confirming that tribal sovereignty does not arise\n\nunder the Constitution or federal law.                 Lara involves a double\n\njeopardy claim brought in light of recent congressional legislation\n\nthat authorizes Indian tribes to prosecute members of other Indian\n\ntribes.    The resolution of this claim hinged on whether there was\n\ndual sovereignty, leading the Lara court to consider whether the\n\nsource of    the     power   to   punish    nonmember    Indian      offenders    is\n\n\"inherent tribal sovereignty\" or delegated federal authority.                    Id.\n\nat 1632.    The Supreme Court determined that \"Congress intended the\n\nformer\"    because    \"the   statute    says    that    it   'recognize[s]       and\n\naffirm[s]' in each tribe the 'inherent' tribal power (not delegated\n\nfederal power) to prosecute nonmember Indians for misdemeanors\" and\n\nbecause \"the statute's legislative history confirms that such was\n\nCongress' intent.\"      Id. at 1632-33.       Based on this logic, the Tribe\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fasserts   that   federal    courts    must    look   first   to    an   existing\n\ninterpretation of state law by the state's highest court in cases\n\nsuch as the instant case.\n\n           The Tribe, however, ignores Supreme Court precedent to\n\nthe contrary.      For     example,   in     Kiowa   Tribe v.     Manufacturing\n\nTechnologies, Inc., the Supreme Court stated that \"[l]ike foreign\n\nsovereign immunity, tribal immunity is a matter of federal law.\"\n\n523 U.S. 751, 759 (1998).         The Tribe also ignores the Supreme\n\nCourt's precedent where the Court accepted a district court's use\n\nof federal law in determining whether the legal incidence of the\n\nWashington tax fell on the Indian tribe over the state court's\n\ninterpretations. See Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville\n\nIndian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 142 (1980); California State Bd.\n\nof Equalization et al. v. Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, 474 U.S. 9, 11\n\n(1985)(explicitly reiterating that the Court accepted the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the legal incidence of Washington state's\n\ncigarette tax fell on purchasers).           In addition, other courts have\n\nconsistently applied federal law in deciding whether the legal\n\nincidence of a state tax falls on a sovereign Indian tribe.                 See,\n\ne.g., Sac and Fox Nation, 213 F.3d at 578 (noting that \"the\n\nquestion of where the legal incidence of the Kansas motor fuel tax\n\nrests is one of federal law\" in a case regarding whether the State\n\nof Kansas could impose its tax on fuel distributed to tribally\n\nowned and operated retail stations located on Indian lands within\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthe State) (citing United States v. Mississippi Tax Comm'n, 421\n\nU.S. 599, 609 n. 7 (1975)); Kern-Limerick, 347 U.S. at 121-22;\n\nCoeur D'Alene Tribe v. Hammond, 384 F.3d 674, 681 (9th Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"The incidence of a state tax on a sovereign Indian nation\n\ninescapably   is   a   question   of   federal   law   that   cannot   be\n\nconclusively resolved in and of itself by the state legislature's\n\nmere statement.\").\n\n          Even if we were to consider the Rhode Island Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Daniels, it is not outcome determinative.\n\nDaniels predates the Supreme Court decisions, such as Moe, 425 U.S.\n\nat 482, that held that pass through tax provisions are dispositive\n\nas to who bears the legal incidence of a tax.      In Moe, the Supreme\n\nCourt evaluated a Montana tax statute that provided that the tax\n\n\"shall be conclusively presumed to be [a] direct [tax] on the\n\nretail consumer precollected for the purpose of convenience and\n\nfacility only.\"    Id. (quoting Mont. Rev. Code Ann. § 84-5606(1)\n\n(1947)). The Supreme Court determined that \"to the extent that the\n\n'smoke shops' sell to those upon whom the State has validly imposed\n\na sales or excise tax . . . the State may require the Indian\n\nproprietor simply to add the tax to the sales price and thereby aid\n\nthe State's enforcement and collection thereof.\"       Id.    The Supreme\n\nCourt has repeatedly affirmed that cigarette tax schemes containing\n\npass through provisions place the legal incidence of the tax on the\n\nconsumer rather than the distributor.      See Chickasaw, 515 U.S. at\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f461; Milhelm Attea, 512 U.S. at 64; Chemehuevi, 474 U.S. at 11;\n\nColville 447 U.S. at 159.        Therefore, the holding of Daniels does\n\nnot persuade us that the incidence of the Rhode Island cigarette\n\ntax falls on the Narragansetts.\n\n               It is not required that the law expressly state that the\n\ntax must be passed on to the ultimate purchaser for a State to\n\nrequire    a    tribe   to   collect    cigarette    taxes   from   non-Indian\n\npurchasers and remit it to the State.           Chemehuevi, 474 U.S. at 11.\n\nThe Supreme Court has instructed that the test we should apply in\n\ndetermining whether the incidence of a state tax falls on an Indian\n\ntribe is to make \"a fair interpretation of the taxing statute as\n\nwritten and applied.\"         Id.      In this case, the Rhode Island tax\n\nstatute     explicitly       states     that   the   cigarette      taxes   are\n\n\"conclusively presumed to be a direct tax upon the retail consumer,\n\nprecollected for the purpose of convenience and facility only.\"\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-53.             As the Supreme Court held in Moe,\n\n\"[t]he State's requirement that the Indian tribal seller collect a\n\ntax validly imposed on non-Indians is a minimal burden designed to\n\navoid the likelihood that in its absence non-Indians purchasing\n\nfrom the tribal seller will avoid payment of a concededly lawful\n\ntax.\"     Moe, 425 U.S. at 483.          We therefore find that the legal\n\nincidence of the Rhode Island cigarette tax falls on the consumer,\n\nnot the Narragansett Tribe, and we find that the State may require\n\nthe Tribe to comply with the cigarette tax in order for the State\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fto collect the cigarette taxes that are passed on to the Tribe's\n\nnon-Indian consumers.\n\nC.   Unanswered Questions\n\n           The State posits that it has raised two independently\n\nsufficient grounds on which we might affirm the district court's\n\njudgment, even if the legal incidence of the tax is found to fall\n\non the Tribe.   Since we find that the legal incidence of the tax\n\ndoes not fall on the Narragansett Tribe, we find it unnecessary and\n\ninappropriate to decide these questions.   The grounds put forth by\n\nthe State are (1) that the settlement lands are not \"Indian\n\ncountry,\"3 and (2) that direct taxation of the Tribe by the State\n\nis allowed pursuant to both section 1708 of the Settlement Act, 25\n\n\n3\n   Indian country is usually \"the benchmark for approaching the\nallocation of federal, tribal, and state authority with respect to\nIndians and Indian lands.\" Narragansett Indian Tribe of R.I. v.\nNarragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d 908, 915 (1996) (quoting Indian\nCountry, U.S.A. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 829 F.2d 967, 973 (10th\nCir. 1987)). Indian country is defined by Congress as including:\n\n           (a) all land within the limits of any Indian\n           reservation under the jurisdiction of the\n           United States Government, . . . (b) all\n           dependent  Indian   communities  within   the\n           borders of the United States whether within\n           the   original   or   subsequently   acquired\n           territory thereof, and whether within or\n           without the limits of a state, and (c) all\n           Indian allotments . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1151; see Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d at 915. The\nSupreme Court has repeatedly applied this definition to issues of\nboth criminal and civil jurisdiction.       Id. at 915; (quoting\nCalifornia v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. 202, 208\n(1987)).\n\n                               -19-\n\fU.S.C.    §   1708(a),   and   the   Tribe's      consent,4   implicit   in   its\n\nagreement to subject the settlement lands to the \"full force and\n\neffect\" of \"all laws of the State of Rhode Island,\" in the Joint\n\nMemorandum of Understanding between the Narragansett Tribe and the\n\nState of Rhode Island, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1453, at 26, reprinted in\n\n1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1948, 1964.\n\n              The Narragansetts, on the other hand, want us to declare\n\nthat the settlement lands are Indian country and that the State\n\ndoes not have authority to tax the Tribe directly because Congress\n\ndid not expressly and unequivocally consent to state taxation of\n\nthe Narragansett Tribe.        McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 177-78 (laying to\n\nrest any doubt that taxation of Indian reservation lands or Indian\n\nincome    from   activities     carried      on   within   the   boundaries   of\n\nreservation lands is not permissible absent unmistakably clear\n\ncongressional consent); see also Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471\n\nU.S. 479, 765 (1985); Brian v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373, 376\n\n(1976).\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Congress has granted the consent of the United States to States\nwishing to assume criminal and civil jurisdiction over reservation\nIndians, 25 U.S.C. § 1322(a), and 25 U.S.C. § 1324 confers upon the\nStates the right to disregard enabling acts which limit their\nauthority over such Indians. However, \"the Act expressly provides\nthat the State must act 'with the consent of the tribe occupying\nthe particular Indian country,' 25 U.S.C. § 1322(a), and must\n'appropriately (amend its) constitution or statutes.' 25 U.S.C.\n§ 1324.\" McClanahan v. State Tax Comm'n of Arizona, 411 U.S. 164,\n177-78 (1973).\n\n                                      -20-\n\f          We find it unnecessary and inappropriate to decide these\n\nquestions today.    Because we affirm the district court's holding\n\nthat the legal incidence of Rhode Island's cigarette tax falls on\n\nthe consumer and not the tribal distributor, it is unnecessary for\n\nus to consider whether the tax would be valid if it were a direct\n\ntax on the Tribe.\n\nD.   Sovereign immunity and the State's enforcement of its laws on\n     the Tribe's settlement lands\n\n\n           The Narragansetts claim that the State of Rhode Island\n\nexceeded its authority in enforcing its cigarette laws against the\n\ngovernment of the Narragansett Indian Tribe and that the State\n\nthereby violated the Tribe's sovereign immunity. The State argues,\n\nconversely, that since the State's civil and criminal laws and\n\njurisdiction apply to the settlement lands pursuant to 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708, the State has concomitant ability to enforce its laws\n\nthere, including those governing the sale of cigarettes. The State\n\nalso argues that the Tribe's sovereign immunity was abrogated by\n\nsection 1708, and therefore tribal sovereign immunity does not bar\n\nthe State's enforcement of its laws on the settlement lands.\n\n           The Tribe asks us to consider six distinct questions\n\nregarding the enforcement of Rhode Island's cigarette laws on the\n\nsettlement lands, including (1) whether the State may invoke its\n\njurisdiction over the settlement lands to enforce its cigarette tax\n\non the government of the Narragansett Indian Tribe (a Land/Tribe\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fdistinction); (2) whether the State may issue and serve a search\n\nwarrant for property of the tribal government; (3) whether the\n\nState may enter tribal lands to serve a warrant; (4) whether the\n\nState may confiscate Tribal government property while on the\n\nsettlement lands; (5) whether the State can require the Tribe to\n\npurchase a license; and (6) whether the State was bound to use less\n\nintrusive means in order to enforce the cigarette tax.\n\n             We have determined that, since the legal incidence of\n\nRhode Island's cigarette tax falls on the consumer, rather than the\n\ntribal distributor, the Narragansetts are obligated to comply with\n\nthe State's cigarette tax laws as they pertain to cigarettes sold\n\nto   non-Indian    consumers.      Therefore,      by   selling   unstamped\n\ncigarettes    to   non-Indian   consumers,   the   Smoke   Shop   operators\n\nviolated Rhode Island tax law, which is a criminal offense.            This\n\nbrings us to the questions regarding what measures the State may\n\ntake to enforce its cigarette tax laws.\n\n             Drawing the line between the sovereign rights of the\n\nNarragansett Tribe and the State of Rhode Island is complicated by\n\nthe Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, which provides for\n\nthe continued applicability of Rhode Island's civil and criminal\n\nlaws and jurisdiction over the settlement lands.            See 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708(a).    This is an ongoing and overarching question which has\n\nvexed the State and Tribe over the years as various issues have\n\narisen.   As we have stated before, all of the relevant questions\n\n                                   -22-\n\fcannot be answered by an all-encompassing solution. State of Rhode\n\nIsland v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 695 (1994).\n\n          1. Whether 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a) abrogates the Tribe's\n          Sovereign Immunity on the Settlement Lands\n\n\n          \"Indian tribes have long been recognized as possessing\n\nthe   common-law    immunity   from   suit    traditionally     enjoyed   by\n\nsovereign powers.\" Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martínez, 436 U.S. 49, 58\n\n(1978) (citations omitted); see also Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen\n\nBand Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, 498 U.S. 505, 508 (1991);\n\nBottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, 599 F.2d 1061, 1066 (1st Cir.\n\n1979).    This aspect of tribal sovereignty is subject to the\n\n\"superior and plenary control of Congress.\"           Santa Clara Pueblo,\n\n436 U.S. at 58.       Absent a clear, express waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity by Congress or the Tribe, suits against Indian tribes are\n\ngenerally barred.    Kiowa, 523 U.S. at 755.\n\n          The Narragansett Tribe argues that its sovereign immunity\n\nis a complete defense to the State's enforcement of its cigarette\n\nlaws against the Tribe.        The State responds that Congress, by\n\ngranting jurisdiction to the state in 25 U.S.C. § 1708, abrogated\n\nthe Tribe's   sovereign   immunity     on    the   settlement   lands.    In\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 701, we stated that \"the\n\ngrant of jurisdictional power to the state in the Settlement Act is\n\nvalid and rather broad . . . .\"       We agree with the State that this\n\ngrant of jurisdictional power, in addition to the applicability of\n\n                                  -23-\n\fthe State's civil and criminal laws, provides the State with the\n\nright, and to some extent the means, to enforce these laws on the\n\nsettlement lands.\n\n          However, this does not mean that we agree with the State\n\nthat Section 1708(a) abrogates the Tribe's sovereign immunity\n\naltogether.     On the contrary, we have recognized and enforced the\n\nTribe's   sovereign      immunity    in     the   past.      See    Maynard     v.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 984 F.2d 14, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1993). The\n\nState suggests that Maynard stands only for the proposition that\n\nCongress did not abrogate sovereign immunity for tribal conduct\n\noutside the settlement lands.         We disagree.        There is nothing in\n\nour analysis of the Settlement Act in that case which suggests that\n\nwe have drawn a distinction based on where tribal activities occur.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Section 1708 does not expressly\n\naddress   the    issue   of   sovereign      immunity,     and     it   would   be\n\ninappropriate for us to infer that the congressional grant of\n\njurisdiction to the State acts as a wholesale abrogation of the\n\nTribe's sovereign immunity.         It is well settled that \"statutes are\n\nto be construed liberally in favor of the Indians with ambiguous\n\nprovisions interpreted to their benefit.\"                 Chickasaw Nation v.\n\nUnited States, 534 U.S. 84, 93-94 (2001).           In fact, the language of\n\nSection 1708 does not purport to waive any of the Tribe's rights.\n\n          [T]he mere fact that the Settlement Act cedes\n          power to the state does not necessarily mean\n          . . . that the Tribe lacks similar power and,\n\n                                     -24-\n\f            thus, lacks 'jurisdiction' over the settlement\n            lands. Although the grant of jurisdictional\n            power to the state in the Settlement Act is\n            valid and rather broad, . . . we do not\n            believe that it is exclusive.          To the\n            contrary, we rule that the Tribe retains\n            concurrent jurisdiction over the settlement\n            lands . . . .\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 701.            The Tribe, therefore,\n\nretains its sovereign immunity despite the grant of jurisdiction to\n\nthe State in Section 1708(a).\n\n            The   Tribe's    immunity   does   not,    however,    provide   a\n\ncomplete defense to the enforcement of State laws.            There remains\n\na question of the extent to which the State may encroach upon the\n\nTribe's settlement lands to enforce its criminal laws.                Neither\n\nthis Court, nor the Supreme Court, has issued definitive guidance\n\non this question.\n\n            2. Whether the State may invoke its jurisdiction over\n            the settlement lands to enforce its cigarette tax\n\n\n            The district court considered the holdings of Nevada v.\n\nHicks, 533 U.S. 353 (2001), and Colville \"in conjunction with the\n\nconferral   of    criminal   and   civil   (which     includes    regulatory)\n\njurisdiction contained in section 1708,\" and found it to be \"beyond\n\ndoubt that criminal law enforcement, including the seizure of\n\ncontraband, on the Settlement Lands is permissible.\"             Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 171.          In Hicks and Colville, the\n\nSupreme Court discusses some allowable enforcement by a state\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fconcerning activities by an Indian tribe which has sovereignty and\n\ndoes not necessarily share jurisdiction over its tribal lands with\n\nthe State.   The Hicks Court recognized that \"the principle that\n\nIndians have the right to make their own laws and be governed by\n\nthem requires 'an accommodation between the interests of the Tribes\n\nand the Federal Government, on the one hand, and those of the\n\nState, on the other.'\"   Hicks, 533 U.S. at 362 (citing Colville,\n\n447 U.S. at 156).   The Court offered the following guidance:\n\n          When on-reservation conduct involving only\n          Indians is at issue, state law is generally\n          inapplicable, for the State's regulatory\n          interest is likely to be minimal and the\n          federal interest in encouraging tribal self-\n          government is at its strongest.           When,\n          however,    state   interests    outside    the\n          reservation    are  implicated,    States   may\n          regulate the activities even of tribe members\n          on tribal land, as exemplified by our decision\n          in [Colville]. . . . It is also well\n          established in our precedent that States have\n          criminal jurisdiction over reservation Indians\n          for   crimes   committed  .   .   .   off   the\n          reservation. While it is not entirely clear\n          from our precedent whether the last mentioned\n          authority entails the corollary right to enter\n          a reservation (including Indian-fee lands) for\n          enforcement purposes, several of our opinions\n          point in that direction.    In [Colville], we\n          explicitly reserved the question whether state\n          officials could seize cigarettes held for sale\n          to nonmembers in order to recover the taxes\n          due.\n\nHicks, 533 U.S. at 362-63 (2001) (citations omitted).   Taking the\n\nSupreme Court's discussion of the enforcement issue in Hicks and\n\nColville, together with Congress' grant of State jurisdiction over\n\n\n                               -26-\n\fthe settlement lands, the district court concluded that Rhode\n\nIsland may enforce its criminal laws on the settlement lands,\n\nincluding the seizure of contraband.\n\n            The Narragansett Tribe argues that the district court\n\ncame to the wrong conclusion for several reasons. First, the Tribe\n\nasserts that its sovereign immunity is a complete defense to\n\nenforcement of the State's laws on the settlement lands. The Tribe\n\nrelies heavily on a Ninth Circuit decision, Bishop Paiute Tribe v.\n\nCounty of Inyo, for the argument that even where Congress has\n\nexpressly authorized a state to enforce its criminal laws, a\n\ntribe's sovereign immunity bars service of a search warrant against\n\nthe tribe itself.    291 F.3d 549, 567 n.6 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he\n\nsearch warrant was executed against the tribes in order to obtain\n\ninformation as part of a criminal investigation against individual\n\nIndians . . . . [T]he officers had authority to enforce criminal\n\nlaw against individual Indians under Public Law 280, but did not\n\nhave authority to enforce those criminal laws against tribes as\n\nsovereign   entities.\").    However,   this   decision   is   not   valid\n\nprecedent, as the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the decision,\n\nstating:\n\n            The Tribe has not explained, and the trial and\n            appellate courts have not clearly decided,\n            what prescription of federal common law, if\n            any, enables the Tribe to maintain an action\n            for   declaratory  relief   establishing   its\n            sovereign right to be free from state criminal\n            processes.   This case is therefore remanded\n\n                                -27-\n\f           for focused consideration and resolution of\n           that jurisdictional question.\n\nInyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone Indians, 538 U.S. 701, 702 (2003).\n\n           Second, the Narragansetts argue that we should not rest\n\nour decision on Colville, because the Supreme Court did not decide\n\nthe question of state encroachment onto tribal lands to seize\n\ncigarettes in that case.        The Court refused to express an opinion\n\non the question of whether the state may enter onto a reservation\n\nand seize stocks of cigarettes which are intended for sale to non-\n\nIndian purchasers.      Colville, 447 U.S. at 162.\n\n           The Court did, however, determine that the State of\n\nWashington's interest in enforcing its valid taxes was sufficient\n\nto   justify    seizures   of   shipments     of   unstamped    cigarettes    as\n\ncontraband      while   they    were    in    transit,   traveling      to   the\n\nreservations.     Id. at 161.    \"By seizing cigarettes en route to the\n\nreservation, the State polices against wholesale evasion of its own\n\nvalid   taxes    without   unnecessarily       intruding   on    core    tribal\n\ninterests.\"     Id. at 162.\n\n             Unlike the State of Washington in Colville, Congress\n\nprovided Rhode Island with civil and criminal jurisdiction on the\n\nNarragansetts' settlement lands. 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a). In light of\n\nthis authority and the precedent set in Colville, we find that the\n\nState of Rhode Island may have the power to enter onto the\n\nsettlement lands and seize unstamped cigarettes as contraband, from\n\n                                       -28-\n\fthe Indian distributor, provided that the action does not violate\n\nthe Tribe's sovereign immunity.\n\n          3.    The \"Land\"/\"Tribe\" Distinction\n\n          The Tribe contends that a distinction should be made\n\nbetween the jurisdiction the State was given over the settlement\n\nlands and any power the State might have over the Tribe itself.\n\nThe Tribe argues that the grant of jurisdiction that Congress gave\n\nto the State of Rhode Island merely subjected \"the settlement lands\n\n. . . to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the\n\nState,\"   25   U.S.C.   §   1708(a),       not   the    Narragansett    Tribal\n\ngovernment.    The Tribe asserts that Congress intentionally limited\n\nthis jurisdiction to the settlement lands, and that it knew how to\n\nwrite the Act to cover the Tribe as well if it had so intended.\n\nSee, e.g., Maine Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1725 (expressly\n\nproviding the State with jurisdiction over \"all Indians, Indian\n\nnations, or tribes or bands of Indians in the State of Maine . . .\n\nand any lands or other natural resources owned by any such Indian,\n\nIndian Nation, tribe or band of Indians, and any lands held in\n\ntrust by the United States for any such Indian\").\n\n          In   ascertaining   the    intent      of    Congress   in   statutes\n\nregulating Indian tribes, we must read the statutes against a\n\nbackdrop of Indian sovereignty.       Colville, 447 U.S. at 178 (citing\n\nMcClanahan, 411 U.S. at 172). \"[T]he [Supreme] Court has held that\n\nretained sovereignty includes the power of Indians to make and\n\n                                    -29-\n\fenforce their own substantive law in internal matters, including\n\nmatters such as membership rules, inheritance rules, and the\n\nregulation of domestic relations.\"        Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19\n\nF.3d at 701 (citing Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56).\n\n            Congress did not expressly give the State jurisdiction\n\nover the Narragansett Tribe in Section 1708.        While we have said\n\nthat the grant of jurisdictional power to the State is broad, we\n\nhave also found that \"the Tribe retains concurrent jurisdiction\n\nover the settlement lands,\" Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at\n\n701, and that \"any effort by the state to exercise [its] authority\n\nis hedged in by . . . the Tribe's retained rights of sovereignty\n\n. . .\"   Id. at 705.   Therefore, as the district court stated, \"when\n\nthe Tribe acts 'qua Tribe,' that is, as the political entity\n\nresponsible for governing the Narragansetts, it is not subject to\n\nthe State's civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction.\"\n\n            The Tribe asserts that the opening and operation of the\n\nSmoke Shop was a tribal government activity.        The Narragansetts'\n\nSmoke Shop was opened pursuant to a resolution passed by the\n\nNarragansett Tribal Council with the stated purpose of providing\n\neconomic development for the Tribal Nation.       The Tribe, therefore,\n\nasserts that sovereign immunity precludes the State of Rhode Island\n\nfrom entering the settlement lands, serving a warrant on the tribal\n\nactivity,     and   confiscating    tribal    government   property   as\n\ncontraband.\n\n                                   -30-\n\f          While   retained   tribal    sovereignty   has   never   been\n\nprecisely defined, the Supreme Court has offered the following\n\ndescription:\n\n          Indian tribes are \"distinct, independent\n          political    communities,   retaining    their\n          original natural rights\" in matters of local\n          self-government. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet.\n          515, 559, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832) . . . Although no\n          longer \"possessed of the full attributes of\n          sovereignty,\" they remain a \"separate people,\n          with the power of regulating their internal\n          and social relations.\" United States v.\n          Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 381-382, 6 S.Ct. 1109,\n          1112-1113, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886). See United\n          States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 98 S.Ct.\n          1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978). They have power\n          to make their own substantive law in internal\n          matters, see Roff v. Burney, 168 U.S. 218, 18\n          S.Ct. 60, 42 L.Ed. 442 (1897) (membership);\n          Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1, 29, 20 S.Ct. 1,\n          12, 44 L.Ed. 49 (1899) (inheritance rules);\n          United States v. Quiver, 241 U.S. 602, 36\n          S.Ct. 699, 60 L.Ed. 1176 (1916) (domestic\n          relations), and to enforce that law in their\n          own forums, see, e.g., Williams v. Lee, 358\n          U.S. 217, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959).\n\nSanta Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 55-56.\n\n          Precedent dictates that the determination of whether the\n\nTribe's retained rights of sovereignty or the State's residual\n\nauthority takes precedence should involve an interest balancing\n\ntest that \"[t]est[s] the sturdiness\" of the barriers each presents\n\nand makes a \"particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,\n\nfederal, and tribal interests at stake.\"         Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe, 19 F.3d at 705 (quoting White Mountain Apache Tribe v.\n\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fBracker, 448 U.S. 136, 145 (1980)).5    In this case, we must balance\n\nthe State's interest in enforcing its cigarette laws with the\n\nTribe's sovereignty interests and related interests in tribal\n\neconomic development and self-governance. As we stated previously,\n\nthe precedent set in Moe and other cigarette tax cases involving\n\nIndian tribes is that Indian retailers on an Indian reservation may\n\nbe required to collect the state cigarette taxes applicable to\n\nsales to non-Indians because the minimal burden imposed by this\n\nrequirement is justified by the State's interest in assuring the\n\npayment of these lawful taxes.\n\n          The district court applied the test this Court used in\n\nAkins v. Penobscot Nation, 130 F.3d 482 (1st Cir. 1997), to\n\ndetermine whether the Tribe's operation of the Smoke Shop should be\n\nincluded in the Tribe's retained right of sovereignty.         In so\n\ndoing, the district court tightly confined the meaning of sovereign\n\nimmunity to apply only when the Tribe acts in \"matters of local\n\ngovernance.\" Narragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 175-77.\n\nWe find it inappropriate to apply the Akins test in this instance.\n\n\n\n\n5\n    We recognize that the Supreme Court has recently granted\ncertiorari for a question regarding whether the Court should\nabandon the White Mountain Apache interest-balancing test in favor\nof a preemption analysis based on the principle that Indian\nimmunities are dependent upon congressional intent. Prairie Band\nPotawatomi Nation v. Richards, 379 F.3d 979 (10th Cir. 2004), cert.\ngranted, 73 U.S.L.W. 3513 (U.S. Feb. 28, 2005) (No. 04-631).\n\n                                 -32-\n\f            In    Akins,   we    established       a    multi-factor            test    for\n\ndetermining      whether   a    policy    or    activity      is,   or     is    not,    an\n\n\"internal tribal matter,\" as that term was used in the Maine state\n\nlegislation implementing the federal Maine Indian Claims Settlement\n\nAct of 1980, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1725-1735 (\"Maine Settlement Act\").                            The\n\nMaine Implementing Act makes the Penobscot Nation subject \"to all\n\nthe   duties,     obligations,      liabilities         and    limitations         of     a\n\nmunicipality . . . provided, however, that internal tribal matters\n\n. . . shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\"                         Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 30, § 6206(1) (emphasis added).\n\n            While Rhode Island and Maine are similar to the extent\n\nthat each state has reached a settlement with its Indian tribes\n\nwhich has been enacted by Congress, the provisions of the Maine\n\nSettlement Act and Implementing Act are very different from the\n\nRhode Island Settlement Act, which did not limit the jurisdiction\n\nof the Narragansett Tribe, but rather provided the State with\n\nconcurrent jurisdiction.         In Akins, we repeatedly warned that our\n\nanalysis was unique to Maine because of the Maine Settlement Act\n\nand   the   State's    Implementing       Act.     130     F.3d     482,    484        (\"The\n\nstructure of analysis differs here from that which would be used in\n\nclaims against the vast majority of other Indian tribes in the\n\ncountry.\"). We will not require the Narragansett Tribe to meet the\n\n\"internal     tribal    matter\"     exception          provided     in      the        Maine\n\n\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fImplementing Act when Congress did not place a similar limitation\n\non the Narragansetts.\n\n           This is not to say that many of the Akins factors are not\n\ngenerally applicable. Nor do we disagree with the district court's\n\nconclusion that the Tribe's retained right of sovereignty will not\n\nshield the Tribe's unlawful operation of a Smoke Shop that offers\n\nnon-Indian consumers a means to bypass the State's cigarette tax\n\nwhich   would    not   otherwise    be   available    to   them   off   of   the\n\nsettlement lands.\n\n           4.   The State's enforcement of its laws against the\n           Narragansett Tribe\n\n\n           The next question concerns the extent to which the State\n\nmay enforce its cigarette laws directly against the Narragansett\n\nTribal government.      We find that it is worthwhile to consider the\n\nfact that the Narragansett Tribe's sovereign immunity has not been\n\nabrogated and that there exist means by which the State could have\n\nenforced   its    cigarette   tax   laws    which    would   have   been     more\n\nrespectful of the Tribe's sovereignty.\n\n           The doctrine of tribal immunity is settled law today.\n\nThe Supreme Court has refused to abandon or narrow this doctrine\n\ndespite arguments that tribal businesses have become far removed\n\nfrom tribal self-governance and internal affairs.             See Kiowa, 523\n\nU.S. at 757.     The Court stated that it \"retained the doctrine . . .\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fon the theory that Congress had failed to abrogate it in order to\n\npromote economic development and tribal self-sufficiency.\"             Id.\n\n           For example, in Potawatomi, the Supreme Court \"reaffirmed\n\nthat while Oklahoma may tax cigarette sales by a Tribe's store to\n\nnonmembers, the Tribe enjoys immunity from a suit to collect unpaid\n\ntaxes.\"   Kiowa, 523 U.S. at 755 (citing Potawatomi, 498 U.S. at\n\n510).     \"There   is   a   difference    between   the   right   to   demand\n\ncompliance with state laws and the means available to enforce\n\nthem.\" Id. (citing Potawatomi, 498 U.S. at 514 (\"There is no doubt\n\nthat sovereign immunity bars the State from pursuing the most\n\nefficient remedy, but we are not persuaded that it lacks any\n\nadequate alternatives.\")).      Some of the alternatives referenced in\n\nPotawatomi include holding individual agents or officers of the\n\ntribe liable for damages in actions brought by the State, see Ex\n\nparte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), collecting the sales tax from\n\ncigarette wholesalers, either by seizing unstamped cigarettes off\n\nthe reservation, Colville, 447 U.S. at 161-162, or assessing\n\nwholesalers who supplied unstamped cigarettes to the tribal stores,\n\nCity Vending of Muskogee, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 898 F.2d 122\n\n(10th Cir. 1990).       Another option is that the State might enter\n\ninto an agreement with the Tribe to adopt a mutually satisfactory\n\nregime for the collection of its cigarette tax.\n\n           Today we have held that the State's cigarette tax laws\n\nare applicable to sales to non-Indian customers on the settlement\n\n                                   -35-\n\flands. The State of Rhode Island has numerous alternatives that it\n\nmay use to enforce its cigarette tax on the settlement lands\n\nwithout violating the Tribe's sovereign immunity.           The State's\n\nhands will not be completely tied while the Tribe continues to\n\noperate its Smoke Shop in violation of the State's cigarette laws.\n\nAlthough the operation of the Smoke Shop without complying with\n\nRhode Island's cigarette tax laws is certainly not a sovereign\n\nright retained by the Narragansett Tribe, the Tribe does have a\n\nright of sovereign immunity that should be respected the State.\n\nFor these reasons, we hold that the State violated the Tribe's\n\nsovereign rights when it enforced the criminal provisions of its\n\ncigarette tax laws by executing a search warrant against the Tribal\n\ngovernment's Smoke Shop, forcibly entering the Shop and seizing the\n\nTribe's   stock   of   unstamped   cigarettes,   and   arresting   tribal\n\nofficials who were acting in their official capacity.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment for the State is affirmed in part and, to the\n\nextent that the district court's declaratory judgment regarding the\n\nState's enforcement of its criminal statutes against the Tribal\n\ngovernment is inconsistent with our holdings, reversed in part.\n\n           Affirmed in part, Reversed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\f",

On July 14, 2003, Rhode Island\n\nState Police executed a search warrant and confiscated inventory at\n\na smoke shop (\"the Smoke Shop\") located on Narragansett tribal\n\nland.   An altercation ensued between members of the Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe (\"the Tribe\" or \"the Narragansetts\") and several State\n\npolice officers, resulting in the arrest of eight tribal members,\n\nincluding the Chief Sachem of the Tribe.\n\n          Following this incident, both the Narragansetts and the\n\nState of Rhode Island filed suits disputing the issue of whether\n\nthe Tribe's operation of a smoke shop and sale of cigarettes on the\n\nTribe's settlement lands are exempt from the application and\n\nenforcement of Rhode Island's cigarette tax laws.        The State\n\ninitially filed its complaint in Rhode Island state court and the\n\nNarragansetts removed the case to federal district court in an\n\nattempt to have it decided together with the Tribe's complaint,\n\nwhich was brought in federal district court.

The Rhode Island Cigarette Tax Scheme\n\n           The sale of cigarettes in Rhode Island is governed by a\n\nnumber of statutory requirements, including taxation provisions.\n\nSee R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 44-20-1 to 44-20-55.   The State's cigarette\n\ntax scheme imposes the following requirements:\n\n                 Every person engaged in the sale of\n          cigarettes in Rhode Island must first obtain a\n          license from the State Tax Administrator.\n          R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-2. In addition to this\n          licensing requirement, Rhode Island imposes an\n          excise tax on cigarettes sold, distributed,\n          held, or consumed within its borders.     R.I.\n          Gen. Laws § 44-20-12.    The tax is collected\n          through the sale of cigarette stamps, which\n          must be affixed to all packages of cigarettes\n          possessed within the State (with limited\n          exceptions). R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-13, 44-\n          20-18, 44-20-30.   State law also requires a\n          retailer to add a sales tax to the sale price\n          of the cigarettes. R.I. Gen.

The excise tax requires that distributors\n\n           affix tax stamps in the proper denominations\n           at the location where their license is issued.\n           The stamps may be affixed to a distributor's\n           cigarettes at any time before transferring the\n           possession of the cigarettes. R.I. Gen. Laws\n           § 44-20-28. When a dealer receives unstamped\n           cigarettes, he or she must affix stamps within\n           twenty-four hours after coming into possession\n           of the cigarettes. R.I. Gen.

The Dispute\n\n             On July 1, 2003, the Narragansett Indian Tribe's Tribal\n\nCouncil passed a resolution authorizing the opening of a tribally\n\nowned Smoke Shop to sell cigarettes. The Tribe stipulated that the\n\npurpose of opening the Smoke Shop was to provide a means for\n\neconomic development for the Tribal Nation.                The Tribe imported\n\nunstamped     cigarettes    from    other    states    and     stored   them       in\n\nanticipation of the Smoke Shop's opening.             The Smoke Shop, which\n\nopened on July 12, 2003, was located entirely within the Tribe's\n\nsettlement lands.        The Shop offered unstamped, untaxed cigarettes\n\nfor sale to both tribal and non-tribal members without collecting\n\nRhode Island's seven percent retail sales tax from any of its\n\ncustomers.      As   stipulated     before   the     court   below,     \"a    large\n\nproportion of the Shop's customers were not members of the Tribe.\"\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fNarragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 158 (referencing the\n\nJoint Stipulations of the parties).\n\n           The day the Smoke Shop opened, the Rhode Island State\n\nPolice sought a search warrant to search the Smoke Shop for alleged\n\nviolations of Rhode Island's cigarette tax laws, specifically, the\n\npossession and sale of unstamped cigarettes, which is a misdemeanor\n\noffense. See R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 44-20-35, 44-20-36; see also id. at\n\n§§ 44-20-37, 44-20-38 (allowing for the seizure of such cigarettes\n\nas contraband).      The State of Rhode Island District Court issued\n\nthe requested warrant to search the Smoke Shop that same day.               On\n\nJuly 14, 2003, Rhode Island State Police entered the Narragansett\n\nTribe's settlement lands and executed the search warrant on the\n\nChief Sachem of the Narragansett Indian Tribe.             The State Police\n\nconfiscated the Tribe's inventory of unstamped cigarettes as well\n\nas various documents and monies. An altercation ensued between the\n\nState Police and some tribal members, resulting in the arrest of\n\nthe Chief Sachem and seven other tribal members.\n\n           Both the Narragansetts and the State brought suit over\n\nthis incident.      The district court found that it had jurisdiction\n\nover the Tribe's case, which was originally brought in federal\n\ndistrict   court.      See   28   U.S.C.   §   1362   (providing   that   \"The\n\n[federal] district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all\n\ncivil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing\n\nbody duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the\n\n                                     -7-\n\fmatter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or\n\ntreaties of the United States.\").                However, the district court\n\nfound that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the\n\nState's action, which was originally brought in Rhode Island State\n\nSuperior Court and later removed to the federal district court by\n\nthe Tribe.     The State had brought its action pursuant to Rhode\n\nIsland law seeking a declaration that the Tribe's failure to comply\n\nwith Rhode Island's cigarette sales and excise tax scheme was\n\nunlawful.    The district court therefore remanded the State's suit\n\nback to the Washington County Superior Court, but determined that\n\nit would \"treat the State's motion for summary Judgment in the\n\nState's case as a motion for summary judgment in the Tribe's\n\naction.\"    Narragansett Indian Tribe, 296 F.

Even had it\n\nbeen preemptively included and argued against in the State's\n\ncomplaint,   it    would   not   have    given   rise   to    federal   question\n\njurisdiction      over   the   State's    complaint.         See   Louisville   &\n\nNashville R.R., 211 U.S. at 152 (holding that the federal court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction under § 1331 because the federal\n\nissue arose only from the plaintiff's anticipation of a defense\n\nbased on a federal statute).\n\n          It is not enough that the plaintiff alleges\n          some anticipated defense to his cause of\n          action, and asserts that the defense is\n          invalidated   by   some   provision   of   the\n          Constitution of the United States. Although\n          such allegations show that very likely, in the\n          course of the litigation, a question under the\n          Constitution would arise, they do not show\n          that the suit, that is, the plaintiff's\n          original cause of action, arises under the\n          Constitution.\n\nId.   Therefore, we find that the court did not err in failing to\n\napply the artful pleading rule in this instance.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The \"artful pleading rule\" bars a plaintiff from concealing a\nnecessary federal question by omitting it from the complaint.\nFranchise Tax Bd. v.

The Legal Incidence of the Cigarette Tax\n\n           The question of whether the legal incidence of Rhode\n\nIsland's cigarette tax scheme falls on the Narragansett Tribe, as\n\ndealers of cigarettes, or merely on the consumer or non-Indian\n\npurchaser of the cigarettes, will likely determine whether the\n\nNarragansetts are required to comply with the tax scheme.      The\n\nNarragansetts argue that the legal incidence of Rhode Island's\n\ncigarette tax falls directly on the Tribe and its members, and that\n\nthe tax may not be enforced against the Tribe without express\n\ncongressional authority. The State, on the other hand, argues that\n\nthe legal incidence of the cigarette tax, as stated in the language\n\nof the Rhode Island statute, rests on the consumer rather than the\n\nTribe. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-53 (\"All taxes paid in pursuance\n\nof this chapter are conclusively presumed to be a direct tax upon\n\nthe retail consumer, precollected for the purpose of convenience\n\nand facility only.\").\n\n           If the legal incidence of the cigarette tax falls on the\n\nTribe itself, it presents serious tribal sovereignty concerns that\n\nmight preclude the State from enforcing its tax due to the United\n\nStates' recognition of the Narragansetts as a sovereign Indian\n\ntribe.

Lara involves a double\n\njeopardy claim brought in light of recent congressional legislation\n\nthat authorizes Indian tribes to prosecute members of other Indian\n\ntribes.    The resolution of this claim hinged on whether there was\n\ndual sovereignty, leading the Lara court to consider whether the\n\nsource of    the     power   to   punish    nonmember    Indian      offenders    is\n\n\"inherent tribal sovereignty\" or delegated federal authority.                    Id.\n\nat 1632.    The Supreme Court determined that \"Congress intended the\n\nformer\"    because    \"the   statute    says    that    it   'recognize[s]       and\n\naffirm[s]' in each tribe the 'inherent' tribal power (not delegated\n\nfederal power) to prosecute nonmember Indians for misdemeanors\" and\n\nbecause \"the statute's legislative history confirms that such was\n\nCongress' intent.\"      Id. at 1632-33.

In Moe, the Supreme\n\nCourt evaluated a Montana tax statute that provided that the tax\n\n\"shall be conclusively presumed to be [a] direct [tax] on the\n\nretail consumer precollected for the purpose of convenience and\n\nfacility only.\"    Id. (quoting Mont. Rev. Code Ann. § 84-5606(1)\n\n(1947)). The Supreme Court determined that \"to the extent that the\n\n'smoke shops' sell to those upon whom the State has validly imposed\n\na sales or excise tax . . . the State may require the Indian\n\nproprietor simply to add the tax to the sales price and thereby aid\n\nthe State's enforcement and collection thereof.\"       Id.    The Supreme\n\nCourt has repeatedly affirmed that cigarette tax schemes containing\n\npass through provisions place the legal incidence of the tax on the\n\nconsumer rather than the distributor.      See Chickasaw, 515 U.S. at\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f461; Milhelm Attea, 512 U.S. at 64; Chemehuevi, 474 U.S. at 11;\n\nColville 447 U.S. at 159.        Therefore, the holding of Daniels does\n\nnot persuade us that the incidence of the Rhode Island cigarette\n\ntax falls on the Narragansetts.\n\n               It is not required that the law expressly state that the\n\ntax must be passed on to the ultimate purchaser for a State to\n\nrequire    a    tribe   to   collect    cigarette    taxes   from   non-Indian\n\npurchasers and remit it to the State.           Chemehuevi, 474 U.S. at 11.\n\nThe Supreme Court has instructed that the test we should apply in\n\ndetermining whether the incidence of a state tax falls on an Indian\n\ntribe is to make \"a fair interpretation of the taxing statute as\n\nwritten and applied.\"         Id.      In this case, the Rhode Island tax\n\nstatute     explicitly       states     that   the   cigarette      taxes   are\n\n\"conclusively presumed to be a direct tax upon the retail consumer,\n\nprecollected for the purpose of convenience and facility only.\"\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 44-20-53.             As the Supreme Court held in Moe,\n\n\"[t]he State's requirement that the Indian tribal seller collect a\n\ntax validly imposed on non-Indians is a minimal burden designed to\n\navoid the likelihood that in its absence non-Indians purchasing\n\nfrom the tribal seller will avoid payment of a concededly lawful\n\ntax.\"     Moe, 425 U.S. at 483.          We therefore find that the legal\n\nincidence of the Rhode Island cigarette tax falls on the consumer,\n\nnot the Narragansett Tribe, and we find that the State may require\n\nthe Tribe to comply with the cigarette tax in order for the State\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fto collect the cigarette taxes that are passed on to the Tribe's\n\nnon-Indian consumers.\n\nC.   Unanswered Questions\n\n           The State posits that it has raised two independently\n\nsufficient grounds on which we might affirm the district court's\n\njudgment, even if the legal incidence of the tax is found to fall\n\non the Tribe.   Since we find that the legal incidence of the tax\n\ndoes not fall on the Narragansett Tribe, we find it unnecessary and\n\ninappropriate to decide these questions.   The grounds put forth by\n\nthe State are (1) that the settlement lands are not \"Indian\n\ncountry,\"3 and (2) that direct taxation of the Tribe by the State\n\nis allowed pursuant to both section 1708 of the Settlement Act, 25\n\n\n3\n   Indian country is usually \"the benchmark for approaching the\nallocation of federal, tribal, and state authority with respect to\nIndians and Indian lands.\" Narragansett Indian Tribe of R.I. v.\nNarragansett Elec.

Because we affirm the district court's holding\n\nthat the legal incidence of Rhode Island's cigarette tax falls on\n\nthe consumer and not the tribal distributor, it is unnecessary for\n\nus to consider whether the tax would be valid if it were a direct\n\ntax on the Tribe.\n\nD.   Sovereign immunity and the State's enforcement of its laws on\n     the Tribe's settlement lands\n\n\n           The Narragansetts claim that the State of Rhode Island\n\nexceeded its authority in enforcing its cigarette laws against the\n\ngovernment of the Narragansett Indian Tribe and that the State\n\nthereby violated the Tribe's sovereign immunity. The State argues,\n\nconversely, that since the State's civil and criminal laws and\n\njurisdiction apply to the settlement lands pursuant to 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708, the State has concomitant ability to enforce its laws\n\nthere, including those governing the sale of cigarettes. The State\n\nalso argues that the Tribe's sovereign immunity was abrogated by\n\nsection 1708, and therefore tribal sovereign immunity does not bar\n\nthe State's enforcement of its laws on the settlement lands.\n\n           The Tribe asks us to consider six distinct questions\n\nregarding the enforcement of Rhode Island's cigarette laws on the\n\nsettlement lands, including (1) whether the State may invoke its\n\njurisdiction over the settlement lands to enforce its cigarette tax\n\non the government of the Narragansett Indian Tribe (a Land/Tribe\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fdistinction); (2) whether the State may issue and serve a search\n\nwarrant for property of the tribal government; (3) whether the\n\nState may enter tribal lands to serve a warrant; (4) whether the\n\nState may confiscate Tribal government property while on the\n\nsettlement lands; (5) whether the State can require the Tribe to\n\npurchase a license; and (6) whether the State was bound to use less\n\nintrusive means in order to enforce the cigarette tax.\n\n             We have determined that, since the legal incidence of\n\nRhode Island's cigarette tax falls on the consumer, rather than the\n\ntribal distributor, the Narragansetts are obligated to comply with\n\nthe State's cigarette tax laws as they pertain to cigarettes sold\n\nto   non-Indian    consumers.      Therefore,      by   selling   unstamped\n\ncigarettes    to   non-Indian   consumers,   the   Smoke   Shop   operators\n\nviolated Rhode Island tax law, which is a criminal offense.            This\n\nbrings us to the questions regarding what measures the State may\n\ntake to enforce its cigarette tax laws.\n\n             Drawing the line between the sovereign rights of the\n\nNarragansett Tribe and the State of Rhode Island is complicated by\n\nthe Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, which provides for\n\nthe continued applicability of Rhode Island's civil and criminal\n\nlaws and jurisdiction over the settlement lands.            See 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708(a).    This is an ongoing and overarching question which has\n\nvexed the State and Tribe over the years as various issues have\n\narisen.   As we have stated before, all of the relevant questions\n\n                                   -22-\n\fcannot be answered by an all-encompassing solution. State of Rhode\n\nIsland v.

In\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 701, we stated that \"the\n\ngrant of jurisdictional power to the state in the Settlement Act is\n\nvalid and rather broad . . . .\"       We agree with the State that this\n\ngrant of jurisdictional power, in addition to the applicability of\n\n                                  -23-\n\fthe State's civil and criminal laws, provides the State with the\n\nright, and to some extent the means, to enforce these laws on the\n\nsettlement lands.\n\n          However, this does not mean that we agree with the State\n\nthat Section 1708(a) abrogates the Tribe's sovereign immunity\n\naltogether.     On the contrary, we have recognized and enforced the\n\nTribe's   sovereign      immunity    in     the   past.      See    Maynard     v.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599016\"><a href=\"/opinion/599016/kenneth-l-maynard-v-narragansett-indian-tribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1993). The\n\nState suggests that Maynard stands only for the proposition that\n\nCongress did not abrogate sovereign immunity for tribal conduct\n\noutside the settlement lands.         We disagree.        There is nothing in\n\nour analysis of the Settlement Act in that case which suggests that\n\nwe have drawn a distinction based on where tribal activities occur.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Section 1708 does not expressly\n\naddress   the    issue   of   sovereign      immunity,     and     it   would   be\n\ninappropriate for us to infer that the congressional grant of\n\njurisdiction to the State acts as a wholesale abrogation of the\n\nTribe's sovereign immunity.         It is well settled that \"statutes are\n\nto be construed liberally in favor of the Indians with ambiguous\n\nprovisions interpreted to their benefit.\"                 Chickasaw Nation v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118467\"><a href=\"/opinion/118467/chickasaw-nation-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93-94 (2001).           In fact, the language of\n\nSection 1708 does not purport to waive any of the Tribe's rights.\n\n          [T]he mere fact that the Settlement Act cedes\n          power to the state does not necessarily mean\n          . . . that the Tribe lacks similar power and,\n\n                                     -24-\n\f            thus, lacks 'jurisdiction' over the settlement\n            lands. Although the grant of jurisdictional\n            power to the state in the Settlement Act is\n            valid and rather broad, . . . we do not\n            believe that it is exclusive.          To the\n            contrary, we rule that the Tribe retains\n            concurrent jurisdiction over the settlement\n            lands . . . .\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 701.            The Tribe, therefore,\n\nretains its sovereign immunity despite the grant of jurisdiction to\n\nthe State in Section 1708(a).\n\n            The   Tribe's    immunity   does   not,    however,    provide   a\n\ncomplete defense to the enforcement of State laws.            There remains\n\na question of the extent to which the State may encroach upon the\n\nTribe's settlement lands to enforce its criminal laws.                Neither\n\nthis Court, nor the Supreme Court, has issued definitive guidance\n\non this question.\n\n            2. Whether the State may invoke its jurisdiction over\n            the settlement lands to enforce its cigarette tax\n\n\n            The district court considered the holdings of Nevada v.\n\nHicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118454\"><a href=\"/opinion/118454/nevada-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), and Colville \"in conjunction with the\n\nconferral   of    criminal   and   civil   (which     includes    regulatory)\n\njurisdiction contained in section 1708,\" and found it to be \"beyond\n\ndoubt that criminal law enforcement, including the seizure of\n\ncontraband, on the Settlement Lands is permissible.\"             Narragansett\n\nIndian Tribe, 296 F. Supp. 2d at 171.          In Hicks and Colville, the\n\nSupreme Court discusses some allowable enforcement by a state\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fconcerning activities by an Indian tribe which has sovereignty and\n\ndoes not necessarily share jurisdiction over its tribal lands with\n\nthe State.   The Hicks Court recognized that \"the principle that\n\nIndians have the right to make their own laws and be governed by\n\nthem requires 'an accommodation between the interests of the Tribes\n\nand the Federal Government, on the one hand, and those of the\n\nState, on the other.'\"   Hicks, 533 U.S. at 362 (citing Colville,\n\n447 U.S. at 156).   The Court offered the following guidance:\n\n          When on-reservation conduct involving only\n          Indians is at issue, state law is generally\n          inapplicable, for the State's regulatory\n          interest is likely to be minimal and the\n          federal interest in encouraging tribal self-\n          government is at its strongest.           When,\n          however,    state   interests    outside    the\n          reservation    are  implicated,    States   may\n          regulate the activities even of tribe members\n          on tribal land, as exemplified by our decision\n          in [Colville]. . . . It is also well\n          established in our precedent that States have\n          criminal jurisdiction over reservation Indians\n          for   crimes   committed  .   .   .   off   the\n          reservation. While it is not entirely clear\n          from our precedent whether the last mentioned\n          authority entails the corollary right to enter\n          a reservation (including Indian-fee lands) for\n          enforcement purposes, several of our opinions\n          point in that direction.    In [Colville], we\n          explicitly reserved the question whether state\n          officials could seize cigarettes held for sale\n          to nonmembers in order to recover the taxes\n          due.\n\nHicks, 533 U.S. at 362-63 (2001) (citations omitted).   Taking the\n\nSupreme Court's discussion of the enforcement issue in Hicks and\n\nColville, together with Congress' grant of State jurisdiction over\n\n\n                               -26-\n\fthe settlement lands, the district court concluded that Rhode\n\nIsland may enforce its criminal laws on the settlement lands,\n\nincluding the seizure of contraband.\n\n            The Narragansett Tribe argues that the district court\n\ncame to the wrong conclusion for several reasons. First, the Tribe\n\nasserts that its sovereign immunity is a complete defense to\n\nenforcement of the State's laws on the settlement lands. The Tribe\n\nrelies heavily on a Ninth Circuit decision, Bishop Paiute Tribe v.\n\nCounty of Inyo, for the argument that even where Congress has\n\nexpressly authorized a state to enforce its criminal laws, a\n\ntribe's sovereign immunity bars service of a search warrant against\n\nthe tribe itself.    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777780\"><a href=\"/opinion/777780/bishop-paiute-tribe-in-its-official-capacity-and-as-a-representative-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 n.6 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"[T]he\n\nsearch warrant was executed against the tribes in order to obtain\n\ninformation as part of a criminal investigation against individual\n\nIndians . . . .

However,   this   decision   is   not   valid\n\nprecedent, as the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the decision,\n\nstating:\n\n            The Tribe has not explained, and the trial and\n            appellate courts have not clearly decided,\n            what prescription of federal common law, if\n            any, enables the Tribe to maintain an action\n            for   declaratory  relief   establishing   its\n            sovereign right to be free from state criminal\n            processes.

The Court refused to express an opinion\n\non the question of whether the state may enter onto a reservation\n\nand seize stocks of cigarettes which are intended for sale to non-\n\nIndian purchasers.      Colville, 447 U.S. at 162.\n\n           The Court did, however, determine that the State of\n\nWashington's interest in enforcing its valid taxes was sufficient\n\nto   justify    seizures   of   shipments     of   unstamped    cigarettes    as\n\ncontraband      while   they    were    in    transit,   traveling      to   the\n\nreservations.     Id. at 161.    \"By seizing cigarettes en route to the\n\nreservation, the State polices against wholesale evasion of its own\n\nvalid   taxes    without   unnecessarily       intruding   on    core    tribal\n\ninterests.\"     Id. at 162.\n\n             Unlike the State of Washington in Colville, Congress\n\nprovided Rhode Island with civil and criminal jurisdiction on the\n\nNarragansetts' settlement lands. 25 U.S.C. § 1708(a). In light of\n\nthis authority and the precedent set in Colville, we find that the\n\nState of Rhode Island may have the power to enter onto the\n\nsettlement lands and seize unstamped cigarettes as contraband, from\n\n                                       -28-\n\fthe Indian distributor, provided that the action does not violate\n\nthe Tribe's sovereign immunity.\n\n          3.    The \"Land\"/\"Tribe\" Distinction\n\n          The Tribe contends that a distinction should be made\n\nbetween the jurisdiction the State was given over the settlement\n\nlands and any power the State might have over the Tribe itself.\n\nThe Tribe argues that the grant of jurisdiction that Congress gave\n\nto the State of Rhode Island merely subjected \"the settlement lands\n\n. . . to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the\n\nState,\"   25   U.S.C.   §   1708(a),       not   the    Narragansett    Tribal\n\ngovernment.    The Tribe asserts that Congress intentionally limited\n\nthis jurisdiction to the settlement lands, and that it knew how to\n\nwrite the Act to cover the Tribe as well if it had so intended.\n\nSee, e.g., Maine Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1725 (expressly\n\nproviding the State with jurisdiction over \"all Indians, Indian\n\nnations, or tribes or bands of Indians in the State of Maine . . .\n\nand any lands or other natural resources owned by any such Indian,\n\nIndian Nation, tribe or band of Indians, and any lands held in\n\ntrust by the United States for any such Indian\").\n\n          In   ascertaining   the    intent      of    Congress   in   statutes\n\nregulating Indian tribes, we must read the statutes against a\n\nbackdrop of Indian sovereignty.       Colville, 447 U.S. at 178 (citing\n\nMcClanahan, 411 U.S. at 172). \"[T]he [Supreme] Court has held that\n\nretained sovereignty includes the power of Indians to make and\n\n                                    -29-\n\fenforce their own substantive law in internal matters, including\n\nmatters such as membership rules, inheritance rules, and the\n\nregulation of domestic relations.\"        Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19\n\nF.3d at 701 (citing Santa Clara Pueblo, 436 U.S. at 56).\n\n            Congress did not expressly give the State jurisdiction\n\nover the Narragansett Tribe in Section 1708.        While we have said\n\nthat the grant of jurisdictional power to the State is broad, we\n\nhave also found that \"the Tribe retains concurrent jurisdiction\n\nover the settlement lands,\" Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at\n\n701, and that \"any effort by the state to exercise [its] authority\n\nis hedged in by . . . the Tribe's retained rights of sovereignty\n\n. . .\"   Id. at 705.   Therefore, as the district court stated, \"when\n\nthe Tribe acts 'qua Tribe,' that is, as the political entity\n\nresponsible for governing the Narragansetts, it is not subject to\n\nthe State's civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction.\"\n\n            The Tribe asserts that the opening and operation of the\n\nSmoke Shop was a tribal government activity.        The Narragansetts'\n\nSmoke Shop was opened pursuant to a resolution passed by the\n\nNarragansett Tribal Council with the stated purpose of providing\n\neconomic development for the Tribal Nation.       The Tribe, therefore,\n\nasserts that sovereign immunity precludes the State of Rhode Island\n\nfrom entering the settlement lands, serving a warrant on the tribal\n\nactivity,     and   confiscating    tribal    government   property   as\n\ncontraband.\n\n                                   -30-\n\f          While   retained   tribal    sovereignty   has   never   been\n\nprecisely defined, the Supreme Court has offered the following\n\ndescription:\n\n          Indian tribes are \"distinct, independent\n          political    communities,   retaining    their\n          original natural rights\" in matters of local\n          self-government.

The\n\nMaine Implementing Act makes the Penobscot Nation subject \"to all\n\nthe   duties,     obligations,      liabilities         and    limitations         of     a\n\nmunicipality . . . provided, however, that internal tribal matters\n\n. . . shall not be subject to regulation by the State.\"                         Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 30, § 6206(1) (emphasis added).\n\n            While Rhode Island and Maine are similar to the extent\n\nthat each state has reached a settlement with its Indian tribes\n\nwhich has been enacted by Congress, the provisions of the Maine\n\nSettlement Act and Implementing Act are very different from the\n\nRhode Island Settlement Act, which did not limit the jurisdiction\n\nof the Narragansett Tribe, but rather provided the State with\n\nconcurrent jurisdiction.         In Akins, we repeatedly warned that our\n\nanalysis was unique to Maine because of the Maine Settlement Act\n\nand   the   State's    Implementing       Act.     </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197651\"><a href=\"/opinion/197651/akins-v-penobscot-indian/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>     <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    484        (\"The\n\nstructure of analysis differs here from that which would be used in\n\nclaims against the vast majority of other Indian tribes in the\n\ncountry.\").

Nor do we disagree with the district court's\n\nconclusion that the Tribe's retained right of sovereignty will not\n\nshield the Tribe's unlawful operation of a Smoke Shop that offers\n\nnon-Indian consumers a means to bypass the State's cigarette tax\n\nwhich   would    not   otherwise    be   available    to   them   off   of   the\n\nsettlement lands.\n\n           4.   The State's enforcement of its laws against the\n           Narragansett Tribe\n\n\n           The next question concerns the extent to which the State\n\nmay enforce its cigarette laws directly against the Narragansett\n\nTribal government.      We find that it is worthwhile to consider the\n\nfact that the Narragansett Tribe's sovereign immunity has not been\n\nabrogated and that there exist means by which the State could have\n\nenforced   its    cigarette   tax   laws    which    would   have   been     more\n\nrespectful of the Tribe's sovereignty.\n\n           The doctrine of tribal immunity is settled law today.\n\nThe Supreme Court has refused to abandon or narrow this doctrine\n\ndespite arguments that tribal businesses have become far removed\n\nfrom tribal self-governance and internal affairs.             See Kiowa, 523\n\nU.S. at 757.     The Court stated that it \"retained the doctrine . . .\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fon the theory that Congress had failed to abrogate it in order to\n\npromote economic development and tribal self-sufficiency.\"             Id.\n\n           For example, in Potawatomi, the Supreme Court \"reaffirmed\n\nthat while Oklahoma may tax cigarette sales by a Tribe's store to\n\nnonmembers, the Tribe enjoys immunity from a suit to collect unpaid\n\ntaxes.\"   Kiowa, 523 U.S. at 755 (citing Potawatomi, 498 U.S. at\n\n510).     \"There   is   a   difference    between   the   right   to   demand\n\ncompliance with state laws and the means available to enforce\n\nthem.\" Id. (citing Potawatomi, 498 U.S. at 514 (\"There is no doubt\n\nthat sovereign immunity bars the State from pursuing the most\n\nefficient remedy, but we are not persuaded that it lacks any\n\nadequate alternatives.\")).

Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537822\"><a href=\"/opinion/537822/city-vending-of-muskogee-inc-v-the-oklahoma-tax-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(10th Cir. 1990).       Another option is that the State might enter\n\ninto an agreement with the Tribe to adopt a mutually satisfactory\n\nregime for the collection of its cigarette tax.\n\n           Today we have held that the State's cigarette tax laws\n\nare applicable to sales to non-Indian customers on the settlement\n\n                                   -35-\n\flands. The State of Rhode Island has numerous alternatives that it\n\nmay use to enforce its cigarette tax on the settlement lands\n\nwithout violating the Tribe's sovereign immunity.           The State's\n\nhands will not be completely tied while the Tribe continues to\n\noperate its Smoke Shop in violation of the State's cigarette laws.\n\nAlthough the operation of the Smoke Shop without complying with\n\nRhode Island's cigarette tax laws is certainly not a sovereign\n\nright retained by the Narragansett Tribe, the Tribe does have a\n\nright of sovereign immunity that should be respected the State.\n\nFor these reasons, we hold that the State violated the Tribe's\n\nsovereign rights when it enforced the criminal provisions of its\n\ncigarette tax laws by executing a search warrant against the Tribal\n\ngovernment's Smoke Shop, forcibly entering the Shop and seizing the\n\nTribe's   stock   of   unstamped   cigarettes,   and   arresting   tribal\n\nofficials who were acting in their official capacity.\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment for the State is affirmed in part and, to the\n\nextent that the district court's declaratory judgment regarding the\n\nState's enforcement of its criminal statutes against the Tribal\n\ngovernment is inconsistent with our holdings, reversed in part.\n\n           Affirmed in part, Reversed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\f</pre>",
