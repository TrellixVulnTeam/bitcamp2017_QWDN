The appellant, Steven\n\nG. Brame (\"Brame\"), appeals from his conviction and sentence in\n\nthis drug and firearms case.    We affirm.\n\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n           On the evening of May 6, 2006, the shift manager at a\n\nMcDonald's restaurant in Portland, Maine, called 911 to report that\n\nhe had just witnessed what he believed was a drug transaction in\n\nthe men's bathroom at the restaurant.       He described one of the men\n\nas white, with a handlebar mustache and wearing a jean jacket; the\n\nother he described as black, wearing a blue T-shirt, baggy jeans,\n\nand a gold chain.\n\n           Responding quickly to the shift manager's call to law\n\nenforcement, two police officers approached the restaurant as a\n\nblack man matching the shift manager's description was seen leaving\n\nthe premises.    After speaking briefly with the shift manager, the\n\nofficers   located   the   suspect    as   he   emerged   from   a   nearby\n\nconvenience store.    Introducing themselves, the officers explained\n\nthat they were investigating a drug transaction that had been\n\nobserved minutes earlier in the restaurant.        Acting \"very nervous\n\nand fidgety,\" looking all around but never making eye-contact with\n\nthe officers, the suspect admitted that he had been in the bathroom\n\nat McDonald's.    He explained that he was there with his boss and\n\nthat the two had exchanged money for some work that one of them had\n\ndone for the other.    When the officers asked about the nature of\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe work, the suspect \"clammed up.\"\n\n           The suspect pulled a wallet from his pocket after the\n\nofficers asked for identification.             As he did so, one of the\n\nofficers saw and grabbed a pocket knife that was also in the\n\nsuspect's pocket.      Fearing that the suspect might try to run, the\n\nofficers asked the suspect to sit down on the steps leading into\n\nthe convenience store.       Seated, the suspect continued to fumble\n\nthrough his wallet looking for identification, ultimately producing\n\nan identification card in the name of Steven Brame.\n\n           Asked by the officers if he had any contraband, drugs,\n\nweapons,   needles,    or   similar    items   in   his    possession,   Brame\n\nresponded in the negative.            Continuing to appear nervous and\n\nanimated, Brame repeatedly put his hands in the pockets of his\n\nbaggy jeans despite instructions to the contrary.             Concerned that\n\nBrame might have a weapon, the officers asked Brame to turn his\n\npockets inside out.     Brame responded by pulling a small portion of\n\nhis pockets out.      He did not, however, empty his pockets.\n\n           At some point, Brame stood up.                 As he did so, the\n\nofficers could see by the sway of his pants that Brame had a heavy\n\nobject in one of his pockets.         The officers immediately told Brame\n\nto put his hands behind his back.           Brame refused to comply and\n\ninstead became \"semi-aggressive.\" Each officer then grabbed one of\n\nBrame's arms and pushed Brame against the wall of the building.\n\nBrame resisted the entire time.             As he was being placed          in\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhandcuffs, Brame said: \"It's in my pocket.\"          One of the officers\n\nthen looked down and saw the butt end of a handgun in Brame's\n\npocket. The officers then frisked Brame, seizing a loaded handgun,\n\nthe serial number of which had been obliterated, and a small\n\nplastic baggie of crack cocaine that was located in the waistband\n\nof Brame's boxer shorts.       Brame was then placed under arrest.          At\n\nno time during the stop was Brame advised of his Miranda rights.\n\n           Brame was later charged in a four-count indictment with\n\n(1) possession of five grams or more of cocaine base in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (Count One); (2) possession of a handgun\n\nduring and in relation to the felony described in Count One, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924 (Count Two); (3) possession of a\n\nfirearm   as   a   convicted   felon,   in   violation   of   18   U.S.C.   §§\n\n922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (Count Three); and (4) possession of a\n\nfirearm that had an obliterated manufacturer's serial number in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(k) and 924(a)(2) (Count Four).\n\n           Brame filed multiple motions to suppress after he was\n\narraigned. The district court denied Brame's motions, finding that\n\nthe officers lawfully stopped Brame for investigative questioning,\n\nlawfully arrested him on suspicion of having committed a crime, and\n\nlawfully seized the physical evidence taken from Brame's person.\n\nThe district court also determined that, with respect to any\n\nstatements made by Brame during his encounter with the officers,\n\nMiranda warnings were not required until Brame was arrested or \"in\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcustody.\"     Because the government agreed not to use, as evidence\n\nagainst Brame, any statements made by Brame after his arrest, the\n\ndistrict court found no basis for suppression of any of Brame's\n\nstatements.\n\n            Brame appeared before the district court on January 3,\n\n2007, to enter a conditional plea of guilty to all four counts of\n\nthe indictment.    The court explained that, as to Count One, Brame\n\nfaced at least five years in prison but could be sentenced up to 20\n\nyears.     As to Count Two, the court advised Brame that he was\n\n\"subject to a term of imprisonment that must be at least five years\n\nand can be as much as life and has to be consecutive to the\n\nsentence on Count One.\"     On each of Counts Three and Four, Brame\n\nwas advised that the maximum penalty was ten years.           Asked if he\n\nunderstood these penalties, Brame replied: \"Yes, sir.\"               After\n\nfinding that there was a factual basis for the plea, that Brame\n\nunderstood and voluntarily waived the rights he was surrendering by\n\npleading guilty, that Brame understood the penalties he was facing,\n\nand that Brame was entering his plea voluntarily, the district\n\ncourt accepted Brame's plea, conditioned on his right to appeal the\n\nsuppression rulings.\n\n            Brame was sentenced on May 23, 2007, to 144 months in\n\nprison, the bottom of the Guidelines range of 144 to 165 months.\n\nThis sentence consisted of 84 months on Counts One, Three and Four,\n\nto   run   concurrently,   plus   60   months   on   Count   Two,   to   run\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fconsecutively.\n\n                          II. SUPPRESSION ISSUES\n\n            Brame contends that the district court erred when it\n\ndenied his motions to suppress.        According to Brame, and contrary\n\nto the district court's findings, the police had neither reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop and question him nor probable cause to search and\n\narrest him.       Brame also contends, again contrary to the district\n\ncourt's findings, that he was subjected to unlawful custodial\n\ninterrogation throughout his encounter with the officers.\n\n            We review a district court's findings of fact on a\n\nsuppression motion for clear error and its conclusions of law de\n\nnovo. United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    Applying that mixed standard of review, we find no error in\n\nthe district court's denial of Brame's motions to suppress.\n\n            The record amply reveals that the officers' initial stop\n\nof Brame was appropriate under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968)\n\n(holding that a brief, investigative stop of a suspect requires\n\nonly a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing).            The shift manager at\n\nMcDonald's called 911 to report that he saw two men—whom the\n\nmanager    well    described—engaged   in   a   drug   transaction   in   the\n\nrestaurant's bathroom.       When officers arrived at the restaurant\n\nmoments later, they saw a man who fit the manager's description\n\nleaving the restaurant.      After briefly talking with the manager,\n\nthe officers stopped the man for questioning.            At that time, the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fofficers clearly had reasonable suspicion that the man had just\n\ntaken    part    in    a    drug   trafficking         offense     in    the   McDonald's\n\nbathroom.\n\n            During         the   course     of       the   investigatory       stop,     the\n\nsuspect—ultimately identified as Brame—acted in a nervous and\n\nfidgety manner, avoided eye contact with the officers, \"clammed up\"\n\nwhen    asked    to    explain     his    story       about     what    happened    in   the\n\nbathroom,       kept   returning         his    hands      to    his    pockets     despite\n\ninstructions to the contrary, and failed fully to comply when the\n\nofficers directed him to turn his pockets inside out.                          Aware that\n\na heavy object was in one of Brame's pockets, the officers asked\n\nBrame to put his hands behind his back.                            Brame refused and,\n\ninstead, became increasingly angry and aggressive.                         Given Brame's\n\nbehavior, the officers placed Brame in handcuffs and frisked him.\n\n            That the officers placed Brame in handcuffs did not\n\nelevate the Terry stop into a full-blown arrest.                               The use of\n\nhandcuffs during the course of a stop is appropriate if officers\n\nreasonably believe that handcuffs are necessary to protect the\n\nofficers, the public, or the suspect during the stop.                               United\n\nStates v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).                            As noted\n\nin Acosta-Colon, \"[p]olice officers engaged in an otherwise lawful\n\nstop must be permitted to take measures—including the use of\n\nhandcuffs—they believe reasonably necessary to protect themselves\n\nfrom harm, or to safeguard the security of others.\"                        Id.     Here, in\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\flight of Brame's belligerent behavior and the officers' objectively\n\nreasonable fears that Brame might be armed, the use of handcuffs\n\nwas entirely appropriate.\n\n               That the officers frisked Brame was also not inconsistent\n\nwith a Terry stop.         As the Supreme Court held in Terry, when an\n\nindividual is subject to a lawful investigative stop, an officer\n\nmay conduct a limited frisk of that individual for weapons. Terry,\n\n392 U.S. at 26-27.           Given the circumstances in this case, a\n\nprecautionary frisk was clearly warranted.\n\n               Not until the frisk resulted in the discovery of both a\n\nloaded weapon as well as drugs did the officers place Brame under\n\narrest.    Then, if not before, the officers had probable cause to\n\nbelieve that Brame had committed a drug trafficking offense.              His\n\narrest and the concomitant seizure of the items found on his person\n\nwere accordingly lawful.          Brame's argument to the contrary—that he\n\nwas subjected, much earlier, to a de facto arrest without probable\n\ncause—is without merit.\n\n               Once Brame was arrested, the officers should have advised\n\nBrame     of    his     Miranda   rights.     The   government,    however,\n\nappropriately         addressed   the   officers'   Miranda   violation    by\n\nagreeing not to introduce any statements made by Brame subsequent\n\nto his arrest.        With respect to the statements made by Brame before\n\nhis arrest, relief under Miranda is not warranted.\n\n               In sum, like the district court, we find no merit to\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fBrame's suppression arguments.        We will accordingly affirm the\n\ndistrict court's denial of Brame's motions to suppress.\n\n                      III. CONSECUTIVE SENTENCE\n\n            Brame contends that he was improperly sentenced to a\n\nconsecutive    sentence    for   carrying   a   firearm   during   a    drug\n\ntrafficking crime.        Specifically, he contends that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that he possessed the firearm in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense.        Because Brame did not\n\nraise this issue before the district court, we review for plain\n\nerror.     To vacate Brame's sentence for plain error, we must find\n\nthat (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain and obvious; (3)\n\nthe error affected Brame's substantial rights; and (4) the error\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceedings.      United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            We note initially that Brame entered a conditional plea\n\nof guilty to all four counts of the indictment.             Before Brame\n\nentered his plea, the government described the evidence that it\n\nplanned to introduce at trial.      Defense counsel assured the court\n\nthat he had discussed the government's proffer with Brame.             After\n\nhearing that defense counsel was satisfied that the government's\n\nevidence was sufficient to convict Brame on all four counts, the\n\ncourt asked Brame whether he disagreed with the government's\n\nproffer.    Brame said that he did not disagree with any part of the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fproffer.   Indeed, Brame said that, to the best of his knowledge,\n\nthe information proffered by the government was true. The district\n\ncourt thereafter announced that it found a factual basis for\n\nBrame's plea.\n\n           Contrary to what he professed at the plea hearing, Brame\n\nnow contends that the government's evidence was not sufficient to\n\nestablish that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n\ntrafficking offense as charged in Count Two.   We are unpersuaded.\n\nThe government's evidence, which Brame did not dispute, revealed\n\nthat (1) soon after a witness observed Brame in what appeared to be\n\na drug trafficking transaction, Brame was found with both a baggie\n\nof crack cocaine and a loaded, operable handgun concealed on his\n\nperson; (2) Brame was, at the time, a convicted felon who could not\n\nlawfully possess a handgun; and (3) the serial number on the\n\nhandgun had been unlawfully obliterated.    Such evidence provided\n\nample basis for Brame's guilty plea. The district court's decision\n\nto impose a consecutive five-year sentence for carrying a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking felony was not erroneous, much\n\nless plainly erroneous.**\n\n                       IV. PRIOR CONVICTIONS\n\n           Brame challenges the district court's use of two prior\n\nconvictions for purposes of enhancing his sentence.   According to\n\n\n\n     **\n       Because we find no error, we need not consider whether\nBrame has waived the right to assert this ground of appeal.\n\n                               -10-\n\fBrame, there was insufficient evidence to establish that he was the\n\nindividual convicted of those two crimes.        We review the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact with respect to prior convictions for\n\nclear error.   United States v. Santos, 363 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n          Brame filed written objections to his probation officer's\n\nPresentence Report, challenging, among other things, the inclusion\n\nin his criminal history of two prior convictions involving an\n\nindividual   named   \"Frank   Lollis.\"   Brame    contends   that    those\n\nconvictions should not have been attributed to him.                 In his\n\npresentence interview, however, Brame admitted that he used the\n\nalias \"Frank Lollis.\"     Moreover, according to Brame's probation\n\nofficer, the court documents in each of the two cases revealed that\n\n\"Steven Brame\" was either the name of the defendant or an alias\n\nused by the defendant.        The same address, including apartment\n\nnumber, was listed for the individual charged in those two cases;\n\nand, when the district court asked defense counsel whether Brame\n\ndisputed the statement that he purportedly made to the presentence\n\ninvestigator, namely, that he used the alias \"Frank Lollis,\"\n\ncounsel replied in the negative.     Based on the evidence presented\n\nto it, the district court overruled Brame's objection to the\n\naddition of criminal history points for the two prior convictions,\n\nfinding, as a matter of fact, that the two convictions were\n\nproperly attributed to Brame.        We find no clear error in the\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fdistrict court's factual finding.\n\n                            V. AMENDMENT 706\n\n           Months after Brame was sentenced, Congress amended the\n\nSentencing Guidelines to lower by two levels the base offense level\n\nfor many crack cocaine offenders.        U.S.S.G § Amend. 706.    Brame was\n\nsentenced in May of 2007, more than five months before Amendment\n\n706 became effective on November 1, 2007. Brame mistakenly asserts\n\nthat Amendment 706 became effective before his May sentencing.\n\nBased on his mistaken assertion, Brame contends that he should have\n\nreceived   the    benefit   of    Amendment   706   at   the   time   of   his\n\nsentencing.      His contention is without merit.        He may be entitled\n\nto the benefit of Amendment 706, but he must seek relief initially\n\nin the district court through 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).           Because his\n\nchallenge here is premature, we take no view as to whether or not\n\nBrame is entitled to the benefit of Amendment 706.\n\n                             VI. CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the judgment\n\nof the district court.      We REMAND the case to the district court\n\nwhere Brame may file, if he wishes, a motion for reduction in\n\nsentence pursuant to the recent Guidelines amendment that lowers\n\nthe Guidelines sentencing range for certain categories of offenses\n\ninvolving crack cocaine.         U.S.S.G. Amend. 706.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

The appellant, Steven\n\nG. Brame (\"Brame\"), appeals from his conviction and sentence in\n\nthis drug and firearms case.    We affirm.\n\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n           On the evening of May 6, 2006, the shift manager at a\n\nMcDonald's restaurant in Portland, Maine, called 911 to report that\n\nhe had just witnessed what he believed was a drug transaction in\n\nthe men's bathroom at the restaurant.       He described one of the men\n\nas white, with a handlebar mustache and wearing a jean jacket; the\n\nother he described as black, wearing a blue T-shirt, baggy jeans,\n\nand a gold chain.\n\n           Responding quickly to the shift manager's call to law\n\nenforcement, two police officers approached the restaurant as a\n\nblack man matching the shift manager's description was seen leaving\n\nthe premises.    After speaking briefly with the shift manager, the\n\nofficers   located   the   suspect    as   he   emerged   from   a   nearby\n\nconvenience store.    Introducing themselves, the officers explained\n\nthat they were investigating a drug transaction that had been\n\nobserved minutes earlier in the restaurant.        Acting \"very nervous\n\nand fidgety,\" looking all around but never making eye-contact with\n\nthe officers, the suspect admitted that he had been in the bathroom\n\nat McDonald's.    He explained that he was there with his boss and\n\nthat the two had exchanged money for some work that one of them had\n\ndone for the other.    When the officers asked about the nature of\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe work, the suspect \"clammed up.\"\n\n           The suspect pulled a wallet from his pocket after the\n\nofficers asked for identification.             As he did so, one of the\n\nofficers saw and grabbed a pocket knife that was also in the\n\nsuspect's pocket.      Fearing that the suspect might try to run, the\n\nofficers asked the suspect to sit down on the steps leading into\n\nthe convenience store.       Seated, the suspect continued to fumble\n\nthrough his wallet looking for identification, ultimately producing\n\nan identification card in the name of Steven Brame.\n\n           Asked by the officers if he had any contraband, drugs,\n\nweapons,   needles,    or   similar    items   in   his    possession,   Brame\n\nresponded in the negative.            Continuing to appear nervous and\n\nanimated, Brame repeatedly put his hands in the pockets of his\n\nbaggy jeans despite instructions to the contrary.             Concerned that\n\nBrame might have a weapon, the officers asked Brame to turn his\n\npockets inside out.     Brame responded by pulling a small portion of\n\nhis pockets out.      He did not, however, empty his pockets.\n\n           At some point, Brame stood up.                 As he did so, the\n\nofficers could see by the sway of his pants that Brame had a heavy\n\nobject in one of his pockets.         The officers immediately told Brame\n\nto put his hands behind his back.           Brame refused to comply and\n\ninstead became \"semi-aggressive.\" Each officer then grabbed one of\n\nBrame's arms and pushed Brame against the wall of the building.\n\nBrame resisted the entire time.             As he was being placed          in\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhandcuffs, Brame said: \"It's in my pocket.\"          One of the officers\n\nthen looked down and saw the butt end of a handgun in Brame's\n\npocket. The officers then frisked Brame, seizing a loaded handgun,\n\nthe serial number of which had been obliterated, and a small\n\nplastic baggie of crack cocaine that was located in the waistband\n\nof Brame's boxer shorts.       Brame was then placed under arrest.          At\n\nno time during the stop was Brame advised of his Miranda rights.\n\n           Brame was later charged in a four-count indictment with\n\n(1) possession of five grams or more of cocaine base in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (Count One); (2) possession of a handgun\n\nduring and in relation to the felony described in Count One, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924 (Count Two); (3) possession of a\n\nfirearm   as   a   convicted   felon,   in   violation   of   18   U.S.C.   §§\n\n922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (Count Three); and (4) possession of a\n\nfirearm that had an obliterated manufacturer's serial number in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(k) and 924(a)(2) (Count Four).\n\n           Brame filed multiple motions to suppress after he was\n\narraigned. The district court denied Brame's motions, finding that\n\nthe officers lawfully stopped Brame for investigative questioning,\n\nlawfully arrested him on suspicion of having committed a crime, and\n\nlawfully seized the physical evidence taken from Brame's person.\n\nThe district court also determined that, with respect to any\n\nstatements made by Brame during his encounter with the officers,\n\nMiranda warnings were not required until Brame was arrested or \"in\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcustody.\"     Because the government agreed not to use, as evidence\n\nagainst Brame, any statements made by Brame after his arrest, the\n\ndistrict court found no basis for suppression of any of Brame's\n\nstatements.\n\n            Brame appeared before the district court on January 3,\n\n2007, to enter a conditional plea of guilty to all four counts of\n\nthe indictment.    The court explained that, as to Count One, Brame\n\nfaced at least five years in prison but could be sentenced up to 20\n\nyears.     As to Count Two, the court advised Brame that he was\n\n\"subject to a term of imprisonment that must be at least five years\n\nand can be as much as life and has to be consecutive to the\n\nsentence on Count One.\"     On each of Counts Three and Four, Brame\n\nwas advised that the maximum penalty was ten years.           Asked if he\n\nunderstood these penalties, Brame replied: \"Yes, sir.\"               After\n\nfinding that there was a factual basis for the plea, that Brame\n\nunderstood and voluntarily waived the rights he was surrendering by\n\npleading guilty, that Brame understood the penalties he was facing,\n\nand that Brame was entering his plea voluntarily, the district\n\ncourt accepted Brame's plea, conditioned on his right to appeal the\n\nsuppression rulings.\n\n            Brame was sentenced on May 23, 2007, to 144 months in\n\nprison, the bottom of the Guidelines range of 144 to 165 months.\n\nThis sentence consisted of 84 months on Counts One, Three and Four,\n\nto   run   concurrently,   plus   60   months   on   Count   Two,   to   run\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fconsecutively.\n\n                          II. SUPPRESSION ISSUES\n\n            Brame contends that the district court erred when it\n\ndenied his motions to suppress.        According to Brame, and contrary\n\nto the district court's findings, the police had neither reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop and question him nor probable cause to search and\n\narrest him.       Brame also contends, again contrary to the district\n\ncourt's findings, that he was subjected to unlawful custodial\n\ninterrogation throughout his encounter with the officers.\n\n            We review a district court's findings of fact on a\n\nsuppression motion for clear error and its conclusions of law de\n\nnovo. United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203232\"><a href=\"/opinion/203232/united-states-v-vilches-navarrete/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    Applying that mixed standard of review, we find no error in\n\nthe district court's denial of Brame's motions to suppress.\n\n            The record amply reveals that the officers' initial stop\n\nof Brame was appropriate under Terry v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1968)\n\n(holding that a brief, investigative stop of a suspect requires\n\nonly a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing).            The shift manager at\n\nMcDonald's called 911 to report that he saw two men—whom the\n\nmanager    well    described—engaged   in   a   drug   transaction   in   the\n\nrestaurant's bathroom.       When officers arrived at the restaurant\n\nmoments later, they saw a man who fit the manager's description\n\nleaving the restaurant.      After briefly talking with the manager,\n\nthe officers stopped the man for questioning.            At that time, the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fofficers clearly had reasonable suspicion that the man had just\n\ntaken    part    in    a    drug   trafficking         offense     in    the   McDonald's\n\nbathroom.\n\n            During         the   course     of       the   investigatory       stop,     the\n\nsuspect—ultimately identified as Brame—acted in a nervous and\n\nfidgety manner, avoided eye contact with the officers, \"clammed up\"\n\nwhen    asked    to    explain     his    story       about     what    happened    in   the\n\nbathroom,       kept   returning         his    hands      to    his    pockets     despite\n\ninstructions to the contrary, and failed fully to comply when the\n\nofficers directed him to turn his pockets inside out.                          Aware that\n\na heavy object was in one of Brame's pockets, the officers asked\n\nBrame to put his hands behind his back.                            Brame refused and,\n\ninstead, became increasingly angry and aggressive.                         Given Brame's\n\nbehavior, the officers placed Brame in handcuffs and frisked him.\n\n            That the officers placed Brame in handcuffs did not\n\nelevate the Terry stop into a full-blown arrest.                               The use of\n\nhandcuffs during the course of a stop is appropriate if officers\n\nreasonably believe that handcuffs are necessary to protect the\n\nofficers, the public, or the suspect during the stop.                               United\n\nStates v. Acosta-Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198134\"><a href=\"/opinion/198134/united-states-v-acosta-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).                            As noted\n\nin Acosta-Colon, \"[p]olice officers engaged in an otherwise lawful\n\nstop must be permitted to take measures—including the use of\n\nhandcuffs—they believe reasonably necessary to protect themselves\n\nfrom harm, or to safeguard the security of others.\"                        Id.     Here, in\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\flight of Brame's belligerent behavior and the officers' objectively\n\nreasonable fears that Brame might be armed, the use of handcuffs\n\nwas entirely appropriate.\n\n               That the officers frisked Brame was also not inconsistent\n\nwith a Terry stop.         As the Supreme Court held in Terry, when an\n\nindividual is subject to a lawful investigative stop, an officer\n\nmay conduct a limited frisk of that individual for weapons. Terry,\n\n392 U.S. at 26-27.           Given the circumstances in this case, a\n\nprecautionary frisk was clearly warranted.\n\n               Not until the frisk resulted in the discovery of both a\n\nloaded weapon as well as drugs did the officers place Brame under\n\narrest.    Then, if not before, the officers had probable cause to\n\nbelieve that Brame had committed a drug trafficking offense.              His\n\narrest and the concomitant seizure of the items found on his person\n\nwere accordingly lawful.          Brame's argument to the contrary—that he\n\nwas subjected, much earlier, to a de facto arrest without probable\n\ncause—is without merit.\n\n               Once Brame was arrested, the officers should have advised\n\nBrame     of    his     Miranda   rights.     The   government,    however,\n\nappropriately         addressed   the   officers'   Miranda   violation    by\n\nagreeing not to introduce any statements made by Brame subsequent\n\nto his arrest.        With respect to the statements made by Brame before\n\nhis arrest, relief under Miranda is not warranted.\n\n               In sum, like the district court, we find no merit to\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fBrame's suppression arguments.        We will accordingly affirm the\n\ndistrict court's denial of Brame's motions to suppress.\n\n                      III. CONSECUTIVE SENTENCE\n\n            Brame contends that he was improperly sentenced to a\n\nconsecutive    sentence    for   carrying   a   firearm   during   a    drug\n\ntrafficking crime.        Specifically, he contends that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that he possessed the firearm in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense.        Because Brame did not\n\nraise this issue before the district court, we review for plain\n\nerror.     To vacate Brame's sentence for plain error, we must find\n\nthat (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain and obvious; (3)\n\nthe error affected Brame's substantial rights; and (4) the error\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceedings.      United States v. Duarte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            We note initially that Brame entered a conditional plea\n\nof guilty to all four counts of the indictment.             Before Brame\n\nentered his plea, the government described the evidence that it\n\nplanned to introduce at trial.      Defense counsel assured the court\n\nthat he had discussed the government's proffer with Brame.             After\n\nhearing that defense counsel was satisfied that the government's\n\nevidence was sufficient to convict Brame on all four counts, the\n\ncourt asked Brame whether he disagreed with the government's\n\nproffer.    Brame said that he did not disagree with any part of the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fproffer.   Indeed, Brame said that, to the best of his knowledge,\n\nthe information proffered by the government was true. The district\n\ncourt thereafter announced that it found a factual basis for\n\nBrame's plea.\n\n           Contrary to what he professed at the plea hearing, Brame\n\nnow contends that the government's evidence was not sufficient to\n\nestablish that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n\ntrafficking offense as charged in Count Two.   We are unpersuaded.\n\nThe government's evidence, which Brame did not dispute, revealed\n\nthat (1) soon after a witness observed Brame in what appeared to be\n\na drug trafficking transaction, Brame was found with both a baggie\n\nof crack cocaine and a loaded, operable handgun concealed on his\n\nperson; (2) Brame was, at the time, a convicted felon who could not\n\nlawfully possess a handgun; and (3) the serial number on the\n\nhandgun had been unlawfully obliterated.    Such evidence provided\n\nample basis for Brame's guilty plea. The district court's decision\n\nto impose a consecutive five-year sentence for carrying a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking felony was not erroneous, much\n\nless plainly erroneous.**\n\n                       IV. PRIOR CONVICTIONS\n\n           Brame challenges the district court's use of two prior\n\nconvictions for purposes of enhancing his sentence.   According to\n\n\n\n     **\n       Because we find no error, we need not consider whether\nBrame has waived the right to assert this ground of appeal.\n\n                               -10-\n\fBrame, there was insufficient evidence to establish that he was the\n\nindividual convicted of those two crimes.        We review the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact with respect to prior convictions for\n\nclear error.   United States v. Santos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200939\"><a href=\"/opinion/200939/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n          Brame filed written objections to his probation officer's\n\nPresentence Report, challenging, among other things, the inclusion\n\nin his criminal history of two prior convictions involving an\n\nindividual   named   \"Frank   Lollis.\"   Brame    contends   that    those\n\nconvictions should not have been attributed to him.                 In his\n\npresentence interview, however, Brame admitted that he used the\n\nalias \"Frank Lollis.\"     Moreover, according to Brame's probation\n\nofficer, the court documents in each of the two cases revealed that\n\n\"Steven Brame\" was either the name of the defendant or an alias\n\nused by the defendant.        The same address, including apartment\n\nnumber, was listed for the individual charged in those two cases;\n\nand, when the district court asked defense counsel whether Brame\n\ndisputed the statement that he purportedly made to the presentence\n\ninvestigator, namely, that he used the alias \"Frank Lollis,\"\n\ncounsel replied in the negative.     Based on the evidence presented\n\nto it, the district court overruled Brame's objection to the\n\naddition of criminal history points for the two prior convictions,\n\nfinding, as a matter of fact, that the two convictions were\n\nproperly attributed to Brame.        We find no clear error in the\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fdistrict court's factual finding.\n\n                            V. AMENDMENT 706\n\n           Months after Brame was sentenced, Congress amended the\n\nSentencing Guidelines to lower by two levels the base offense level\n\nfor many crack cocaine offenders.        U.S.S.G § Amend. 706.    Brame was\n\nsentenced in May of 2007, more than five months before Amendment\n\n706 became effective on November 1, 2007. Brame mistakenly asserts\n\nthat Amendment 706 became effective before his May sentencing.\n\nBased on his mistaken assertion, Brame contends that he should have\n\nreceived   the    benefit   of    Amendment   706   at   the   time   of   his\n\nsentencing.      His contention is without merit.        He may be entitled\n\nto the benefit of Amendment 706, but he must seek relief initially\n\nin the district court through 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).           Because his\n\nchallenge here is premature, we take no view as to whether or not\n\nBrame is entitled to the benefit of Amendment 706.\n\n                             VI. CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the judgment\n\nof the district court.      We REMAND the case to the district court\n\nwhere Brame may file, if he wishes, a motion for reduction in\n\nsentence pursuant to the recent Guidelines amendment that lowers\n\nthe Guidelines sentencing range for certain categories of offenses\n\ninvolving crack cocaine.         U.S.S.G. Amend. 706.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f</pre>",
