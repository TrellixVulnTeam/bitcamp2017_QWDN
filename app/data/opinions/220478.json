D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Boudin and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert C. Andrews on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Thomas         E.\nDelahanty II, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 7, 2011\n\f          Per Curiam. We have reviewed the record and the parties'\n\nsubmissions, and we affirm.\n\n          The appellant, William Holmes (\"Holmes\"), raises a number\n\nof challenges to his sentence.    He first challenges the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that he possessed a handgun during each of two\n\ndrug transactions with a confidential informant (\"CI\").     He argues\n\nthat the evidence presented by the government was unreliable.      We\n\nsee no clear error.   The discrepancies as to the date of the second\n\ndrug transaction and the caliber of the weapon seized from a drug\n\npartner's apartment may permissibly be viewed as rather minor\n\ndiscrepancies and were explained by the witnesses:           the date\n\ndiscrepancy was allegedly due to a typographical error and the\n\ndiscrepancy with regard to the size of the weapon was explained by\n\nthe fact that a .22 caliber weapon and a .25 caliber are similar in\n\nappearance.   There is nothing in the record which would require\n\nthis court to question those explanations, and the district court\n\nwas in the best position to evaluate whether the witnesses who gave\n\nthose explanations were credible.      The CI's alleged offer to leave\n\ntown in exchange for $12,000 adversely affected his credibility,\n\nbut the court did not rely solely on the CI's claim that Holmes had\n\na gun with him at each of the two drug transactions.      Rather, the\n\nCI's claim was corroborated by an agent's testimony that the CI was\n\nwearing a wire during both transactions, that she was monitoring\n\nthe wire during both transactions, and that she heard Holmes refer\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fon the first occasion to the fact that he was carrying a firearm.\n\nThe court also listened to the recordings of those controlled\n\ntransactions.      The CI's claim that Holmes carried a different\n\nfirearm to each of the two transactions was corroborated by the\n\nfact that the CI described the two weapons (a small caliber\n\nderringer and a 9 mm or .45 caliber handgun with a brown wooden\n\nhandle), and that weapons matching those descriptions were later\n\nseized from Holmes' co-conspirators.         Thus, we see no clear error\n\nin the court's conclusion that Holmes possessed the handguns.\n\n            We also see no error in the district court's conclusion\n\nthat Holmes constructively possessed a shotgun found under his co-\n\nconspirator's bed.     \"Constructive possession exists when a person\n\nknowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise\n\ndominion and control over an object either directly or through\n\nothers.\"    United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).              Holmes\n\npled guilty to illegal possession of shotgun ammunition; that\n\nammunition was found in Holmes' bedroom; and the ammunition matched\n\nthe shotgun found in the other bedroom in his home.            That second\n\nbedroom    was   unlocked,   and   its   occupant,   one   William   Hopkins\n\n(\"Hopkins\"), was apparently Holmes' partner in a drug-dealing\n\nbusiness.    One ounce of cocaine was found in Hopkins' closet along\n\nwith a handgun that may have been the same gun that Holmes carried\n\nduring one of the two controlled drug transactions.           The district\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcourt reasonably could have concluded from this evidence that the\n\ntwo drug partners -- Holmes and Hopkins -- appeared to share ready\n\naccess to the entire apartment and that the tools of their trade –\n\nthe drugs they sold and the weapons and ammunition used to protect\n\nthose drugs – were shared between them and scattered throughout the\n\napartment.   A small caliber handgun that Holmes carried with him\n\nduring the other controlled drug transaction may have been the same\n\ngun later found in an apartment occupied by another drug-dealing\n\npartner, one Michael Pressey (\"Pressey\"); Holmes was seen routinely\n\nentering this apartment throughout this investigation in order to\n\nretrieve drugs. This is further indication that the three partners\n\n(Holmes, Hopkins and Pressey) all shared access to the tools of\n\ntheir trade, i.e., the drugs and the guns used to protect those\n\ndrugs.   Given all of this, we see no clear error in the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Holmes knowingly had the power and the\n\nintent to exercise control over the shotgun.   Thus, we see no error\n\nin the court's conclusion that Holmes had constructive possession\n\nof the shotgun found under Hopkins' bed.   See id. (\"[T]here must be\n\nsome action, some word, or some conduct that links the individual\n\nto the contraband and indicates that he had some stake in it, some\n\npower over it.\").\n\n          Finally, Holmes argues that even if he did possess the\n\ntwo handguns and did constructively possess the shotgun, the\n\ndistrict court erred in imposing an enhancement under U.S.S.G. §\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f2K2.1(b)(1)(A) for possession of three to seven firearms. He notes\n\nthat he was only convicted of illegal possession of ammunition, so\n\nany possession by him of firearms should not have been treated as\n\nrelevant conduct.       See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(2).        Holmes' possession\n\nof firearms can be considered relevant conduct, and the enhancement\n\nin U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A) may be applied, if 1) U.S.S.G. §\n\n3D1.2(d) would require a sentencing court to group any possession\n\nof firearms with his possession of ammunition, had Holmes been\n\ncharged additionally with possessing the three guns in question,\n\nand 2) his possession of those three guns was part of the same\n\ncourse of conduct or common scheme or plan as his possession of the\n\nshotgun ammunition.       See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(2).\n\n              The first requirement is met here, as subsection 3D1.2(d)\n\nwould have required grouping of any gun possession charges with the\n\nammunition charge.        See U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(d) (offenses covered by\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 shall be grouped); U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 (entitled\n\n\"Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or\n\nAmmunition\").       The      only    question,    then,   is   whether    Holmes'\n\npossession of the three guns was part of the same course of conduct\n\nor   common    scheme   or    plan    as    his   possession   of   the   shotgun\n\nammunition.      \"The 'same course of conduct' concept ... looks to\n\nwhether the defendant repeats the same type of criminal activity\n\nover time.      It does not require that acts be 'connected together'\n\nby common participants or by an overall scheme.\"               United States v.\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fSanders, 982 F.2d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted); see U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, app. note 9.\n\n           We see no error in the sentencing court's conclusion that\n\nHolmes' possession of the three guns in question and his possession\n\nof ammunition were all part of the same course of conduct.   Holmes'\n\nconstructive possession of the shotgun was part of the same course\n\nof conduct as his possession of the matching ammunition for that\n\ngun; after all, the latter generally is not used without the\n\nformer.   Holmes argues that there is no evidence that he kept the\n\nshotgun shells in aid of his drug business, but the relevant\n\nquestion is whether his possession of that shotgun was related to\n\nthe crime for which he was convicted, i.e., his possession of the\n\nshotgun ammunition.   Clearly it was.\n\n           We also see no error in the district court's conclusion\n\nthat Holmes' possession of the two handguns also was part of the\n\nsame course of conduct, i.e., illegal possession of ammunition and\n\nweapons (the shotgun) at his home, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g).   The CI reported that he had seen both handguns in Holmes'\n\napartment; he saw the smaller handgun when he met Holmes at the\n\napartment shortly before the first drug transaction, and he saw the\n\nlarger handgun on two occasions (during the second drug transaction\n\nat Holmes' home, and during some previous visit by the CI to the\n\napartment).    Holmes possessed all three guns, as well as the\n\nammunition, within a very short time frame:    only one month.   It\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fappears that Holmes' possession of ammunition and multiple weapons\n\nwas all part of a single scheme or plan to run a drug operation out\n\nof his home (in partnership with Hopkins and Pressey) and to\n\nsupport that operation through the possession of weapons and\n\nammunition.   This is sufficient.   Holmes contends that possession\n\nof firearms can never be treated as relevant conduct to the offense\n\nof possession of ammunition; but he cites no case law in support of\n\nthis suggestion, and the argument is contrary to the plain language\n\nof U.S.S.G. §§ 1B1.3(a)(2) & 3D1.2(d). Finally, Holmes argues that\n\nthe court's decision to enhance his sentence on the basis of\n\nuncharged conduct violated his Sixth Amendment rights.        This\n\nargument fails.    See United States v. Zapata, 589 F.3d 475, 484\n\n(1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
