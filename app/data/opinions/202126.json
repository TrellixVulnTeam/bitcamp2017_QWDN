William Matt, WT Matt Holding, LLC and WT\n\nMatt   Development   Corporation    appeal    from   decisions   by   the\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP), which dismissed their appeal\n\nfrom a bankruptcy court decision and denied rehearing.                 We\n\ndismiss the appeal by William Matt and reject the appeal by the\n\ncorporate appellants as meritless.        We also address a pending\n\nmotion by the appellees.\n\n           Insofar as Matt is concerned, we agree substantially\n\nwith the reasoning by the BAP, which concluded that he lacks\n\nstanding to pursue the appeal.           Thus, his appeal should be\n\ndismissed.    Spenlinhauer v. O'Donnell, 261 F.3d 113, 118 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n           Regarding the corporate appellants, we find no error or\n\nabuse of discretion by the BAP, which reasonably dismissed the\n\nappeal and denied rehearing.        As the BAP said, the companies\n\nfailed to timely have an attorney enter an appearance on their\n\nbehalf.   In addition, Matt, who had urged -- essentially up to\n\nthe time of oral argument -- that he should be allowed to\n\nrepresent his companies, failed to raise on appeal the only\n\nappellate issue the companies had.           Neither his statement of\n\nissues nor his brief alleged that the bankruptcy court had erred\n\nin striking their pleadings for lack of representation.\n\n           In any event, even if the BAP had considered the merits\n\nof the appellants' appeal, it is plain that it would have\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\faffirmed the bankruptcy court and that this court, in its turn,\n\nwould have done the same.         The bankruptcy court properly struck\n\nthe companies' pleadings because they had not been filed by an\n\nattorney.   See In re Las Colinas Development Corp., 585 F.2d 7,\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1978) (confirming the general rule that a corporate\n\nentity may not pursue litigation except through an attorney).\n\n            Appellees Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. and Tremont\n\nTower Residences, LLC, move to amend the caption of this appeal\n\nto list only them as appellees.
