Joseph L.

La Liberte, with whom Pamela Zorn Adams and Sherin and\nLodgen LLP were on brief for appellant.\n     Andrew M. Osborne, with whom David J. Fonte and Osborne &\nFonte were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 6, 2007\n\f            CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.                 The corporate owner of\n\ncommercial premises upon which its lessee sought to reorganize\n\nunder chapter 11 and reopen as a food market appeals from the\n\nbankruptcy court judgment which denied the motion to dismiss the\n\nchapter 11 petition on the ground that it was not filed in good\n\nfaith.   We affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n            In    1965,   the   Fields       Station    Realty     Trust   (\"Fields\n\nStation\")    leased   a   commercial     retail        property    in   Dorchester,\n\nMassachusetts, to Supreme Fields Corner, Inc.                 Rentals under the\n\nlease (“Lease”) were – and remain – well below prevailing market\n\nrates.      The   Lease   permitted    Fields     Station     to    terminate   the\n\nleasehold within thirty days should Supreme Fields cease operating\n\na business – viz., a food market – on the premises.                        In 1996,\n\nCapitol Food Corporation of Fields Corner, Inc. (“Capitol Food”)\n\nsucceeded to Supreme Fields’ interests as lessee.\n\n            In 2005, Capitol Food ceased operating the food market\n\nitself, and subleased the store to Ethnic and American Foods, Inc.\n\nd/b/a America’s Food Basket (“AFB”).            AFB operated a market on the\n\npremises until December 26, 2005, when it closed its doors and\n\nfiled a chapter 7 petition.         On December 27, Fields Station sent\n\nCapitol Food a written notice, citing AFB’s closure of the market\n\nas an event of default under the Lease, and inviting Capitol Food\n\nto cure the default by January 26, 2006 or forfeit its leasehold.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           Capitol Food promptly decided to resume its own operation\n\nof a market on the leased premises.              During January 2006, it\n\npurchased AFB’s sublease interests in the Property from the chapter\n\n7 trustee in the AFB bankruptcy case, and agreed to purchase the\n\nmarket’s existing equipment and inventory from one of AFB’s secured\n\ncreditors. Capitol Food also applied to the city for the necessary\n\noperating and health permits.         However, since it was unable to\n\nreopen the market by the Fields Station January 26 deadline,\n\nCapitol Food filed a voluntary chapter 11 reorganization proceeding\n\non January 27, expressly to avert forfeiture of its lucrative\n\nleasehold. Capitol Food has continued to make timely rent payments\n\nto Fields Station.     Within two weeks of its chapter 11 filing,\n\nCapitol   Food   obtained   the    operating    and    health   permits,   and\n\nreopened the food market.\n\n           Fields Station promptly submitted a motion to dismiss the\n\nCapitol   Food   chapter    11    petition,    see    11   U.S.C.   §   1112(b)\n\n(authorizing dismissal of petitions for “cause”), or for relief\n\nfrom the automatic stay, see id. § 362(d)(1) (same, “for cause”),\n\nalleging that the Capitol Food petition had been filed in bad faith\n\nand for an improper purpose.\n\n           After a non-evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court\n\ndenied both Capitol Food motions, holding, inter alia, that section\n\n1112(b) contains no good faith filing requirement, and that Fields\n\nStation failed to establish “cause” for relief from the automatic\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fstay because Capitol Food did not utilize the chapter 11 filing for\n\nany improper purpose. Fields Station appealed the bankruptcy court\n\norders denying its subsection 1112(b) and 362(d) motions to the\n\ndistrict court, which summarily affirmed.\n\n                                II\n\n                                A.\n\n          On appeal from an intermediate district court affirmance,\n\nwe review de novo the bankruptcy court’s legal conclusions, its\n\nfindings of fact for clear error, In re Watman, 458 F.3d 26, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), and its refusal to dismiss a bankruptcy petition\n\nor to grant relief from the automatic stay only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, Howard v. Lexington Invs., Inc., 284 F.3d 320, 322 (1st\n\nCir. 2002); In re Soares, 107 F.3d 969, 977 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                B.\n\n          The Bankruptcy Code prescribes that the bankruptcy court\n\nmay dismiss a chapter 11 case for “cause.”   11 U.S.C. § 1112(b)(1).\n\nFields Station initially posits that a finding that Capitol Food\n\nfiled its chapter 11 petition in “bad faith” is sufficient “cause”\n\nfor a § 1112(b) dismissal.   The courts are not in agreement as to\n\nthis legal proposition, compare, e.g., In re Integrated Telecom\n\nExpress, Inc., 384 F.3d 108, 118 (3d Cir. 2004) (embracing good\n\nfaith filing requirement), cert. denied, 545 U.S. 1110 (2005), with\n\nIn re Victoria Ltd. P’ship, 187 B.R. 54, 61-62 (Bankr. D. Mass.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f1995) (rejecting the proposition),1 and the issue remains one of\n\nfirst impression in this circuit, cf. In re Coastal Cable T.V.,\n\nInc., 709 F.2d 762, 764-65 (1st Cir. 1983) (merely observing that\n\nthe Code imposes a generalized duty of good faith, and citing 11\n\nU.S.C.   §     1129(a)(3),     which      expressly     requires     that   a\n\nreorganization plan be “proposed in good faith”).\n\n             Although   the   bankruptcy    court   held   that    subsection\n\n1112(b) imposes no good faith filing requirement, we need not\n\naddress this matter in the present case.              Even the courts which\n\nhave found a good faith filing requirement would demand that Fields\n\nStation first make a prima facie showing that Capitol Food filed\n\nits petition in bad faith, see, e.g., In re Paolini, 312 B.R. 295,\n\n\n     1\n      The courts which endorse a good faith filing requirement\nprimarily observe that it comports with the equitable roots of\nbankruptcy law, by ensuring, from the earliest stages of a\nbankruptcy case, that the debtor’s genuine need for bankruptcy\nprotection outweighs the burden and delay to creditors occasioned\nby the chapter 11 proceedings. See, e.g., Integrated Telecom, 384\nF.3d at 119.    The courts which reject the requirement observe,\ninter alia, that: (i) § 1112(b) expressly provides adequate\nalternate mechanisms for weeding out bad faith chapter 11 petitions\nby expressly listing several criteria warranting dismissal for\n“cause” (e.g., the debtor’s failure to propose a viable chapter 11\nplan in good faith), 11 U.S.C. § 1112(b)(4)(A)-(P), yet\nconspicuously omits mention of any good faith filing criterion; and\n(ii) “good faith” is too vague and amorphous a term to justify\ndismissal ab initio of a chapter 11 petition before the debtor has\nhad a fair opportunity to propose and argue for the bona fides of\nits reorganization plan. See Victoria Ltd. P’ship, 187 B.R. at 61-\n62. In the same vein, Capitol Food notes that the Bankruptcy Abuse\nPrevention and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23\n(2005), recently included in the Code an explicit “good faith”\ndefinition in § 362(c)(3)(B), (C) (provisions to discourage\nmultiple bankruptcy filings by same debtor within one-year period),\nbut did not so amend § 1112(b).\n\n                                    -5-\n\f305 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2004) (observing that the moving party must\n\nmake a prima facie showing of bad faith before the burden of\n\nproving good faith shifts to debtor), and the appellate record\n\nreveals   that    Fields    Station      has   made   no   such     preliminary\n\ndemonstration.\n\n                                        C.\n\n          Although Fields Station acknowledges the fact-intensive\n\nnature of the good faith question, In re Marsch, 36 F.3d 825, 828\n\n(9th Cir. 1994), it suggests that the two matters particularly\n\npertinent to its appeal are whether the Capitol Food petition\n\n“serves a valid reorganizational purpose,” and whether the petition\n\nwas filed “merely to obtain tactical litigation advantages.” In re\n\nSGL Carbon Corp., 200 F.3d 154, 163, 165 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n          Even the case authority cited by Fields Station refutes\n\nits allegation that Capitol Food submitted its chapter 11 petition\n\nin bad faith.     Fields Station relies primarily on the fact that\n\nCapitol Food admitted that it was solvent at the time it filed its\n\nchapter 11 petition, see 11 U.S.C. § 101(32) (providing definition\n\nof “insolvent”), therefore had the ability to pay its unsecured\n\ndebts without liquidating its business assets, thus had no present\n\nneed for bankruptcy protection in January 2006.\n\n          “A     debtor    need   not    be    insolvent   before    filing   a\n\nbankruptcy petition,” however, provided it is experiencing “some\n\ntype of financial distress.”       Integrated Telecom, 384 F.3d at 122\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f(“The absence of an insolvency requirement encourages companies to\n\nfile   for    Chapter      11   before      they    face    a    financially   hopeless\n\nsituation.”) (emphasis added); SGL Carbon, 200 F.3d at 165-66\n\n(“When financially troubled petitioners seek a chance to remain in\n\nbusiness,         the   exercise       of    those     [bankruptcy]         powers   is\n\njustified.”); In re Liberate Techs., 314 B.R. 206, 211-12 (Bankr.\n\nN.D. Cal. 2004) (same); see also Coastal Cable, 709 F.2d at 765\n\n(noting that a “good faith” plan of reorganization “must bear some\n\nrelation to the statutory objective of resuscitating a financially\n\ntroubled corporation”).            Catastrophic business events, such as an\n\nimminent or threatened foreclosure on the debtor’s interests in\n\nreal property essential to successful reorganization efforts, are\n\nprecisely the sort of imminent financial distress for which debtors\n\nroutinely seek chapter 11 protection.                      See Liberate Techs., 314\n\nB.R. at 216 (citing In re Sylmar Plaza, L.P., 314 F.3d 1070, 1075\n\n(9th Cir. 2002) (finding no “bad faith” filing where debtor filed\n\nchapter      11     petition      to   avoid       incurring       prohibitive   lease\n\npenalties)). Two primary purposes of chapter 11 relief are the\n\npreservation of businesses as going concerns, and the maximization\n\nof the assets recoverable to satisfy unsecured claims. See Bank of\n\nAm. Nat’l Trust & Sav. Ass’n v. 203 N. LaSalle St. P’ship, 526 U.S.\n\n434, 453 (1999).           Upon the abrupt closure of the AFB market in\n\nDecember 2005, Capitol Food was deprived of its principal source of\n\ncash   flow       (viz.,    the    sublease        rental       payments   receivable),\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fwhereupon Capitol Food legitimately opted to reconvert itself –\n\nfrom a non-operational sublessor to a market operator – thereby\n\npreserving for the business the going concern value of both the\n\nbelow-market-rate leasehold and the store’s existing equipment and\n\ninventory. Since “‘going-concern value is likely to be higher than\n\nliquidation value,’”      Integrated Techs., 384 F.3d at 121 (citation\n\nomitted), a successful reorganization in turn can maximize the\n\nvalue of the assets available to settle the outstanding claims of\n\nunsecured creditors.      If the reorganization succeeds, and a steady\n\ncash flow is restored, everyone wins: the debtor, creditors,\n\nemployees, and shareholders.\n\n              Importantly, Fields Station has not contended that the\n\nCapitol Food reorganization would have been viable even if Capitol\n\nFood were forced to pay prevailing market rates on the Lease.\n\nWhere   the    Capitol   Food   non-monetary   default   under   the   Lease\n\nthreatened to extinguish its lucrative leasehold, and the loss of\n\nthat leasehold would have doomed its bona fide reorganization\n\nefforts, it had a present need for chapter 11 protection to avoid\n\nbusiness disruption and economic dismemberment.           See id. at 129\n\n(noting that a “good faith” petition “must seek to create or\n\npreserve some value that would otherwise be lost . . . outside of\n\nbankruptcy”); In re James Wilson Assocs., 965 F.2d 160, 170 (7th\n\nCir. 1992) (“It is not bad faith to seek to gain an advantage from\n\ndeclaring bankruptcy – why else would one declare it?”).\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f               “The [§ 1112(b) good faith filing] inquiry often centers\n\naround the debtor's bona fide need for a breathing spell to\n\nreorganize.”         In re Original IFPC S'holders, Inc., 317 B.R. 738,\n\n750 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2004).           Congress intended that the filing of\n\na    chapter    11    petition   and   the     coincident   triggering   of   the\n\nautomatic stay would afford debtors a “breathing spell” from “all\n\ncollection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions.”\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 340 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n5787, at 6296-97 (emphasis added); 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(6); In re\n\nJamo, 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2002); Soares, 107 F.3d at 975.\n\nAs   in   the    instant   case,   the   \"time-out\"     typically   delimits   a\n\ncreditor’s contractual rights against the debtor in order to\n\nadvance the prospects for a successful reorganization:\n\n               Filing a bankruptcy petition with the intent\n               to frustrate creditors does not by itself\n               “establish an absence of intent to seek\n               rehabilitation.” Indeed, because a major\n               purpose behind our bankruptcy laws is to\n               afford a debtor some breathing room from\n               creditors, it is almost inevitable that\n               creditors will, in some sense, be “frustrated”\n               when their debtor files a bankruptcy petition.\n               In reality, there is “a considerable gap\n               between delaying creditors, on the eve of\n               foreclosure, and the concept of abuse of\n               judicial purpose.”\n\n\nIn re Cohoes Indus. Terminal, Inc., 931 F.2d 222, 228 (2d Cir.\n\n1991) (citations omitted).\n\n               In this regard, none of Fields Stations’ case authorities\n\nprove to be factually apposite.              Unlike Capitol Food, the debtors\n\n                                         -9-\n\fin Integrated Telecom and Liberate Technologies did not file their\n\nchapter 11 petitions with intent to reorganize a financially\n\ndistressed company as an operational business, but rather, with the\n\ndeclared   intention   to   sell   a   fully   solvent    company,   viz.,    a\n\nbusiness fully able to pay its unsecured claims as they came due.\n\nSee   Integrated   Telecom,    384     F.3d    at   120    (“Integrated      is\n\nunquestionably ‘out of business,’ and therefore has no going\n\nconcern value to preserve in Chapter 11 through reorganization or\n\nliquidation under the Bankruptcy Code.”); Liberate Techs., 314 B.R.\n\nat 217.    In order to maximize the businesses’ sales value, hence\n\nthe financial return their shareholders would realize from their\n\nanticipated sales, the debtors sought to invoke a Bankruptcy Code\n\nprovision that caps the amount a lessor may recover in future rents\n\nfor the debtor’s default under a lease, thereby making the leases’\n\nterms more valuable and attractive to prospective purchasers of the\n\nbusinesses. 11 U.S.C. § 506(b)(6); Integrated Telecom, 384 F.3d at\n\n128 (noting that the establishment of a valid reorganizational\n\npurpose is a question “antecedent” to the right to invoke the §\n\n506(b)(6) cap).\n\n           By contrast, the Capitol Food unsecured creditors are\n\nlikely to benefit from the now-successful reorganization, since\n\nCapitol Food’s operation of the food market has restored a reliable\n\nand adequate cash flow from which it can pay its past and ongoing\n\ndebts to unsecured creditors, as well as continue its timely rental\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fpayments to Fields Station under the Lease.2         Far from an unworthy\n\npurpose, this type of bona fide rehabilitative effort is among the\n\nmost fundamental aims attendant upon chapter 11 protection.\n\n           As Fields Station has made no prima facie showing that\n\nCapitol Food submitted its chapter 11 petition in bad faith, we\n\nconclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying   the   Fields   Station   motion   to   dismiss   the   chapter   11\n\npetition or relief from the automatic stay.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Fields Station predicated its bankruptcy court motions, at\nleast in part, on allegations, based on media reports, that Capitol\nFood had a long history of mismanaging and neglecting the leased\nproperty (e.g., repeated health violations).       Given that many\ncompanies   suffer   financial   distress  precisely   because   of\nmismanagement, we do not perceive what relevance these allegations\nhave to the question as to whether Capitol Food filed its chapter\n11 petition in bad faith.      Rather, these allegations pertain\nprincipally to the prospects vel non that the plan proposed by\nCapitol Food would effect a successful rehabilitation.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Even the courts which have found a good faith filing requirement would demand that Fields Station first make a <i>prima facie</i> showing that Capitol Food filed its petition in bad faith, <i>see, e.g., In re Paolini,</i> 312 B.R. 295, 305 (Bankr.E.D.Va.2004) (observing that the moving party must make a <i>prima facie</i> showing of bad faith before the burden of proving good faith shifts to debtor), and the appellate record reveals that Fields Station has made no such preliminary demonstration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Fields Station acknowledges the fact-intensive nature of the good faith question, <i>In re Marsch,</i> 36 F.3d 825, 828 (9th Cir.1994), it suggests that the two matters particularly pertinent to its appeal are whether the Capitol Food petition \"serves a valid reorganizational purpose,\" and whether the petition was filed \"merely to obtain tactical litigation advantages.\" <i>In re SGL Carbon Corp.,</i> 200 F.3d 154, 163, 165 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even the case authority cited by Fields Station refutes its allegation that Capitol Food submitted its chapter 11 petition in bad faith. Fields Station relies primarily on the fact that Capitol Food admitted that it was solvent at the time it filed its chapter 11 petition, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(32) (providing definition of \"insolvent\"), therefore had the ability to pay its unsecured debts without liquidating its business assets, thus had no <i>present</i> need for bankruptcy protection in January 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A debtor need not be insolvent before filing a bankruptcy petition,\" however, provided it is experiencing \"some type of financial distress.\" <i>Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 122 (\"The absence of an insolvency requirement encourages companies to file for Chapter 11 <i>before</i> they face a financially hopeless situation.\") (emphasis added); <i>SGL Carbon,</i> 200 F.3d at 165-66 (\"When financially troubled petitioners seek a chance to remain in business, the exercise of those [bankruptcy] powers is justified.\"); <i>In re Liberate Techs.,</i> 314 B.R. 206, 211-12 (Bankr.

Catastrophic business events, such as an imminent or threatened foreclosure on the debtor's interests in real property essential to successful reorganization efforts, are precisely the sort of imminent financial distress for which debtors routinely seek chapter 11 protection. <i>See Liberate Techs.,</i> 314 B.R. at 216 (citing <i>In re Sylmar Plaza, L.P.,</i> 314 F.3d 1070, 1075 (9th Cir.2002) (finding no \"bad faith\" filing where debtor filed chapter 11 petition to avoid incurring prohibitive lease penalties)). Two primary purposes of chapter 11 relief are the preservation of businesses as going concerns, and the maximization of the assets recoverable to satisfy unsecured claims. <i>See Bank of Am. Nat'l Trust &amp; Sav. Ass'n v. 203 N. LaSalle St. P'ship,</i> 526 U.S. 434, 453, 119 S.Ct. 1411, 143 L.Ed.2d 607 (1999). Upon the abrupt closure of the AFB market in December 2005, Capitol Food was deprived of its principal source of cash flow (<i>viz.,</i> the sublease rental payments receivable), whereupon Capitol Food legitimately opted to reconvert itself&#8212;from a non-operational sublessor to a market operator&#8212;thereby preserving for the business the going concern value of both the below-market-rate leasehold and the store's existing equipment and inventory. Since \"`going-concern value is likely to be higher than liquidation value,'\" <i>Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 121 (citation omitted), a successful reorganization in turn can maximize the value of the assets available to settle the outstanding claims of unsecured creditors. If the reorganization succeeds, and a steady cash flow is restored, everyone wins: the debtor, creditors, employees, and shareholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, Fields Station has not contended that the Capitol Food reorganization would have been viable even if Capitol Food were forced to pay prevailing market rates on the Lease. Where the Capitol Food non-monetary default under the Lease threatened to extinguish its lucrative leasehold, and the loss of that leasehold would have doomed its <i>bona fide</i> reorganization efforts, it had a <i>present</i> need for chapter 11 protection to avoid business disruption and economic dismemberment. <i>See id.</i> at 129 (noting that a \"good faith\" petition \"must seek to create or preserve some value that would otherwise be lost . . . outside of bankruptcy\"); <i>In re James Wilson Assocs.,</i> 965 F.2d 160, 170 (7th Cir.1992) (\"It is not bad faith to seek to gain an advantage from declaring bankruptcy&#8212;why else would one declare it?\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The [&#167; 1112(b) good faith filing] inquiry often centers around the debtor's <i>bona fide</i> need for a breathing spell to reorganize.\" <i>In re Original IFPC S'holders, Inc.,</i> 317 B.R. 738, 750 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 2004). Congress intended that the filing of a chapter 11 petition and the coincident triggering of the automatic stay would afford debtors a \"breathing spell\" from \"all collection efforts, all harassment, and all <i>foreclosure actions.</i>\" H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 340 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, at 6296-97 (emphasis added); 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(6); <i>In re Jamo,</i> 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Soares,</i> 107 F.3d at 975.

In reality, there is \"a considerable gap between delaying creditors, on the eve of foreclosure, and the concept of abuse of judicial purpose.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In re Cohoes Indus.

Unlike Capitol Food, the debtors in <i>Integrated Telecom</i> and <i>Liberate Technologies</i> did not file their chapter 11 petitions with intent to reorganize a financially distressed company as an operational business, but rather, with the declared intention to <i>sell</i> a fully solvent company, <i>viz.,</i> a business fully able to pay its unsecured claims as they came due. <i>See Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 120 (\"Integrated is unquestionably `out of business,' and therefore has no going concern value to preserve in Chapter 11 through reorganization or liquidation under the Bankruptcy Code.\"); <i>Liberate Techs.,</i> 314 B.R. at 217. In order to maximize the businesses' sales value, hence the financial return their <i>shareholders</i> would realize from their anticipated sales, the debtors sought to invoke a Bankruptcy Code provision that caps the amount a lessor may recover in future rents for the debtor's default under a lease, thereby making the leases' terms more valuable and attractive to prospective purchasers of the businesses. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 506(b)(6); <i>Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 128 (noting that the establishment of a valid reorganizational purpose is a question \"antecedent\" to the right to invoke the &#167; 506(b)(6) cap).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Capitol Food unsecured creditors are likely to benefit from the now-successful reorganization, since Capitol Food's operation of the food market has restored a reliable and adequate cash flow from which it can pay its past and ongoing debts to unsecured creditors, as well as continue its timely rental payments to Fields Station under the Lease.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Far from an unworthy purpose, this type of <i>bona fide</i> rehabilitative effort is among the most fundamental aims attendant upon chapter 11 protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Fields Station has made no <i>prima facie</i> showing that Capitol Food submitted its chapter 11 petition in bad faith, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Fields Station motion to dismiss the chapter 11 petition or relief from the automatic stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The courts which endorse a good faith filing requirement primarily observe that it comports with the equitable roots of bankruptcy law, by ensuring, from the earliest stages of a bankruptcy case, that the debtor's genuine need for bankruptcy protection outweighs the burden and delay to creditors occasioned by the chapter 11 proceedings<i>See, e.g., Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 119. The courts which reject the requirement observe, <i>inter alia,</i> that: (i) &#167; 1112(b) expressly provides adequate alternate mechanisms for weeding out bad faith chapter 11 petitions by expressly listing several criteria warranting dismissal for \"cause\" (<i>e.g.,</i> the debtor's failure to propose a viable chapter 11 plan in good faith), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1112(b)(4)(A)-(P), yet conspicuously omits mention of any good faith filing criterion; and (ii) \"good faith\" is too vague and amorphous a term to justify dismissal <i>ab initio</i> of a chapter 11 petition before the debtor has had a fair opportunity to propose and argue for the <i>bona fides</i> of its reorganization plan. <i>See Victoria Ltd. P'ship,</i> 187 B.R. at 61-62. In the same vein, Capitol Food notes that the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.L. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (2005), recently included in the Code an explicit \"good faith\" definition in &#167; 362(c)(3)(B), (C) (provisions to discourage multiple bankruptcy filings by same debtor within one-year period), but did not so amend &#167; 1112(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fields Station predicated its bankruptcy court motions, at least in part, on allegations, based on media reports, that Capitol Food had a long history of mismanaging and neglecting the leased property (<i>e.g.,</i> repeated health violations). Given that many companies suffer financial distress precisely because of mismanagement, we do not perceive what relevance these allegations have to the question as to whether Capitol Food filed its chapter 11 petition in bad faith. Rather, these allegations pertain principally to the prospects <i>vel non</i> that the plan proposed by Capitol Food would effect a successful rehabilitation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Catastrophic business events, such as an imminent or threatened foreclosure on the debtor's interests in real property essential to successful reorganization efforts, are precisely the sort of imminent financial distress for which debtors routinely seek chapter 11 protection. <i>See Liberate Techs.,</i> 314 B.R. at 216 (citing <i>In re Sylmar Plaza, L.P.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span>, 1075 (9th Cir.2002) (finding no \"bad faith\" filing where debtor filed chapter 11 petition to avoid incurring prohibitive lease penalties)). Two primary purposes of chapter 11 relief are the preservation of businesses as going concerns, and the maximization of the assets recoverable to satisfy unsecured claims. <i>See Bank of Am.

Upon the abrupt closure of the AFB market in December 2005, Capitol Food was deprived of its principal source of cash flow (<i>viz.,</i> the sublease rental payments receivable), whereupon Capitol Food legitimately opted to reconvert itself&#8212;from a non-operational sublessor to a market operator&#8212;thereby preserving for the business the going concern value of both the below-market-rate leasehold and the store's existing equipment and inventory. Since \"`going-concern value is likely to be higher than liquidation value,'\" <i>Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 121 (citation omitted), a successful reorganization in turn can maximize the value of the assets available to settle the outstanding claims of unsecured creditors. If the reorganization succeeds, and a steady cash flow is restored, everyone wins: the debtor, creditors, employees, and shareholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, Fields Station has not contended that the Capitol Food reorganization would have been viable even if Capitol Food were forced to pay prevailing market rates on the Lease. Where the Capitol Food non-monetary default under the Lease threatened to extinguish its lucrative leasehold, and the loss of that leasehold would have doomed its <i>bona fide</i> reorganization efforts, it had a <i>present</i> need for chapter 11 protection to avoid business disruption and economic dismemberment. <i>See id.</i> at 129 (noting that a \"good faith\" petition \"must seek to create or preserve some value that would otherwise be lost . . . outside of bankruptcy\"); <i>In re James Wilson Assocs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583935\"><a href=\"/opinion/583935/26-collier-bankrcas2d-1673-bankr-l-rep-p-74636-in-the-matter-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 170 (7th Cir.1992) (\"It is not bad faith to seek to gain an advantage from declaring bankruptcy&#8212;why else would one declare it?\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The [&#167; 1112(b) good faith filing] inquiry often centers around the debtor's <i>bona fide</i> need for a breathing spell to reorganize.\" <i>In re Original IFPC S'holders, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1834560\"><a href=\"/opinion/1834560/in-re-original-ifpc-shareholders-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 750 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 2004).

As in the instant case, the \"time-out\" typically delimits a creditor's contractual rights against the debtor in order to advance the prospects for a successful reorganization:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Filing a bankruptcy petition with the intent to frustrate creditors does not by itself \"establish an absence of intent to seek rehabilitation.\" Indeed, because a major purpose behind our bankruptcy laws is to afford a debtor some breathing room from creditors, it is almost inevitable that creditors will, in some sense, be \"frustrated\" when their debtor files a bankruptcy petition. In reality, there is \"a considerable gap between delaying creditors, on the eve of foreclosure, and the concept of abuse of judicial purpose.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In re Cohoes Indus.

Unlike Capitol Food, the debtors in <i>Integrated Telecom</i> and <i>Liberate Technologies</i> did not file their chapter 11 petitions with intent to reorganize a financially distressed company as an operational business, but rather, with the declared intention to <i>sell</i> a fully solvent company, <i>viz.,</i> a business fully able to pay its unsecured claims as they came due. <i>See Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 120 (\"Integrated is unquestionably `out of business,' and therefore has no going concern value to preserve in Chapter 11 through reorganization or liquidation under the Bankruptcy Code.\"); <i>Liberate Techs.,</i> 314 B.R. at 217. In order to maximize the businesses' sales value, hence the financial return their <i>shareholders</i> would realize from their anticipated sales, the debtors sought to invoke a Bankruptcy Code provision that caps the amount a lessor may recover in future rents for the debtor's default under a lease, thereby making the leases' terms more valuable and attractive to prospective purchasers of the businesses. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 506(b)(6); <i>Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 128 (noting that the establishment of a valid reorganizational purpose is a question \"antecedent\" to the right to invoke the &#167; 506(b)(6) cap).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Capitol Food unsecured creditors are likely to benefit from the now-successful reorganization, since Capitol Food's operation of the food market has restored a reliable and adequate cash flow from which it can pay its past and ongoing debts to unsecured creditors, as well as continue its timely rental payments to Fields Station under the Lease.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Far from an unworthy purpose, this type of <i>bona fide</i> rehabilitative effort is among the most fundamental aims attendant upon chapter 11 protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Fields Station has made no <i>prima facie</i> showing that Capitol Food submitted its chapter 11 petition in bad faith, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Fields Station motion to dismiss the chapter 11 petition or relief from the automatic stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The courts which endorse a good faith filing requirement primarily observe that it comports with the equitable roots of bankruptcy law, by ensuring, from the earliest stages of a bankruptcy case, that the debtor's genuine need for bankruptcy protection outweighs the burden and delay to creditors occasioned by the chapter 11 proceedings<i>See, e.g., Integrated Telecom,</i> 384 F.3d at 119. The courts which reject the requirement observe, <i>inter alia,</i> that: (i) &#167; 1112(b) expressly provides adequate alternate mechanisms for weeding out bad faith chapter 11 petitions by expressly listing several criteria warranting dismissal for \"cause\" (<i>e.g.,</i> the debtor's failure to propose a viable chapter 11 plan in good faith), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1112(b)(4)(A)-(P), yet conspicuously omits mention of any good faith filing criterion; and (ii) \"good faith\" is too vague and amorphous a term to justify dismissal <i>ab initio</i> of a chapter 11 petition before the debtor has had a fair opportunity to propose and argue for the <i>bona fides</i> of its reorganization plan. <i>See Victoria Ltd. P'ship,</i> 187 B.R. at 61-62. In the same vein, Capitol Food notes that the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.L. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (2005), recently included in the Code an explicit \"good faith\" definition in &#167; 362(c)(3)(B), (C) (provisions to discourage multiple bankruptcy filings by same debtor within one-year period), but did not so amend &#167; 1112(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fields Station predicated its bankruptcy court motions, at least in part, on allegations, based on media reports, that Capitol Food had a long history of mismanaging and neglecting the leased property (<i>e.g.,</i> repeated health violations). Given that many companies suffer financial distress precisely because of mismanagement, we do not perceive what relevance these allegations have to the question as to whether Capitol Food filed its chapter 11 petition in bad faith. Rather, these allegations pertain principally to the prospects <i>vel non</i> that the plan proposed by Capitol Food would effect a successful rehabilitation.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
