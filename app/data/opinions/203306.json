Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Lydia Lizarríbar-Masini, by appointment of the court, on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Chief, Appellate\nDivision), on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              May 23, 2008\n\f             Per Curiam. In United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70 (1st\n\nCir. 1995), we forecast that battles over a defendant's role in the\n\noffense \"will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\"\n\nId. at 75.      This appeal illustrates why we thought that forecast\n\nappropriate.\n\n             The tale can quickly be told.         On September 28, 2005, a\n\nfederal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned\n\na   two-count    indictment     against      defendant-appellant     Dianneris\n\nRodríguez-Guerrero.        Count   1     charged   her    with   knowingly   and\n\nintentionally possessing heroin with intent to distribute, see 21\n\nU.S.C. §841(a)(1); and count 2 charged her with importing heroin\n\nfrom the Dominican Republic into the United States, see id. §952.\n\nAfter initially maintaining her innocence, the appellant tendered\n\na   guilty   plea   to   both   counts    pursuant   to    a   negotiated    plea\n\nagreement.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(A)-(B).            Pertinently, the\n\nplea agreement left open the appellant's role in the underlying\n\ncriminal activity.\n\n             The undisputed facts showed that the appellant had served\n\nas a courier for a drug smuggler.            She was caught red-handed while\n\ndisembarking from the ferry, at Mayagüez, driving a Chrysler minivan\n\nbearing Puerto Rico license plates. The minivan had a spare battery\n\nin its cargo compartment which, upon inspection, was found to\n\ncontain more than two kilograms of heroin.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            The   district    court   held   the   disposition   hearing    on\n\nDecember 22, 2006. It determined that the appellant was a minor but\n\nnot a minimal participant in the offenses of conviction.            See USSG\n\n§3B1.2(a)-(b)(2006).      Taking   into     account   this   mitigating    role\n\nadjustment and other guideline computations not at issue here, the\n\ncourt sentenced the appellant to a 46-month incarcerative term on\n\neach   count   (to   be   served   concurrently).       This   timely    appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            In this venue, the appellant advances only a solitary\n\nclaim of error.      She asserts that the sentencing court's refusal to\n\naward her a more generous mitigating role adjustment was incorrect\n\nand requires a remand for resentencing.\n\n            Our standard of review is not appellant-friendly.             Role-\n\nin-the-offense       determinations    typically      are    factbound    and,\n\ntherefore, we will reverse the denial of minimal participant status\n\nonly for clear error.        See United States v. Mateo-Espejo, 426 F.3d\n\n508, 512 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Mateo-Sánchez, 166 F.3d\n\n413, 417 (1st Cir. 1999). The defendant bears the burden of proving\n\nher entitlement to any downward adjustment, including a downward\n\nadjustment for minimal participation.         See, e.g., Mateo-Espejo, 426\n\nF.3d at 512; United States v. Muñoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1238 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n            With these principles in mind, we turn to the matter of\n\nmitigating role adjustments. The guidelines authorize a sentencing\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcourt to decrease a defendant's offense level by four levels if she\n\nwas   \"a    minimal   participant\"   in     the    criminal    activity.      USSG\n\n§3B1.2(a)(2006).        The commentary to this guideline indicates,\n\nsomewhat tautologically, that it applies to a defendant who plays\n\na minimal role in that activity.          Id., cmt. (n.4).        The Sentencing\n\nCommission      has   made   clear   that    the     adjustment    for     minimal\n\nparticipation should be invoked sparingly.             See id.\n\n              The line between minor and minimal participation is fuzzy.\n\nIn the last analysis, that distinction comes down to a judgment\n\ncall.      Labels are not dispositive.\n\n              This last precept is important because, in this case, the\n\nappellant emphasizes that she was \"merely\" a courier.               It is plain,\n\nhowever, that drug couriers are not automatically entitled to\n\nmitigating rule adjustments for minimal participation.                See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Davis, 36 F.3d 1424, 1436 (9th Cir. 1994); United\n\nStates v. Garcia, 920 F.2d 153, 155 (2d Cir. 1990); United States\n\nv. Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d 396, 399 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v.\n\nBuenrostro, 868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir. 1989).                Everything depends\n\non the idiosyncratic circumstances of the particular case. See USSG\n\n§3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(C)).\n\n              Here, the record shows a plausible basis for believing\n\nthat the appellant was more than a minimal participant.                        She\n\nregistered the minivan used to transport the contraband in her own\n\nname, drove it to the Dominican Republic, waited while the drugs\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwere loaded aboard, and then tried to smuggle them into the United\n\nStates.   This course of conduct, coupled with the quantity and type\n\nof drugs — upwards of two kilograms of heroin — argues convincingly\n\nagainst a finding of minimal participation.\n\n            We need go no further. At the very least, the appellant's\n\ninvolvement   in   the   criminal   activity   lends   itself   to   varying\n\ninferences as to how her role should be characterized.           That ends\n\nthe matter: \"where there is more than one plausible view of the\n\ncircumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable\n\nalternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\"        United States v. Ruiz,\n\n905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
