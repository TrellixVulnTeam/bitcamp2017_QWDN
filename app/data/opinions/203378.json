René Vázquez-Botet (\"Vázquez\")\n\nand Marcos Morell-Corrada (\"Morell\") were convicted of conspiracy,\n\nextortion, and mail and wire fraud for their roles in demanding\n\nmoney from construction contractors in exchange for using their\n\ninfluence in the Puerto Rico government to secure them a major\n\nproject.    On appeal, the defendants claim that the district court\n\ncommitted   a   myriad    of   errors      invalidating     their        convictions;\n\nalternatively, they claim errors requiring remand for resentencing.\n\nAfter careful consideration of each of these arguments in light of\n\nthe record, we affirm both defendants' convictions and sentences.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n            Because Morell challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting his conviction, we relate the facts \"as the jury could\n\nhave    found   them,    drawing    all     inferences     in   the       light   most\n\nconsistent with the jury's verdict.\"            United States v. Colón-Díaz,\n\n521 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2008) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).         We consider only those facts relevant to the\n\nissues on appeal.        In August 1994, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and\n\nSewer    Authority      (\"PRASA\")    solicited      bids     from        construction\n\ncontractors     to   build     a    large      water   pipe     --       dubbed   the\n\n\"Superaqueduct\" -- along Puerto Rico's north coast.                  The magnitude\n\nof the project required the bidding contractors to form consortia\n\nwith    local   subcontractors       for      the   provision       of     equipment,\n\nexpertise, financial resources, and labor.                 One of the aspirants\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas a consortium led by contractor Thames-Dick, a joint venture\n\nbetween a British firm and the Dick Corporation of Pennsylvania.\n\nWithin the Thames-Dick consortium were a number of Puerto Rico\n\nsubcontractors:     (1) Las Piedras Construction, owned by Pedro\n\n\"Cuco\" Feliciano; (2) Constructora Hato Rey, owned by Waldemar\n\nCamrona; (3) Longo de Puerto Rico, owned by Greg Laracy; (4)\n\nCarrero    Engineering,   owned   by     Alberto   \"Tico\"   Carrero;   and\n\n(5) Cobián, Agustín & Ramos, controlled by José Cobián-Guzmán\n\n(\"Cobián\").    Thames-Dick won the $305 million contract in January\n\n1996; it began construction in September 1996 and finished in 2000.\n\n           Cobián, a key government witness, testified at trial that\n\nhe knew from experience that, in order for his consortium to be\n\nawarded the contract, he would need to bribe someone influential in\n\nthe government, which at the time was controlled by the New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\").    Thus, in June 1995, Cobián approached\n\nVázquez, an ophthalmologist and the manager of Governor Pedro\n\nRosselló's reelection campaign.        Several witnesses testified that\n\nVázquez was believed to hold an almost unparalleled degree of sway\n\nwithin the Rosselló government.        Vázquez told Cobián that he would\n\ndo what he could in exchange for two percent of the total value of\n\nthe contracts awarded to the Thames-Dick subcontractors.           Cobián\n\nexplained that the subcontractors' share of the total would be more\n\nthan $200 million; two percent was estimated to be about $2.4\n\nmillion.      Vázquez indicated that Morell, an attorney and NPP\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fSecretary-General, and José Granados-Navedo (\"Granados\"), the NPP\n\nchair of the House of Representatives infrastructure committee,\n\nwould be assisting him and would need a share of the $2 million.\n\nCobián proposed that it be split four ways, with him receiving a\n\nquarter; Vázquez acquiesced.   Vázquez said he would deal only with\n\nCobián and must be paid in cash, and that Cobián should approach\n\nMorell and Granados directly to arrange their payments.    Vázquez\n\ndid not explain to Cobián what actions he or others would take to\n\nmake sure Thames-Dick got the contract.\n\n          Cobián then went to subcontractors Feliciano, Carmona,\n\nLaracy, and Carrero and told them that together they would have to\n\npay two percent of their part of the contract award to purchase the\n\nassistance of influential people in the government.   Although the\n\nsubcontractors had not delegated authority to Cobián to make such\n\na deal on their behalf, they grudgingly agreed to pay.\n\n          The subcontractors paid Cobián incrementally as they\n\nreceived payments from Thames-Dick.    They understood that Cobián\n\nwould then pass the payments on to the politicians in question.\n\nCobián delivered monthly cash payments to Vázquez in his office,\n\nand made other payments to third parties for NPP campaign expenses\n\nowed them by Vázquez.   On one occasion Feliciano, who had figured\n\nout that Vázquez was one of the recipients of the extortionate\n\npayments, made a $5,760 payment to him in person at his medical\n\noffice.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           On Vázquez's instructions, Cobián went to Morell's law\n\noffice to arrange how his payments would be made.          Morell drew up\n\na sham contract under which Cobián was to pay Morell's law firm\n\n$5,000 per month for legal services; Cobián made these monthly\n\npayments from 1997 to 1999.           In addition, Morell and Cobián\n\narranged for Cobián to make several payments to third parties\n\n(including Sears, a rental car company, an architectural firm, and\n\na basketball team) on Morell's behalf.             Morell never actually\n\nperformed any legal services for Cobián or his company.             Cobián\n\nsimilarly made payments to third parties on Granados's behalf, and\n\nalso made some cash payments to Granados.\n\n           In all, the subcontractors gave Cobián cash and checks\n\ntotaling over $1 million; of this, Vázquez received the equivalent\n\nof over $360,000, and Morell received over $125,000.                Vázquez\n\nfailed to report to the Puerto Rico Treasury Department the money\n\nhe received from Cobián from 1997 to 1999, and concealed thousands\n\nmore dollars of cash payments made to him by his ophthalmology\n\npatients and businesses involved in healthcare services.             Morell\n\nreported on his tax returns payments to his law firm by Cobián in\n\n1997 and 1998 under the sham contract.       Morell failed to report the\n\napproximately   $25,000   paid   in   1999   and   the   many   third-party\n\npayments made by Cobián, which totaled some $23,000; he also failed\n\nto report payments from other clients in 1998 totaling about\n\n$22,000.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f             In July 1999, when Cobián learned that he had been\n\nindicted for unrelated conduct, he panicked and stopped making\n\npayments to Vázquez, Morell, and Granados.            After pleading guilty\n\nto the indictment, Cobián decided to cooperate with the Government\n\nin exchange for immunity with respect to further crimes for which\n\nhe might implicate himself in rendering such cooperation, and the\n\nGovernment's recommendation of a sentencing reduction. Cobián then\n\ntold investigators of the details of the Superaqueduct extortion\n\nscheme. On the basis of this and other information, the Government\n\nsought indictments against Vázquez, Morell, and Granados.\n\n             On   April   8,   2004,   a   grand   jury   returned   a   public\n\nindictment charging Vázquez and Morell with the following: (1) one\n\ncount of conspiracy to commit extortion and launder money in\n\nfurtherance of a bribery scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;\n\n(2) several counts of extortion under color of official right and\n\nby economic fear, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951,\n\nand aiding and abetting this offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2; and (3)\n\nseveral counts of mail and wire fraud committed as part of a scheme\n\nto defraud Puerto Rico of income tax payments, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2, 1341, and 1343.1          The Government's central theory was\n\nthat   the    defendants       and   Granados   conspired    to   induce   the\n\nsubcontractors to pay them a portion of their Superaqueduct profits\n\n\n1\n   Morell was also charged with obstruction of justice under 18\nU.S.C. § 1503 but was acquitted on this count, and this charge is\nnot at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fby making them fear that if they did not pay (and keep making\n\nperiodic payments), the defendants and Granados would use their\n\ninfluence in the government:               (1) to promote the subcontractors'\n\ncompetitors for the bid; (2) to remove the subcontractors from the\n\ncontract after it was already awarded; or (3) would malign their\n\nprofessional reputations so that their respective businesses would\n\nnot receive government contracts in the future.\n\n               After we ordered the recusal of the original trial judge\n\nfrom this case, see In re United States, 441 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), the case was randomly reassigned to Chief Judge Fusté.\n\nVázquez moved to recuse Chief Judge Fusté on a number of grounds,\n\nand Chief Judge Fusté denied the motion, United States v. Vázquez-\n\nBotet, 453 F. Supp. 2d 362, 374 (D.P.R. 2006).                  We denied mandamus\n\nrelief, noting that Vázquez could challenge the non-recusal on end-\n\nof-case appeal if he were found guilty.                   In re Vázquez-Botet, 464\n\nF.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (\"Vázquez-Botet I\") (facts\n\npresented by Vázquez did not present the \"'clear and indisputable'\"\n\nright    to     immediate    mandamus       relief        necessary     for     such    an\n\nextraordinary remedy (quoting In re Cargill, Inc., 66 F.3d 1256,\n\n1262    (1st    Cir.    1995))).         Vázquez    now    avails     himself    of    the\n\nopportunity to appeal the non-recusal.\n\n               Before   trial,     the    then-lead       prosecutor     of   the      U.S.\n\nAttorney's       Office     in   Puerto      Rico     granted       several     of     the\n\nsubcontractors immunity from prosecution in exchange for their\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\ftestimony.     Cobián also testified with immunity under the prior\n\nagreement, and Granados pled guilty to crimes committed in carrying\n\nout his role in the extortion scheme and also testified for the\n\nGovernment.      During the pretrial phase, responsibility for the\n\nprosecution of the case was transferred from the U.S. Attorney's\n\nOffice in Puerto Rico to the Public Integrity Section of the\n\nDepartment of Justice in Washington, D.C.\n\n             On September 25, 2006 -- the day before trial was set to\n\nbegin and more than two years after he was indicted -- Vázquez\n\nsubpoenaed two witnesses, hereinafter \"Witness A\" and \"Witness B,\"\n\nto compel their testimony at trial; he also served a subpoena on\n\nDick    Corporation    for   the     production    of       certain    documents.\n\nWitness A was a Dick Corporation official and Witness B was a\n\nconsultant     hired   by    Dick    Corporation       to    conduct   marketing\n\nactivities inside and outside Puerto Rico, including negotiations\n\nfor    the   construction    of    \"intercity   connectors\"       --   pipelines\n\nconnecting the Superaqueduct to municipal water systems.2                Vázquez\n\nsought to argue at trial, inter alia, that it was Witness B,\n\nanother consultant (\"Consultant C\"), and powerful persons for whom\n\nthey worked who extorted money from the subcontractors in exchange\n\nfor the Superaqueduct contract, and not Vázquez.                The Government,\n\nDick   Corporation,    and   Witness    B    opposed    the   subpoenas.     The\n\n\n\n2\n   The indictment against Vázquez and Morell did not allege any\ncorruption or extortion with respect to the intercity connectors.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdistrict court ruled the proposed evidence irrelevant in light of\n\nthe uncontradicted statements of Witnesses A and B to investigators\n\nthat any relationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation began\n\nat    least   two    years   after    the    Superaqueduct   project       had   been\n\nawarded.      But the court stated that it would allow the defendants\n\nto make an offer of proof nonetheless, in order to create a record\n\nof its relevancy decision for appellate review.\n\n              Accordingly, on October 16, 2006, the district court held\n\na hearing at which Vázquez questioned Witnesses A and B and the\n\nGovernment cross-examined Witness A.3 The court closed the hearing\n\nto the press and public to preclude what it feared would be a\n\n\"sideshow\"; the court clarified that \"[t]his is not part of the\n\ntrial.    This is a hearing to determine relevancy.\"            Both witnesses\n\ntestified that Witness B and Consultant C did not represent Dick\n\nCorporation in its efforts to obtain the Superaqueduct contract for\n\nthe    Thames-Dick     consortium.          They   also   testified       that   Dick\n\nCorporation did not even hire Witness B until 1998 or 1999 -- at\n\nleast two years after the awarding of the contract when the project\n\nwas    nearing      completion   --    and     hired   Consultant     C    sometime\n\nthereafter.      Witnesses A and B also testified that, to the extent\n\nthat the tasks Witness B performed on behalf of Thames-Dick had\n\nanything to do with the Superaqueduct project, they were confined\n\nto negotiations surrounding the intercity connectors.\n\n\n3\n     The Government chose not to cross-examine Witness B.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f            On October 19, 2006, the district court issued a sealed\n\norder confirming its earlier relevancy ruling and quashing both\n\nsubpoenas.       The court took account of documents submitted by Dick\n\nCorporation and the witnesses' testimony to confirm its pre-hearing\n\nassessment with respect to Witness B:              the proposed evidence was\n\nirrelevant to any triable issue or defense, as the contractual\n\nrelationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation began more than\n\ntwo years after the events giving rise to the accusations against\n\nVázquez; allowing testimony on this relationship would \"result in\n\nunnecessary       and    irrelevant     distractions.\"       With       respect   to\n\nWitness A, the court found that he had no evidence to offer that\n\nwould tend to prove or disprove Vázquez's link to any wrongdoing,\n\nsave   possible       knowledge    of   two   discrete   events    on    which    the\n\ndefendants should be permitted to question Witness A at trial; the\n\ndefendants did not ultimately avail themselves of this opportunity\n\nand    Witness    A     never   appeared   at   trial.    The     district    court\n\nmaintained the seal on all written and oral arguments in the\n\nlitigation surrounding the quashed subpoenas, and ordered that any\n\npublic dissemination of the hearing transcript or the exhibits\n\nproffered at the hearing would result in \"severe penalties by\n\ncontempt or otherwise.\"            The court denied Vázquez's post-trial\n\nmotion to unseal this portion of the record.               Vázquez and Morell\n\nnow argue before us that these decisions effected a violation of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\ftheir Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, compelling us to\n\nvacate their convictions.\n\n               Trial   began   on    September    26,    2006.     Among   others,\n\nFeliciano, Carmona, Cobián, and Granados testified as government\n\nwitnesses. Among many other things, Cobián testified on direct that\n\nVázquez told him Morell would be among those helping Thames-Dick to\n\nsecure    the    Superaqueduct       contract.     Morell    objected      to   this\n\ntestimony as hearsay not covered by the coconspirator exemption in\n\nFederal    Rule    of    Evidence     801(d)(2)(E).        The    district      court\n\nprovisionally      allowed     the    testimony    and    later    confirmed     the\n\napplicability of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) and kept the testimony on the\n\nrecord. Morell now claims this ruling constituted reversible error.\n\n               The Government also called the co-case agent, Federal\n\nBureau    of    Investigation       (\"FBI\")    special   agent    Ivan   Vitousek.\n\nVitousek testified about a number of FBI investigatory practices,\n\nincluding that of using cooperators in public corruption cases.                   In\n\nthe course of direct and cross-examination, Vitousek made several\n\nstatements that the defendants characterized as improper bolstering\n\nof the credibility of other government witnesses.                    Vázquez and\n\nMorell argue on appeal that Vitousek's vouching made the jury more\n\nlikely to believe these witnesses, thus prejudicing the outcome of\n\nthe trial to their detriment.                 During closing arguments, the\n\nprosecutor made a number of statements the defendants now brand as\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fprosecutorial misconduct mandating retrial.       We discuss all these\n\nchallenges in greater detail below.\n\n           On November 3, 2006, the jury convicted Vázquez and Morell\n\non the conspiracy count, on several of the extortion counts, and on\n\nseveral of the mail and wire fraud counts. On January 30, 2007, the\n\ndistrict court sentenced Vázquez and Morell each to five years'\n\nimprisonment, and a $100,000 fine.       The court determined their\n\nrespective guideline Sentencing ranges (\"GSRs\") by looking at the\n\ntotal amount of profit earned by the subcontractors -- some $10\n\nmillion. On appeal, both defendants challenge the propriety of this\n\nmethodology.\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n           A.   Chief Judge Fusté's Non-Recusal\n\n           Before trial, Vázquez moved for Chief Judge Fusté to\n\nrecuse himself, claiming recusal was required for a number of\n\nreasons.   Chief Judge Fusté denied the motion, Vázquez-Botet, 453\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 374, and Vázquez petitioned us for mandamus relief,\n\nwhich we denied, Vázquez-Botet I, 464 F.3d at 57.          On appeal,\n\nVázquez renews his claim that Chief Judge Fusté should have been\n\nrecused, but narrows the focus to two arguments.      We address these\n\nin turn. We will sustain Chief Judge Fusté's decision not to recuse\n\nhimself unless we find that it \"cannot be defended as a rational\n\nconclusion supported by [a] reasonable reading of the record.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fUnited States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\nIn re United States, 158 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            Vázquez first questions Chief Judge Fusté's partiality\n\nbecause of the professional activities of the judge's wife, an\n\nattorney named Rachel Brill, in matters tangentially related to this\n\ncase.    Specifically, Brill represented subcontractor Laracy during\n\nseveral meetings between Laracy and the Government, negotiated the\n\nagreement that provided Laracy with immunity in exchange for his\n\ngrand jury and trial testimony in this case, and represented him\n\nwhen he testified before the grand jury that indicted Vázquez.\n\nBrill also represented José Ventura, another local contractor not\n\ninvolved in the events at issue here.              During this representation,\n\nBrill filed a public motion in the district court (presided over by\n\na   different   judge)    in     which    she    requested   sanctions   against\n\nVázquez's lawyer for attempting to intimidate Ventura.                     After\n\nVázquez had been indicted, Brill sent a letter to Vázquez's lawyers\n\naccusing Vázquez of trying to extort money out of Ventura by falsely\n\naccusing Ventura of slander; Brill copied this letter to the\n\nprosecutors in this case so they could investigate whether Vázquez\n\nhad thereby violated his bail conditions.\n\n            Vázquez argues that Chief Judge Fusté's decision not to\n\nrecuse   himself   in    light    of     his    wife's   activities   constitutes\n\nreversible error under 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(5)(ii) (judge shall\n\ndisqualify himself if spouse \"[i]s acting as a lawyer in the\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fproceeding\"); see also id. § 455(d)(1) (\"'[P]roceeding' includes\n\npretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation.\").\n\nWe disagree.     As we noted in Vázquez-Botet I, \"while an attorney\n\nneed not be 'enrolled as counsel' of record in order to fall within\n\n[§ 455(b)(5)(ii)], the attorney must at least 'actually participate\n\nin the case.'\"     464 F.3d at 58 (quoting McCuin v. Tex. Power & Light\n\nCo., 714 F.2d 1255, 1260 (5th Cir. 1983)) (citations and alteration\n\nomitted); accord United States ex rel. Weinberger v. Equifax, Inc.,\n\n557 F.2d 456, 463-64 (5th Cir. 1977) (recusal required where judge's\n\nfamily member actively participates).          Chief Judge Fusté has issued\n\na standing order that Brill not appear as an attorney in any\n\nproceeding before him.      In line with this directive, Brill did not\n\nappear before him in this case, as counsel for Ventura, Laracy, or\n\nanyone else.\n\n           Specifically with respect to Brill's representation of\n\nVentura, it is clear that neither of the incidents impugned by\n\nVázquez   counts    as   \"actually      participat[ing]   in   th[is]   case.\"\n\nVázquez-Botet    I,   464   F.3d   at    58.   Brill's    motion   requesting\n\nsanctions against Vázquez's lawyer on Ventura's behalf occurred\n\nbefore Vázquez was even indicted.           We reaffirm our observation in\n\nVázquez-Botet I that this action thus fell outside the scope of\n\n\"pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation.\"\n\n464 F.3d at 58 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 455(d)(1)). In Vázquez-Botet I,\n\nwe likewise rejected Vázquez's other contention relating to Ventura:\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthat Brill's post-indictment letter to Vázquez's lawyers, copied to\n\nthe prosecutor in this case, somehow converted her into a lawyer\n\nacting in this proceeding.   Id. at 59.    Brill sent this letter in\n\nresponse to a communication from Vázquez directly to Ventura seeking\n\n$10 million for allegedly slandering him during testimony in other\n\njudicial and legislative proceedings.     In her letter, Brill cited\n\na statutory privilege for Ventura's testimony and characterized\n\nVázquez's demand as \"laughable.\"   However, while she remarked that\n\nVázquez's demand may also have been extortionate, she did not accuse\n\nhim of extortion outright.   And the prosecutor did not act on the\n\nletter by, for example, requesting sanctions against Vázquez for\n\nviolating his bail conditions, adding charges against him in this\n\ncase, or issuing a separate indictment for attempting to extort\n\nmoney out of Ventura.   Moreover, Brill made no submissions before\n\nthe district court in this case requesting action against Vázquez;\n\nno party sought introduction of Brill's letter into evidence or made\n\nany reference to it; and Ventura was not called to testify.    These\n\nconsiderations lead us readily to conclude, as we did in Vázquez-\n\nBotet I, that any connection between Brill's letter and the events\n\nin this case was simply too tangential to qualify her as a lawyer\n\nacting in the proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f           As for Laracy, while he did testify at trial, he was not\n\nrepresented by Brill at the time.4          Brill's representation in the\n\nnegotiations for Laracy's immunity agreement occurred more than ten\n\nmonths prior to Vázquez's indictment, and Brill was not mentioned\n\nat any point during the trial. Thus, as we held in Vázquez-Botet I,\n\nBrill's representation did not constitute acting in this proceeding.\n\n464 F.3d at 58.    We also expressed doubts in Vázquez-Botet I that\n\nher representation of Laracy during his grand jury testimony could\n\nbe considered part of this proceeding because the grand jury is\n\nfunctionally and constitutionally separate from the district court.\n\nId. at 58 n.6 (citing In re United States, 441 F.3d at 57).           Today\n\nwe confirm our formerly expressed views and hold that, for purposes\n\nof the recusal statute, the grand jury hearing was separate from\n\npretrial and trial proceedings in the district court.\n\n           Vázquez bases his second challenge to Chief Judge Fusté's\n\nimpartiality on the more general language of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a),\n\nwhich   requires   recusal   where    the   judge's   \"impartiality   might\n\nreasonably be questioned.\"      Vázquez argues that a reasonable and\n\ninformed member of the public could fairly conclude that Chief Judge\n\nFusté was biased against him because Brill openly took sides in this\n\nlitigation by asking another judge to sanction Vázquez's lawyer;\n\nmoreover, as a conjugal partnership under Puerto Rico law, Chief\n\n\n\n4\n   It is unclear from the record whether Laracy was accompanied by\nany lawyer when he gave this testimony.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fJudge Fusté and Brill necessarily shared in the legal fees paid the\n\nlatter by Laracy, and the public surely believes the two talk about\n\ntheir work in private.           These arguments are unavailing.\n\n           Section 455(a) requires us to examine whether a reasonable\n\nobserver, knowing all the relevant facts, would have doubts about\n\nChief Judge Fusté's impartiality in this proceeding.                     Liljeberg v.\n\nHealth   Serv.    Acquisition          Corp.,    486    U.S.   847,   860-61   (1988).\n\nVázquez's speculative arguments assume that Brill played a much more\n\nsignificant      role    than    she    actually       did.     Critically,    Brill's\n\ninvolvement      in     this    case    and     in   other     matters   tangentially\n\nimplicating Vázquez occurred more than two years before Chief Judge\n\nFusté was randomly assigned to replace the original district judge.\n\nTo that end, Vázquez provides no explanation as to how Brill's fees\n\ncould possibly have biased Chief Judge Fusté against Vázquez or\n\nadversely affected any of his rulings.                  Furthermore, no reasonable\n\nobserver would interpret Brill's advocacy on behalf of Ventura as\n\nevincing some sort of personal animosity toward Vázquez that somehow\n\nendured through pretrial and trial proceedings and prompted her to\n\ndisparage him in front of her husband.\n\n           For these reasons, we cannot say that Chief Judge Fusté's\n\ndecision not to recuse himself was irrational or lacked support on\n\na reasonable reading of the record.                    Snyder, 235 F.3d at 46.     As\n\nsuch, we dismiss this ground of appeal and proceed to the next one.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f            B.   The Closed Relevancy Hearing\n\n            Vázquez and Morell argue that the October 16, 2006 closed\n\nhearing violated their Sixth Amendment rights to a public trial and\n\nto present evidence in their own defense.          See Waller v. Georgia,\n\n467 U.S. 39, 47 (1984); In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273 (1948). The\n\ndefendants argue that these errors were structural and we must,\n\ntherefore, vacate their convictions.          See Owens v. United States,\n\n483 F.3d 48, 64 (1st Cir. 2007).              We allowed two Puerto Rico\n\nnewspapers and two radio stations to appear jointly as amici\n\ncuriae.5   In their brief and in oral arguments before us, the amici\n\njoined the defendants in objecting to the October 16 hearing, but\n\non a new ground:      that the hearing's closure and the sealing of\n\nrelated    documentation   violated     the   press   and   public's   First\n\nAmendment right of access to criminal proceedings.               See Globe\n\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Court for the County of Norfolk, 457 U.S.\n\n596, 603 (1982).    The Government counters that, as explicitly noted\n\nby the district court, this particular hearing was merely an offer\n\nof proof to preserve the court's relevancy determination, and that\n\nneither the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights nor the press and\n\npublic's   First   Amendment   rights    were   implicated.6     Under   the\n\n\n5\n   The amici point out that this case has received high media\nattention in Puerto Rico due to the defendants' notoriety and\nletters to newspapers written by Vázquez professing that what was\ndiscussed at the October 16 hearing exonerates him.\n6\n    The Government also asserts that the press may not raise a\nFirst Amendment argument not raised by one of the parties.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fcircumstances, the Government is correct on the first point; we need\n\nnot reach the merits of the second.\n\n           Vázquez proffered the testimony of Witness A and Witness B\n\nand the subpoenaed Dick Corporation documents in an attempt to show\n\nthat Witness B, Consultant C, and powerful persons for whom they\n\nworked were the ones who extorted money out of the subcontractors\n\nin exchange for the Superaqueduct contract, and that the defendants\n\nwere framed in order to throw suspicion off of these and other\n\nimplicated individuals. After considering the testimony of Witness\n\nA and Witness B from the October 16 hearing, the district court\n\nconfirmed its earlier ruling that the evidence was mostly irrelevant\n\nto any matter at issue in the trial of Vázquez and Morell.               The\n\ncourt   focused   primarily   on   the    timeline   of   the    contractual\n\nrelationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation.            Witness A and\n\nWitness B indicated that Witness B began working informally on\n\nbehalf of Dick Corporation sometime in 1998, as a consultant and\n\nmarketing agent for the company in several construction projects in\n\nPuerto Rico and elsewhere.     This relationship was formalized in a\n\nwritten contract in the fall of 1999, and Consultant C was hired at\n\naround the same time.   The witnesses also testified that Witness B\n\nand Consultant C had nothing to do with the 1995-96 discussions\n\nsurrounding the Superaqueduct bid. The district court also examined\n\ndocuments submitted by Dick Corporation, which confirmed that the\n\ncontractual relationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fbegan well after the bid was awarded, and opined that Vázquez's\n\nsubpoena   to   Dick   Corporation    \"was   a   broad,   sweeping   fishing\n\nexpedition.\" The court concluded that Vázquez's theory that Witness\n\nB was involved in the Superaqueduct extortion scheme was unfounded\n\nspeculation and that any evidence Witness B could provide at trial\n\nwould be irrelevant, and accordingly quashed Vázquez's subpoenas to\n\nWitness B and Dick Corporation.7             The court ordered that the\n\ntranscript of the October 16 hearing and the proffered exhibits\n\nremain sealed, and warned that their divulgence would be punished\n\nby contempt.\n\n           We first address the defendants' contention that the\n\ndistrict court's relevancy ruling deprived them of an opportunity\n\nto present exonerating evidence to the jury, and thus violated their\n\nSixth Amendment right to defend themselves.         We afford the district\n\ncourt considerable discretion in making relevancy determinations and\n\nin excluding evidence for lack of relevance, and our review of such\n\ndeterminations is for abuse of discretion.        Richards v. Relentless,\n\nInc., 341 F.3d 35, 49 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n7\n    The court found Witness A's proposed testimony minimally\nrelevant with respect to \"two very discrete areas,\" and left the\nsubpoena intact insofar as the defendants wished to ask him\nquestions only in relation to these areas.      These areas had no\nbearing on whether someone other than Vázquez, Morell, and Granados\nwas extorting money from the subcontractors.       The defendants'\ndecision not to call Witness A at trial waives any objection\nregarding that potential testimony.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f          After examining the October 16 hearing transcript, the\n\ndocuments provided by Dick Corporation, and the submissions of the\n\nparties, we agree with the district court that the proposed evidence\n\nwas irrelevant to any issue in the prosecution of Vázquez and\n\nMorell; we also agree that to place such evidence in front of the\n\njury would have resulted in a confusing and distracting sideshow.\n\nNothing in the transcript, the Dick Corporation documents submitted\n\nat the hearing, or the sealed written submissions contains any\n\nsuggestion that Witness B or Consultant C was connected in any way\n\nto the Superaqueduct project until at least 1998, and then only\n\ntangentially    with   respect   to    the   intercity        connectors,     which\n\ninvolved a completely separate contract.             Moreover, nothing in the\n\nrecord reveals that either individual was involved in any scheme to\n\nextort money from the subcontractors.              The conduct the jury found\n\nto be extortionate began in June 1995, when Vázquez told Cobián that\n\nhe, Morell, and Granados would use their influence to help Thames-\n\nDick win the contract in exchange for money.                While the effects of\n\nthis conduct -- including the subcontractors' monthly payments to\n\nthe defendants and Granados -- continued for several years and\n\npartially overlapped in time with Witness B's and Consultant C's\n\nemployment     at   Dick   Corporation,      the     main    criminal   act     was\n\naccomplished long before these two persons appeared on the scene.\n\nIndeed, Witness B testified that he had no contact at all with the\n\nindividual subcontractors with the exception of Carrero, with whom\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fhe had a social relationship and worked on matters unrelated to the\n\nSuperaqueduct.         Witness B's testimony also indicates that his\n\ncontacts with persons in the Rosselló government were minimal and\n\nhis influence over them virtually nil.\n\n            The   district    court    did    not,    therefore,     abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in deeming the proposed evidence irrelevant and excluding\n\nit from the trial.       See Achille Bayart & Cie v. Crowe, 238 F.3d 44,\n\n49 (1st Cir. 2001); cf. United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1118\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (affirming district court's denial of subpoenas for\n\nthree proposed defense witnesses where the anticipated testimony\n\nwould   have    been    irrelevant,   in     part    because   the   witnesses'\n\ninvolvement with the defendant occurred subsequent to his criminal\n\nconduct).      This conclusion disposes of the defendants' claim that\n\nthe district court violated their Sixth Amendment right to present\n\na defense, as no such right exists where the evidence proffered has\n\nbeen properly ruled irrelevant.        See United States v. Maxwell, 254\n\nF.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001) (defendant's \"wide-ranging right to\n\npresent a defense\" still \"does not give him a right to present\n\nirrelevant evidence\") (citing In re Oliver, 333 U.S. at 273-74\n\n& n.31); United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 108 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(no \"'unfettered'\" Sixth Amendment right \"'to offer [evidence] that\n\nis incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard\n\nrules of evidence'\" (quoting Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 42\n\n(1996))).\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f            We therefore turn to the defendants' remaining argument\n\nconcerning the October 16 hearing:      that the closure of the hearing\n\nand sealing of related documentation violated their Sixth Amendment\n\nright to a public trial.     Our review of this (preserved) claim is\n\nplenary.     See United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).     Despite the defendants' sweeping assertions regarding the\n\nscope of the public-trial right, the question before us is quite\n\nnarrow.    We think it clear that, as characterized by the district\n\ncourt, the October 16 hearing was not a trial session, but rather\n\na \"question-and-answer\" offer of proof,8 the purpose of which was to\n\ncreate a record so that we could determine the propriety of the\n\ncourt's relevancy ruling.9    See Wright & Graham, Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 5040.3, at 908 (2d ed. 2005) (in question-and-answer\n\noffer of proof, proponent elicits proposed testimony by questioning\n\nwitness outside jury's presence); accord United States v. Adams, 271\n\n\n8\n     Although the actual hearing took place on October 16, 2006 --\nnearly three weeks after opening statements -- the subpoenas that\nresulted in the hearing were issued before trial began, and the\ndistrict court expressly stated at the start of the hearing that it\nwas not part of the trial.\n9\n   Although the district court did not use the term \"offer of\nproof,\" it is evident from the context that this is what the court\nintended. Black's Legal Dictionary defines offer of proof as \"[a]\npresentation of evidence for the record (but outside the jury's\npresence) . . . so that the evidence can be preserved on the record\nfor an appeal of the judge's ruling. . . .       Such an offer may\ninclude tangible evidence or testimony (through questions and\nanswers, a lawyer's narrative description, or an affidavit).\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1114 (8th ed. 2004).\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fF.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir. 2001) (discussing the several types of\n\noffer of proof, and expressing a preference for the question-and-\n\nanswer type).\n\n            The defendants point to no precedent in the Supreme Court,\n\nthis circuit, or elsewhere extending the Sixth Amendment public-\n\ntrial right to an outside-of-trial, question-and-answer offer of\n\nproof -- or indeed, any type of offer of proof.           Furthermore, the\n\nOctober 16 hearing differed in at least two fundamental respects\n\nfrom the categories of non-trial hearings to which the Sixth\n\nAmendment public-trial right has been held to apply in the past,\n\nsuch as hearings on motions to suppress, see, e.g., Waller, 467 U.S.\n\nat 47, and jury-selection proceedings, see, e.g., Owens, 483 F.3d\n\nat 62.     First, the evidence elicited at the hearing had already\n\n(correctly) been ruled irrelevant.        Cf. Brown v. Kuhlmann, 142 F.3d\n\n529, 541 (2d Cir. 1998) (courtroom closure during trial did not\n\ninfringe    Sixth   Amendment   rights    where   it   involved   cumulative\n\ntestimony related to matter collateral to charged offense). Second,\n\nthe district court was under no obligation to hold the hearing in\n\nthe first place, but chose to do so for our and the defendants'\n\nbenefit when confronted with Vázquez's eleventh-hour request.\n\n            These differences render the Sixth Amendment precedent\n\ninvoked by the defendants inapposite in the circumstances.             While\n\nwe leave open the possibility that the public-trial right may apply\n\nto some offer-of-proof hearings, we decline to recognize such a\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fright on facts as uncompelling as these.10         We accordingly reject\n\nthis ground of appeal.11\n\n            The amici argue that the closure of the October 16 hearing\n\nviolated the press and public's First Amendment right of access to\n\ncriminal proceedings.      As a remedy, the amici ask us to lift the\n\ndistrict court's seal on the hearing transcript along with the gag\n\norder on those who know its contents, so that the press may examine\n\nand report on what transpired there.\n\n            Crucially, however, the defendants did not raise this\n\nargument.     As we have often acknowledged, we ordinarily will not\n\nconsider novel arguments advanced by an amicus on appeal, but not\n\nalso raised by a party or another entity             which has formally\n\nintervened.    See United States v. Sturm, Ruger & Co, Inc., 84 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996); Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19\n\nF.3d   685,   705   n.22   (1st   Cir.    1994)   (declining   to   address\n\nconstitutional claims advanced by amici but not raised by parties);\n\naccord Knetsch v. United States, 364 U.S. 361, 370 (1960).             The\n\n\n10\n    Vázquez would have us adopt a sweeping rule akin to that\narticulated by the Fifth Circuit in Rovinsky v. McKaskle, 722 F.2d\n197, 200 (5th Cir. 1984), which seems to hold the Sixth Amendment\nright applicable to all but a very small fraction of pretrial and\ntrial proceedings. The facts of this case do not provide us reason\nto endorse such an expansive reading of the law.\n11\n   We also note that it was entirely proper -- and indeed required\n-- for the district court to hold the hearing outside the presence\nof the jury, and thereafter to take measures to keep the\nirrelevant, and thus inadmissible, evidence from reaching the\njury's eyes and ears. See Fed. R. Evid. 103(c); United States v.\nGalin, 222 F.3d 1123, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                   -26-\n\ffacts present us with no reason to depart from the general rule.\n\nCf., e.g., United States v. Spock, 416 F.2d 165, 169 (1st Cir. 1969)\n\n(opting to consider amicus's arguments as to unconstitutionally\n\nbroad applicability of statute criminalizing aiding and abetting\n\nVietnam War draft dodging).         The amici are, of course, free to\n\nreturn to the district court in an attempt to argue that changed\n\ncircumstances have rendered the seal on the hearing transcript and\n\nrelated documentation no longer necessary, but that is an issue for\n\nthe district court -- not us -- to decide.\n\n            Having disposed of the challenges to the closed relevancy\n\nhearing, we turn to the defendants' next assignment of error.\n\n            C.   The Alleged Witness Vouching\n\n            Vázquez and Morell next argue that certain statements made\n\nby Agent Vitousek during his testimony improperly vouched for the\n\ncredibility of other government witnesses, made these witnesses more\n\ncredible in the minds of the jurors, and thus unfairly prejudiced\n\nthe outcome of the trial.         We describe the specific instances of\n\nalleged   vouching   below,   but    begin     with    the    applicable   legal\n\nframework.\n\n            A prosecutor may not vouch for one of her witnesses by\n\nmaking    personal   assurances     about    him;     she    likewise    may   not\n\naccomplish this goal by putting on another government witness, such\n\nas an FBI agent, to make such assurances.                    This practice is\n\nprohibited   because   of   its    potential    to    shore    up   a   witness's\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fcredibility by putting the prestige of the United States behind him\n\nand thereby inviting the jury to find guilt on some basis other than\n\nthe evidence presented at trial. United States v. Rosario-Díaz, 202\n\nF.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir. 2000); accord United States v. Pérez-Ruíz, 353\n\nF.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Although the prosecution's success\n\noften depends on its ability to convince the jury of a particular\n\nwitness's credibility, it cannot entice the jury to find guilt on\n\nthe basis of a [government] agent's opinion of the witness's\n\nveracity.\").\n\n          The district court's decision to admit testimony over a\n\npreserved vouching objection is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Tom, 330 F.3d 83, 94 (1st Cir. 2003).           In\n\nperforming our inquiry, we consider various criteria, including the\n\noverall strength of the Government's case against the defendant, the\n\nprosecutor's willfulness in eliciting the statement from the witness\n\nwho did the vouching, the strength and clarity of any curative\n\ninstructions, and the likelihood that any prejudice that may have\n\nsurvived the instructions affected the outcome of the case.     See\n\nUnited States v. Page, 521 F.3d 101, 108 (1st Cir. 2008); United\n\nStates v. Cormier, 468 F.3d 63, 73 (1st Cir. 2006).   In all events,\n\nwe will not vacate a defendant's conviction on vouching grounds\n\nunless the error likely affected the outcome of the trial. Tom, 330\n\nF.3d at 95; Rosario-Díaz, 202 F.3d at 65.\n\n\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f            During the first twelve days of trial, the Government\n\ncalled several of the witnesses directly involved in the extortion\n\nscheme.      Included among them were Cobián and several of the\n\nsubcontractor-witnesses, all of whom received immunity in exchange\n\nfor their cooperation or testimony, and the coconspirator Granados,\n\nwho pled guilty to his role in the extortion and also cooperated\n\nwith investigators.    On the thirteenth day, the Government called\n\nAgent Vitousek, an experienced FBI fraud investigator.\n\n            The defendants identify four episodes in which Vitousek\n\nallegedly vouched for other government witnesses; we address these\n\nin turn. First, the Government sought to elicit from Agent Vitousek\n\nthat the FBI had followed normal procedures in investigating this\n\ncase.     When the prosecutor asked Agent Vitousek why the FBI uses\n\ncooperating insiders as sources in fraud investigations, Vázquez\n\ninterposed a vouching objection which the court overruled. Vitousek\n\nthen described the procedure employed with cooperating insiders,\n\nstating such things as, \"I will tell . . . these cooperating\n\nwitnesses to tell the truth about the information they are going to\n\nprovide us,\" and \"a cooperating defendant . . . can explain exactly\n\nwhat happened.\"    We fail to see how the jury could possibly have\n\nunderstood these generic descriptions of procedure -- with no\n\nreference to any specific individual or case -- to be Vitousek's\n\nassurances that Cobián and Granados were truthful in their dealings\n\nwith the FBI or otherwise.   As the defendants provide nothing more,\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fwe will go no further than this.   See United States v. Parsons, 141\n\nF.3d 386, 390 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          The second claimed instance of vouching occurred during\n\ncross-examination by Vázquez.      Vázquez asked Vitousek about an\n\nincident in which Cobián told investigators that a certain public\n\nofficial had accepted a bribe from him; the substance of the\n\ninterview was memorialized in a nonpublic FBI report. Later, Cobián\n\nadmitted to the investigators that the official had not actually\n\naccepted a bribe.   Vázquez questioned Vitousek at length over why\n\nhe failed to correct the FBI records on this point. While conceding\n\nthat mistakes had been made, Vitousek asserted that there was little\n\nlikelihood of negative repercussions for the official because the\n\ngovernment requires much more than a single interview before it will\n\nindict someone.   \"Trust me,\" Vitousek added, \"[w]e need much more\n\nevidence.\"   Vázquez argues that this testimony gave assurances to\n\nthe jury that Vitousek would never seek the indictment of an\n\ninnocent person, and that the FBI corroborated Cobián's information\n\non Vázquez's role in the Superaqueduct extortion with \"much more\n\nevidence.\"   Since Vázquez did not timely object to this testimony\n\nor move to strike it at trial, we review the challenge for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57, 72 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nHere again, we fail to see how the jury could possibly have\n\nunderstood the testimony as bolstering the credibility of any of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fGovernment's witnesses, and Vázquez does not explain further.                  As\n\nsuch, we cannot find error, much less plain error.\n\n            The defendants' third vouching challenge gets them no\n\nfurther.    During an exchange in cross-examination, Vázquez asked\n\nAgent Vitousek several times why the Government relied on Cobián\n\ndespite    its   policy    against   dealing   with    cooperators     who   lie.\n\nUltimately, the following exchange occurred between Vázquez and\n\nVitousek:\n\n            Q.     . . . Based on the records of other\n            people, Cuco and Laracy and all the other\n            people who the jury have heard from, you could\n            prosecute Cobián?\n\n            A.      Yes.\n\n            Q.     And the Government has given him               a\n            benefit and chosen not to prosecute him.\n\n            A.      He is cooperating.\n\n            . . .\n\n            Q.     He will not         be   prosecuted     for   the\n            [Superaqueduct]?\n\n            A.     If he tells the truth. And . . . up to\n            now, the assessment has been that he has been\n            truthful.\n\nVázquez objected to this last response as vouching.              The district\n\ncourt overruled the objection, finding that Vázquez had \"opened the\n\ndoor\" to Vitousek's response. This ruling was entirely appropriate,\n\nand certainly not an abuse of discretion:             Vázquez cannot complain\n\nabout vouching in response to his own questions, United States v.\n\nGarcía-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 18 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004), especially when\n\n                                     -31-\n\fhe   very    purposely     invited   the    answer   he   got   by   repeatedly\n\nquestioning Vitousek about why he continued to deal with Cobián\n\ndespite the latter's dishonesty, see United States v. Cutler, 948\n\nF.2d 691, 697 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"It is fundamental that a defendant\n\ncannot complain of error which he invited upon himself.\") (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Taylor, 828 F.2d 630, 633 (10th Cir. 1987))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).12\n\n             The fourth and final claimed instance of vouching is\n\nsomewhat more problematic, but here too we must conclude that no\n\nabuse   of   discretion     occurred.       On   redirect   examination,   the\n\nGovernment attempted to clarify an inconsistency raised during\n\nMorell's cross:\n\n             Q.     . . . [D]o you recall, at the end of\n             [Morell]'s cross-examination yesterday, he\n             ask[ed] you about the difference between the\n             amount of cash that José Cobián said he gave to\n             Granados and the amount of cash which Mr.\n             Granados admits he received?\n\n             A.      Yes\n\n             . . .\n\n             Q.     Do you recall that [Morell] asked you,\n             \"Would it be fair to say one or both of those\n             cooperators is lying about that? Yes or no?\"\n\n\n\n12\n    The fact that, now on appeal, Morell belatedly signs on to\nVázquez's challenge to this instance of alleged vouching does not\ncompel a different conclusion with respect to Morell.      In any\nevent, Morell failed to object at trial, and is thus relegated to\nplain error review, see Brown, 510 F.3d at 72; United States v.\nPalow, 777 F.2d 52, 54 (1st Cir. 1985), a standard he cannot\nsatisfy on these facts.\n\n                                     -32-\n\f          A.      Yes.\n\n          Q.     And do you recall that you answered, \"If\n          you say that, yes.\" Please tell the members of\n          the jury what you mean by that answer.\n\n          A.     . . . I want to explain that at no time\n          I was agreeing with that statement. That is\n          [Morell]'s statement, not mine. And I would\n          like to explain exactly what my words\n          are . . . .\n\n          . . .\n\n          Now, I want to say my words, and these are the\n          words of Ivan Vitousek. At no time no witness\n          brought here by the Government has lied under\n          oath in this courtroom. . . .\n\nAt this, Vázquez objected on vouching grounds.   The court indicated\n\nit would instruct the jury later, and allowed Vitousek to continue:\n\n          A.     . . . There is a discrepancy on the\n          amounts of cash that were paid illegally by Mr.\n          Cobián to Mr. Granados Navedo, and there is a\n          discrepancy on the amount that Mr. Granados\n          Navedo says that he received in cash from\n          illegal payments from Mr. Cobián. That doesn't\n          mean that they are lying. . . .\n\n          At sidebar after redirect, Vázquez moved to strike this\n\ntestimony.13   The court denied the motion because Morell had opened\n\nthe door on cross by essentially asking Vitousek which of the two\n\nmen -- Cobián or Granados -- was lying.   The court opted instead to\n\ninstruct the jury as follows:\n\n          The . . . duty to determine whether somebody\n          has been truthful or not is yours. You are the\n\n\n13\n    Vázquez also moved for mistrial, which the court denied.\nVázquez then moved for severance from Morell, which the court also\ndenied. He appeals neither of these rulings.\n\n                                -33-\n\f             judges of the believability of the witnesses.\n             You will decide how much of a witness'\n             testimony you are going to accept or you are\n             going to reject.\n\n             You should not take the testimony of Mr.\n             Vitousek just now as him telling you that you\n             should believe any witness. What he basically\n             told you was that he, rightly or wrongly,\n             believed what they told him, which is a\n             different story.\n\n             You are the sole judges of the credibility of\n             the witnesses. You will decide . . . whether\n             you believe Cobián [and] whether you believe\n             Granados . . . , and how much of their\n             testimony you are going to accept and how much\n             you are going to reject.\n\nThe    court's    end-of-trial        jury   instructions      contained     similar\n\nlanguage. Neither defendant objected to either set of instructions.\n\n             On appeal, Vázquez and Morell argue that Agent Vitousek's\n\nstatements improperly vouched both for the government's witnesses\n\nin general, and for Cobián and Granados in particular.                        In the\n\ncircumstances,      we    need    not    decide    whether     either       statement\n\nconstituted vouching because any error the district court may have\n\ncommitted in allowing this testimony to stand was harmless.                      The\n\ndistrict court -- obviously mindful of the harm the impugned\n\nstatements    might      cause   to    the   defendants   --    gave    a    curative\n\ninstruction that the jurors not trust in Agent Vitousek's views on\n\nany witness's veracity, but instead judge veracity for themselves\n\non the weight of the evidence.            These instructions were timely (at\n\nmost    a   few   minutes    after      Vitousek   uttered     the     statements),\n\nstraightforward, explicit, and detailed.             See Cormier, 468 F.3d at\n\n                                         -34-\n\f74 (no prejudice where instructions were \"'strong and clear'\"\n\n(quoting United States v. Rodríguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)); accord Olszewski v. Spencer, 466 F.3d 47, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nMoreover, as we have noted many times, we presume juries understand\n\nand follow the court's instructions, see, e.g., United States v.\n\nKornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 97 (1st Cir. 2005), and Vázquez and Morell\n\nhave given us no reason to believe that this jury acted any\n\ndifferently.14\n\n          Considering this factor together with the general strength\n\nof the Government's case against each defendant, we conclude that\n\nno prejudice survived the district court's curative instructions,\n\nand therefore any vouching that may have occurred could not have\n\naffected the outcome of the trial.     See Page, 521 F.3d at 108;\n\nCormier, 468 F.3d at 73.   For this reason, the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in allowing this testimony to remain on the\n\nrecord and in continuing with the trial.   Tom, 330 F.3d at 94.\n\n          Having disposed of all the vouching challenges, we proceed\n\nto the next assignment of error.\n\n\n\n\n14\n   We also note that the prosecutor did not willfully seek such a\nbold endorsement by Vitousek of the other witnesses' truthfulness.\nInstead, these statements appear to have been a spontaneous effort\nby Vitousek, who had obviously become frustrated with Morell's\naggressive cross-examination, to set the record straight.\n\n\n                               -35-\n\f              D.    The Prosecutor's Closing Argument\n\n              The defendants argue that certain of the prosecutor's\n\nremarks      in    closing    improperly       disparaged   defense   counsel   and\n\nsuggested that the defense bore the burden of proof. We again start\n\nwith the applicable legal framework, and then address the specific\n\ninstances of alleged misconduct.\n\n              If we find that remarks made by the prosecutor at trial\n\nrise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct, we analyze them for\n\nprejudice under the test in United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).        See United States v. Mooney, 315 F.3d 54, 59-60\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).           We ask whether the prosecutor's behavior \"so\n\npoisoned the well\" that the defendant must be given a new trial.\n\nManning, 23 F.3d at 573 (quoting United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952\n\nF.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1991)).                We consider a number of factors,\n\nincluding the egregiousness of the conduct; the context in which it\n\noccurred; whether the court gave curative instructions and what\n\neffect these instructions likely had; and the overall strength of\n\nthe Government's case.              Id.; see also United States v. Casas, 425\n\nF.3d   23,    38    (1st     Cir.    2005)    (misconduct   evaluated   through   a\n\n\"'balanced view of the evidence in the record'\" (quoting United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-de Jesús, 202 F.3d 482, 485 (1st Cir. 2000))).\n\nWe review de novo whether a given remark amounted to prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct; if we conclude that it did, we review the overruling of\n\na preserved objection to the making of the remark for abuse of\n\n\n                                             -36-\n\fdiscretion.       Casas, 425 F.3d at 39; accord            United States v.\n\nRobinson, 473 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir. 2007) (no vacatur if error\n\nharmless).\n\n           The    defendants    point      to   several    passages   in   the\n\nprosecutor's closing argument that they say poisoned the well.              In\n\nopening summation, the prosecutor stated:\n\n           You've heard and seen a whole lot of evidence\n           of crime: Conspiracy, extortion, tax offenses,\n           and of course obstruction of justice. And the\n           defense has tried very hard to cloud and\n           complicate the real issues in this case, to\n           focus your attention on anyone, anything, but\n           them. That is their job.\n\nIn rebuttal, the prosecutor remarked along similar lines as follows:\n\n           [T]he government in this case has been accused\n           of political motivation. Is there any evidence\n           of that? We have been accused of intentionally\n           bringing in witnesses who would lie to you,\n           creating a whole fabricated case against these\n           defendants. There is no evidence of this kind\n           of behavior.    And it is offensive, and you\n           should take it for what it is:    The acts of\n           some very desperate lawyers, lawyers who want\n           to cloud the evidence.\n\nHere,   Vázquez    objected,   but   the    court   made   no   ruling.    The\n\nprosecutor continued:\n\n           . . . [Morell] has told you repeatedly that if\n           the Government did not bring you a witness, you\n           are entitled to infer that witness would give\n           evidence that would exculpate, that would prove\n           his client is innocent. Make no mistake, the\n           defendant has no burden. No defendant has any\n           obligation to testify before the grand jury or\n           at trial.    But the defendant has the same\n           subpoena power as the Government.       And if\n           [Morell] or [Vázquez], for that matter, thought\n           they could subpoena a witness who would . . .\n\n                                     -37-\n\f          give you testimony that would exculpate the[m],\n          you would have heard it.15\n\nVázquez again objected and the district court overruled.        The court\n\ndid not give curative instructions.\n\n          The defendants make two main arguments.             First, they\n\nobject to the prosecutor's statement that \"if [Morell] or [Vázquez]\n\n. . . thought they could subpoena a witness who would . . . give you\n\ntestimony that would exculpate their clients, you would have heard\n\nit\"; they assert that this remark suggested to the jury that they\n\nhad the duty to present the missing evidence.       See United States v.\n\nDíaz-Díaz, 433 F.3d 128, 135 (1st Cir. 2005) (such a suggestion \"may\n\ncross the line\").      Second, they contend that the prosecutor's\n\ncharacterization of them as \"desperate lawyers\" seeking to \"cloud\n\nthe   issues\"   improperly   disparaged   defense   counsel    and   their\n\nimportant role in the justice system.     See Manning, 23 F.3d at 573\n\nn.1 (disapproving of prosecutor's remark that defense counsel were\n\nlike \"Shakespeare's players, full of sound and fury signifying\n\nnothing\").\n\n          While we are reluctant to find categorically that these\n\nremarks constituted misconduct,16 even assuming they did, we cannot\n\n\n15\n     After Vázquez's objection was sustained, the prosecutor\ncontinued: \"You are entitled to disregard [Morell]'s argument that\n[Morell's secretary] had any relevant, important evidence to give\nin this case because the government did not call her. . . . Don't\ngo chasing off looking for witnesses you didn't hear.\"\n16\n   For example, contrary to the defendants' suggestion, not every\ncomment on a defendant's failure to produce evidence supporting his\n\n                                 -38-\n\fconclude that they so poisoned the well under Manning that the\n\ndefendants are entitled to a new trial.       First, the remarks are\n\nsimply not that egregious, and come nowhere near the sort of remarks\n\nwe have found, in rare cases, to mandate a new trial.          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Hardy, 37 F.3d 753 (1st Cir. 1994) (conviction\n\nvacated where prosecutor drew analogy between defendant's running\n\nand hiding from police on the night of the crime, and running and\n\nhiding again at trial by invoking Fifth Amendment right not to\n\ntestify); Manning, 23 F.3d 570 (conviction vacated where prosecutor\n\nsuggested that government witnesses cannot lie and urged jury to\n\n\"[t]ake responsibility for your community\" by convicting defendant);\n\nUnited States v. Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d 525 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(convictions vacated where prosecutor urged jury to consider case\n\nas battle in war against drugs, and defendants as enemy soldiers\n\ncorrupting \"our society\").\n\n          Second,   while    the    court   did   not   give     curative\n\ninstructions, it did instruct the jury at the end of trial that\n\nnothing said during closing arguments could be taken as evidence,\n\nand must be disregarded if it did not conform to the jury's\n\n\n\ntheory of the case is prohibited. See Díaz-Díaz, 433 F.3d at 135\n(citing United States v. Kubitsky, 469 F.2d 1253, 1255 (1st Cir.\n1972)). Indeed, in Díaz-Díaz, we suggested that such remarks would\nnot be improper if made in response to defense arguments \"aimed at\nhaving the jury draw the inference that the government did not call\nthe [witness] because his testimony would have been harmful to its\ncase.\" Id. As discussed below, the remarks here would seem to fit\nthis bill.\n\n                                   -39-\n\frecollection of the evidence actually presented.              The court also\n\nreminded the jury that the Government had the burden of putting on\n\nevidence to establish the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, and that the defendants bore no burden at all.                    Again,\n\nVázquez and Morell have given us no reason to believe the jury was\n\nsomehow unable to follow these instructions, and we do not believe\n\nthe impugned remarks \"were of a caliber that would inherently compel\n\njurors to disregard their duty.\"         United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67\n\nF.3d 1002, 1009 (1st Cir. 1995); cf., e.g., Rodríguez-de Jesús, 202\n\nF.3d at 486 (no retrial required where court gave no curative\n\ninstructions at time of remarks, but later instructed jury that\n\ncounsel's statements were not to be taken as evidence); Levy-\n\nCordero, 67 F.3d at 1009 (similar); Mooney, 315 F.3d at 60 (noting\n\nthat end-of-trial instructions \"are sometimes enough to neutralize\n\nany prejudice from improper remarks\").\n\n            Third,   on   a    comprehensive    view   of   the   record,   the\n\nGovernment's case against these two defendants was strong.                   It\n\nrested on a solid foundation of testimony from several witnesses,\n\nincluding many personally involved (albeit often grudgingly) in the\n\nextortion and fraud schemes, as well as considerable documentary\n\nevidence.\n\n            Fourth, specifically with respect to the remark on the\n\ndefendants'    ability        to   subpoena    witnesses,   we    have   often\n\nacknowledged that retrial is not required where the prosecutor's\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\fremarks, even if arguably improper, are a closely tailored response\n\nto defense counsel's equally improper remarks.           See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112, 122 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[I]f the\n\nprosecutor's remarks were 'invited,' and did no more than respond\n\nsubstantially in order to 'right the scale,' such comments would not\n\nwarrant reversing a conviction.\" (quoting United States v. Young,\n\n470 U.S. 1, 12-13 (1985))); United States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92,\n\n107 (1st Cir. 2003) (same); see also United States v. Skerret-\n\nOrtega, No. 06-1126, 2008 WL 2402254, at *5 (1st Cir. June 13, 2008)\n\n(latitude given to prosecutors in responding to provocative remarks\n\nby defense counsel); United States v. Pérez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (similar).\n\n           Morell argued in closing that if a witness with relevant\n\ninformation was available to the Government, but the Government\n\nchose not to call the witness to testify, the jury could acquit him\n\non the relevant count of the indictment.          He referred specifically\n\nto his secretary, who he argued would have corroborated his version\n\nof the facts had the Government called her.             In rebuttal a few\n\nminutes later, the prosecutor reminded the jury (as quoted above)\n\nthat the defendants had no duty to put on evidence, but that they\n\nwould   have   subpoenaed   a   given   witness   had   they   believed   her\n\ntestimony would exculpate them.           We find this to have been a\n\nlimited, proportionate, and thus closely tailored, response to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -41-\n\fMorell's rather outrageous invitation.   See Henderson, 320 F.3d at\n\n107.\n\n           Finally, we are mindful of the Supreme Court's admonition\n\nthat we not set guilty persons free simply to punish prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.   United States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 133 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citing United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 506-07\n\n(1983)).   Ordering retrial is a rare remedy to which we resort only\n\nwhere a miscarriage of justice would otherwise occur, or where the\n\nevidence weighs heavily against the jury's verdict.    Rodríguez-de\n\nJesús, 202 F.3d at 486.   Neither of these conditions is present in\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n           In sum, the impugned remarks, even if rising to the level\n\nof prosecutorial misconduct, did not poison the well to the degree\n\nrequired under Manning.17     We therefore reject this ground of\n\nappeal, and proceed to the next one.\n\n\n\n\n17\n   In light of the several other factors militating against finding\nan abuse of discretion here, our conclusion remains the same even\nif, as Vázquez urges, we disregard the invited-response rule with\nrespect to him because it was Morell who told the jury that\nuncalled Government witnesses would have exonerated him.\n\n     We also note that neither defendant objected at trial to the\nfirst \"cloud the evidence\" remark, made during the prosecutor's\nopening summation. For convenience we have considered both \"cloud\nthe evidence\" remarks in tandem, but if we were to consider them\nindependently of one another, we would review the first one for\nplain error, see Henderson, 320 F.3d at 102, 107, and find that it\ncomes nowhere near requiring retrial under that standard.\n\n                                -42-\n\f           E.    Sufficiency of the Evidence Against Morell\n\n           Morell mounts a broad challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence used to convict him. He argues that no rational jury could\n\nhave found him guilty of any of the crimes of which this jury\n\nconvicted him.    Those crimes were:    (1) conspiracy in Count One of\n\nthe indictment; (2) Hobbs Act extortion of three subcontractors --\n\nFeliciano, Carmona, and Laracy -- in Counts Two, Three, and Four,\n\nrespectively; (3) wire fraud in Counts Nine to Eleven; and (4) mail\n\nfraud in Count Thirteen.18\n\n           Our central task in evaluating the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence is to determine whether a rational factfinder could have\n\nfound each element of the crime in question beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   United States v. Lizardo, 445 F.3d 73, 81 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nOur review is plenary, looking at the record as a whole and\n\n\"resolv[ing] all questions of credibility and reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of the verdict.\"    Id.; accord United States v. Ortiz, 966\n\nF.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[I]t is not the appellate court's\n\nfunction to weigh the evidence or make credibility judgments.\n\nRather, it is for the jury to choose between varying interpretations\n\nof the evidence.\").    We need not be convinced that a guilty verdict\n\nwas the only one available on the evidence, but merely that \"a\n\n\n\n18\n   The indictment had fourteen counts. The jury acquitted Morell\nof Count Five, extortion of subcontractor Carrero; Count Twelve,\none of the wire fraud charges; and Count Fourteen, obstruction of\njustice. Counts Six to Eight pertained only to Vázquez.\n\n                                 -43-\n\fplausible rendition of the record\" supports the verdict. Ortiz, 966\n\nF.2d at 711.   Evidence sufficient to support a guilty verdict may\n\nbe entirely circumstantial, and the factfinder is \"free to choose\n\namong reasonable interpretations of the evidence.\"         United States\n\nv. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1395 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Morell   was   convicted   on   three   counts   of   Hobbs   Act\n\nextortion by fear of economic harm or under color of official right;\n\neach of these counts pertained to the extortion of each of three\n\nsubcontractors:    Feliciano, Carmona, and Laracy.         We begin our\n\nanalysis by determining whether a rational jury could have found the\n\nelements of extortion for these three subcontractors. The Hobbs Act\n\nprovides that \"[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n\naffects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in\n\ncommerce, by . . . extortion or attempts or conspires so to do . .\n\n. shall be [punished].\"     18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).       The Act defines\n\nextortion as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his\n\nconsent, induced by wrongful use of . . . fear, or under color of\n\nofficial right.\"   Id. § 1951(b)(2).      We have clarified that \"fear\"\n\n\"encompasses 'fear of economic loss, . . . including the possibility\n\nof lost business opportunities.'\"     United States v. Rivera Rangel,\n\n396 F.3d 476, 483 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Bucci,\n\n839 F.2d 825, 827-28 (1st Cir. 1988)).        Therefore, an individual\n\ncommits Hobbs Act extortion if he:          (1) obtains property from\n\nanother person; (2) with that person's consent; (3) through fear of\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\feconomic loss or under color of official right;        and (4) the\n\ntransaction affects interstate commerce.    Id.\n\n          Morell does not dispute the existence of the fourth\n\nelement, and we find sufficient evidence in the record to establish\n\nthis element19 and the first three.     The first element is easily\n\nsatisfied:   Cobián testified -- and a rational jury could have\n\nbelieved -- that the subcontractors made periodic cash payments to\n\nhim between 1997 and 1999 which he then passed on to Vázquez,\n\nMorell, and Granados.   Several subcontractors verified that they\n\nmade such payments to Cobián, and this testimony was supported by\n\ndocumentary evidence -- for example, sham checks from Carmona's\n\nbusiness to non-existent individuals for unperformed services, so\n\nCarmona could generate the cash necessary to pay Cobián.   Feliciano\n\nalso testified that he made one payment to Vázquez in person.   The\n\nsecond element is also easily met:    Feliciano, Carmona, and Laracy\n\nall testified that they agreed voluntarily (though reluctantly) to\n\npay the money demanded, and a rational jury could have believed this\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n19\n   We have held that \"the government need only show a realistic\nprobability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce[] in\norder to bring extortion within the reach of the Hobbs Act.\"\nUnited States v. Rivera-Medina, 845 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1988);\nsee also United States v. Hathaway, 534 F.2d 386, 396 (1st Cir.\n1976) (Hobbs Act reaches \"even those effects which are merely\npotential or subtle\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We find\nample evidence on the record before us to prove this element.\n\n                               -45-\n\f           As for the third element -- inducement to pay by fear of\n\neconomic loss or color of official right -- it, too, is established\n\non the facts presented.     As an initial matter, the two components\n\nof this element are disjunctive, and an extortion conviction will\n\nstand if there is sufficient evidence to prove either component.\n\nId.   To prove the former, \"the government must show that the victim\n\nreasonably    feared     that    noncompliance     with    the     putative\n\nextortionist's   terms   would   result   in   economic   loss.\"    United\n\nStates v. Cruz-Arroyo, 461 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2006), cert.\n\ndenied, 127 S. Ct. 1169 (2007).\n\n           The Government here put forth ample evidence to show that\n\nFeliciano, Carmona, and Laracy reasonably feared economic harm if\n\nthey failed to pay the money demanded of them.             Feliciano, for\n\nexample, testified that he agreed to pay the money because, if he\n\ndid not, \"[t]he government\" could \"make life very difficult\" for his\n\nconstruction firm by delaying Superaqueduct project payments and not\n\nawarding the firm government contracts in the future.               Carmona\n\ntestified that he felt compelled to pay and keep paying because if\n\nhe failed to do so, the Thames-Dick consortium could be removed from\n\nthe Superaqueduct project and his construction firm might also\n\nsuffer other adverse consequences.        Laracy testified in a similar\n\nvein that he feared detriment to his business if he did not pay.\n\nFeliciano, Carmona, and Laracy testified further that they knew the\n\nrecipients of the money were people with influence in the NPP\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fgovernment; they knew Granados to be among them; and Feliciano and\n\nCarmona   also    knew    Vázquez    to    be     among   them.      Based   on   this\n\ntestimony, a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Feliciano, Carmona, and Laracy paid Cobián out of fear\n\nof detrimental consequences for their respective businesses, and\n\nthat   this   fear       was   reasonable         because     they    believed     the\n\nextortionists to have real power to effect such detriment.\n\n           The next critical question we must answer is whether a\n\nrational jury could have found Morell to be linked to the extortion\n\nscheme in a manner that allows criminal liability to be imputed to\n\nhim.   We must therefore examine whether a rational jury could have\n\nfound a conspiracy to exist, and Morell to be a member of it, as\n\ncharged in Count One of the indictment.              To establish a conspiracy,\n\nthe Government must prove three elements:                     (1) an agreement to\n\ncommit an unlawful act; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the\n\nagreement and voluntary participation in it; and (3) an overt act\n\nby at least one of the coconspirators in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.      United States v. Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d 25, 45 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 678 (2007). The Government need not\n\nprove a formal agreement; instead, \"[t]he agreement may be shown by\n\na   concert      of   action,       all     the     parties       working    together\n\nunderstandingly, with a single design for the accomplishment of a\n\ncommon purpose.\"      Id. at 45-46 (quoting Am. Tobacco Co. v. United\n\nStates, 147 F.2d 93, 107 (4th Cir. 1944)) (internal quotation marks\n\n\n                                          -47-\n\fomitted).     Morell's conviction may be sustained on sufficient\n\nevidence of a conspiracy      to commit any of the three charged\n\nconspiracy offenses.     Id. at 46.     For purposes of the present\n\nanalysis, we focus on conspiracy to commit extortion.\n\n            Morell does not seriously challenge the Government's\n\nevidence on the first and third elements of conspiracy, and we find\n\nan abundance of evidence in the record to support their existence.\n\nCobián and Granados testified that Vázquez and Cobián devised a plan\n\nto compel the subcontractors to hand over a portion of their\n\nSuperaqueduct profits.     As we have found above, a rational jury\n\ncould have considered this compelled payment to constitute extortion\n\n-- the requisite unlawful act that is the object of the conspiracy.\n\nAnd the record reveals many overt acts in furtherance of such a\n\nconspiracy including, for example, Cobián's physical transfer of\n\nperiodic cash payments from Feliciano and Carmona to Vázquez's\n\nmedical office.\n\n            What remains, then, is the second element: whether Morell\n\nknew of the extortion agreement and voluntary participated in it.\n\nThe most direct evidence against Morell in this regard is Cobián's\n\ntestimony about one of his initial meetings with Vázquez. According\n\nto this testimony, Vázquez told Cobián that Morell and Granados\n\nwould be assisting him in his efforts to secure the Superaqueduct\n\ncontract for Thames-Dick, and that Cobián should approach Morell to\n\nwork out how Morell wished to receive his share of the payments.\n\n\n                                 -48-\n\fYet even in the absence of this testimony, a rational factfinder\n\ncould still have inferred that Morell knew of and adhered to the\n\nextortion    agreement     based    on    a     significant   quantum    of   other\n\nevidence.      For   example,      Cobián       testified   that,   in   1997,   he\n\napproached Morell to arrange how the latter wished to receive his\n\nshare.   Cobián stated that Morell was not surprised to see him, but\n\ninstead seemed to have been expecting him and had already devised\n\na specific plan for concealing the transfer of the subcontractors'\n\nmoney.     According to Cobián, Morell proceeded to draw up a sham\n\nlegal contract and made several other elaborate arrangements to this\n\nend.   Morell then accepted periodic payments from Cobián under the\n\nsham contract and through third-party payments from 1997 to 1999 --\n\na period largely overlapping with the period during which Vázquez\n\nand Granados were also receiving payments.             Morell does not dispute\n\nthat he received thousands of dollars from Cobián over the course\n\nof those two years.\n\n            As noted above, it is not for us to make credibility\n\ndeterminations on a review of the sufficiency of the evidence, but\n\nmerely to say whether a rational jury could have believed this\n\ntestimony.     See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.             We find that a rational\n\njury could have believed Cobián, and then drawn the reasonable\n\ninference that Cobián's payments to Morell were not for legal\n\nservices     and   other   licit     ends,       but   were   instead    designed\n\nclandestinely to channel him his part of the extortionate proceeds.\n\n\n                                         -49-\n\fA rational jury could then have drawn a second inference:                  that\n\nMorell obviously knew of, and voluntarily participated in, the\n\nscheme.    Accordingly, a rational jury could have found all three\n\nelements of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, and this jury's\n\nconviction of Morell under Count One was therefore supported by\n\nsufficient evidence.\n\n            This brings us to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\n\nthe counts charging Morell with substantive crimes incident to the\n\nconspiracy.    Contrary to Morell's assertion at oral argument, the\n\nlaw does not require proof that he personally took any steps to\n\ninstill economic fear in the subcontractors, to influence the award\n\nof the contract or the payment for performance under the contract,\n\nor that the subcontractors feared Morell or even knew of his\n\ninvolvement. Instead, under the Pinkerton doctrine, a defendant can\n\nbe found liable for the substantive crime of a coconspirator\n\nprovided the crime was reasonably foreseeable and committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.           United States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d\n\n302, 309 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Pinkerton v. United States, 328\n\nU.S. 640, 647-48 (1946)).        The district court properly instructed\n\nthe jury on the Pinkerton doctrine.         Based on overwhelming evidence\n\nin the record, the jury could rationally have found that Vázquez,\n\nCobián, or Granados committed extortion.           Through Pinkerton, such\n\na   jury   could   then   have   found   Morell   equally   liable   for    the\n\nsubstantive offense, since extortion was committed in furtherance\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\fof the conspiracy (and indeed was the conspiracy's object), and was\n\na reasonably foreseeable result of the conspiracy.                See Díaz-Díaz,\n\n433   F.3d   at    137.20     For   these     reasons,    Morell's   substantive\n\nextortion convictions under Counts Two to Four of the indictment\n\nwere also supported by substantial evidence.\n\n             The   last     set   of   convictions       Morell   challenges   on\n\nsufficiency grounds stem from various instances of mail and wire\n\nfraud charged in Counts Nine to Eleven and Thirteen.                 In order to\n\nconvict an individual of mail or wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341\n\nand 1343, the Government must prove:            \"(1) the defendant's knowing\n\nand willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with\n\nthe specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails or\n\ninterstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n             Counts Nine, Ten, and Eleven charged Morell with devising\n\na scheme to defraud the Puerto Rico Treasury Department (\"Hacienda\")\n\nby failing to pay income taxes on revenue earned from the extortion.\n\nEach count lists a separate wire transaction of thousands of dollars\n\n\n\n20\n   Citing United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1021 (1st Cir.\n1992), Morell argues that he cannot be held vicariously liable\nthrough Pinkerton because Vázquez and Granados had already\ncommitted extortion by the time he began receiving payments. We\nreject this argument, as extortion can be an ongoing crime, see,\ne.g., Bucci, 839 F.2d at 829-30, and this extortion went on until\nthe payments ceased in 1999. In any event, a rational jury could\nhave found that Morell adhered to the extortion agreement from its\ninception, and not merely from 1997, when he began receiving\npayments.\n\n                                       -51-\n\fdated April 16, 1999 from Thames-Dick to Feliciano, Carmona, and\n\nLaracy,   respectively.       These     were   apparently   chosen   as\n\nrepresentative samples of the monthly wire transfers Thames-Dick\n\nmade to the subcontractors beginning in January 1997, a portion of\n\nwhich the subcontractors then handed over to Cobián, who in turn\n\ngave a portion to Morell, Vázquez, and Granados.        The indictment\n\ncharges that Morell failed to account for this 1999 income on his\n\nPuerto Rico tax return, and then used the mails to send the return\n\nto the Puerto Rico tax agency.    This mailing was the basis for the\n\nmail-fraud charge in Count Thirteen.\n\n          Upon review of the record, we find sufficient evidence for\n\na rational jury to have convicted Morell on all of these counts.\n\nA rational jury could have believed Cobián's testimony that Morell\n\ndirected Cobián to funnel him the subcontractors' money through\n\nchecks for sham legal services purportedly rendered to Cobián's\n\ncompany, and through payments to third parties for Morell's benefit.\n\nSuch a jury could also have credited the certified copy of Morell's\n\n1999 tax return in evidence, that failed to report payments made to\n\nhim by Cobián in that year.      A rational jury could likewise have\n\nbelieved Morell's tax preparer, who testified that Morell did not\n\ntell him about income earned from Cobián's company in 1999, and that\n\nhe therefore did not include it on the 1999 return. These findings,\n\nin turn, would be sufficient to satisfy the first element for both\n\n\n\n\n                                 -52-\n\fmail and wire fraud:     that Morell intentionally, knowingly, and\n\nwillingly participated in a scheme to defraud Hacienda.           See id.\n\n          Specifically with respect to the wire-fraud counts, a\n\nrational jury could then have found the second element fulfilled --\n\nthat wire communications were used in furtherance of the scheme.21\n\nMorell need not have had any personal involvement in initiating the\n\nwire transfers; instead, the use of the wires need only have been\n\n\"a   reasonably   foreseeable   part    of   the   scheme    in   which   he\n\nparticipated.\"    Id. at 723 n.6 (quoting United States v. Boots, 80\n\nF.3d 580, 585 n.8 (1st Cir. 1996)) (internal quotation marks and\n\nalteration omitted); accord United States v. Fermín Castillo, 829\n\nF.2d 1194, 1198 (1st Cir. 1987) (it must have been reasonably\n\nforeseeable that use of the mails or wires would \"follow in the\n\nordinary course of business\" (quoting United States v. Benmuhar, 658\n\nF.2d 14, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1981)) (internal quotation marks omitted));\n\nsee also id.   (case law on mail-fraud statute instructive for wire-\n\nfraud statute).   From the evidence presented, a rational jury could\n\nhave inferred that it was reasonably foreseeable that interstate\n\nwires would be used in the ordinary course of business for Thames-\n\nDick to transfer payments to the subcontractors.            These transfers\n\nwere essential to the success of the extortion scheme and, in turn,\n\nthe scheme to defraud the Puerto Rico tax agency, because they\n\n\n21\n    The parties stipulated that the wire payments traveled in\ninterstate commerce, so we need not address the evidence on this\nelement.\n\n                                 -53-\n\fprovided the subcontractors the money they gave to Morell and the\n\nothers, and which Morell then failed to report.      On the basis of\n\nsuch findings, a rational jury could thus have concluded that Morell\n\nwas guilty of wire fraud on each of the three counts.22\n\n          Turning specifically to the mail-fraud count, a rational\n\njury could also have found the second element fulfilled here -- that\n\nthe mails were used in furtherance of the scheme.       The district\n\ncourt admitted into evidence a copy of a meter-marked envelope\n\naddressed to Hacienda and bearing a Hacienda receipt stamp, along\n\nwith Morell's 1999 return.    Morell does not dispute that these were\n\nhis envelope and return, but contends there is no proof that the\n\nreturn was actually placed in the mail.    We disagree, and conclude\n\nthat a rational jury could have credited evidence that Morell mailed\n\nthe return or reasonably expected that in the regular course of\n\nbusiness, it would be mailed to Hacienda on his behalf.     Morell's\n\ntax preparer, who formerly worked for Hacienda, testified that when\n\ntax returns came in the mail, Hacienda kept the envelope and stapled\n\nit to the return, but would likely discard an envelope accompanying\n\na hand-delivered return.     A rational jury could have believed this\n\n\n\n22\n   Morell makes much of the fact that the indictment also alleges\nhe committed fraud on his 1997 and 1998 tax returns, but the\nevidence used to show wire transfers for Counts Nine to Eleven\nconsisted of April 1999 transactions made after the 1997 and 1998\nreturns had been filed. We need not address this argument because\nall that was required to sustain Morell's convictions on these\ncounts was sufficient evidence that he committed fraud on one of\nthe returns, and the 1999 return meets this requirement.\n\n                                 -54-\n\ftestimony, and inferred from it that the 1999 return and the meter-\n\nmarked envelope were actually mailed.    The evidence was therefore\n\nsufficient to support a finding of guilt by mail fraud.\n\n           For these reasons, we reject all of Morell's challenges\n\nto the sufficiency of the evidence, and proceed to the next ground\n\nof appeal.\n\n           F.   Admission of Coconspirator Statement Against Morell\n\n           This ground of appeal, also advanced only by Morell,\n\nconcerns Cobián's testimony on direct examination about one of the\n\nmeetings in which Vázquez proposed the extortion scheme to Cobián.\n\nCobián testified that he asked Vázquez who else would be helping the\n\nsubcontractors to secure the Superaqueduct contract,       and that\n\nVázquez told Cobián it would be Morell and Granados.       At this,\n\nMorell objected on hearsay grounds, arguing that this testimony was\n\ninadmissible hearsay. The district court provisionally allowed the\n\ntestimony under our rule in United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d\n\n20 (1st Cir. 1977), and later kept it on the record after assessing\n\nit in light of other evidence presented at trial. See United States\n\nv. Mangual-García, 505 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2007).       Morell now\n\nargues that this constituted reversible error because the testimony\n\nwas the only piece of evidence linking him to a conspiracy involving\n\nVázquez.\n\n           Our case law instructs district courts faced with a\n\nchallenge to the admission of a coconspirator hearsay statement to\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fadmit the statement provisionally and wait until the end of trial\n\nto   consider    four      factors   in   the    light   of   all   the    evidence:\n\n(1) whether a conspiracy existed; (2) whether the defendant was a\n\nmember of the conspiracy; (3) whether the declarant was also a\n\nmember of the conspiracy; and (4) whether the declarant's statement\n\nwas made in furtherance of the conspiracy.                Colón-Díaz, 521 F.3d\n\nat   35-36    (citing       Petrozziello,        548   F.2d    at   23;    Fed.     R.\n\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(E)).         If these four conditions are satisfied by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, the statement qualifies under the\n\ncoconspirator exemption to the hearsay rule and may therefore be\n\nadmitted into evidence -- including to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted.       Id.   at    35.      We   review   preserved    challenges     to    a\n\nPetrozziello determination (or a portion thereof) for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, and unpreserved challenges for plain error.                      Id. at\n\n36-37.\n\n             In a sealed written order, the district court made the\n\nPetrozziello determination, finding the four Rule 801(d)(2)(E)\n\nfactors satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence.                     Morell did\n\nnot object to this assessment with respect to the first, third, and\n\nfourth Rule 801(d)(2)(E) factors, and does not quarrel with it now.\n\nAs such, he forfeited any challenge to the court's findings on these\n\nfactors.     United States v. Thompson, 449 F.3d 267, 273 (1st Cir.\n\n2006). As concerns the second factor -- whether Morell was a member\n\nof the conspiracy -- we have already concluded above that, on the\n\n\n                                          -56-\n\fevidence presented at trial, a rational jury could have found Morell\n\nto be a member of the charged conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt\n\neven absent Cobián's testimony that Vázquez implicated Morell during\n\nthe meeting in question.        A fortiori, the record contains ample\n\nevidence to support a finding by the requisite preponderance that\n\nMorell     was   a    member   of   the       conspiracy    for    purposes    of\n\nRule 801(d)(2)(E).      Cf. United States v. Gjerde, 110 F.3d 595, 602\n\n(8th Cir. 1997) (finding certain Rule 801(d)(2)(E) factors as\n\nnecessarily satisfied by preponderance where court had already found\n\nthe relevant facts proven beyond reasonable doubt).                The district\n\ncourt did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in not striking the\n\nstatement, and the jury was entitled to consider it for the truth\n\nof the matter asserted therein.\n\n            G.   Sentencing\n\n            As their final ground of appeal, Vázquez and Morell\n\nchallenge the manner in which the district court calculated their\n\nrespective GSRs under the Sentencing Guidelines.                  We review the\n\ndistrict    court's    legal   interpretation       and    application   of   the\n\nGuidelines de novo, but its loss or benefits calculations are\n\nreviewed only for clear error. United States v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d\n\n286, 290 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Griffin, 324 F.3d 330,\n\n365 (5th Cir. 2003).\n\n            At   sentencing,     the     district    court     calculated     the\n\ndefendants' respective GSRs in the manner recommended by their\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\frespective Presentence Reports (\"PSRs\").         It accordingly looked to\n\n§ 2C1.1 of the 1998 Guidelines,23 on \"Extortion Under Color of\n\nOfficial Right\":\n\n          (a)      Base Offense Level:     10.\n\n          (b)      Special Offense Characteristics\n\n                   . . .\n\n                   (2)   (If more than one applies, use the greater):\n\n                           (A) If the value of the payment, the benefit\n                           received or to be received in return for the\n                           payment, or the loss to the government from\n                           the offense, whichever is greatest, exceeded\n                           $2,000, increase by the corresponding number\n                           of levels from the table in § 2F1.1 (Fraud\n                           and Deceit). . . .\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2C1.1 (1998). Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) thus provides three\n\nalternative amounts, and the court must choose the greatest:         (1)\n\nthe value of the payment; (2) the benefit received or to be received\n\nin return for the payment; or (3) the loss to the government from\n\nthe offense.24\n\n\n\n23\n    The PSRs recommended that the 1998 Guidelines be used by\noperation of U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(1) (2006). The district court\nfollowed this recommendation, and the parties did not object. We\naccordingly use the 1998 Guidelines as well, noting that while\n§ 2C1.1 has been amended since 1998, the key language for purposes\nof analyzing the defendants' challenge remains virtually the same.\n24\n    It is undisputed that the third alternative -- loss to the\ngovernment -- is not available because the government lost no money\nas a result of the extortion scheme. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2\ncmt. n.6 (1998), the district court did not make an independent\ndetermination of the defendants' sentences for defrauding the\nPuerto Rico tax authorities. As such, those losses played no part\nin the sentencing calculations in this case.\n\n                                   -58-\n\f            Relying on the PSRs, the district court determined that\n\nthe alternative with the highest quantity was the \"benefit to be\n\nreceived in return for the payment,\" which the court estimated as\n\nslightly over $10 million -- the approximate combined profit earned\n\nby the subcontractors for their work on the Superaqueduct project.\n\nFollowing the directive in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), the court then looked\n\nto   §   2F1.1,    which     instructed     it    to   increase      the    defendants'\n\nrespective       offense     levels   by    fifteen     because      the    \"loss\"    the\n\ndefendants caused exceeded $10 million.                     Id. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(P)\n\n(1998).      Added      to   the   base    offense     level    of    ten    (which   was\n\nundisputed), the defendants were left with offense levels of twenty-\n\nfive, along with respective Criminal History Categories of I.                         This\n\nproduced    a     GSR   of   fifty-seven     to   seventy-one         months.     After\n\nundertaking the remainder of the sentencing analysis, including an\n\nexamination of the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the court\n\nsentenced Vázquez and Morell toward the lower end of this range, to\n\nsixty months' imprisonment each.             The defendants timely objected to\n\nthe methodology used to produce this sentence.\n\n            On appeal, Vázquez and Morell argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in choosing the \"benefit to be received\" alternative\n\nbecause there was no evidence that the subcontractors received the\n\nroughly    $10     million    in   profits    \"in      return   for    the    payment.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).            According to the defendants, it was\n\nundisputed that the Thames-Dick consortium was the most qualified\n\n\n                                           -59-\n\fof the bidders, and there was no evidence that Vázquez or Morell\n\nactually exerted any real influence on anyone responsible for\n\nawarding Thames-Dick the contract.              As Granados testified, the\n\ncoconspirators' promise to help the subcontractors was merely an\n\ninsurance policy to make sure nothing happened that would impede the\n\nawarding of the contract -- not to compel or persuade the relevant\n\nofficials to award it.         Therefore, because Thames-Dick was awarded\n\nthe contract based on its and the subcontractors' own merit through\n\na process not tainted by the defendants' crime, the \"benefit . . .\n\nto be received in return for the payment\" was zero, and the court\n\nmust sentence the defendants under the (much lower) \"value of the\n\npayment\" alternative in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).            The district court did\n\nnot make specific findings on the amount of money the defendants\n\nactually   received,     but    other   evidence   suggested    it   was   below\n\n$1 million for each defendant.\n\n           We   begin    by    determining     whether   the   district    court\n\ncommitted legal error in its interpretation of the meaning of\n\n\"benefit . . . to be received in return for the payment\" in\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).       This is a question of first impression in this\n\ncircuit.    Evident from the plain language of the guideline --\n\n\"benefit . . . to be received\" -- is the Sentencing Commission's\n\nintention that this inquiry be forward-looking, a conclusion also\n\nreached by the Fifth Circuit in one of the rare cases interpreting\n\nthe guideline in the context of extortion, as opposed to bribery:\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\f\"[I]n determining the amount of benefit to be received, courts may\n\nconsider   the    expected   benefits,   not   only   the    actual    benefits\n\nreceived.\"       Griffin, 324 F.3d at 366 (emphasis added).                   This\n\nprospective analysis comports with our closely analogous case law\n\non computing loss for purposes of sentencing.               We have held that\n\nwhen a person is convicted of a fraud offense, a proper analysis of\n\nthe loss he intended to cause asks what a person in his position at\n\nthe relevant time would reasonably have expected to happen to the\n\nvictim as a result of the fraud.         See Innarelli, 524 F.3d at 291.\n\nThe rationale for an ex ante inquiry lies in the purpose of the\n\nexercise: to set the defendant's punishment at a level commensurate\n\nwith the degree of his moral culpability.         For this reason, it is\n\nnot determinative what loss the victim actually ended up suffering,\n\nor indeed whether the victim suffered any loss at all.                Id.25\n\n           This reasoning translates readily into the extortion\n\ncontext.     We think that the best interpretation of \"benefit . . .\n\nto be received in return for the payment\" is the benefit a person\n\nin the defendant's position at the time of the extortion would\n\nreasonably have expected the victim to receive by paying him the\n\nmoney he demanded.     See Griffin, 324 F.3d at 366.          This figure, in\n\nturn, affords the court a gauge for how severely the defendant\n\n\n\n25\n   As we noted in Innarelli, this rationale contrasts with that for\nrestitution, which is \"necessarily a backward-looking inquiry\"\nbecause the defendant can only be made to reimburse the victim for\nthe loss he actually caused to the victim. 524 F.3d at 294.\n\n                                   -61-\n\fdeserves to be punished.   We reject the defendants' invitation to\n\nlook with 20-20 hindsight at whether, at the end of the day, they\n\nactually did anything overt to help Thames-Dick get the contract.\n\nAs reasonable expectation at the time of the extortion is the\n\ntouchstone of the inquiry, the district court's interpretation was\n\nthe right one.\n\n          As for the amount of the benefit in this case, neither\n\ndefendant contests the district court's estimate of slightly more\n\nthan $10 million, a figure the court described as conservative.   In\n\nany event, our review of the record reveals this estimate to be\n\nreasonable, and a reasonable estimate is all that is required.    See\n\nInnarelli, 524 F.3d at 290; Griffin, 324 F.3d at 365.   We therefore\n\nsee no reason to deem this quantity clearly erroneous.       United\n\nStates v. Gray, 521 F.3d 514, 542-43 (6th Cir. 2008) (amount of\n\nbenefit to be received reviewed for clear error); Griffin, 324 F.3d\n\nat 365 (same).\n\n          Since more than $10 million is undisputably greater than\n\nthe other available alternative in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) -- the value of\n\nthe payments to Vázquez and Morell -- the district court properly\n\nused it to determine how many additional levels to add to their\n\nrespective base offense levels.       See U.S.S.G. §§ 2C1.1(b)(2),\n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(P).   Accordingly, the court's GSR calculation for each\n\ndefendant was correct, and in the absence of any further sentencing\n\nchallenges, our review ends there.\n\n\n                               -62-\n\f                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Vázquez's conviction\n\nand sentence, and affirm Morell's conviction and sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -63-\n\f",

We consider only those facts relevant to the\n\nissues on appeal.        In August 1994, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and\n\nSewer    Authority      (\"PRASA\")    solicited      bids     from        construction\n\ncontractors     to   build     a    large      water   pipe     --       dubbed   the\n\n\"Superaqueduct\" -- along Puerto Rico's north coast.                  The magnitude\n\nof the project required the bidding contractors to form consortia\n\nwith    local   subcontractors       for      the   provision       of     equipment,\n\nexpertise, financial resources, and labor.                 One of the aspirants\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas a consortium led by contractor Thames-Dick, a joint venture\n\nbetween a British firm and the Dick Corporation of Pennsylvania.\n\nWithin the Thames-Dick consortium were a number of Puerto Rico\n\nsubcontractors:     (1) Las Piedras Construction, owned by Pedro\n\n\"Cuco\" Feliciano; (2) Constructora Hato Rey, owned by Waldemar\n\nCamrona; (3) Longo de Puerto Rico, owned by Greg Laracy; (4)\n\nCarrero    Engineering,   owned   by     Alberto   \"Tico\"   Carrero;   and\n\n(5) Cobián, Agustín & Ramos, controlled by José Cobián-Guzmán\n\n(\"Cobián\").    Thames-Dick won the $305 million contract in January\n\n1996; it began construction in September 1996 and finished in 2000.\n\n           Cobián, a key government witness, testified at trial that\n\nhe knew from experience that, in order for his consortium to be\n\nawarded the contract, he would need to bribe someone influential in\n\nthe government, which at the time was controlled by the New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\").    Thus, in June 1995, Cobián approached\n\nVázquez, an ophthalmologist and the manager of Governor Pedro\n\nRosselló's reelection campaign.        Several witnesses testified that\n\nVázquez was believed to hold an almost unparalleled degree of sway\n\nwithin the Rosselló government.        Vázquez told Cobián that he would\n\ndo what he could in exchange for two percent of the total value of\n\nthe contracts awarded to the Thames-Dick subcontractors.           Cobián\n\nexplained that the subcontractors' share of the total would be more\n\nthan $200 million; two percent was estimated to be about $2.4\n\nmillion.      Vázquez indicated that Morell, an attorney and NPP\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fSecretary-General, and José Granados-Navedo (\"Granados\"), the NPP\n\nchair of the House of Representatives infrastructure committee,\n\nwould be assisting him and would need a share of the $2 million.\n\nCobián proposed that it be split four ways, with him receiving a\n\nquarter; Vázquez acquiesced.   Vázquez said he would deal only with\n\nCobián and must be paid in cash, and that Cobián should approach\n\nMorell and Granados directly to arrange their payments.    Vázquez\n\ndid not explain to Cobián what actions he or others would take to\n\nmake sure Thames-Dick got the contract.\n\n          Cobián then went to subcontractors Feliciano, Carmona,\n\nLaracy, and Carrero and told them that together they would have to\n\npay two percent of their part of the contract award to purchase the\n\nassistance of influential people in the government.   Although the\n\nsubcontractors had not delegated authority to Cobián to make such\n\na deal on their behalf, they grudgingly agreed to pay.\n\n          The subcontractors paid Cobián incrementally as they\n\nreceived payments from Thames-Dick.    They understood that Cobián\n\nwould then pass the payments on to the politicians in question.\n\nCobián delivered monthly cash payments to Vázquez in his office,\n\nand made other payments to third parties for NPP campaign expenses\n\nowed them by Vázquez.   On one occasion Feliciano, who had figured\n\nout that Vázquez was one of the recipients of the extortionate\n\npayments, made a $5,760 payment to him in person at his medical\n\noffice.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           On Vázquez's instructions, Cobián went to Morell's law\n\noffice to arrange how his payments would be made.          Morell drew up\n\na sham contract under which Cobián was to pay Morell's law firm\n\n$5,000 per month for legal services; Cobián made these monthly\n\npayments from 1997 to 1999.           In addition, Morell and Cobián\n\narranged for Cobián to make several payments to third parties\n\n(including Sears, a rental car company, an architectural firm, and\n\na basketball team) on Morell's behalf.             Morell never actually\n\nperformed any legal services for Cobián or his company.             Cobián\n\nsimilarly made payments to third parties on Granados's behalf, and\n\nalso made some cash payments to Granados.\n\n           In all, the subcontractors gave Cobián cash and checks\n\ntotaling over $1 million; of this, Vázquez received the equivalent\n\nof over $360,000, and Morell received over $125,000.                Vázquez\n\nfailed to report to the Puerto Rico Treasury Department the money\n\nhe received from Cobián from 1997 to 1999, and concealed thousands\n\nmore dollars of cash payments made to him by his ophthalmology\n\npatients and businesses involved in healthcare services.             Morell\n\nreported on his tax returns payments to his law firm by Cobián in\n\n1997 and 1998 under the sham contract.       Morell failed to report the\n\napproximately   $25,000   paid   in   1999   and   the   many   third-party\n\npayments made by Cobián, which totaled some $23,000; he also failed\n\nto report payments from other clients in 1998 totaling about\n\n$22,000.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f             In July 1999, when Cobián learned that he had been\n\nindicted for unrelated conduct, he panicked and stopped making\n\npayments to Vázquez, Morell, and Granados.            After pleading guilty\n\nto the indictment, Cobián decided to cooperate with the Government\n\nin exchange for immunity with respect to further crimes for which\n\nhe might implicate himself in rendering such cooperation, and the\n\nGovernment's recommendation of a sentencing reduction. Cobián then\n\ntold investigators of the details of the Superaqueduct extortion\n\nscheme. On the basis of this and other information, the Government\n\nsought indictments against Vázquez, Morell, and Granados.\n\n             On   April   8,   2004,   a   grand   jury   returned   a   public\n\nindictment charging Vázquez and Morell with the following: (1) one\n\ncount of conspiracy to commit extortion and launder money in\n\nfurtherance of a bribery scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;\n\n(2) several counts of extortion under color of official right and\n\nby economic fear, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951,\n\nand aiding and abetting this offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2; and (3)\n\nseveral counts of mail and wire fraud committed as part of a scheme\n\nto defraud Puerto Rico of income tax payments, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2, 1341, and 1343.1          The Government's central theory was\n\nthat   the    defendants       and   Granados   conspired    to   induce   the\n\nsubcontractors to pay them a portion of their Superaqueduct profits\n\n\n1\n   Morell was also charged with obstruction of justice under 18\nU.S.C. § 1503 but was acquitted on this count, and this charge is\nnot at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fby making them fear that if they did not pay (and keep making\n\nperiodic payments), the defendants and Granados would use their\n\ninfluence in the government:               (1) to promote the subcontractors'\n\ncompetitors for the bid; (2) to remove the subcontractors from the\n\ncontract after it was already awarded; or (3) would malign their\n\nprofessional reputations so that their respective businesses would\n\nnot receive government contracts in the future.\n\n               After we ordered the recusal of the original trial judge\n\nfrom this case, see In re United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), the case was randomly reassigned to Chief Judge Fusté.\n\nVázquez moved to recuse Chief Judge Fusté on a number of grounds,\n\nand Chief Judge Fusté denied the motion, United States v.

Vázquez    now    avails     himself    of    the\n\nopportunity to appeal the non-recusal.\n\n               Before   trial,     the    then-lead       prosecutor     of   the      U.S.\n\nAttorney's       Office     in   Puerto      Rico     granted       several     of     the\n\nsubcontractors immunity from prosecution in exchange for their\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\ftestimony.     Cobián also testified with immunity under the prior\n\nagreement, and Granados pled guilty to crimes committed in carrying\n\nout his role in the extortion scheme and also testified for the\n\nGovernment.      During the pretrial phase, responsibility for the\n\nprosecution of the case was transferred from the U.S. Attorney's\n\nOffice in Puerto Rico to the Public Integrity Section of the\n\nDepartment of Justice in Washington, D.C.\n\n             On September 25, 2006 -- the day before trial was set to\n\nbegin and more than two years after he was indicted -- Vázquez\n\nsubpoenaed two witnesses, hereinafter \"Witness A\" and \"Witness B,\"\n\nto compel their testimony at trial; he also served a subpoena on\n\nDick    Corporation    for   the     production    of       certain    documents.\n\nWitness A was a Dick Corporation official and Witness B was a\n\nconsultant     hired   by    Dick    Corporation       to    conduct   marketing\n\nactivities inside and outside Puerto Rico, including negotiations\n\nfor    the   construction    of    \"intercity   connectors\"       --   pipelines\n\nconnecting the Superaqueduct to municipal water systems.2                Vázquez\n\nsought to argue at trial, inter alia, that it was Witness B,\n\nanother consultant (\"Consultant C\"), and powerful persons for whom\n\nthey worked who extorted money from the subcontractors in exchange\n\nfor the Superaqueduct contract, and not Vázquez.                The Government,\n\nDick   Corporation,    and   Witness    B    opposed    the   subpoenas.     The\n\n\n\n2\n   The indictment against Vázquez and Morell did not allege any\ncorruption or extortion with respect to the intercity connectors.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdistrict court ruled the proposed evidence irrelevant in light of\n\nthe uncontradicted statements of Witnesses A and B to investigators\n\nthat any relationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation began\n\nat    least   two    years   after    the    Superaqueduct   project       had   been\n\nawarded.      But the court stated that it would allow the defendants\n\nto make an offer of proof nonetheless, in order to create a record\n\nof its relevancy decision for appellate review.\n\n              Accordingly, on October 16, 2006, the district court held\n\na hearing at which Vázquez questioned Witnesses A and B and the\n\nGovernment cross-examined Witness A.3 The court closed the hearing\n\nto the press and public to preclude what it feared would be a\n\n\"sideshow\"; the court clarified that \"[t]his is not part of the\n\ntrial.    This is a hearing to determine relevancy.\"            Both witnesses\n\ntestified that Witness B and Consultant C did not represent Dick\n\nCorporation in its efforts to obtain the Superaqueduct contract for\n\nthe    Thames-Dick     consortium.          They   also   testified       that   Dick\n\nCorporation did not even hire Witness B until 1998 or 1999 -- at\n\nleast two years after the awarding of the contract when the project\n\nwas    nearing      completion   --    and     hired   Consultant     C    sometime\n\nthereafter.      Witnesses A and B also testified that, to the extent\n\nthat the tasks Witness B performed on behalf of Thames-Dick had\n\nanything to do with the Superaqueduct project, they were confined\n\nto negotiations surrounding the intercity connectors.\n\n\n3\n     The Government chose not to cross-examine Witness B.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f            On October 19, 2006, the district court issued a sealed\n\norder confirming its earlier relevancy ruling and quashing both\n\nsubpoenas.       The court took account of documents submitted by Dick\n\nCorporation and the witnesses' testimony to confirm its pre-hearing\n\nassessment with respect to Witness B:              the proposed evidence was\n\nirrelevant to any triable issue or defense, as the contractual\n\nrelationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation began more than\n\ntwo years after the events giving rise to the accusations against\n\nVázquez; allowing testimony on this relationship would \"result in\n\nunnecessary       and    irrelevant     distractions.\"       With       respect   to\n\nWitness A, the court found that he had no evidence to offer that\n\nwould tend to prove or disprove Vázquez's link to any wrongdoing,\n\nsave   possible       knowledge    of   two   discrete   events    on    which    the\n\ndefendants should be permitted to question Witness A at trial; the\n\ndefendants did not ultimately avail themselves of this opportunity\n\nand    Witness    A     never   appeared   at   trial.    The     district    court\n\nmaintained the seal on all written and oral arguments in the\n\nlitigation surrounding the quashed subpoenas, and ordered that any\n\npublic dissemination of the hearing transcript or the exhibits\n\nproffered at the hearing would result in \"severe penalties by\n\ncontempt or otherwise.\"            The court denied Vázquez's post-trial\n\nmotion to unseal this portion of the record.               Vázquez and Morell\n\nnow argue before us that these decisions effected a violation of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\ftheir Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, compelling us to\n\nvacate their convictions.\n\n               Trial   began   on    September    26,    2006.     Among   others,\n\nFeliciano, Carmona, Cobián, and Granados testified as government\n\nwitnesses. Among many other things, Cobián testified on direct that\n\nVázquez told him Morell would be among those helping Thames-Dick to\n\nsecure    the    Superaqueduct       contract.     Morell    objected      to   this\n\ntestimony as hearsay not covered by the coconspirator exemption in\n\nFederal    Rule    of    Evidence     801(d)(2)(E).        The    district      court\n\nprovisionally      allowed     the    testimony    and    later    confirmed     the\n\napplicability of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) and kept the testimony on the\n\nrecord. Morell now claims this ruling constituted reversible error.\n\n               The Government also called the co-case agent, Federal\n\nBureau    of    Investigation       (\"FBI\")    special   agent    Ivan   Vitousek.\n\nVitousek testified about a number of FBI investigatory practices,\n\nincluding that of using cooperators in public corruption cases.                   In\n\nthe course of direct and cross-examination, Vitousek made several\n\nstatements that the defendants characterized as improper bolstering\n\nof the credibility of other government witnesses.                    Vázquez and\n\nMorell argue on appeal that Vitousek's vouching made the jury more\n\nlikely to believe these witnesses, thus prejudicing the outcome of\n\nthe trial to their detriment.                 During closing arguments, the\n\nprosecutor made a number of statements the defendants now brand as\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fprosecutorial misconduct mandating retrial.       We discuss all these\n\nchallenges in greater detail below.\n\n           On November 3, 2006, the jury convicted Vázquez and Morell\n\non the conspiracy count, on several of the extortion counts, and on\n\nseveral of the mail and wire fraud counts. On January 30, 2007, the\n\ndistrict court sentenced Vázquez and Morell each to five years'\n\nimprisonment, and a $100,000 fine.       The court determined their\n\nrespective guideline Sentencing ranges (\"GSRs\") by looking at the\n\ntotal amount of profit earned by the subcontractors -- some $10\n\nmillion. On appeal, both defendants challenge the propriety of this\n\nmethodology.\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n           A.   Chief Judge Fusté's Non-Recusal\n\n           Before trial, Vázquez moved for Chief Judge Fusté to\n\nrecuse himself, claiming recusal was required for a number of\n\nreasons.   Chief Judge Fusté denied the motion, Vázquez-Botet, 453\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 374, and Vázquez petitioned us for mandamus relief,\n\nwhich we denied, Vázquez-Botet I, 464 F.3d at 57.          On appeal,\n\nVázquez renews his claim that Chief Judge Fusté should have been\n\nrecused, but narrows the focus to two arguments.      We address these\n\nin turn. We will sustain Chief Judge Fusté's decision not to recuse\n\nhimself unless we find that it \"cannot be defended as a rational\n\nconclusion supported by [a] reasonable reading of the record.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fUnited States v.

Specifically, Brill represented subcontractor Laracy during\n\nseveral meetings between Laracy and the Government, negotiated the\n\nagreement that provided Laracy with immunity in exchange for his\n\ngrand jury and trial testimony in this case, and represented him\n\nwhen he testified before the grand jury that indicted Vázquez.\n\nBrill also represented José Ventura, another local contractor not\n\ninvolved in the events at issue here.              During this representation,\n\nBrill filed a public motion in the district court (presided over by\n\na   different   judge)    in     which    she    requested   sanctions   against\n\nVázquez's lawyer for attempting to intimidate Ventura.                     After\n\nVázquez had been indicted, Brill sent a letter to Vázquez's lawyers\n\naccusing Vázquez of trying to extort money out of Ventura by falsely\n\naccusing Ventura of slander; Brill copied this letter to the\n\nprosecutors in this case so they could investigate whether Vázquez\n\nhad thereby violated his bail conditions.\n\n            Vázquez argues that Chief Judge Fusté's decision not to\n\nrecuse   himself   in    light    of     his    wife's   activities   constitutes\n\nreversible error under 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(5)(ii) (judge shall\n\ndisqualify himself if spouse \"[i]s acting as a lawyer in the\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fproceeding\"); see also id. § 455(d)(1) (\"'[P]roceeding' includes\n\npretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation.\").\n\nWe disagree.

In line with this directive, Brill did not\n\nappear before him in this case, as counsel for Ventura, Laracy, or\n\nanyone else.\n\n           Specifically with respect to Brill's representation of\n\nVentura, it is clear that neither of the incidents impugned by\n\nVázquez   counts    as   \"actually      participat[ing]   in   th[is]   case.\"\n\nVázquez-Botet    I,   464   F.3d   at    58.   Brill's    motion   requesting\n\nsanctions against Vázquez's lawyer on Ventura's behalf occurred\n\nbefore Vázquez was even indicted.           We reaffirm our observation in\n\nVázquez-Botet I that this action thus fell outside the scope of\n\n\"pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation.\"\n\n464 F.3d at 58 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 455(d)(1)). In Vázquez-Botet I,\n\nwe likewise rejected Vázquez's other contention relating to Ventura:\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthat Brill's post-indictment letter to Vázquez's lawyers, copied to\n\nthe prosecutor in this case, somehow converted her into a lawyer\n\nacting in this proceeding.   Id. at 59.    Brill sent this letter in\n\nresponse to a communication from Vázquez directly to Ventura seeking\n\n$10 million for allegedly slandering him during testimony in other\n\njudicial and legislative proceedings.     In her letter, Brill cited\n\na statutory privilege for Ventura's testimony and characterized\n\nVázquez's demand as \"laughable.\"   However, while she remarked that\n\nVázquez's demand may also have been extortionate, she did not accuse\n\nhim of extortion outright.   And the prosecutor did not act on the\n\nletter by, for example, requesting sanctions against Vázquez for\n\nviolating his bail conditions, adding charges against him in this\n\ncase, or issuing a separate indictment for attempting to extort\n\nmoney out of Ventura.   Moreover, Brill made no submissions before\n\nthe district court in this case requesting action against Vázquez;\n\nno party sought introduction of Brill's letter into evidence or made\n\nany reference to it; and Ventura was not called to testify.    These\n\nconsiderations lead us readily to conclude, as we did in Vázquez-\n\nBotet I, that any connection between Brill's letter and the events\n\nin this case was simply too tangential to qualify her as a lawyer\n\nacting in the proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f           As for Laracy, while he did testify at trial, he was not\n\nrepresented by Brill at the time.4          Brill's representation in the\n\nnegotiations for Laracy's immunity agreement occurred more than ten\n\nmonths prior to Vázquez's indictment, and Brill was not mentioned\n\nat any point during the trial. Thus, as we held in Vázquez-Botet I,\n\nBrill's representation did not constitute acting in this proceeding.\n\n464 F.3d at 58.    We also expressed doubts in Vázquez-Botet I that\n\nher representation of Laracy during his grand jury testimony could\n\nbe considered part of this proceeding because the grand jury is\n\nfunctionally and constitutionally separate from the district court.\n\nId. at 58 n.6 (citing In re United States, 441 F.3d at 57).           Today\n\nwe confirm our formerly expressed views and hold that, for purposes\n\nof the recusal statute, the grand jury hearing was separate from\n\npretrial and trial proceedings in the district court.\n\n           Vázquez bases his second challenge to Chief Judge Fusté's\n\nimpartiality on the more general language of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a),\n\nwhich   requires   recusal   where    the   judge's   \"impartiality   might\n\nreasonably be questioned.\"      Vázquez argues that a reasonable and\n\ninformed member of the public could fairly conclude that Chief Judge\n\nFusté was biased against him because Brill openly took sides in this\n\nlitigation by asking another judge to sanction Vázquez's lawyer;\n\nmoreover, as a conjugal partnership under Puerto Rico law, Chief\n\n\n\n4\n   It is unclear from the record whether Laracy was accompanied by\nany lawyer when he gave this testimony.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fJudge Fusté and Brill necessarily shared in the legal fees paid the\n\nlatter by Laracy, and the public surely believes the two talk about\n\ntheir work in private.           These arguments are unavailing.\n\n           Section 455(a) requires us to examine whether a reasonable\n\nobserver, knowing all the relevant facts, would have doubts about\n\nChief Judge Fusté's impartiality in this proceeding.

Critically,    Brill's\n\ninvolvement      in     this    case    and     in   other     matters   tangentially\n\nimplicating Vázquez occurred more than two years before Chief Judge\n\nFusté was randomly assigned to replace the original district judge.\n\nTo that end, Vázquez provides no explanation as to how Brill's fees\n\ncould possibly have biased Chief Judge Fusté against Vázquez or\n\nadversely affected any of his rulings.                  Furthermore, no reasonable\n\nobserver would interpret Brill's advocacy on behalf of Ventura as\n\nevincing some sort of personal animosity toward Vázquez that somehow\n\nendured through pretrial and trial proceedings and prompted her to\n\ndisparage him in front of her husband.\n\n           For these reasons, we cannot say that Chief Judge Fusté's\n\ndecision not to recuse himself was irrational or lacked support on\n\na reasonable reading of the record.

The Government counters that, as explicitly noted\n\nby the district court, this particular hearing was merely an offer\n\nof proof to preserve the court's relevancy determination, and that\n\nneither the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights nor the press and\n\npublic's   First   Amendment   rights    were   implicated.6     Under   the\n\n\n5\n   The amici point out that this case has received high media\nattention in Puerto Rico due to the defendants' notoriety and\nletters to newspapers written by Vázquez professing that what was\ndiscussed at the October 16 hearing exonerates him.\n6\n    The Government also asserts that the press may not raise a\nFirst Amendment argument not raised by one of the parties.\n\n                                  -19-\n\fcircumstances, the Government is correct on the first point; we need\n\nnot reach the merits of the second.\n\n           Vázquez proffered the testimony of Witness A and Witness B\n\nand the subpoenaed Dick Corporation documents in an attempt to show\n\nthat Witness B, Consultant C, and powerful persons for whom they\n\nworked were the ones who extorted money out of the subcontractors\n\nin exchange for the Superaqueduct contract, and that the defendants\n\nwere framed in order to throw suspicion off of these and other\n\nimplicated individuals. After considering the testimony of Witness\n\nA and Witness B from the October 16 hearing, the district court\n\nconfirmed its earlier ruling that the evidence was mostly irrelevant\n\nto any matter at issue in the trial of Vázquez and Morell.               The\n\ncourt   focused   primarily   on   the    timeline   of   the    contractual\n\nrelationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation.            Witness A and\n\nWitness B indicated that Witness B began working informally on\n\nbehalf of Dick Corporation sometime in 1998, as a consultant and\n\nmarketing agent for the company in several construction projects in\n\nPuerto Rico and elsewhere.     This relationship was formalized in a\n\nwritten contract in the fall of 1999, and Consultant C was hired at\n\naround the same time.   The witnesses also testified that Witness B\n\nand Consultant C had nothing to do with the 1995-96 discussions\n\nsurrounding the Superaqueduct bid. The district court also examined\n\ndocuments submitted by Dick Corporation, which confirmed that the\n\ncontractual relationship between Witness B and Dick Corporation\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fbegan well after the bid was awarded, and opined that Vázquez's\n\nsubpoena   to   Dick   Corporation    \"was   a   broad,   sweeping   fishing\n\nexpedition.\" The court concluded that Vázquez's theory that Witness\n\nB was involved in the Superaqueduct extortion scheme was unfounded\n\nspeculation and that any evidence Witness B could provide at trial\n\nwould be irrelevant, and accordingly quashed Vázquez's subpoenas to\n\nWitness B and Dick Corporation.7             The court ordered that the\n\ntranscript of the October 16 hearing and the proffered exhibits\n\nremain sealed, and warned that their divulgence would be punished\n\nby contempt.\n\n           We first address the defendants' contention that the\n\ndistrict court's relevancy ruling deprived them of an opportunity\n\nto present exonerating evidence to the jury, and thus violated their\n\nSixth Amendment right to defend themselves.         We afford the district\n\ncourt considerable discretion in making relevancy determinations and\n\nin excluding evidence for lack of relevance, and our review of such\n\ndeterminations is for abuse of discretion.

Relentless,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200599\"><a href=\"/opinion/200599/richards-v-relentless-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 49 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n7\n    The court found Witness A's proposed testimony minimally\nrelevant with respect to \"two very discrete areas,\" and left the\nsubpoena intact insofar as the defendants wished to ask him\nquestions only in relation to these areas.      These areas had no\nbearing on whether someone other than Vázquez, Morell, and Granados\nwas extorting money from the subcontractors.       The defendants'\ndecision not to call Witness A at trial waives any objection\nregarding that potential testimony.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f          After examining the October 16 hearing transcript, the\n\ndocuments provided by Dick Corporation, and the submissions of the\n\nparties, we agree with the district court that the proposed evidence\n\nwas irrelevant to any issue in the prosecution of Vázquez and\n\nMorell; we also agree that to place such evidence in front of the\n\njury would have resulted in a confusing and distracting sideshow.\n\nNothing in the transcript, the Dick Corporation documents submitted\n\nat the hearing, or the sealed written submissions contains any\n\nsuggestion that Witness B or Consultant C was connected in any way\n\nto the Superaqueduct project until at least 1998, and then only\n\ntangentially    with   respect   to    the   intercity        connectors,     which\n\ninvolved a completely separate contract.             Moreover, nothing in the\n\nrecord reveals that either individual was involved in any scheme to\n\nextort money from the subcontractors.              The conduct the jury found\n\nto be extortionate began in June 1995, when Vázquez told Cobián that\n\nhe, Morell, and Granados would use their influence to help Thames-\n\nDick win the contract in exchange for money.                While the effects of\n\nthis conduct -- including the subcontractors' monthly payments to\n\nthe defendants and Granados -- continued for several years and\n\npartially overlapped in time with Witness B's and Consultant C's\n\nemployment     at   Dick   Corporation,      the     main    criminal   act     was\n\naccomplished long before these two persons appeared on the scene.\n\nIndeed, Witness B testified that he had no contact at all with the\n\nindividual subcontractors with the exception of Carrero, with whom\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fhe had a social relationship and worked on matters unrelated to the\n\nSuperaqueduct.         Witness B's testimony also indicates that his\n\ncontacts with persons in the Rosselló government were minimal and\n\nhis influence over them virtually nil.\n\n            The   district    court    did    not,    therefore,     abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in deeming the proposed evidence irrelevant and excluding\n\nit from the trial.

Despite the defendants' sweeping assertions regarding the\n\nscope of the public-trial right, the question before us is quite\n\nnarrow.    We think it clear that, as characterized by the district\n\ncourt, the October 16 hearing was not a trial session, but rather\n\na \"question-and-answer\" offer of proof,8 the purpose of which was to\n\ncreate a record so that we could determine the propriety of the\n\ncourt's relevancy ruling.9    See Wright & Graham, Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 5040.3, at 908 (2d ed. 2005) (in question-and-answer\n\noffer of proof, proponent elicits proposed testimony by questioning\n\nwitness outside jury's presence); accord United States v. Adams, 271\n\n\n8\n     Although the actual hearing took place on October 16, 2006 --\nnearly three weeks after opening statements -- the subpoenas that\nresulted in the hearing were issued before trial began, and the\ndistrict court expressly stated at the start of the hearing that it\nwas not part of the trial.\n9\n   Although the district court did not use the term \"offer of\nproof,\" it is evident from the context that this is what the court\nintended. Black's Legal Dictionary defines offer of proof as \"[a]\npresentation of evidence for the record (but outside the jury's\npresence) . . . so that the evidence can be preserved on the record\nfor an appeal of the judge's ruling. . . .       Such an offer may\ninclude tangible evidence or testimony (through questions and\nanswers, a lawyer's narrative description, or an affidavit).\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1114 (8th ed. 2004).\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fF.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir. 2001) (discussing the several types of\n\noffer of proof, and expressing a preference for the question-and-\n\nanswer type).\n\n            The defendants point to no precedent in the Supreme Court,\n\nthis circuit, or elsewhere extending the Sixth Amendment public-\n\ntrial right to an outside-of-trial, question-and-answer offer of\n\nproof -- or indeed, any type of offer of proof.           Furthermore, the\n\nOctober 16 hearing differed in at least two fundamental respects\n\nfrom the categories of non-trial hearings to which the Sixth\n\nAmendment public-trial right has been held to apply in the past,\n\nsuch as hearings on motions to suppress, see, e.g., Waller, 467 U.S.\n\nat 47, and jury-selection proceedings, see, e.g., Owens, 483 F.3d\n\nat 62.

Second,\n\nthe district court was under no obligation to hold the hearing in\n\nthe first place, but chose to do so for our and the defendants'\n\nbenefit when confronted with Vázquez's eleventh-hour request.\n\n            These differences render the Sixth Amendment precedent\n\ninvoked by the defendants inapposite in the circumstances.             While\n\nwe leave open the possibility that the public-trial right may apply\n\nto some offer-of-proof hearings, we decline to recognize such a\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fright on facts as uncompelling as these.10         We accordingly reject\n\nthis ground of appeal.11\n\n            The amici argue that the closure of the October 16 hearing\n\nviolated the press and public's First Amendment right of access to\n\ncriminal proceedings.

Included among them were Cobián and several of the\n\nsubcontractor-witnesses, all of whom received immunity in exchange\n\nfor their cooperation or testimony, and the coconspirator Granados,\n\nwho pled guilty to his role in the extortion and also cooperated\n\nwith investigators.    On the thirteenth day, the Government called\n\nAgent Vitousek, an experienced FBI fraud investigator.\n\n            The defendants identify four episodes in which Vitousek\n\nallegedly vouched for other government witnesses; we address these\n\nin turn. First, the Government sought to elicit from Agent Vitousek\n\nthat the FBI had followed normal procedures in investigating this\n\ncase.     When the prosecutor asked Agent Vitousek why the FBI uses\n\ncooperating insiders as sources in fraud investigations, Vázquez\n\ninterposed a vouching objection which the court overruled. Vitousek\n\nthen described the procedure employed with cooperating insiders,\n\nstating such things as, \"I will tell . . . these cooperating\n\nwitnesses to tell the truth about the information they are going to\n\nprovide us,\" and \"a cooperating defendant . . . can explain exactly\n\nwhat happened.\"    We fail to see how the jury could possibly have\n\nunderstood these generic descriptions of procedure -- with no\n\nreference to any specific individual or case -- to be Vitousek's\n\nassurances that Cobián and Granados were truthful in their dealings\n\nwith the FBI or otherwise.   As the defendants provide nothing more,\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fwe will go no further than this.   See United States v.

Vázquez asked Vitousek about an\n\nincident in which Cobián told investigators that a certain public\n\nofficial had accepted a bribe from him; the substance of the\n\ninterview was memorialized in a nonpublic FBI report. Later, Cobián\n\nadmitted to the investigators that the official had not actually\n\naccepted a bribe.   Vázquez questioned Vitousek at length over why\n\nhe failed to correct the FBI records on this point. While conceding\n\nthat mistakes had been made, Vitousek asserted that there was little\n\nlikelihood of negative repercussions for the official because the\n\ngovernment requires much more than a single interview before it will\n\nindict someone.   \"Trust me,\" Vitousek added, \"[w]e need much more\n\nevidence.\"   Vázquez argues that this testimony gave assurances to\n\nthe jury that Vitousek would never seek the indictment of an\n\ninnocent person, and that the FBI corroborated Cobián's information\n\non Vázquez's role in the Superaqueduct extortion with \"much more\n\nevidence.\"   Since Vázquez did not timely object to this testimony\n\nor move to strike it at trial, we review the challenge for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203058\"><a href=\"/opinion/203058/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nHere again, we fail to see how the jury could possibly have\n\nunderstood the testimony as bolstering the credibility of any of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fGovernment's witnesses, and Vázquez does not explain further.                  As\n\nsuch, we cannot find error, much less plain error.\n\n            The defendants' third vouching challenge gets them no\n\nfurther.    During an exchange in cross-examination, Vázquez asked\n\nAgent Vitousek several times why the Government relied on Cobián\n\ndespite    its   policy    against   dealing   with    cooperators     who   lie.\n\nUltimately, the following exchange occurred between Vázquez and\n\nVitousek:\n\n            Q.     . . . Based on the records of other\n            people, Cuco and Laracy and all the other\n            people who the jury have heard from, you could\n            prosecute Cobián?\n\n            A.      Yes.\n\n            Q.     And the Government has given him               a\n            benefit and chosen not to prosecute him.\n\n            A.      He is cooperating.\n\n            . . .\n\n            Q.     He will not         be   prosecuted     for   the\n            [Superaqueduct]?\n\n            A.     If he tells the truth. And . . . up to\n            now, the assessment has been that he has been\n            truthful.\n\nVázquez objected to this last response as vouching.              The district\n\ncourt overruled the objection, finding that Vázquez had \"opened the\n\ndoor\" to Vitousek's response. This ruling was entirely appropriate,\n\nand certainly not an abuse of discretion:             Vázquez cannot complain\n\nabout vouching in response to his own questions, United States v.\n\nGarcía-Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201227\"><a href=\"/opinion/201227/united-states-v-garcia-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004), especially when\n\n                                     -31-\n\fhe   very    purposely     invited   the    answer   he   got   by   repeatedly\n\nquestioning Vitousek about why he continued to deal with Cobián\n\ndespite the latter's dishonesty, see United States v.

The court indicated\n\nit would instruct the jury later, and allowed Vitousek to continue:\n\n          A.     . . . There is a discrepancy on the\n          amounts of cash that were paid illegally by Mr.\n          Cobián to Mr. Granados Navedo, and there is a\n          discrepancy on the amount that Mr. Granados\n          Navedo says that he received in cash from\n          illegal payments from Mr. Cobián. That doesn't\n          mean that they are lying. . . .\n\n          At sidebar after redirect, Vázquez moved to strike this\n\ntestimony.13   The court denied the motion because Morell had opened\n\nthe door on cross by essentially asking Vitousek which of the two\n\nmen -- Cobián or Granados -- was lying.   The court opted instead to\n\ninstruct the jury as follows:\n\n          The . . . duty to determine whether somebody\n          has been truthful or not is yours.

What he basically\n             told you was that he, rightly or wrongly,\n             believed what they told him, which is a\n             different story.\n\n             You are the sole judges of the credibility of\n             the witnesses.

Neither defendant objected to either set of instructions.\n\n             On appeal, Vázquez and Morell argue that Agent Vitousek's\n\nstatements improperly vouched both for the government's witnesses\n\nin general, and for Cobián and Granados in particular.                        In the\n\ncircumstances,      we    need    not    decide    whether     either       statement\n\nconstituted vouching because any error the district court may have\n\ncommitted in allowing this testimony to stand was harmless.                      The\n\ndistrict court -- obviously mindful of the harm the impugned\n\nstatements    might      cause   to    the   defendants   --    gave    a    curative\n\ninstruction that the jurors not trust in Agent Vitousek's views on\n\nany witness's veracity, but instead judge veracity for themselves\n\non the weight of the evidence.            These instructions were timely (at\n\nmost    a   few   minutes    after      Vitousek   uttered     the     statements),\n\nstraightforward, explicit, and detailed.

In\n\nopening summation, the prosecutor stated:\n\n           You've heard and seen a whole lot of evidence\n           of crime: Conspiracy, extortion, tax offenses,\n           and of course obstruction of justice. And the\n           defense has tried very hard to cloud and\n           complicate the real issues in this case, to\n           focus your attention on anyone, anything, but\n           them. That is their job.\n\nIn rebuttal, the prosecutor remarked along similar lines as follows:\n\n           [T]he government in this case has been accused\n           of political motivation. Is there any evidence\n           of that? We have been accused of intentionally\n           bringing in witnesses who would lie to you,\n           creating a whole fabricated case against these\n           defendants. There is no evidence of this kind\n           of behavior.    And it is offensive, and you\n           should take it for what it is:    The acts of\n           some very desperate lawyers, lawyers who want\n           to cloud the evidence.\n\nHere,   Vázquez    objected,   but   the    court   made   no   ruling.    The\n\nprosecutor continued:\n\n           . . . [Morell] has told you repeatedly that if\n           the Government did not bring you a witness, you\n           are entitled to infer that witness would give\n           evidence that would exculpate, that would prove\n           his client is innocent. Make no mistake, the\n           defendant has no burden. No defendant has any\n           obligation to testify before the grand jury or\n           at trial.    But the defendant has the same\n           subpoena power as the Government.       And if\n           [Morell] or [Vázquez], for that matter, thought\n           they could subpoena a witness who would . . .\n\n                                     -37-\n\f          give you testimony that would exculpate the[m],\n          you would have heard it.15\n\nVázquez again objected and the district court overruled.        The court\n\ndid not give curative instructions.\n\n          The defendants make two main arguments.             First, they\n\nobject to the prosecutor's statement that \"if [Morell] or [Vázquez]\n\n. . . thought they could subpoena a witness who would . . . give you\n\ntestimony that would exculpate their clients, you would have heard\n\nit\"; they assert that this remark suggested to the jury that they\n\nhad the duty to present the missing evidence.

Second, they contend that the prosecutor's\n\ncharacterization of them as \"desperate lawyers\" seeking to \"cloud\n\nthe   issues\"   improperly   disparaged   defense   counsel    and   their\n\nimportant role in the justice system.     See Manning, 23 F.3d at 573\n\nn.1 (disapproving of prosecutor's remark that defense counsel were\n\nlike \"Shakespeare's players, full of sound and fury signifying\n\nnothing\").\n\n          While we are reluctant to find categorically that these\n\nremarks constituted misconduct,16 even assuming they did, we cannot\n\n\n15\n     After Vázquez's objection was sustained, the prosecutor\ncontinued: \"You are entitled to disregard [Morell]'s argument that\n[Morell's secretary] had any relevant, important evidence to give\nin this case because the government did not call her. . . .

The first element is easily\n\nsatisfied:   Cobián testified -- and a rational jury could have\n\nbelieved -- that the subcontractors made periodic cash payments to\n\nhim between 1997 and 1999 which he then passed on to Vázquez,\n\nMorell, and Granados.   Several subcontractors verified that they\n\nmade such payments to Cobián, and this testimony was supported by\n\ndocumentary evidence -- for example, sham checks from Carmona's\n\nbusiness to non-existent individuals for unperformed services, so\n\nCarmona could generate the cash necessary to pay Cobián.   Feliciano\n\nalso testified that he made one payment to Vázquez in person.   The\n\nsecond element is also easily met:    Feliciano, Carmona, and Laracy\n\nall testified that they agreed voluntarily (though reluctantly) to\n\npay the money demanded, and a rational jury could have believed this\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n19\n   We have held that \"the government need only show a realistic\nprobability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce[] in\norder to bring extortion within the reach of the Hobbs Act.\"\nUnited States v.

Feliciano, for\n\nexample, testified that he agreed to pay the money because, if he\n\ndid not, \"[t]he government\" could \"make life very difficult\" for his\n\nconstruction firm by delaying Superaqueduct project payments and not\n\nawarding the firm government contracts in the future.               Carmona\n\ntestified that he felt compelled to pay and keep paying because if\n\nhe failed to do so, the Thames-Dick consortium could be removed from\n\nthe Superaqueduct project and his construction firm might also\n\nsuffer other adverse consequences.        Laracy testified in a similar\n\nvein that he feared detriment to his business if he did not pay.\n\nFeliciano, Carmona, and Laracy testified further that they knew the\n\nrecipients of the money were people with influence in the NPP\n\n\n                                  -46-\n\fgovernment; they knew Granados to be among them; and Feliciano and\n\nCarmona   also    knew    Vázquez    to    be     among   them.      Based   on   this\n\ntestimony, a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Feliciano, Carmona, and Laracy paid Cobián out of fear\n\nof detrimental consequences for their respective businesses, and\n\nthat   this   fear       was   reasonable         because     they    believed     the\n\nextortionists to have real power to effect such detriment.\n\n           The next critical question we must answer is whether a\n\nrational jury could have found Morell to be linked to the extortion\n\nscheme in a manner that allows criminal liability to be imputed to\n\nhim.   We must therefore examine whether a rational jury could have\n\nfound a conspiracy to exist, and Morell to be a member of it, as\n\ncharged in Count One of the indictment.              To establish a conspiracy,\n\nthe Government must prove three elements:                     (1) an agreement to\n\ncommit an unlawful act; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the\n\nagreement and voluntary participation in it; and (3) an overt act\n\nby at least one of the coconspirators in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.

Morell's conviction may be sustained on sufficient\n\nevidence of a conspiracy      to commit any of the three charged\n\nconspiracy offenses.     Id. at 46.     For purposes of the present\n\nanalysis, we focus on conspiracy to commit extortion.\n\n            Morell does not seriously challenge the Government's\n\nevidence on the first and third elements of conspiracy, and we find\n\nan abundance of evidence in the record to support their existence.\n\nCobián and Granados testified that Vázquez and Cobián devised a plan\n\nto compel the subcontractors to hand over a portion of their\n\nSuperaqueduct profits.     As we have found above, a rational jury\n\ncould have considered this compelled payment to constitute extortion\n\n-- the requisite unlawful act that is the object of the conspiracy.\n\nAnd the record reveals many overt acts in furtherance of such a\n\nconspiracy including, for example, Cobián's physical transfer of\n\nperiodic cash payments from Feliciano and Carmona to Vázquez's\n\nmedical office.\n\n            What remains, then, is the second element: whether Morell\n\nknew of the extortion agreement and voluntary participated in it.\n\nThe most direct evidence against Morell in this regard is Cobián's\n\ntestimony about one of his initial meetings with Vázquez. According\n\nto this testimony, Vázquez told Cobián that Morell and Granados\n\nwould be assisting him in his efforts to secure the Superaqueduct\n\ncontract for Thames-Dick, and that Cobián should approach Morell to\n\nwork out how Morell wished to receive his share of the payments.\n\n\n                                 -48-\n\fYet even in the absence of this testimony, a rational factfinder\n\ncould still have inferred that Morell knew of and adhered to the\n\nextortion    agreement     based    on    a     significant   quantum    of   other\n\nevidence.      For   example,      Cobián       testified   that,   in   1997,   he\n\napproached Morell to arrange how the latter wished to receive his\n\nshare.   Cobián stated that Morell was not surprised to see him, but\n\ninstead seemed to have been expecting him and had already devised\n\na specific plan for concealing the transfer of the subcontractors'\n\nmoney.     According to Cobián, Morell proceeded to draw up a sham\n\nlegal contract and made several other elaborate arrangements to this\n\nend.   Morell then accepted periodic payments from Cobián under the\n\nsham contract and through third-party payments from 1997 to 1999 --\n\na period largely overlapping with the period during which Vázquez\n\nand Granados were also receiving payments.             Morell does not dispute\n\nthat he received thousands of dollars from Cobián over the course\n\nof those two years.\n\n            As noted above, it is not for us to make credibility\n\ndeterminations on a review of the sufficiency of the evidence, but\n\nmerely to say whether a rational jury could have believed this\n\ntestimony.     See Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.             We find that a rational\n\njury could have believed Cobián, and then drawn the reasonable\n\ninference that Cobián's payments to Morell were not for legal\n\nservices     and   other   licit     ends,       but   were   instead    designed\n\nclandestinely to channel him his part of the extortionate proceeds.\n\n\n                                         -49-\n\fA rational jury could then have drawn a second inference:                  that\n\nMorell obviously knew of, and voluntarily participated in, the\n\nscheme.    Accordingly, a rational jury could have found all three\n\nelements of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, and this jury's\n\nconviction of Morell under Count One was therefore supported by\n\nsufficient evidence.\n\n            This brings us to the sufficiency of the evidence as to\n\nthe counts charging Morell with substantive crimes incident to the\n\nconspiracy.    Contrary to Morell's assertion at oral argument, the\n\nlaw does not require proof that he personally took any steps to\n\ninstill economic fear in the subcontractors, to influence the award\n\nof the contract or the payment for performance under the contract,\n\nor that the subcontractors feared Morell or even knew of his\n\ninvolvement. Instead, under the Pinkerton doctrine, a defendant can\n\nbe found liable for the substantive crime of a coconspirator\n\nprovided the crime was reasonably foreseeable and committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.

The district court properly instructed\n\nthe jury on the Pinkerton doctrine.

We\nreject this argument, as extortion can be an ongoing crime, see,\ne.g., Bucci, 839 F.2d at 829-30, and this extortion went on until\nthe payments ceased in 1999. In any event, a rational jury could\nhave found that Morell adhered to the extortion agreement from its\ninception, and not merely from 1997, when he began receiving\npayments.\n\n                                       -51-\n\fdated April 16, 1999 from Thames-Dick to Feliciano, Carmona, and\n\nLaracy,   respectively.       These     were   apparently   chosen   as\n\nrepresentative samples of the monthly wire transfers Thames-Dick\n\nmade to the subcontractors beginning in January 1997, a portion of\n\nwhich the subcontractors then handed over to Cobián, who in turn\n\ngave a portion to Morell, Vázquez, and Granados.        The indictment\n\ncharges that Morell failed to account for this 1999 income on his\n\nPuerto Rico tax return, and then used the mails to send the return\n\nto the Puerto Rico tax agency.    This mailing was the basis for the\n\nmail-fraud charge in Count Thirteen.\n\n          Upon review of the record, we find sufficient evidence for\n\na rational jury to have convicted Morell on all of these counts.\n\nA rational jury could have believed Cobián's testimony that Morell\n\ndirected Cobián to funnel him the subcontractors' money through\n\nchecks for sham legal services purportedly rendered to Cobián's\n\ncompany, and through payments to third parties for Morell's benefit.\n\nSuch a jury could also have credited the certified copy of Morell's\n\n1999 tax return in evidence, that failed to report payments made to\n\nhim by Cobián in that year.      A rational jury could likewise have\n\nbelieved Morell's tax preparer, who testified that Morell did not\n\ntell him about income earned from Cobián's company in 1999, and that\n\nhe therefore did not include it on the 1999 return. These findings,\n\nin turn, would be sufficient to satisfy the first element for both\n\n\n\n\n                                 -52-\n\fmail and wire fraud:     that Morell intentionally, knowingly, and\n\nwillingly participated in a scheme to defraud Hacienda.           See id.\n\n          Specifically with respect to the wire-fraud counts, a\n\nrational jury could then have found the second element fulfilled --\n\nthat wire communications were used in furtherance of the scheme.21\n\nMorell need not have had any personal involvement in initiating the\n\nwire transfers; instead, the use of the wires need only have been\n\n\"a   reasonably   foreseeable   part    of   the   scheme    in   which   he\n\nparticipated.\"    Id. at 723 n.6 (quoting United States v.

From the evidence presented, a rational jury could\n\nhave inferred that it was reasonably foreseeable that interstate\n\nwires would be used in the ordinary course of business for Thames-\n\nDick to transfer payments to the subcontractors.            These transfers\n\nwere essential to the success of the extortion scheme and, in turn,\n\nthe scheme to defraud the Puerto Rico tax agency, because they\n\n\n21\n    The parties stipulated that the wire payments traveled in\ninterstate commerce, so we need not address the evidence on this\nelement.\n\n                                 -53-\n\fprovided the subcontractors the money they gave to Morell and the\n\nothers, and which Morell then failed to report.      On the basis of\n\nsuch findings, a rational jury could thus have concluded that Morell\n\nwas guilty of wire fraud on each of the three counts.22\n\n          Turning specifically to the mail-fraud count, a rational\n\njury could also have found the second element fulfilled here -- that\n\nthe mails were used in furtherance of the scheme.       The district\n\ncourt admitted into evidence a copy of a meter-marked envelope\n\naddressed to Hacienda and bearing a Hacienda receipt stamp, along\n\nwith Morell's 1999 return.    Morell does not dispute that these were\n\nhis envelope and return, but contends there is no proof that the\n\nreturn was actually placed in the mail.    We disagree, and conclude\n\nthat a rational jury could have credited evidence that Morell mailed\n\nthe return or reasonably expected that in the regular course of\n\nbusiness, it would be mailed to Hacienda on his behalf.     Morell's\n\ntax preparer, who formerly worked for Hacienda, testified that when\n\ntax returns came in the mail, Hacienda kept the envelope and stapled\n\nit to the return, but would likely discard an envelope accompanying\n\na hand-delivered return.     A rational jury could have believed this\n\n\n\n22\n   Morell makes much of the fact that the indictment also alleges\nhe committed fraud on his 1997 and 1998 tax returns, but the\nevidence used to show wire transfers for Counts Nine to Eleven\nconsisted of April 1999 transactions made after the 1997 and 1998\nreturns had been filed. We need not address this argument because\nall that was required to sustain Morell's convictions on these\ncounts was sufficient evidence that he committed fraud on one of\nthe returns, and the 1999 return meets this requirement.\n\n                                 -54-\n\ftestimony, and inferred from it that the 1999 return and the meter-\n\nmarked envelope were actually mailed.    The evidence was therefore\n\nsufficient to support a finding of guilt by mail fraud.\n\n           For these reasons, we reject all of Morell's challenges\n\nto the sufficiency of the evidence, and proceed to the next ground\n\nof appeal.\n\n           F.   Admission of Coconspirator Statement Against Morell\n\n           This ground of appeal, also advanced only by Morell,\n\nconcerns Cobián's testimony on direct examination about one of the\n\nmeetings in which Vázquez proposed the extortion scheme to Cobián.\n\nCobián testified that he asked Vázquez who else would be helping the\n\nsubcontractors to secure the Superaqueduct contract,       and that\n\nVázquez told Cobián it would be Morell and Granados.

It accordingly looked to\n\n§ 2C1.1 of the 1998 Guidelines,23 on \"Extortion Under Color of\n\nOfficial Right\":\n\n          (a)      Base Offense Level:     10.\n\n          (b)      Special Offense Characteristics\n\n                   . . .\n\n                   (2)   (If more than one applies, use the greater):\n\n                           (A) If the value of the payment, the benefit\n                           received or to be received in return for the\n                           payment, or the loss to the government from\n                           the offense, whichever is greatest, exceeded\n                           $2,000, increase by the corresponding number\n                           of levels from the table in § 2F1.1 (Fraud\n                           and Deceit). . . .\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2C1.1 (1998). Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) thus provides three\n\nalternative amounts, and the court must choose the greatest:         (1)\n\nthe value of the payment; (2) the benefit received or to be received\n\nin return for the payment; or (3) the loss to the government from\n\nthe offense.24\n\n\n\n23\n    The PSRs recommended that the 1998 Guidelines be used by\noperation of U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(1) (2006). The district court\nfollowed this recommendation, and the parties did not object. We\naccordingly use the 1998 Guidelines as well, noting that while\n§ 2C1.1 has been amended since 1998, the key language for purposes\nof analyzing the defendants' challenge remains virtually the same.\n24\n    It is undisputed that the third alternative -- loss to the\ngovernment -- is not available because the government lost no money\nas a result of the extortion scheme. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2\ncmt. n.6 (1998), the district court did not make an independent\ndetermination of the defendants' sentences for defrauding the\nPuerto Rico tax authorities. As such, those losses played no part\nin the sentencing calculations in this case.\n\n                                   -58-\n\f            Relying on the PSRs, the district court determined that\n\nthe alternative with the highest quantity was the \"benefit to be\n\nreceived in return for the payment,\" which the court estimated as\n\nslightly over $10 million -- the approximate combined profit earned\n\nby the subcontractors for their work on the Superaqueduct project.\n\nFollowing the directive in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A), the court then looked\n\nto   §   2F1.1,    which     instructed     it    to   increase      the    defendants'\n\nrespective       offense     levels   by    fifteen     because      the    \"loss\"    the\n\ndefendants caused exceeded $10 million.                     Id. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(P)\n\n(1998).      Added      to   the   base    offense     level    of    ten    (which   was\n\nundisputed), the defendants were left with offense levels of twenty-\n\nfive, along with respective Criminal History Categories of I.                         This\n\nproduced    a     GSR   of   fifty-seven     to   seventy-one         months.     After\n\nundertaking the remainder of the sentencing analysis, including an\n\nexamination of the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the court\n\nsentenced Vázquez and Morell toward the lower end of this range, to\n\nsixty months' imprisonment each.             The defendants timely objected to\n\nthe methodology used to produce this sentence.\n\n            On appeal, Vázquez and Morell argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in choosing the \"benefit to be received\" alternative\n\nbecause there was no evidence that the subcontractors received the\n\nroughly    $10     million    in   profits    \"in      return   for    the    payment.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).            According to the defendants, it was\n\nundisputed that the Thames-Dick consortium was the most qualified\n\n\n                                           -59-\n\fof the bidders, and there was no evidence that Vázquez or Morell\n\nactually exerted any real influence on anyone responsible for\n\nawarding Thames-Dick the contract.              As Granados testified, the\n\ncoconspirators' promise to help the subcontractors was merely an\n\ninsurance policy to make sure nothing happened that would impede the\n\nawarding of the contract -- not to compel or persuade the relevant\n\nofficials to award it.         Therefore, because Thames-Dick was awarded\n\nthe contract based on its and the subcontractors' own merit through\n\na process not tainted by the defendants' crime, the \"benefit . . .\n\nto be received in return for the payment\" was zero, and the court\n\nmust sentence the defendants under the (much lower) \"value of the\n\npayment\" alternative in § 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).            The district court did\n\nnot make specific findings on the amount of money the defendants\n\nactually   received,     but    other   evidence   suggested    it   was   below\n\n$1 million for each defendant.\n\n           We   begin    by    determining     whether   the   district    court\n\ncommitted legal error in its interpretation of the meaning of\n\n\"benefit . . . to be received in return for the payment\" in\n\n§ 2C1.1(b)(2)(A).       This is a question of first impression in this\n\ncircuit.    Evident from the plain language of the guideline --\n\n\"benefit . . . to be received\" -- is the Sentencing Commission's\n\nintention that this inquiry be forward-looking, a conclusion also\n\nreached by the Fifth Circuit in one of the rare cases interpreting\n\nthe guideline in the context of extortion, as opposed to bribery:\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\f\"[I]n determining the amount of benefit to be received, courts may\n\nconsider   the    expected   benefits,   not   only   the    actual    benefits\n\nreceived.\"       Griffin, 324 F.3d at 366 (emphasis added).                   This\n\nprospective analysis comports with our closely analogous case law\n\non computing loss for purposes of sentencing.               We have held that\n\nwhen a person is convicted of a fraud offense, a proper analysis of\n\nthe loss he intended to cause asks what a person in his position at\n\nthe relevant time would reasonably have expected to happen to the\n\nvictim as a result of the fraud.         See Innarelli, 524 F.3d at 291.\n\nThe rationale for an ex ante inquiry lies in the purpose of the\n\nexercise: to set the defendant's punishment at a level commensurate\n\nwith the degree of his moral culpability.         For this reason, it is\n\nnot determinative what loss the victim actually ended up suffering,\n\nor indeed whether the victim suffered any loss at all.                Id.25\n\n           This reasoning translates readily into the extortion\n\ncontext.     We think that the best interpretation of \"benefit . . .\n\nto be received in return for the payment\" is the benefit a person\n\nin the defendant's position at the time of the extortion would\n\nreasonably have expected the victim to receive by paying him the\n\nmoney he demanded.     See Griffin, 324 F.3d at 366.          This figure, in\n\nturn, affords the court a gauge for how severely the defendant\n\n\n\n25\n   As we noted in Innarelli, this rationale contrasts with that for\nrestitution, which is \"necessarily a backward-looking inquiry\"\nbecause the defendant can only be made to reimburse the victim for\nthe loss he actually caused to the victim. 524 F.3d at 294.\n\n                                   -61-\n\fdeserves to be punished.   We reject the defendants' invitation to\n\nlook with 20-20 hindsight at whether, at the end of the day, they\n\nactually did anything overt to help Thames-Dick get the contract.\n\nAs reasonable expectation at the time of the extortion is the\n\ntouchstone of the inquiry, the district court's interpretation was\n\nthe right one.\n\n          As for the amount of the benefit in this case, neither\n\ndefendant contests the district court's estimate of slightly more\n\nthan $10 million, a figure the court described as conservative.   In\n\nany event, our review of the record reveals this estimate to be\n\nreasonable, and a reasonable estimate is all that is required.    See\n\nInnarelli, 524 F.3d at 290; Griffin, 324 F.3d at 365.   We therefore\n\nsee no reason to deem this quantity clearly erroneous.       United\n\nStates v.

See U.S.S.G. §§ 2C1.1(b)(2),\n\n2F1.1(b)(1)(P).   Accordingly, the court's GSR calculation for each\n\ndefendant was correct, and in the absence of any further sentencing\n\nchallenges, our review ends there.\n\n\n                               -62-\n\f                         III.
