José Antonio Fusté,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph C. Laws, Jr. on Memorandum of Law in Support of\nApplication for Certificate of Appealability for petitioner.\n\n\n\n                              May 22, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam. Petitioner Hector Escudero-Aponte ultimately\n\nseeks to appeal from the district court's rejection on the merits\n\nof his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, presented in a\n\nmotion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.       However, his present request\n\nis for a certificate of appealability (\"COA\") to appeal from the\n\ndenial     of   his   Fed.R.Civ.P.   60(b)(6)   motion.   Specifically,\n\npetitioner sought and was denied permission under Fed.R.App.P.\n\n4(a)(6) to reopen the time to appeal from denial of his § 2255\n\nmotion.     Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of that\n\ndenial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).        Petitioner is presently\n\nseeking to appeal from the denial of that motion to reconsider.\n\nI. The COA Standard\n\n            Under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c), a COA may issue only upon the\n\n\"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"\n\nAlthough petitioner is currently seeking a COA to appeal from a\n\nprocedural ruling, the district court's denial of his § 2255 motion\n\nrejected his constitutional claims on the merits.          Therefore, §\n\n2253(c) requires petitioner to \"demonstrate that reasonable jurists\n\nwould find the district court's assessment of the constitutional\n\nclaims debatable or wrong.\"       Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 485\n\n(2000).1\n\n\n     1\n       Because petitioner clearly cannot satisfy the merits prong\nof the COA standard, we need not address the procedural prong.\nThat prong is complicated in this case by the two levels of\nprocedural rulings, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and Fed.R.App.P.\n4(a)(6).   In the Rule 4(a)(6) context, the Second Circuit has\n\n                                     -2-\n\fII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims\n\n               \"A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nmust    show    (1)       that    counsel's    representation     'fell   below    an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness,' and (2) that counsel's\n\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\" Roe v. Flores-\n\nOrtega,       528   U.S.     470,    476-77    (2000)    (quoting   Strickland     v.\n\nWashington,         466    U.S.     668   (1984)).       That    test   applies    to\n\npetitioner's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file\n\na notice of appeal. Id. at 477.                 It also applies to petitioner's\n\nclaim of ineffective assistance based upon counsel's failure to\n\nfile a motion under former Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).                  See United States\n\nv. Nino, 878 F.2d 101, 104 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n               Where, as in this case, the district court dismisses §\n\n2255 claims without holding an evidentiary hearing, \"we take as\n\ntrue the sworn allegations of fact set forth in the petition unless\n\nthose   allegations         are     merely    conclusory,    contradicted   by    the\n\nrecord, or inherently incredible.\" Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d\n\n636,    641    (1st   Cir.       2002).       Petitioner's   §   2255   motion    and\n\naccompanying statement allege that immediately after sentencing,\n\npetitioner and members of his family asked counsel to file a motion\n\nfor reconsideration of the sentence.                    It is further alleged by\n\n\n\ndeveloped a standard for satisfying § 2253(c), which might be\nadaptable to the slightly different procedural context in which\nthis appeal arises. See Eltayib v. United States, 294 F.3d 347,\n400 (2d Cir. 2002). However, we need not resolve that issue here.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fpetitioner that counsel responded that in his view such a motion\n\nwould not be successful.      The motion was not filed.   Although it is\n\nalleged that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal, there is no\n\nspecific allegation that petitioner requested counsel to file an\n\nappeal, or even that petitioner desired to appeal his sentence.\n\nA. Failure to File Rule 35(b) Motion\n\n             Petitioner pled guilty to a crime committed in 1986,\n\nbefore the applicable date of the Sentencing Reform Act (November\n\n1, 1987).2     Therefore, the former version of Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)\n\napplied, which provided as follows:\n\n             (b) Reduction of Sentence. A motion to reduce\n             a sentence may be made, or the court may\n             reduce a sentence without motion, within 120\n             days after the sentence is imposed or\n             probation is revoked, or within 120 days after\n             receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon\n             affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the\n             appeal.\n\nFormer Rule 35(b).          \"[F]ormer Rule 35(b) conferred virtually\n\nunfettered discretion on sentencing courts.\" United States v.\n\nAngiulo, 57 F.3d 38, 41 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             \"No court has held that failure to file . . . a motion\n\n[pursuant     to   former    Rule   35(b)]   automatically   constitutes\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.\" Shraiar v. United States, 736\n\n\n\n     2\n       The 1987 amendment limited the ground for Rule 35(b) relief\nto \"substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother person who has committed an offense,\" added a \"government\nmotion\" requirement and extended the time for filing such motion.\nSee United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fF.2d 817, 818 (1st Cir. 1984).            Courts have held that \"where\n\ncounsel's promise to file such a motion is followed by counsel's\n\nfailure to file it, the court should look further into the matter.\"\n\nId.; see United States v. Golden, 854 F.3d 31, 32 (3d Cir. 1988);\n\nUnited States v. Ackerman, 619 F.2d 285, 288 (3d Cir. 1980).\n\nPetitioner has not alleged that his counsel promised to file a Rule\n\n35(b) motion.     To the contrary, he alleged that his attorney\n\nresponded to his request by stating his opinion that such a motion\n\nwould not be successful.     The failure to file a Rule 35(b) motion\n\nunder these circumstances does not fall below an objective standard\n\nof reasonableness. See Shraiar, 736 F.2d at 818.\n\n           Even   if   petitioner   had    alleged    facts   sufficient    to\n\nsatisfy the first prong of the Strickland test, he has not alleged\n\nfacts to support a finding of prejudice. Judge Fusté, who presided\n\nat petitioner's sentencing, determined in his denial of the § 2255\n\nmotion   that   petitioner   failed   to    \"show[]    that   there   was    a\n\nreasonable probability that his sentence would have been reduced\n\nhad Attorney Mendez-Lebron filed a timely Rule 35(b) motion.\"              The\n\ncourt gave detailed reasons why petitioner was in a \"different\n\nposition from his co-defendants\" and stated that the reduction of\n\ntheir sentences was no indication that petitioner's Rule 35(b)\n\nmotion would have been successful.          Accordingly, petitioner has\n\nfailed to show that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to file\n\na Rule 35(b) motion.     See United States v. Nino, 878 F.2d 101, 105\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f(3d   Cir.   1989)(holding   that   second    Strickland   prong   was   not\n\nsatisfied where \"district judge who considered the habeas corpus\n\nmotion also was the sentencing judge to whom a Rule 35(b) motion\n\nwould have been submitted, and he conclusively stated in his\n\nopinion that had a Rule 35(b) motion been submitted to him, he\n\nwould not have granted it\"); Voytik v. United States, 778 F.2d\n\n1306, 1310 (8th Cir. 1985)(same).         It does not appear that jurists\n\nof reason would find the district court's summary dismissal of this\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim to be debatable or wrong.3\n\nB. Failure to File Notice of Appeal\n\n             Petitioner's § 2255 motion and accompanying statement\n\nfail to allege that he specifically requested counsel to file a\n\nnotice of appeal.     The Supreme Court has applied the following\n\nstandard to such claims of ineffective assistance of counsel:\n\n                  In those cases where the defendant\n             neither instructs counsel to file an appeal\n             nor asks that an appeal not be taken, we\n             believe the question whether counsel has\n             performed deficiently by not filing a notice\n             of appeal is best answered by first asking a\n             separate, but antecedent, question: whether\n\n\n      3\n       Some courts have held that because failure to file a Rule\n35(b) motion does not call into question the judgment and sentence,\n§ 2255 cannot supply a remedy. See United States v. Hill, 826 F.2d\n507, 509 (7th Cir. 1987).    Anticipating that the district court\nmight so rule, petitioner sought alternative relief pursuant to the\nwrit of coram nobis under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651\n(1982). See Golden, 854 F.2d at 32.     Because neither party has\nchallenged the district court's assumption that § 2255 could supply\na remedy if ineffective assistance of counsel had been established,\nthe question of whether the writ of coram nobis could provide an\nalternative remedy is moot.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            counsel in fact consulted with the defendant\n            about an appeal. We employ the term \"consult\"\n            to convey a specific meaning - advising the\n            defendant    about    the    advantages   and\n            disadvantages of taking an appeal, and making\n            a   reasonable   effort   to    discover  the\n            defendant's wishes.\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 478-79.\n\n            In the response by petitioner's former counsel to the\n\ndistrict court's order that counsel give reasons for failing to\n\nfile a notice of appeal and Rule 35(b) motion, counsel stated that\n\n1) in his professional judgment there were no grounds for a\n\nsuccessful appeal, and 2) that it would be better to try to\n\nnegotiate a plea agreement in the parallel state proceedings.\n\nCounsel further stated that petitioner \"agreed with this course of\n\naction, and never instructed the undersigned to file an appeal in\n\nthe federal case.\" The district court, relying upon this statement\n\nby counsel, found that \"Petitioner and his counsel made a conscious\n\ndecision to pursue state-court negotiations in lieu of an appeal.\"\n\nAccordingly, the district court found that the failure to file a\n\nnotice of appeal did not constitute ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\n\n            Counsel's     statement   did   not   contradict   any   specific\n\nallegations by petitioner in his § 2255 motion or his accompanying\n\nstatement.      Therefore, the district court did not err in relying\n\nupon that statement to determine whether the failure to file a\n\nnotice     of    appeal    fell   below     an    objective    standard    of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\freasonableness.     Based upon the uncontradicted statement of the\n\nattorney, it appears that counsel \"consulted\" with petitioner about\n\ntaking an appeal, within the meaning of Flores-Ortega, supra.\n\nUnder such circumstances, \"[c]ounsel performs in a professionally\n\nunreasonable manner only by failing to follow the defendant's\n\nexpress instructions with respect to an appeal.\" Flores-Ortega, 528\n\nU.S. at 478.      Petitioner has not alleged that counsel failed to\n\nfollow his express instructions to file an appeal.          Therefore, we\n\nconclude that jurists of reason would not find the district court's\n\nassessment   of    this   ineffective    assistance    of   counsel   claim\n\ndebatable or wrong.\n\n          The request for a COA is denied.            Petitioner's appeal\n\nfrom the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

A motion to reduce\n             a sentence may be made, or the court may\n             reduce a sentence without motion, within 120\n             days after the sentence is imposed or\n             probation is revoked, or within 120 days after\n             receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon\n             affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the\n             appeal.\n\nFormer Rule 35(b).          \"[F]ormer Rule 35(b) conferred virtually\n\nunfettered discretion on sentencing courts.\" United States v.\n\nAngiulo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196148\"><a href=\"/opinion/196148/united-states-v-angiulo/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             \"No court has held that failure to file . . . a motion\n\n[pursuant     to   former    Rule   35(b)]   automatically   constitutes\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.\" Shraiar v.

To the contrary, he alleged that his attorney\n\nresponded to his request by stating his opinion that such a motion\n\nwould not be successful.     The failure to file a Rule 35(b) motion\n\nunder these circumstances does not fall below an objective standard\n\nof reasonableness. See Shraiar, 736 F.2d at 818.\n\n           Even   if   petitioner   had    alleged    facts   sufficient    to\n\nsatisfy the first prong of the Strickland test, he has not alleged\n\nfacts to support a finding of prejudice. Judge Fusté, who presided\n\nat petitioner's sentencing, determined in his denial of the § 2255\n\nmotion   that   petitioner   failed   to    \"show[]    that   there   was    a\n\nreasonable probability that his sentence would have been reduced\n\nhad Attorney Mendez-Lebron filed a timely Rule 35(b) motion.\"              The\n\ncourt gave detailed reasons why petitioner was in a \"different\n\nposition from his co-defendants\" and stated that the reduction of\n\ntheir sentences was no indication that petitioner's Rule 35(b)\n\nmotion would have been successful.          Accordingly, petitioner has\n\nfailed to show that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to file\n\na Rule 35(b) motion.     See United States v.

It does not appear that jurists\n\nof reason would find the district court's summary dismissal of this\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim to be debatable or wrong.3\n\nB. Failure to File Notice of Appeal\n\n             Petitioner's § 2255 motion and accompanying statement\n\nfail to allege that he specifically requested counsel to file a\n\nnotice of appeal.     The Supreme Court has applied the following\n\nstandard to such claims of ineffective assistance of counsel:\n\n                  In those cases where the defendant\n             neither instructs counsel to file an appeal\n             nor asks that an appeal not be taken, we\n             believe the question whether counsel has\n             performed deficiently by not filing a notice\n             of appeal is best answered by first asking a\n             separate, but antecedent, question: whether\n\n\n      3\n       Some courts have held that because failure to file a Rule\n35(b) motion does not call into question the judgment and sentence,\n§ 2255 cannot supply a remedy. See United States v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492685\"><a href=\"/opinion/492685/united-states-v-debbie-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (7th Cir. 1987).    Anticipating that the district court\nmight so rule, petitioner sought alternative relief pursuant to the\nwrit of coram nobis under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651\n(1982). See Golden, 854 F.2d at 32.     Because neither party has\nchallenged the district court's assumption that § 2255 could supply\na remedy if ineffective assistance of counsel had been established,\nthe question of whether the writ of coram nobis could provide an\nalternative remedy is moot.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            counsel in fact consulted with the defendant\n            about an appeal. We employ the term \"consult\"\n            to convey a specific meaning - advising the\n            defendant    about    the    advantages   and\n            disadvantages of taking an appeal, and making\n            a   reasonable   effort   to    discover  the\n            defendant's wishes.\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 478-79.\n\n            In the response by petitioner's former counsel to the\n\ndistrict court's order that counsel give reasons for failing to\n\nfile a notice of appeal and Rule 35(b) motion, counsel stated that\n\n1) in his professional judgment there were no grounds for a\n\nsuccessful appeal, and 2) that it would be better to try to\n\nnegotiate a plea agreement in the parallel state proceedings.\n\nCounsel further stated that petitioner \"agreed with this course of\n\naction, and never instructed the undersigned to file an appeal in\n\nthe federal case.\" The district court, relying upon this statement\n\nby counsel, found that \"Petitioner and his counsel made a conscious\n\ndecision to pursue state-court negotiations in lieu of an appeal.\"\n\nAccordingly, the district court found that the failure to file a\n\nnotice of appeal did not constitute ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\n\n            Counsel's     statement   did   not   contradict   any   specific\n\nallegations by petitioner in his § 2255 motion or his accompanying\n\nstatement.      Therefore, the district court did not err in relying\n\nupon that statement to determine whether the failure to file a\n\nnotice     of    appeal    fell   below     an    objective    standard    of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\freasonableness.     Based upon the uncontradicted statement of the\n\nattorney, it appears that counsel \"consulted\" with petitioner about\n\ntaking an appeal, within the meaning of Flores-Ortega, supra.\n\nUnder such circumstances, \"[c]ounsel performs in a professionally\n\nunreasonable manner only by failing to follow the defendant's\n\nexpress instructions with respect to an appeal.\" Flores-Ortega, 528\n\nU.S. at 478.      Petitioner has not alleged that counsel failed to\n\nfollow his express instructions to file an appeal.          Therefore, we\n\nconclude that jurists of reason would not find the district court's\n\nassessment   of    this   ineffective    assistance    of   counsel   claim\n\ndebatable or wrong.\n\n          The request for a COA is denied.            Petitioner's appeal\n\nfrom the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f</pre>",
