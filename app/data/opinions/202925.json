Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Gina\nWalcott-Torres, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 6, 2007\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge.          Yaoling Yu, a native and citizen\n\nof China, petitions for review of a final order of removal from the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA).                  Having found Yu not to be\n\ncredible, the IJ determined Yu had not carried her burdens as to\n\nthree forms of relief.              The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's\n\nruling. Because the decision is supported by substantial evidence,\n\nwe deny the petition for review.              Yu's claims for relief primarily\n\nrested   on    the    Immigration      and     Nationality        Act,   8     U.S.C.   §\n\n1101(a)(42).\n\n                                         I.\n\n              Yu came to visit the United States in 1997 on a temporary\n\nvisa.    She later secured a student visa but was apprehended by\n\nimmigration        officials   in    December       1999    because      she    was   not\n\nattending school and was illegally employed.\n\n              On   December    15,    2002,    Yu    filed    claims     for     asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).       At a hearing before the IJ on November 23, 2004, Yu\n\ntestified that she was forced to have an IUD inserted in 1983 after\n\nshe gave birth to a daughter in 1982.                      She found a doctor who\n\nagreed to remove the device and she became pregnant again in 1984.\n\nShe planned to conceal her pregnancy, but one of her coworkers\n\nbecame   suspicious       and       reported     her;       she   was     then    taken\n\ninvoluntarily from her workplace to a hospital where a doctor\n\nperformed an abortion and inserted another IUD, also in 1984.                         The\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fIUD caused her tremendous physical discomfort and she had it\n\nremoved by a doctor in the United States in 2001.               She also\n\ntestified that she divorced her husband in 1996, before she came to\n\nthe United States.\n\n           On December 20, 2004, the IJ issued an oral decision\n\nrejecting all of Yu's claims on the ground that her testimony was\n\nnot credible.     The IJ cited numerous inconsistencies in support of\n\nhis finding.    For example, Yu's earlier written statement differed\n\nfrom her oral testimony as to whether her coworkers were present in\n\nthe operating room when she was examined and anesthetized by the\n\ndoctor performing the abortion.       While Yu testified she was taken\n\nto the hospital directly from her workplace, a written statement\n\nshe submitted from her husband stated that she was taken from their\n\nhome.   A Chinese household register from 2000, in evidence, stated\n\nthat Yu and her husband were married as of that date, contradicting\n\nYu's assertion that they had divorced in 1996.        Most importantly,\n\nthe medical record from Yu's February 4, 2001 visit to a doctor in\n\nthe United States to have the IUD removed indicates that she told\n\nthe doctor that she was pregnant only once before, with no mention\n\nof an abortion.\n\n           In a brief per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed\n\nthe IJ's decision.      The BIA held that it had no reason to question\n\nthe IJ's credibility determination.       It rejected as baseless Yu's\n\nargument   that   her   husband's   inconsistent   statement   about   the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fabortion should be disregarded because of their divorce. The order\n\nalso held that Yu should have been able to recall who held her down\n\nwhen she was anesthetized and that if there had been an abortion,\n\nlogically the abortion would appear in the 2001 medical records.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling and\n\nalso discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review\n\nboth opinions.   Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          To qualify for asylum, an alien must show that he or she\n\nis a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the immigration laws.    See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).      The alien has the burden of proof for\n\nestablishing that he or she is eligible for asylum.          Id.   §\n\n1158(b)(1)(B)(i); Jean v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n          To demonstrate that he or she is a \"refugee,\" the alien\n\nmust show that he or she has either suffered past persecution or\n\nhas a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his or\n\nher \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also\n\nAlibeaj v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 191 (1st Cir. 2006).       If an\n\nindividual has been \"forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo\n\ninvoluntary sterilization, or . . . has been persecuted for failure\n\nor refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to\n\na coercive population control program,\" that individual is deemed\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fto have been \"persecuted on account of political opinion.\"                       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(B); see also Zeng v. Gonzales, 436 F.3d 26, 28\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); Tai v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nSimilarly, an individual who \"has a well founded fear that he or\n\nshe will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to\n\npersecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance\" is deemed to\n\nhave \"a well founded fear of persecution on account of political\n\nopinion.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(B).\n\n             Whether    an    alien    has    met    his   or    her   burden   of\n\nestablishing eligibility for asylum is a factual determination that\n\nwe review under the deferential substantial evidence standard.\n\nOuk, 464 F.3d at 111.         Thus, we uphold the decision unless \"any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"     Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             We agree with the BIA that the record provides sufficient\n\nsupport for the IJ's adverse credibility determination and the\n\ndenial of relief.       Yu was inconsistent in her recollection of who\n\nwas present in the room when the abortion took place.                  Her account\n\nof   being   taken     from   her     workplace     to   the    hospital   differs\n\nsignificantly from her husband's statement that Yu's coworkers came\n\nand removed her from their home, and is also inconsistent with his\n\nrecollection that the two had been forced to stay home from work on\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\faccount of her pregnancy.            Yu claims to have been divorced in 1996\n\nbut the 2000 register lists her as married.                    Her medical records\n\nindicate that in 2001, she told the doctor who removed the IUD that\n\nshe was married.         The medical records indicate that Yu made no\n\nmention of a previous abortion in the course of otherwise providing\n\na detailed medical history.               She informed the doctor about her\n\nfirst pregnancy and even her parents' history of hypertension.\n\nYu's explanations for these inconsistencies are unconvincing.\n\n            The    IJ    and   BIA    focused     on   Yu's    claim   of    a    forced\n\nabortion, but on appeal to the BIA, Yu made the argument -- renewed\n\nin this court -- that she should qualify for asylum on the basis of\n\nthe involuntary IUD insertions and her removal of them.                          Without\n\nreaching the question of whether 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) covers such\n\nsituations, see, e.g., Zheng v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 804, 811 (7th\n\nCir. 2005) (noting that \"no court of appeals has decided whether\n\npersecution . . . can be established on the basis of forcible IUD\n\ninsertions alone\"), we reject this claim.\n\n            If    Yu    intended     to    make   a    claim   under   the       statute\n\nindependent of her forced abortion claim, she did not clearly\n\ncommunicate that to the IJ.               Her pleadings were broad and vague.\n\nThe IJ understood her claims to be focused on the purported forced\n\nabortion.         She    did   nothing       to   disabuse      the    IJ    of    this\n\nunderstanding.          She cannot change the nature of the claim by\n\nshifting her focus in the appellate tribunals.\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f           We do not consider Yu's claims for withholding of removal\n\nand protection under the CAT because she failed to develop those\n\nclaims   sufficiently   before   the   BIA.   Rodrígues-Nascimento   v.\n\nGonzales, 485 F.3d 60, 62-63 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that \"failure\n\nto adequately brief . . . [a] claim before the BIA prevents us from\n\nconsidering its merits\");    Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           We deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

The alien has the burden of proof for establishing that he or she is eligible for asylum. <i>Id.</i> § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); <i>Jean v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202385\"><a href=\"/opinion/202385/jean-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>To demonstrate that he or she is a \"refugee,\" the alien must show that he or she has either suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his or her \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Alibeaj v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202521\"><a href=\"/opinion/202521/alibeaj-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 191 (1st Cir.2006). If an individual has been \"forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or . . . has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,\" that individual is deemed to have been \"persecuted on account of political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Zeng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793127\"><a href=\"/opinion/793127/jin-dong-zeng-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Tai v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201792\"><a href=\"/opinion/201792/tai-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2005). Similarly, an individual who \"has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance\" is deemed to have \"a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p>Whether an alien has met his or her burden of establishing eligibility for asylum is a factual determination that we review under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>Ouk,</i> 464 F.3d at 111. Thus, we uphold the decision unless \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>We agree with the BIA that the record provides sufficient support for the IJ's adverse credibility determination and the denial of relief. Yu was inconsistent in her recollection of who was present in the room when the abortion took place. Her account of being taken from her workplace to the hospital differs significantly from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> her husband's statement that Yu's coworkers came and removed her from their home, and is also inconsistent with his recollection that the two had been forced to stay home from work on account of her pregnancy. Yu claims to have been divorced in 1996 but the 2000 register lists her as married. Her medical records indicate that in 2001, she told the doctor who removed the IUD that she was married. The medical records indicate that Yu made no mention of a previous abortion in the course of otherwise providing a detailed medical history. She informed the doctor about her first pregnancy and even her parents' history of hypertension. Yu's explanations for these inconsistencies are unconvincing.</p>\n<p>The IJ and BIA focused on Yu's claim of a forced abortion, but on appeal to the BIA, Yu made the argument  renewed in this court  that she should qualify for asylum on the basis of the involuntary IUD insertions and her removal of them. Without reaching the question of whether 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) covers such situations, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790430\"><a href=\"/opinion/790430/yahong-zheng-v-alberto-r-gonzales-1-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 811 (7th Cir.2005) (noting that \"no court of appeals has decided whether persecution . . . can be established on the basis of forcible IUD insertions alone\"), we reject this claim.</p>\n<p>If Yu intended to make a claim under the statute independent of her forced abortion claim, she did not clearly communicate that to the IJ. Her pleadings were broad and vague. The IJ understood her claims to be focused on the purported forced abortion. She did nothing to disabuse the IJ of this understanding. She cannot change the nature of the claim by shifting her focus in the appellate tribunals.</p>\n<p>We do not consider Yu's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT because she failed to develop those claims sufficiently before the BIA. <i>Rodrígues-Nascimento v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202733\"><a href=\"/opinion/202733/rodrigues-nascimento-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62-63 (1st Cir.2007) (noting that \"failure to adequately brief . . .
