George Z. Singal, Chief District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n          Robert C. Andrews for appellant.\n          Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula\nD. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        January 20, 2006\n\f               STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.          Frank Mastera pled guilty\n\nin 2004 to two counts of unlawful firearm possession.                    Upon the\n\nrecommendation of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSI), the\n\nsentencing judge determined that Mastera fell within the ambit of\n\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which provides mandatory\n\nminimum penalties for defendants with a history of violent felony\n\nconvictions.       The judge determined that Mastera had committed the\n\nrequisite three prior felonies, and accordingly sentenced him to\n\nthe   ACCA's     minimum   penalty    of     fifteen   years   in   prison.    In\n\naddition, prior to sentencing, Mastera submitted a request for\n\nfunds,    in    the   amount   of    $900,     for   an   expert    psychological\n\nevaluation to determine whether he had a diminished capacity that\n\nwould allow for a reduced sentence. The district court denied this\n\nrequest.\n\n               Mastera now appeals both the district court's decision to\n\nsentence him under the ACCA and that court's denial of funds for a\n\npsychological evaluation.           We find no error, and so affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n               Mastera pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm\n\nand ammunition as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)\n\n(2000), and one count of possessing a stolen firearm, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 922(j).              The Armed Career Criminal Act, which\n\ncarries    a      mandatory    minimum        sentence    of   fifteen     years'\n\nimprisonment, applies to felons convicted of firearm possession\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\funder 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and who have at least three previous\n\nconvictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.          See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e).     The predicate convictions must be for crimes\n\n\"committed on occasions different from one another.\"          18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(e)(1).\n\n           The district court found that Mastera had four qualifying\n\nconvictions: one for stalking, one for assault with a dangerous\n\nweapon, and two for separate incidents of breaking and entering.\n\nMastera concedes that the assault conviction properly counts as an\n\nACCA predicate.     But he contends that there was insufficient\n\nevidence for the district court to determine that either of the\n\nbreaking and entering convictions was a conviction for a violent\n\nfelony as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).        He also argues that\n\nthe stalking conviction and one of the breaking and entering\n\nconvictions derive from conduct committed on the same occasion, and\n\nthus can count as only one predicate conviction rather than two.\n\nIn sum, Mastera claims, he had only two predicate convictions, not\n\nthe   requisite   three,   and   thus    the   district   court   erred   in\n\nsentencing him under the ACCA.\n\n           Mastera also requested the district court to grant funds\n\nfor a psychological evaluation to determine if he had a diminished\n\ncapacity that might qualify him for a reduced sentence, because as\n\na person of limited means, Mastera could not afford to pay an\n\nexpert himself.   His submission to the court alleged that he was an\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\falcoholic who suffered from insomnia and racing thoughts and that\n\nas a child he had endured abuse.                 He admitted that he was not on\n\nany medication except to treat acid reflux disease.                       The court\n\ndenied Mastera's request, sentencing him to a fifteen-year term,\n\nthe mandatory minimum under the ACCA.\n\n                                   II. Discussion\n\n              Mastera appeals both the district court's determination\n\nthat he qualified as an Armed Career Criminal and the court's\n\ndenial of funds for a psychological evaluation. We address the two\n\nissues in turn.1\n\nA. Adjudication under the Armed Career Criminal Act\n\n              Mastera     argues    that    the     district    court    improperly\n\nsentenced      him   under   the    ACCA    because    there    was     insufficient\n\nevidence to conclude he had the required three predicate violent\n\nfelony convictions. The district court found that Mastera had four\n\nsuch       convictions.       Here,        Mastera    attacks     two     of   those\n\ndeterminations.       Whether a defendant qualifies as an Armed Career\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Mastera also argues that the ACCA is unconstitutional because\nit allows a defendant to receive a mandatory minimum sentence based\non facts (i.e. the facts of prior convictions) that are found by a\njudge rather than by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We have\nalready rejected this argument in United States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d\n69 (1st Cir. 2005), in which we held that Almendarez-Torres v.\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 224, 247 (1998), which upheld a federal law\nallowing judges to impose an enhanced sentence based on prior\nconvictions that had not been alleged in the indictment, \"remains\nbinding law that we must apply until overruled by a majority of the\nSupreme Court.\" Ivery, 427 F.3d at 75.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fCriminal is a question of law that we review de novo.              United\n\nStates v. Moore, 286 F.3d 47, 49 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          1. Overlap between Paragraphs 34 and 352\n\n          Mastera's   first   claim   is   that   two   of   his    prior\n\nconvictions, those laid out in Paragraphs 34 and 35 of the PSI,\n\nwere erroneously counted as two separate ACCA predicates instead of\n\nas just one.   Paragraph 34 describes a conviction for breaking and\n\nentering in the daytime, and Paragraph 35 describes a conviction\n\nfor stalking; both convictions were in 1998.3            The crime of\n\nstalking4 undoubtedly satisfies the ACCA's definition of a violent\n\nfelony because it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1), and Mastera does not argue otherwise.5             He\n\n\n     2\n     For ease, we will sometimes refer to a contested conviction\nby the number of the paragraph in which it was described in the\nPSI.\n     3\n      According to the PSI, the breaking and entering took place on\nSeptember 7, 1997, while the stalking charge was dated September 8\nof the same year.\n     4\n      In Massachusetts, a person commits the crime of stalking if\nhe or she \"(1) willfully and maliciously engages in a knowing\npattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed\nat a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person\nand would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional\ndistress, and (2) makes a threat with the intent to place the\nperson in imminent fear of death or bodily injury.\" Mass. Gen.\nLaws Ann. ch. 265, § 43 (2000).\n     5\n      Mastera's \"overlap\" claim assumes arguendo that the breaking\nand entering conviction in Paragraph 34 is also a valid ACCA\npredicate, and the following discussion makes the same assumption.\nHe makes an independent challenge to the validity of Paragraph 34;\n\n                                -5-\n\fcontends, however, that it was improper to count his Paragraph 34\n\nand 35 convictions as two separate ACCA predicates, because the two\n\nconvictions    do   not   arise   from    acts   \"committed   on   occasions\n\ndifferent from\" one another as required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).\n\nThe breaking and entering, the argument goes, was part of the same\n\ncourse of conduct that made up the stalking charge, and since\n\nMassachusetts law defines the crime of stalking to require multiple\n\nacts, the \"occasion\" underlying the stalking encompasses, and thus\n\nis not \"different from,\" the \"occasion\" underlying the breaking and\n\nentering. Whether two crimes occurred on separate occasions within\n\nthe meaning of the ACCA \"requires a case-by-case examination of the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.\" United States v. Stearns, 387 F.3d\n\n104, 108 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Mastera correctly asserts that, under Massachusetts law,\n\nstalking requires a \"pattern of conduct or series of acts.\"              See\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, § 43 (2000); see also Commonwealth v.\n\nAlphas, 712 N.E.2d 575, 581 (Mass. 1999) (stalking by following\n\nrequires more than two incidents of following); Commonwealth v.\n\nKwiatkowski, 637 N.E.2d 854, 857-58 (Mass. 1994) (stalking by\n\nharassment requires more than two incidents of harassment).\n\n              The record does not indicate that the September 7\n\nbreaking and entering was one of the \"incidents\" composing the\n\nstalking charge of which Mastera was convicted in 1998.              Because\n\n\nwe address that challenge infra, Section II.A.2.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthere is no evidence that the acts underlying Paragraph 34 also\n\nunderlie     Paragraph   35,   we   need    not   decide   what   outcome   that\n\nsituation would require.         Mastera has offered evidence only that\n\nthe two crimes took place on consecutive days and had the same\n\nvictim. Neither of these facts necessarily prevents a finding that\n\nthe crimes occurred on separate occasions, see Stearns, 387 F.3d at\n\n108-09, and in fact the record suggests that the breaking and\n\nentering had an \"endpoint,\" after which any subsequent crimes would\n\nbe considered separate.        See id.     The district court did not err in\n\nconcluding that the breaking and entering offense and the stalking\n\noffense occurred on two separate occasions and that each could be\n\ncounted as a separate ACCA predicate conviction.\n\n             2. Breaking and Entering in the Daytime (Paragraph 34)\n\n             Mastera next raises a challenge to the validity of\n\nParagraph 34 as an ACCA predicate conviction.               He admits that he\n\nwas convicted and sentenced in 1998 on one count of breaking and\n\nentering in the daytime with intent to commit a misdemeanor.                  He\n\nargues, however, that under the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nShepard v. United States, 125 S. Ct. 1254 (2005), there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to allow the district court to conclude that\n\nthis breaking and entering qualified as a \"violent felony\" under\n\nthe ACCA.6\n\n\n     6\n      Mastera was sentenced on February 15, 2005.      The Supreme\nCourt decided Shepard three weeks later, on March 7, 2005. The\npresent appeal is on direct review, and \"a new rule for the conduct\n\n                                      -7-\n\f           a. Legal Background\n\n           The   ACCA    includes     \"burglary\"   in   its    enumeration   of\n\nqualifying   violent      felonies.      18    U.S.C.   §     924(e)(2)(B)(i).\n\nHowever, the crime of \"burglary\" does not have the same elements in\n\nevery jurisdiction.       To clear up potential confusion and ensure\n\nconsistent application of the ACCA across state lines, the Supreme\n\nCourt has read the ACCA's definition of burglary \"to refer to what\n\nwe called 'generic burglary,' an 'unlawful or unprivileged entry\n\ninto, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to\n\ncommit a crime.'\"       Shepard, 125 S. Ct. at 1257 (quoting Taylor v.\n\nUnited   States,   495    U.S.   575,    599   (1990)).        This   \"generic\"\n\ndefinition, which is limited to burglary of a building, is narrower\n\nthan the crime as defined by some states, which \"define burglary\n\nmore broadly, as by extending it to entries into boats and cars.\"\n\nShepard, 125 S. Ct. at 1257.        Massachusetts is one of the handful\n\nof states with a broader definition of burglary.7\n\n\n\n\nof criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all\ncases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final,\nwith no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a\n'clear break' with the past.\" Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314,\n328 (1987); cf. United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738, 769 (2005)\n(citing Griffith in support of applying Sixth Amendment holding and\ninterpretation of Sentencing Act \"to all cases on direct review.\").\n     7\n      Massachusetts law defines the crime of which Mastera was\nconvicted in 1998 as the act committed by someone who \"breaks and\nenters a building, ship, vessel or vehicle with intent to commit a\nmisdemeanor.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266, § 16A (2000).\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          Because of this inconsistency, in non-generic states like\n\nMassachusetts, a sentencing judge cannot necessarily tell, simply\n\nfrom the fact that a defendant has been convicted of \"burglary,\"\n\nwhether that conviction was for breaking and entering into a\n\nbuilding (in which case it would qualify as an ACCA predicate) or\n\nwhether the conviction was for breaking and entering into a ship or\n\nmotor vehicle (in which case it would not qualify as an ACCA\n\npredicate).    Thus,   before   counting   a   Massachusetts   burglary\n\nconviction as an ACCA predicate, a sentencing court must somehow\n\ndetermine that the burglary did, in fact, involve a building. This\n\nis because \"any sentence under the ACCA [must] rest on a showing\n\nthat a prior conviction 'necessarily' involved (and a prior plea\n\nnecessarily admitted) facts equating to generic burglary.\"       Id. at\n\n1262 (plurality opinion) (quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 601).\n\n          Moreover, in Taylor and then in Shepard, the Supreme\n\nCourt restricted the types of evidence a sentencing court may\n\nconsider when deciding whether a state burglary conviction was for\n\nan act of \"generic\" burglary.          In the context of a burglary\n\nconviction resulting from a guilty plea, \"a later court determining\n\nthe character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to\n\nexamining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea\n\nagreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual\n\nfinding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\"\n\nShepard, 125 S. Ct. at 1257.     A \"comparable judicial record\" is\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\falso acceptable.      Id. at 1263.        Documents such as complaint\n\napplications or police reports, in contrast, may not be considered\n\nby the sentencing court.    Id. at 1257.\n\n            b. Validity of Paragraph 34 as ACCA Predicate\n\n            On appeal, Mastera argues that the district court lacked\n\nsufficient evidence of the type permitted by Shepard to allow the\n\nconclusion that the Paragraph 34 conviction was for a generic\n\nburglary.     He   acknowledges,   however,   that   he   forfeited   this\n\nobjection by failing to raise it before the sentencing court.\n\nThus, we review only for plain error.      See United States v. Eirby,\n\n262 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).      To prevail under this standard,\n\nMastera must make a four-part showing: \"(1) that an error occurred\n\n(2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected\n\n[his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nUnited States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d 174, 177 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n            Mastera's argument fails on plain error review, at least\n\nunder the second prong of the test, which requires that the error\n\nbe \"clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.\"\n\nUnited States v. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing United States v. Olano,\n\n507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993); Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461,\n\n467-68 (1997)).    Mastera's counsel, in a sentencing memorandum to\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe district court, more or less conceded that the conviction in\n\nParagraph 34 was for breaking into a home (not a boat or a\n\nvehicle), stating that \"the breaking and entering that occurred\n\nSeptember 7, 1997 [the Paragraph 34 offense] appears to be a\n\nbreaking and entering into his own home.\"            It may be debatable\n\nwhether the defendant's admission, which was not made during the\n\nplea   colloquy   for   the    original    conviction,    falls   within   the\n\nevidence permitted by Taylor and Shepard.         But it was not a \"clear\"\n\nor \"obvious\" transgression of the Shepard rule for the sentencing\n\ncourt to consider the admission (which was sufficient to justify a\n\nconclusion   by   the   court   that   the   conviction    was    for   generic\n\nburglary). Given this uncertainty, we cannot say that the district\n\ncourt's finding of an ACCA predicate in the Paragraph 34 conviction\n\nwas plainly erroneous.        Cf. United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"unsettled state of the law\" precludes finding\n\nof plain error).\n\n           Because Mastera has not shown that any clear or obvious\n\nerror occurred, we need not address the third and fourth prongs of\n\nthe plain error test.         The convictions in Paragraphs 34 and 35,\n\ntogether with the assault conviction that Mastera has conceded is\n\na valid ACCA predicate, create the three convictions necessary to\n\nsustain adjudication as an Armed Career Criminal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            3. Breaking and Entering at Night (Paragraph 24)\n\n            The last of the four predicate convictions found by the\n\ndistrict court in support of sentencing under the ACCA was a 1991\n\nMassachusetts state conviction for breaking and entering at night\n\nwith intent to    commit a felony.8      Mastera argues that under\n\nShepard, there was insufficient evidence to allow the district\n\ncourt to conclude that this breaking and entering qualified as a\n\n\"violent felony\" under the ACCA.        Although this argument was\n\nundoubtedly preserved for appeal, we need not reach it, because we\n\nhave already determined that the district court properly found that\n\nMastera had three predicate convictions -- the number necessary to\n\nqualify him for sentencing under the ACCA.     Whether the court had\n\nadequate Shepard-approved evidence to find that Paragraph 24 was an\n\nACCA predicate therefore does not bear on the validity of Mastera's\n\nsentence.\n\nB. Denial of Funds for Psychological Evaluation\n\n            Finally, we turn to Mastera's claim that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his request for $900 to obtain a pre-\n\nsentencing psychological evaluation.    We review the denial of such\n\na request for abuse of discretion.      United States v. Manning, 79\n\nF.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n     8\n      Like breaking and entering in the daytime, the crime of\nbreaking and entering at night encompasses burglary of \"a building,\nship, vessel or vehicle.\" See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266, § 16\n(2000).\n\n                                 -12-\n\f           Mastera contends that a psychological evaluation was\n\nnecessary for him to prepare an adequate defense, since he is an\n\nalcoholic, suffered from sleep difficulties and racing thoughts,\n\nallegedly had mental health problems while incarcerated in the\n\npast, and had endured childhood abuse.        He believes these facts\n\nmight signify that he has a diminished capacity that would entitle\n\nhim to a lower sentence.9   \"[D]ue process requires that, where 'the\n\ndefendant's   mental   condition    [is]   relevant   to    his   criminal\n\nculpability and to the punishment he might suffer,' the government\n\nprovide to indigent defendants expert psychiatric testimony at 'the\n\nsentencing phase.'\" United States v. Abreu, 202 F.3d 386, 391 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (quoting Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 80, 83-84\n\n(1985)).   Nevertheless, \"a trial judge is not required to grant\n\nevery motion questioning an accused's competency.\"          United States\n\nv. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1544 (1st Cir. 1989).         After a careful\n\nreview of the evidence Mastera offers in support of his claim, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the request for funds.\n\n           Mastera presents four reasons for believing he might\n\nqualify for a diminished capacity sentencing departure.               The\n\nevidence of alcoholism does not help Mastera because § 5K2.13\n\n\n\n     9\n      With some qualifications, U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13 recommends a\nsentence below the otherwise-applicable range if \"the defendant\ncommitted the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced\nmental capacity.\"\n\n                                   -13-\n\fspecifically prohibits a court from granting a diminished capacity\n\ndownward departure if \"the [defendant's] significantly reduced\n\nmental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other\n\nintoxicants.\"         This   prohibition       is   buttressed      by   the   policy\n\nstatement in § 5H1.4 that \"[d]rug or alcohol dependence or abuse is\n\nnot a reason for a downward departure.\" Thus, Mastera's alcoholism\n\ncan be eliminated as an argument in favor of granting funds for a\n\npsychological evaluation.           Moreover, current insomnia and racing\n\nthoughts, while indicative of some level of mental distress, are\n\nnot probative as to Mastera's mental condition at the time he\n\ncommitted the crime of unlawfully possessing a firearm.\n\n             As to the child abuse, Mastera presented the sentencing\n\ncourt with a letter he had handwritten, entitled \"My Life,\" that\n\ndescribed his violent and abusive childhood.                  Before imposing the\n\nsentence, the judge stated that he had received this document and\n\n\"reviewed it closely.\" Mastera argues that this case is comparable\n\nto the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Brown, 985 F.2d\n\n478   (9th   Cir.     1993),    which   held     that    a   district    court   had\n\ndiscretion to consider a defendant's account of \"severe abuse and\n\nneglect\"     during    his     childhood.       Id.     at   481.    However,    the\n\nsentencing court in Brown explicitly stated its desire to depart\n\ndownward but concluded that it did not have the authority to do so,\n\nand the Ninth Circuit held that it did, in fact, have that\n\nauthority.     See id. at 480, 483.            In this case, by contrast, the\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fsentencing court did read and consider Mastera's submission about\n\nthe childhood abuse he suffered.\n\n                Finally, Mastera alleged to the district court, without\n\nproviding specifics, that he had \"some history of psychological\n\ncare during a prior incarceration.\" He argues that this allegation\n\nbrings him within the ambit of Pellerito, in which the defendant\n\nmoved for permission for a psychological evaluation and alleged,\n\ninter alia, \"that he was a long-time drug abuser [and] that he had\n\nbeen treated previously for mental illness.\"              Pellerito, 878 F.2d\n\nat 1545.        We held that the defendant's motion should have been\n\ngranted.        However, Pellerito is distinct from this case in one\n\nimportant way.10 In Pellerito, the defendant's \"medicinal regimen,\"\n\nconsisting of sedatives and anti-anxiety medications, was, at the\n\ntime the request for an expert was made, \"a matter of record.\"               Id.\n\nMastera, in contrast, told the judge he was not on any medication,\n\nand, importantly, provided no corroborating evidence of any kind\n\nthat he had a history of treatment for mental illness.\n\n                Having considered all the foregoing factors, we conclude\n\nthat it was not an abuse of discretion for the judge to determine\n\nthere     was    no   warrant   for   Mastera   to   receive   a   psychological\n\nevaluation.\n\n\n     10\n      Mastera contends that the only difference between the                 two\ncases is that the defendant in Pellerito was able to pay for                his\nown psychological expert, whereas Mastera is unable to do                   so.\nThis, however, is not a dispositive distinction. See Abreu,                 202\nF.3d at 391.\n\n                                        -15-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n     The district court's denial of defendant's motion for funds\n\nfor a psychological examination and the defendant's sentence are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f",

Upon the recommendation of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSI), the sentencing judge determined that Mastera fell within the ambit of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which provides mandatory minimum penalties for defendants with a history of violent felony convictions. The judge determined that Mastera had committed the requisite three prior felonies, and accordingly sentenced him to the ACCA's minimum penalty of fifteen years in prison. In addition, prior to sentencing, Mastera submitted a request for funds, in the amount of $900, for an expert psychological evaluation to determine whether he had a diminished capacity that would allow for a reduced sentence. The district court denied this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera now appeals both the district court's decision to sentence him under the ACCA and that court's denial of funds for a psychological evaluation. We find no error, and so affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (2000), and one count of possessing a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j). The Armed Career Criminal Act, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment, applies to felons convicted of firearm possession under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) and who have at least three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). The predicate convictions must be for crimes \"committed on occasions different from one another.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Mastera had four qualifying convictions: one for stalking, one for assault with a dangerous weapon, and two for separate incidents of breaking and entering. Mastera concedes that the assault conviction properly counts as an ACCA predicate. But he contends that there was insufficient evidence for the district court to determine that either of the breaking and entering convictions was a conviction for a violent felony as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B). He also argues that the stalking conviction and one of the breaking and entering convictions derive from conduct committed on the same occasion, and thus can count as only one predicate conviction rather than two. In sum, Mastera claims, he had only two predicate convictions, not the requisite three, and thus the district court erred in sentencing him under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera also requested the district court to grant funds for a psychological evaluation to determine if he had a diminished capacity that might qualify him for a reduced sentence, because as a person of limited means, Mastera could not afford to pay an expert himself. His submission to the court alleged that he was an alcoholic who suffered from insomnia and racing thoughts and that as a child he had endured abuse. He admitted that he was not on any medication except to treat acid reflux disease. The court denied Mastera's request, sentencing him to a fifteen-year term, the mandatory minimum under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera appeals both the district court's determination that he qualified as an Armed Career Criminal and the court's denial of funds for a psychological evaluation. We address the two issues in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Adjudication under the Armed Career Criminal Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera argues that the district court improperly sentenced him under the ACCA because there was insufficient evidence to conclude he had the required three predicate violent felony convictions. The district court found that Mastera had four such convictions. Here, Mastera attacks two of those determinations. Whether a defendant qualifies as an Armed Career Criminal is a question of law that we review <i>de novo. United States v. Moore,</i> 286 F.3d 47, 49 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Overlap between Paragraphs 34 and 35<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera's first claim is that two of his prior convictions, those laid out in Paragraphs 34 and 35 of the PSI, were erroneously counted as two separate ACCA predicates instead of as just one. Paragraph 34 describes a conviction for breaking and entering in the daytime, and Paragraph 35 describes a conviction for stalking; both convictions were in 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The crime of stalking<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> undoubtedly satisfies the ACCA's definition of a violent felony because it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and Mastera does not argue otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He contends, however, that it was improper to count his Paragraph 34 and 35 convictions as two separate ACCA predicates, because the two convictions do not arise from acts \"committed on occasions different from\" one another as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1). The breaking and entering, the argument goes, was part of the same course of conduct that made up the stalking charge, and since Massachusetts law defines the crime of stalking to require multiple acts, the \"occasion\" underlying the stalking encompasses, and thus is not \"different from,\" the \"occasion\" underlying the breaking and entering. Whether two crimes occurred on separate occasions within the meaning of the ACCA \"requires a case-by-case examination of the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>United States v. Stearns,</i> 387 F.3d 104, 108 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera correctly asserts that, under Massachusetts law, stalking requires a \"pattern of conduct or series of acts.\" <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 265, &#167; 43 (2000); <i>see also Commonwealth v. Alphas,</i> 430 Mass. 8, 712 N.E.2d 575, 581 (1999) (stalking by following requires more than two incidents of following); <i>Commonwealth v. Kwiatkowski,</i> 418 Mass. 543, 637 N.E.2d 854, 857-58 (1994) (stalking by harassment requires more than two incidents of harassment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record does not indicate that the September 7 breaking and entering was one of the \"incidents\" composing the stalking charge of which Mastera was convicted in 1998. Because there is no evidence that the acts underlying Paragraph 34 also underlie Paragraph 35, we need not decide what outcome that situation would require. Mastera has offered evidence only that the two crimes took place on consecutive days and had the same victim. Neither of these facts necessarily prevents a finding that the crimes occurred on separate occasions, <i>see Stearns,</i> 387 F.3d at 108-09, and in fact the record suggests that the breaking and entering had an \"endpoint,\" after which any subsequent crimes would be considered separate. <i>See id.</i> The district court did not err in concluding that the breaking and entering offense and the stalking offense occurred on two separate occasions and that each could be counted as a separate ACCA predicate conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Breaking and Entering in the Daytime (Paragraph 34)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera next raises a challenge to the validity of Paragraph 34 as an ACCA predicate conviction. He admits that he was convicted and sentenced in 1998 on one count of breaking and entering in the daytime with intent to commit a misdemeanor. He argues, however, that under the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), there was insufficient evidence to allow the district court to conclude that this breaking and entering qualified as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Legal Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACCA includes \"burglary\" in its enumeration of qualifying violent felonies. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(i). However, the crime of \"burglary\" does not have the same elements in every jurisdiction. To clear up potential confusion and ensure consistent application of the ACCA across state lines, the Supreme Court has read the ACCA's definition of burglary \"to refer to what we called `generic burglary,' an `unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.'\" <i>Shepard,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1257 (quoting <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). This \"generic\" definition, which is limited to burglary of a building, is narrower than the crime as defined by some states, which \"define burglary more broadly, as by extending it to entries into boats and cars.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1257. Massachusetts is one of the handful of states with a broader definition of burglary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of this inconsistency, in non-generic states like Massachusetts, a sentencing judge cannot necessarily tell, simply from the fact that a defendant has been convicted of \"burglary,\" whether that conviction was for breaking and entering into a building (in which case it would qualify as an ACCA predicate) or whether the conviction was for breaking and entering into a ship or motor vehicle (in which case it would not qualify as an ACCA predicate). Thus, before counting a Massachusetts burglary conviction as an ACCA predicate, a sentencing court must somehow determine that the burglary did, in fact, involve a building. This is because \"any sentence under the ACCA [must] rest on a showing that a prior conviction `necessarily' involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts equating to generic burglary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1262 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. 2143).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in <i>Taylor</i> and then in <i>Shepard,</i> the Supreme Court restricted the types of evidence a sentencing court may consider when deciding whether a state burglary conviction was for an act of \"generic\" burglary. In the context of a burglary conviction resulting from a guilty plea, \"a later court determining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1257. A \"comparable judicial record\" is also acceptable. <i>Id.</i> at 1263. Documents such as complaint applications or police reports, in contrast, may not be considered by the sentencing court. <i>Id.</i> at 1257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Validity of Paragraph 34 as ACCA Predicate</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mastera argues that the district court lacked sufficient evidence of the type permitted by <i>Shepard</i> to allow the conclusion that the Paragraph 34 conviction was for a generic burglary. He acknowledges, however, that he forfeited this objection by failing to raise it before the sentencing court. Thus, we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v. Eirby,</i> 262 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.2001). To prevail under this standard, Mastera must make a four-part showing: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Luciano,</i> 414 F.3d 174, 177 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera's argument fails on plain error review, at least under the second prong of the test, which requires that the error be \"clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.\" <i>United States v. Bradstreet,</i> 135 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 467-68, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). Mastera's counsel, in a sentencing memorandum to the district court, more or less conceded that the conviction in Paragraph 34 was for breaking into a home (not a boat or a vehicle), stating that \"the breaking and entering that occurred September 7, 1997 [the Paragraph 34 offense] appears to be a breaking and entering into his own home.\" It may be debatable whether the defendant's admission, which was not made during the plea colloquy for the original conviction, falls within the evidence permitted by <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Shepard.</i> But it was not a \"clear\" or \"obvious\" transgression of the <i>Shepard</i> rule for the sentencing court to consider the admission (which was sufficient to justify a conclusion by the court that the conviction was for generic burglary). Given this uncertainty, we cannot say that the district court's finding of an ACCA predicate in the Paragraph 34 conviction was plainly erroneous. <i>Cf. United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir.2002) (\"unsettled state of the law\" precludes finding of plain error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Mastera has not shown that any clear or obvious error occurred, we need not address the third and fourth prongs of the plain error test. The convictions in Paragraphs 34 and 35, together with the assault conviction that Mastera has conceded is a valid ACCA predicate, create the three convictions necessary to sustain adjudication as an Armed Career Criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Although this argument was undoubtedly preserved for appeal, we need not reach it, because we have already determined that the district court properly found that Mastera had three predicate convictions &#8212; the number necessary to qualify him for sentencing under the ACCA. Whether the court had adequate <i>Shepard</i>-approved evidence to find that Paragraph 24 was an ACCA predicate therefore does not bear on the validity of Mastera's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Denial of Funds for Psychological Evaluation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn to Mastera's claim that the district court erred in denying his request for $900 to obtain a pre-sentencing psychological evaluation. We review the denial of such a request for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Manning,</i> 79 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera contends that a psychological evaluation was necessary for him to prepare an adequate defense, since he is an alcoholic, suffered from sleep difficulties and racing thoughts, allegedly had mental health problems while incarcerated in the past, and had endured childhood abuse. He believes these facts might signify that he has a diminished capacity that would entitle him to a lower sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> \"[D]ue process requires that, where `the defendant's mental condition [is] relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer,' the government provide to indigent defendants expert psychiatric testimony at `the sentencing phase.'\" <i>United States v. Abreu,</i> 202 F.3d 386, 391 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Ake v. Oklahoma,</i> 470 U.S. 68, 80, 83-84, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985)). Nevertheless, \"a trial judge is not required to grant every motion questioning an accused's competency.\" <i>United States v. Pellerito,</i> 878 F.2d 1535, 1544 (1st Cir.1989). After a careful review of the evidence Mastera offers in support of his claim, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera presents four reasons for believing he might qualify for a diminished capacity sentencing departure. The evidence of alcoholism does not help Mastera because &#167; 5K2.13 specifically prohibits a court from granting a diminished capacity downward departure if \"the [defendant's] significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants.\" This prohibition is buttressed by the policy statement in &#167; 5H1.4 that \"[d]rug or alcohol dependence or abuse is not a reason for a downward departure.\" Thus, Mastera's alcoholism can be eliminated as an argument in favor of granting funds for a psychological evaluation. Moreover, current insomnia and racing thoughts, while indicative of some level of mental distress, are not probative as to Mastera's mental condition at the time he committed the crime of unlawfully possessing a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the child abuse, Mastera presented the sentencing court with a letter he had handwritten, entitled \"My Life,\" that described his violent and abusive childhood. Before imposing the sentence, the judge stated that he had received this document and \"reviewed it closely.\" Mastera argues that this case is comparable to the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>United States v.

Upon the recommendation of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSI), the sentencing judge determined that Mastera fell within the ambit of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which provides mandatory minimum penalties for defendants with a history of violent felony convictions. The judge determined that Mastera had committed the requisite three prior felonies, and accordingly sentenced him to the ACCA's minimum penalty of fifteen years in prison. In addition, prior to sentencing, Mastera submitted a request for funds, in the amount of $900, for an expert psychological evaluation to determine whether he had a diminished capacity that would allow for a reduced sentence. The district court denied this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera now appeals both the district court's decision to sentence him under the ACCA and that court's denial of funds for a psychological evaluation. We find no error, and so affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera pled guilty to one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (2000), and one count of possessing a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j). The Armed Career Criminal Act, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment, applies to felons convicted of firearm possession under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) and who have at least three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e). The predicate convictions must be for crimes \"committed on occasions different from one another.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Mastera had four qualifying convictions: one for stalking, one for assault with a dangerous weapon, and two for separate incidents of breaking and entering. Mastera concedes that the assault conviction properly counts as an ACCA predicate. But he contends that there was insufficient evidence for the district court to determine that either of the breaking and entering convictions was a conviction for a violent felony as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B). He also argues that the stalking conviction and one of the breaking and entering convictions derive from conduct committed on the same occasion, and thus can count as only one predicate conviction rather than two. In sum, Mastera claims, he had only two predicate convictions, not the requisite three, and thus the district court erred in sentencing him under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera also requested the district court to grant funds for a psychological evaluation to determine if he had a diminished capacity that might qualify him for a reduced sentence, because as a person of limited means, Mastera could not afford to pay an expert himself. His submission to the court alleged that he was an alcoholic who suffered from insomnia and racing thoughts and that as a child he had endured abuse. He admitted that he was not on any medication except to treat acid reflux disease. The court denied Mastera's request, sentencing him to a fifteen-year term, the mandatory minimum under the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera appeals both the district court's determination that he qualified as an Armed Career Criminal and the court's denial of funds for a psychological evaluation. We address the two issues in turn.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The district court found that Mastera had four such convictions. Here, Mastera attacks two of those determinations. Whether a defendant qualifies as an Armed Career Criminal is a question of law that we review <i>de novo. United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199919\"><a href=\"/opinion/199919/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Paragraph 34 describes a conviction for breaking and entering in the daytime, and Paragraph 35 describes a conviction for stalking; both convictions were in 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The crime of stalking<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> undoubtedly satisfies the ACCA's definition of a violent felony because it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and Mastera does not argue otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He contends, however, that it was improper to count his Paragraph 34 and 35 convictions as two separate ACCA predicates, because the two convictions do not arise from acts \"committed on occasions different from\" one another as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1). The breaking and entering, the argument goes, was part of the same course of conduct that made up the stalking charge, and since Massachusetts law defines the crime of stalking to require multiple acts, the \"occasion\" underlying the stalking encompasses, and thus is not \"different from,\" the \"occasion\" underlying the breaking and entering. Whether two crimes occurred on separate occasions within the meaning of the ACCA \"requires a case-by-case examination of the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>United States v.

Because there is no evidence that the acts underlying Paragraph 34 also underlie Paragraph 35, we need not decide what outcome that situation would require. Mastera has offered evidence only that the two crimes took place on consecutive days and had the same victim. Neither of these facts necessarily prevents a finding that the crimes occurred on separate occasions, <i>see Stearns,</i> 387 F.3d at 108-09, and in fact the record suggests that the breaking and entering had an \"endpoint,\" after which any subsequent crimes would be considered separate. <i>See id.</i> The district court did not err in concluding that the breaking and entering offense and the stalking offense occurred on two separate occasions and that each could be counted as a separate ACCA predicate conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

He argues, however, that under the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Shepard v.

Legal Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ACCA includes \"burglary\" in its enumeration of qualifying violent felonies. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(i). However, the crime of \"burglary\" does not have the same elements in every jurisdiction. To clear up potential confusion and ensure consistent application of the ACCA across state lines, the Supreme Court has read the ACCA's definition of burglary \"to refer to what we called `generic burglary,' an `unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.'\" <i>Shepard,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1257 (quoting <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 599, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990)). This \"generic\" definition, which is limited to burglary of a building, is narrower than the crime as defined by some states, which \"define burglary more broadly, as by extending it to entries into boats and cars.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1257. Massachusetts is one of the handful of states with a broader definition of burglary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of this inconsistency, in non-generic states like Massachusetts, a sentencing judge cannot necessarily tell, simply from the fact that a defendant has been convicted of \"burglary,\" whether that conviction was for breaking and entering into a building (in which case it would qualify as an ACCA predicate) or whether the conviction was for breaking and entering into a ship or motor vehicle (in which case it would not qualify as an ACCA predicate). Thus, before counting a Massachusetts burglary conviction as an ACCA predicate, a sentencing court must somehow determine that the burglary did, in fact, involve a building. This is because \"any sentence under the ACCA [must] rest on a showing that a prior conviction `necessarily' involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts equating to generic burglary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1262 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 601, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the context of a burglary conviction resulting from a guilty plea, \"a later court determining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 1257. A \"comparable judicial record\" is also acceptable. <i>Id.</i> at 1263.

He acknowledges, however, that he forfeited this objection by failing to raise it before the sentencing court. Thus, we review only for plain error. <i>See United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span> (1997)). Mastera's counsel, in a sentencing memorandum to the district court, more or less conceded that the conviction in Paragraph 34 was for breaking into a home (not a boat or a vehicle), stating that \"the breaking and entering that occurred September 7, 1997 [the Paragraph 34 offense] appears to be a breaking and entering into his own home.\" It may be debatable whether the defendant's admission, which was not made during the plea colloquy for the original conviction, falls within the evidence permitted by <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Shepard.</i> But it was not a \"clear\" or \"obvious\" transgression of the <i>Shepard</i> rule for the sentencing court to consider the admission (which was sufficient to justify a conclusion by the court that the conviction was for generic burglary). Given this uncertainty, we cannot say that the district court's finding of an ACCA predicate in the Paragraph 34 conviction was plainly erroneous. <i>Cf. United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2002) (\"unsettled state of the law\" precludes finding of plain error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Mastera has not shown that any clear or obvious error occurred, we need not address the third and fourth prongs of the plain error test. The convictions in Paragraphs 34 and 35, together with the assault conviction that Mastera has conceded is a valid ACCA predicate, create the three convictions necessary to sustain adjudication as an Armed Career Criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Although this argument was undoubtedly preserved for appeal, we need not reach it, because we have already determined that the district court properly found that Mastera had three predicate convictions &#8212; the number necessary to qualify him for sentencing under the ACCA. Whether the court had adequate <i>Shepard</i>-approved evidence to find that Paragraph 24 was an ACCA predicate therefore does not bear on the validity of Mastera's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

We review the denial of such a request for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Manning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera contends that a psychological evaluation was necessary for him to prepare an adequate defense, since he is an alcoholic, suffered from sleep difficulties and racing thoughts, allegedly had mental health problems while incarcerated in the past, and had endured childhood abuse. He believes these facts might signify that he has a diminished capacity that would entitle him to a lower sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> \"[D]ue process requires that, where `the defendant's mental condition [is] relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer,' the government provide to indigent defendants expert psychiatric testimony at `the sentencing phase.'\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span> (1985)). Nevertheless, \"a trial judge is not required to grant every motion questioning an accused's competency.\" <i>United States v. Pellerito,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526038\"><a href=\"/opinion/526038/united-states-v-giuseppe-pellerito-aka-joseph-el-italiano-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1535</span></a></span>, 1544 (1st Cir.1989). After a careful review of the evidence Mastera offers in support of his claim, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mastera presents four reasons for believing he might qualify for a diminished capacity sentencing departure. The evidence of alcoholism does not help Mastera because &#167; 5K2.13 specifically prohibits a court from granting a diminished capacity downward departure if \"the [defendant's] significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants.\" This prohibition is buttressed by the policy statement in &#167; 5H1.4 that \"[d]rug or alcohol dependence or abuse is not a reason for a downward departure.\" Thus, Mastera's alcoholism can be eliminated as an argument in favor of granting funds for a psychological evaluation. Moreover, current insomnia and racing thoughts, while indicative of some level of mental distress, are not probative as to Mastera's mental condition at the time he committed the crime of unlawfully possessing a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the child abuse, Mastera presented the sentencing court with a letter he had handwritten, entitled \"My Life,\" that described his violent and abusive childhood. Before imposing the sentence, the judge stated that he had received this document and \"reviewed it closely.\" Mastera argues that this case is comparable to the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599385\"><a href=\"/opinion/599385/united-states-v-james-michael-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1993), which held that a district court had discretion to consider a defendant's account of \"severe abuse and neglect\" during his childhood. <i>Id.</i> at 481. However, the sentencing court in <i>Brown</i> explicitly stated its desire to depart downward but concluded that it did not have the authority to do so, and the Ninth Circuit held that it did, in fact, have that authority. <i>See id.</i> at 480, 483. In this case, by contrast, the sentencing court did read and consider Mastera's submission about the childhood abuse he suffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mastera alleged to the district court, without providing specifics, that he had \"some history of psychological care during a prior incarceration.\" He argues that this allegation brings him within the ambit of <i>Pellerito,</i> in which the defendant moved for permission for a psychological evaluation and alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> \"that he was a long-time drug abuser [and] that he had been treated previously for mental illness.\" <i>Pellerito,</i> 878 F.2d at 1545. We held that the defendant's motion should have been granted. However, <i>Pellerito</i> is distinct from this case in one important way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> In <i>Pellerito,</i> the defendant's \"medicinal regimen,\" consisting of sedatives and anti-anxiety medications, was, at the time the request for an expert was made, \"a matter of record.\" <i>Id.</i> Mastera, in contrast, told the judge he was not on any medication, and, importantly, provided no corroborating evidence of any kind that he had a history of treatment for mental illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered all the foregoing factors, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the judge to determine there was no warrant for Mastera to receive a psychological evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of defendant's motion for funds for a psychological examination and the defendant's sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mastera also argues that the ACCA is unconstitutional because it allows a defendant to receive a mandatory minimum sentence based on facts (i.e. the facts of prior convictions) that are found by a judge rather than by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We have already rejected this argument in<i>United States v. Ivery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201865\"><a href=\"/opinion/201865/united-states-v-ivery/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005), in which we held that <i>Almendarez-Torres v.
