George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n      Souter, Associate Justice,* and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     J. Gregory Batten for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 1, 2010\n\n\n\n\n*\n    The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f          SOUTER,   Associate    Justice.          The   defendant,    Stephen\n\nRamnath, was convicted of conspiracy to distribute, and possess\n\nwith intent to distribute, more than fifty grams of crack in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1).                He argues that\n\nadmission of pre-conspiracy and bad act evidence was error, that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to prove conspiracy, that admission\n\nof alleged co-conspirator hearsay was reversible and that the Maine\n\nvenue for trial was unsupported.         We hold the pre-conspiracy and\n\nbad act evidence admissible and the conspiracy clearly shown.              The\n\nremaining claims assume that the conspiracy was unproven and fall\n\nin consequence of our contrary conclusion.\n\n          On July 25, 2007, law enforcement agents in Portland,\n\nMaine, made a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Hussein Al-\n\nRikabi, and then got authorization to tap his phone.                  Over the\n\ncourse of the next week, Ramnath (speaking from New Jersey) was a\n\nparty in conversations that anyone would recognize as guarded\n\ndiscussions about price and quantity of drugs to be obtained by\n\nRamnath for sale to Al-Rikabi.        Ultimately, they arranged that Al-\n\nRikabi would drive from Maine to see Ramnath in New Jersey.                The\n\npolice observed this meeting through binoculars and saw a large\n\nquantity of cash pass from Al-Rikabi to Ramnath in exchange for\n\nsomething they could not make out.           The next day, officers in\n\nPortland saw Al-Rikabi engage in a series of short encounters in\n\ncommercial   establishments     and     on   the    streets,   including     a\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fneighborhood noted for drug sales.            Less than two weeks later, the\n\nwiretap    picked     up    another    conversation      in    which    Al-Rikabi\n\napparently sought to buy more drugs from Ramnath, who spoke to the\n\nability of his sources to produce material good to “cook.”\n\n           Two months after that phone interception, Al-Rikabi was\n\narrested in Maine on drug charges, and a day later so was Ramnath,\n\nin New Jersey.        Ramnath admitted that he already knew of Al-\n\nRikabi’s arrest, and that twice he had sold him 100 grams of crack\n\nknowing it was for resale in Maine at a price higher than the rate\n\nin the New Jersey market.          Ramnath consented to a search of his\n\napartment, which produced 16 grams of powder cocaine, some cutting\n\nagent, a digital pharmacist’s scale and the sort of plastic baggies\n\nused for individual drug sales.\n\n           As   for    Ramnath’s      assignment    of   error     in   admitting\n\nevidence of the controlled purchase on July 25, trial counsel\n\nobjected that it was irrelevant because the conspiracy was charged\n\nas having begun on July 26.           Current counsel adds that its unfair\n\nprejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value,\n\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 403, and that trial counsel was ineffective in\n\nfailing to request an instruction limiting its consideration to any\n\npossible   bearing     on   Ramnath’s    understanding        or   intentions   in\n\ndealing with Al-Rikabi.           The relevance objection was rightly\n\noverruled; the evidence served to identify Ramnath’s alleged co-\n\nconspirator, Al-Rikabi, as a drug dealer, with the implication that\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fsomeone supplying him with large quantities of drugs would know\n\nwhat he would do with them.         Since evidence subsequently obtained\n\nshowed that Ramnath and Al-Rikabi engaged in substantial drug\n\ntransactions (as, indeed, Ramnath admitted, only denying that the\n\nparties were conspirators), the relevance of this evidence was\n\nclear, and its probative value not substantially outweighed.           The\n\nfurther claim of counsel’s constitutional inadequacy adds nothing\n\nto this appeal; the prevailing rule in this circuit generally bars\n\nconsideration of an ineffectiveness claim raised for the first time\n\non appeal, United States v. Theodore, 354 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), and in any event Ramnath’s counsel mentions it with a\n\nbrevity that fails to address adequately the elements of a charge\n\nof ineffective assistance under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n\n668, 687 (1984).\n\n            Ramnath’s unsuccessful objection to admission of the\n\ndrugs and paraphernalia found in his apartment was followed by an\n\ninstruction that the jury could consider them “only for the limited\n\npurpose of deciding whether Mr. Ramnath had the state of mind or\n\nintent necessary to commit the crime charged,” and its admission\n\nwas consistent with the provision of Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n404(b) that evidence of other crimes, while inadmissible to prove\n\npropensity to commit the crime charged, nonetheless may be received\n\nto   show   motive,   intent   or   plan,   among   other   things.   Being\n\nadmissible here, it was an evidentiary bookend to the testimony\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fabout Al-Rikabi’s drug sale just before the authorities got wind of\n\nhis connection with Ramnath.    The quantity of drugs, the baggies,\n\nthe cutting agent and the scale (described by a police witness as\n\na distributor’s “number one tool”) combined to confirm that Ramnath\n\nwas, as he admitted, a sophisticated drug dealer, and provided\n\nprobative evidence of his intent when he undertook to supply\n\nanother known dealer with commercial quantities of crack cocaine.\n\n          Ramnath’s     admissions    were   thus    given   corroborative\n\ncontext for consideration on the conspiracy charge, that is, that\n\nRamnath had voluntarily agreed with Al-Rikabi to distribute the\n\nspecified quantity of crack (and to possess it for that purpose)\n\nwith the understanding that Al-Rikabi would distribute it to\n\nothers. See United States v. Thompson, 449 F.3d 267, 275 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   This could not have been a difficult issue for the jury.\n\nThe   evidence   just   discussed     indicates     that   Ramnath   was   a\n\ndistributor and Al-Rikabi was dealing in retail quantities in\n\nstreet sales.    The telephone conversations show that Ramnath also\n\nsold in volume and undertook to get a large quantity of crack for\n\nAl-Rikabi. (This much is inferrable from Ramnath’s own intercepted\n\nstatements, as to which he has no sustainable hearsay objection.)\n\nThe account of the New Jersey surveillance established that the\n\ninitial dialogue led to a transaction involving a considerable sum\n\nof money, and Ramnath’s subsequent           statements over the phone\n\nreflect an understanding that his relationship with Al-Rikabi would\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcontinue.     These facts are confirmed by his confession, which\n\nmentioned two sales of commercial quantities to Al-Rikabi as well\n\nas the Maine destination of the crack for profitable resale there.\n\nWhile Ramnath argues that his confession ought to be ignored as\n\nuncorroborated, if corroboration were needed the record supplies\n\nit: evidence of Al-Rikabi’s occupation, observations during the New\n\nJersey surveillance, Ramnath’s intercepted statements, and the\n\ndealer’s    accoutrements   in    his     apartment.     The     pieces    fit\n\ncomfortably together and the jury was entitled to find agreement to\n\na joint course of conduct resulting in Al-Rikabi’s retail sales in\n\nMaine.\n\n            Given the sufficient support for the conspiracy charged,\n\nthe remaining issues here go by the boards.              The objection to\n\nadmitting Al-Rikabi’s intercepted statements simply repeats the\n\nclaim that no conspiracy was proven.         But because it was shown (by\n\nevidence    including   “some    extrinsic    proof,”   United    States   v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1182 (1st Cir. 1993)), the co-conspirator\n\nstatements fall outside the definition of hearsay, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801(d)(2)(E), there being no serious question that the\n\ndiscussions of larger sales were made during and in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy. What Al-Rikabi’s statements added to the probative\n\nforce of Ramnath’s own is debatable, but admissibility is not.\n\n            Neither is proper venue.         Ramnath told the police the\n\ndrugs Al-Rikabi obtained from him were for resale in Maine, at\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fprices higher than those in New Jersey, and evidence in the record\n\nis enough to show that Maine was where the chain of commerce ended.\n\nTo be sure, Ramnath argues that his statement is incompetent to\n\nsupport the venue because he was a mere seller, not part of a\n\nconspiracy whose business extended to Maine.    But our conclusion\n\nthat conspiracy was sufficiently shown settles that; the venue was\n\nproperly laid in a district where the object of the conspiracy\n\noffence was realized, see 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a); United States v.\n\nSantiago, 83 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",
