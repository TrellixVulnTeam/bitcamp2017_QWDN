In our increasingly pluralistic\n\nand multilingual society, the issues raised by this case will grow\n\nin importance.     This case arises in the federal courts of Puerto\n\nRico.     These courts often face the difficult task of admitting\n\nevidence that originates in the Spanish language while seeking to\n\ncomply with the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. § 864, which requires that\n\ncourt proceedings be conducted in English.                   In this case, the\n\nevidence involved fifty-two recordings of wiretapped conversations\n\nin Spanish among members of a drug importation and distribution\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            The defendant, Gabriel Morales-Madera, was convicted of\n\nparticipating in a massive drug conspiracy.                 He was sentenced to\n\n250 months imprisonment and six years of supervised release.                   On\n\nappeal,    the   primary    issue      raised    is    that    English-language\n\ntranscripts of the wiretapped conversations were neither marked as\n\nexhibits nor admitted in evidence, and that the court reporter did\n\nnot transcribe and translate the wiretapped conversations into the\n\nrecord as the tapes were being played.\n\n            Morales-Madera urges this court to adopt a bright-line\n\nrule    that   where   English   transcripts          of    taped   conversations\n\nconducted in Spanish are not admitted in evidence, there is such\n\nharm to    the   national   interest     in     maintaining     English   as   the\n\nlanguage of the courts that any ensuing conviction should be\n\noverturned.       He    reads    our     opinion       in    United   States   v.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fRivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002), to require that result.\n\nWe reject both his reading of Rivera-Rosario and his proposed\n\nbright-line rule. Instead, we evaluate a number of factors, taking\n\ninto account the nature of the problem at trial, the objections\n\nmade by the defendant below, the use of Fed. R. App. P. 10(e) to\n\nsupplement the record for purposes of appellate review, and any\n\nprejudice to the defendant.   Morales-Madera also argues that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to convict and that there were sentencing\n\nerrors.   We reject his challenges to his conviction and affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          Because the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Morales-\n\nMadera, we state the facts in the light most favorable to his\n\nconviction.\n\n           On December 10, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a\n\nfour-count indictment against twenty-four defendants allegedly\n\ninvolved in a drug trafficking organization.         Count One charged\n\nthat from about December 1994 until the time of the indictment,\n\nMorales-Madera   and   twenty-two    other   individuals   conspired   to\n\ndistribute and to possess with the intent to distribute more than\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, and multi-pound\n\nquantities of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.\n\n           Morales-Madera was tried alone in a four-day jury trial\n\nthat started on August 6, 2001.     At trial, FBI Special Agent Carlos\n\nCases testified that Federico Naranjo-Rosa and his nephew Carlos\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fGutierrez-Naranjo       operated        a     drug-trafficking     organization.\n\nAccording to Agent Cases's testimony, the organization imported\n\ncocaine and heroin from the Dominican Republic and Columbia and\n\ndistributed marijuana in Puerto Rico.                Agent Cases testified that\n\nMorales-Madera was Naranjo-Rosa's right-hand man and had the task\n\nof collecting drug debts and helping Naranjo-Rosa obtain drugs from\n\nthe Dominican Republic.\n\n            The government played to the jury recordings of fifty-two\n\ntapes of telephone conversations between the conspirators that were\n\nintercepted and recorded by the FBI pursuant to a wiretap order.\n\nThese wiretapped conversations took place in Spanish.                     The court\n\nreporter did not transcribe or translate the contents of the tapes\n\nin   the    record.         Instead,     the      government   provided     Spanish\n\ntranscripts    of     the    tapes     and    English   translations      of   those\n\ntranscripts to the district court, the jury, and defense counsel at\n\ntrial.1    The jury used the transcripts as aids while the wiretap\n\ntapes were played, and returned the transcripts to the government\n\nafterwards.    The court instructed the jury to \"consider in [their]\n\ndeliberations what [they] heard on tape, not what the transcript\n\nsays.\"     The transcripts were not marked as exhibits or entered in\n\nevidence, and they were not taken into the jury room during\n\n\n     1\n          Transcripts were provided for each tape played to the\njury except for Exhibit No. 4, which Agent Cases testified was a\ntape of a conversation on April 5, 1997 between Naranjo-Rosa and\nco-conspirator Rivera-Rosario regarding two planned shipments of\n500 kilograms of cocaine.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fdeliberations. At trial, defense counsel did not object to the use\n\nof the transcripts or to their accuracy.\n\n           According    to   Agent    Cases's    testimony,   most    of     the\n\nwiretaps consisted of conversations using coded language to discuss\n\ndrug sales and the collection of drug debts.          Nine tapes involved\n\nwiretapped conversations between Morales-Madera and Naranjo-Rosa in\n\nApril and May 1997.      In one conversation on April 15, Morales-\n\nMadera referred    in   coded   language    to   returning    bad    drugs    in\n\nexchange for good drugs.        Later that day, Morales-Madera called\n\nNaranjo-Rosa to ask how much money he should collect for twenty\n\nkilograms of cocaine (\"twenty parts\").             After consulting with\n\nGutierrez-Naranjo, Naranjo-Rosa called Morales-Madera back to tell\n\nhim in coded language that the price would be $15,000 per kilogram.\n\nOn April 18, Naranjo-Rosa and Morales-Madera discussed a $30,000\n\ndebt owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo.        During the conversation, Naranjo-\n\nRosa became upset because Morales-Madera used non-coded language to\n\ndiscuss the debt, and warned Morales-Madera that his phone might be\n\ntapped.    On April 29, Naranjo-Rosa told Morales-Madera that they\n\nhad five-eighths of a kilogram, or 625 grams, of heroin (\"five\n\nwhitewall tires\"), for which the two discussed an appropriate\n\nprice.    The two also discussed the collection of debt for cocaine\n\n(\"parts\").   On April 30, Naranjo-Rosa instructed Morales in coded\n\nlanguage to call someone who would give him $45,000, and the two\n\ndiscussed cocaine (\"tires\").         In three conversations on May 1 and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f2, the two made plans to purchase heroin (\"15 wide whitewall\n\ntires\") in the Dominican Republic and discussed in coded language\n\n$1,000 that was missing from a $39,000 payment.\n\n            Another tape involved a phone call on April 11 from\n\nMorales-Madera, who was using Naranjo-Rosa's wiretapped phone, to\n\nAmerican Airlines to arrange their flight to the Dominican Republic\n\nthat day.     FBI Agent Cases testified, based on other wiretapped\n\nconversations, that the purpose of this trip was to purchase heroin\n\nto be imported into Puerto Rico.\n\n            The government also played tapes of conversations in\n\nwhich Morales-Madera did not participate.              Three tapes involved\n\ncoded discussions by co-conspirators regarding Morales-Madera's\n\nactivities.      On   April   15,    Naranjo-Rosa   and   Gutierrez-Naranjo\n\ndiscussed Morales-Madera's call to Naranjo-Rosa earlier that day,\n\nin which Morales-Madera had asked how much money he should collect\n\nfor twenty kilograms of cocaine. Later that same day, Naranjo-Rosa\n\ntold Gomez-Felix that he would send him money via Morales-Madera.\n\nOn April 30, Naranjo-Rosa and Gomez-Felix discussed four and one-\n\nhalf eighths of a kilogram of heroin that Naranjo-Rosa and Morales-\n\nMadera were supposed to pick up from the Dominican Republic.\n\nApproximately thirty other recordings involved coded conversations\n\nbetween co-conspirators about drug importation or distribution.\n\n            In   addition     to    the   wiretapped    conversations,   the\n\ngovernment introduced passports, boarding passes, and testimony\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ffrom Agent Cases about Morales-Madera's travel to the Dominican\n\nRepublic.    Morales-Madera traveled to the Dominican Republic with\n\nNaranjo-Rosa on April 11 and again on April 21.             Morales-Madera\n\nalso took one trip to the Dominican Republic with Naranjo-Rosa's\n\ncousin on May 2.\n\n            Morales-Madera testified at trial in his own defense. In\n\nhis testimony, he admitted that he had sought to collect debts owed\n\nto Gutierrez-Naranjo and that he had assumed at the time that those\n\ndebts were drug-related.\n\n            On August 9, 2001, the jury found Morales-Madera guilty\n\nof Count One of the indictment.             On January 22, 2002, Morales-\n\nMadera was sentenced to 250 months imprisonment, plus a supervised\n\nrelease term of six years and a special monetary assessment of\n\n$100.   Seeking to reverse his conviction and sentence, Morales-\n\nMadera filed this appeal.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.   English Language Issue\n\n            This issue involves two statutes: (1) the Jones Act, 48\n\nU.S.C. § 864, which provides that \"[a]ll pleadings and proceedings\n\nin the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nshall be conducted in the English language,\" and (2) the Court\n\nReporter    Act,   28   U.S.C.   §   753(b),   which   requires   that   \"all\n\nproceedings in criminal cases [held] in open court . . . shall be\n\nrecorded verbatim.\"\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f               Morales-Madera's first theory confuses the different\n\nstatutes and different types of evidence. He argues that the Court\n\nReporter Act required the reporter to transcribe literally and\n\nsomehow translate into English the wiretap tapes as they were\n\nplayed to the jury.          That, in our view, is a misreading of the\n\nstatute.       When the court reporter transcribes the testimony of a\n\nwitness       who    testifies   in   Spanish,   the   interpreter's   English\n\ntranslation is the evidence entered in the record under the Jones\n\nAct.       United States v. De Jesus Boria, 518 F.2d 368, 370 (1st Cir.\n\n1975); Bordas & Co. v. Pizarro, 314 F.2d 291, 292 (1st Cir. 1963).\n\nThe playing of recordings, however, presents a different issue.\n\nThe conversations on the wiretap tapes are not testimony from\n\nwitnesses before the court that must be recorded in a verbatim\n\ntranscript.2\n\n               Language in some opinions, ours and others, indicates\n\nthat the Court Reporter Act is violated when the court reporter\n\nfails to simultaneously transcribe the contents of recordings heard\n\nby the jury.          See United States v. Andiarena, 823 F.2d 673, 676\n\n(1st Cir. 1987); United States v. McCusker, 936 F.2d 781, 785 (5th\n\nCir. 1981).         We harbor considerable doubts about this proposition.\n\nThe Court Reporter Act is not usually understood to require the\n\n\n\n       2\n          Even if the Court Reporter Act were violated because a\nverbatim transcript was not available, reversal of the conviction\nwould not automatically be required. United States v. Brand, 80\nF.3d 560, 563 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                        -8-\n\freporter to record separately the contents of exhibits admitted in\n\nevidence.    The   tapes of the recordings are not testimony but are\n\nthemselves admitted in evidence as exhibits.    See United States v.\n\nYoung, 105 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Craig, 573\n\nF.2d 455, 480 (7th Cir. 1977) (finding \"no merit\" to the argument\n\nthat there was a violation of the Court Reporter Act because the\n\nreporter did not transcribe the recorded conversations).     We held\n\nin United States v. Rengifo, 789 F.2d 975 (1st Cir. 1986), that a\n\ntranscript of a composite audio recording was not \"testimony\" even\n\nwhen the transcript was read aloud to the jury.     Id. at 977, 983.\n\nAt any rate, this issue need not be resolved.      Even among those\n\ncourts that find an error under the Court Reporter Act based on the\n\nfailure to transcribe an audio recording, it is agreed that the\n\nerror is harmless when the recording itself is entered in the\n\nrecord. See Andiarena, 823 F.2d at 676; McCusker, 936 F.2d at 785.\n\n            Morales-Madera's next argument is a Jones Act claim that\n\nimplicates several issues.     At the trial level, separate issues\n\narise regarding the submission of English transcripts of Spanish\n\naudio recordings to the jury as aids, the proper procedures for\n\nensuring reliable transcription of the taped conversations and\n\nreliable translation of those transcripts into English, and the\n\nadmissibility of English transcripts as evidence. At the appellate\n\nlevel, issues arise regarding compliance at the trial court level\n\nwith the Jones Act and the Court Reporter Act, the adequacy of the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\frecord on which appellate review is based, and the appropriate\n\nremedy for non-compliance.\n\n        1.   Submitting English Transcripts to the Jury\n\n             When   an   audio    recording    is    in   English,    the    common\n\npractice is to play the recording, make a transcript available,\n\nmark the transcript as an exhibit, and use it as an aid.                         Our\n\ncourt, and many others, have approved such use of transcripts as\n\naids to the jury, provided the court makes clear to the jury that\n\nthe tape rather than the transcript constitutes the best evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Ademaj, 170 F.3d 58, 65 (1st Cir. 1999).                        In\n\nordinary circumstances, the district court does not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in allowing the jury to use the transcripts during\n\ndeliberations.      Rengifo, 789 F.2d at 980.\n\n             Providing     an    English-language      transcript     of    wiretap\n\nevidence is more than merely useful when the recorded language is\n\nnot English; for Jones Act purposes, it is necessary. The language\n\nof the federal courts is English.          Participants, including judges,\n\njurors, and counsel, are entitled to understand the proceedings in\n\nEnglish.3    Even apart from the mandates of the Jones Act, in Puerto\n\nRico,    where   Spanish    is    the   primary     language   of    most   of   the\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The public shares that entitlement to proceedings in\nEnglish. But the rights of the public are not impaired here. All\nproceedings were in English; the only complaint is that the wiretap\ntapes were in Spanish.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fpopulation, there are nevertheless jurors, parties, and counsel\n\nwhose primary language is English.\n\n          Here, the submission of English transcripts was required,\n\nassuming the transcripts were translated and transcribed accurately\n\n(an issue discussed infra).    Unlike in Rivera-Rosario, where the\n\n\"English translation was . . . cast aside\" and the jurors used\n\nSpanish transcripts instead, 300 F.3d at 5, the English transcripts\n\nhere were made available to the jurors and used while the tapes\n\nwere playing. Furthermore, in this case, counsel made no objection\n\nbelow to the provision of the English transcripts to the jury.\n\n     2.   Ensuring the Reliability of Translation and of\n          Transcription When Using English Transcripts\n\n          Before transcripts may be submitted to the jury even as\n\naids, issues must be addressed both about the reliability of the\n\ntranscription in the original language of the wiretaps and about\n\nthe accuracy of the translation of those transcripts from the\n\noriginal language to English (here, from Spanish to English).\n\nCommonly, the transcripts and the English translations of those\n\ntranscripts are produced by the government and copies are then\n\ngiven to the defendant.   Sound trial management and considerations\n\nof fairness caution that the government provide these copies to\n\ndefense counsel adequately in advance, so that disputes concerning\n\nthe reliability of the transcription in the original language and\n\nof the English translation may be brought to the attention of the\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fdistrict court or resolved by agreement.                     Counsel, of course, may\n\nagree to the accuracy in both senses.\n\n             This court outlined in Rengifo the proper procedure for\n\naddressing transcription error:\n\n      We believe that it is advisable for the district court to\n      try to obtain a stipulated transcript from the parties\n      before trial or, at least, before a transcript is used.\n      Failing such stipulation, each party should be allowed to\n      introduce its own transcript of the recording provided\n      that it is properly authenticated.        When the jury\n      receives two transcripts of the same recording, it\n      should, of course, be instructed that there is a\n      difference of opinion as to the accuracy of the\n      transcripts and that it is up to them to decide which, if\n      any, version to accept.      The jurors should also be\n      instructed that they can disregard any portion of the\n      transcript (or transcripts) which they think differs from\n      what they hear on the tape recording. Further limiting\n      instructions will depend on the circumstances of each\n      case.\n\n789   F.2d    at   983.      In    short,      if      the   defendant     believes   the\n\ntranscription of the tape is in error as to what was said, then the\n\ndispute should be brought to the attention of the court.                         Usually,\n\nthe   judge    either      makes       a   determination        as   to    the   correct\n\ntranscription after listening to the tape or determines that the\n\ndispute is an issue of fact for the jury to decide.                       This procedure\n\napplies to transcription disputes regarding both English and non-\n\nEnglish transcripts.\n\n              In   the    case    of   tapes      of    non-English       conversations,\n\nhowever, there is the additional problem of potential translation\n\nerror.   If the parties do not agree that the English transcript\n\nsubmitted is correctly translated, the preferred solution is to\n\n                                           -12-\n\fobtain agreement from counsel as to an accurate translation.                 If\n\nagreement is not possible, the district court should have the\n\nparties present testimony from translators and allow the jury to\n\ndecide the issue.     See Weinstein & Berger, Weinstein's Federal\n\nEvidence § 901.09.\n\n          Here,    because     Morales-Madera     did   not   object    to   the\n\naccuracy of the translation or the transcription and he makes no\n\nclaim on appeal that the English transcripts before the jury were\n\ninaccurate, no issue of that type is before us.\n\n     3.   Admitting English Transcripts In Evidence\n\n          Once translation and transcription disputes have been\n\naddressed and the transcripts have been submitted to the jury for\n\nits use, parties using audio recordings in other languages should\n\nensure that the English transcripts become part of the record by\n\nintroducing them in evidence.4       The English transcripts should be\n\nmarked and     admitted   in   evidence    in   addition   to   the    wiretaps\n\nthemselves.5    The issue of jury instructions was not raised either\n\nat trial or on appeal and has not been briefed, so it is not before\n\n\n\n     4\n          The trial court retains discretion as to what documentary\nevidence the jury is permitted to have during deliberations. See\nUnited States v. McCarthy, 961 F.2d 972, 978 (1st Cir. 1992)\n(\"Whether . . . evidentiary exhibits properly admitted should or\nshould not accompany the jury to the jury room is a discretionary\nmatter for the trial court.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n     5\n          Where, by contrast, the conversations on the tape are in\nEnglish, the transcript is often marked as an exhibit for\nidentification without being admitted.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fus.   Nonetheless, in these circumstances hereafter, an instruction\n\nthat the jury should consider only what is on the tape and not what\n\nis in the English transcript would not be appropriate.\n\n            Parties frequently, as here, use the transcripts only as\n\naids and fail to admit them in evidence.                The usual reason given\n\nfor not introducing transcripts in evidence is that the wiretap\n\ntapes themselves are the best evidence of the conversation, not the\n\ntranscripts. See, e.g., United States v. Warner, 204 F.3d 799, 801\n\n(8th Cir. 2000); Fed. R. Evid. 1002 (\"To prove the content of a\n\nwriting, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording,\n\nor photograph is required . . . .\").\n\n            The best evidence rule requires that the tape recordings\n\nthemselves must be furnished, absent agreement to the contrary, but\n\ndoes not require that English translations of those tapes be\n\nexcluded from evidence.          Non-English recordings present unique\n\nproblems    of    compliance    with    the    Jones     Act,   which    requires\n\nproceedings to be conducted in English.                 Accordingly, almost 20\n\nyears ago, this court approved the introduction in evidence of\n\nEnglish transcripts for wiretaps of Spanish conversations, provided\n\nthe reliability issues were worked out.            Rengifo, 789 F.2d at 983.6\n\nThe   Eleventh    Circuit     reached    the     same   conclusion      about   the\n\nadmission    in    evidence     of     English     transcripts    of     recorded\n\n\n\n      6\n          Because the Rengifo case arose in Massachusetts, it did\nnot present Jones Act issues.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fconversations in Spanish in United States v. Cruz, 765 F.2d 1020,\n\n1022-24 (11th Cir. 1985), as did the Seventh Circuit in United\n\nStates v. Jordan, 223 F.3d 676, 688 (7th Cir. 2000).          This practice\n\nof admitting reliable English transcripts in evidence is entirely\n\nconsistent with the best evidence rule.         The rationale behind the\n\nbest evidence rule -- that \"the [recording itself] is a more\n\nreliable, complete and accurate source of information as to its\n\ncontents and meaning than anyone's description\" of it, Gordon v.\n\nUnited States, 344 U.S. 414, 421 (1953) -- is not undercut when the\n\noriginal recording is played to the jury and the undisputedly\n\naccurate English transcript is admitted in evidence.               See United\n\nStates v.     Holton,   116   F.3d   1536   (D.C.   Cir.   1997)   (\"concerns\n\naddressed by the best evidence rule are not at issue\" in this\n\nsituation).\n\n            Here, the government concedes that it committed error in\n\nfailing to enter the English transcripts in the record.\n\n     4.     Adequacy of English-Language Record for Judicial Review\n\n            Where, as here, English transcripts are not part of the\n\nrecord, the issue arises of creating a sufficient record to allow\n\njudicial review under the Jones Act.         This problem exists not only\n\non appellate review but also in the district court's review of the\n\nrecord when deciding Rule 29 motions.\n\n            Here, Morales-Madera's argument focuses on the adequacy\n\nof appellate review.      In simple terms, he argues that because the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\ftrial record before this court has no English translation of the\n\nmany wiretaps played to the jury, this court is unable to review\n\nthe record to determine if the evidence was sufficient to convict.\n\nAbsent the wiretaps, he says, the remaining evidence is plainly\n\ninsufficient.     He argues that Rivera-Rosario compels acceptance of\n\nhis position.\n\n              We reject Morales-Madera's argument that Rivera-Rosario\n\ncontrols this case.          This court's opinion in Rivera-Rosario is\n\ndistinguishable on several grounds.            Unlike this case, Rivera-\n\nRosario involved a situation in which the jury was deprived of\n\nhaving      English-language    transcripts    at    all.       Rivera-Rosario\n\ninvolved a unique sequence of events:\n\n1. the government failed to provide English transcripts in advance,\n\nthus apparently depriving the defendants of a fair opportunity to\n\nraise and resolve issues of reliability as to the 180 tapes that\n\nconstituted the heart of the government's case;\n\n2. there was a dispute raised by the defendants at trial about the\n\naccuracy of the English translation of the transcripts of the\n\nwiretap tapes;\n\n3.   that    dispute   was   neither    resolved    by   the   trial   court   by\n\nobtaining agreement nor submitted to the jury for resolution;\n\n4. as a consequence, and this is a key distinction, the English\n\ntranscripts were never submitted to the jury at all;\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f5. this problem was not mooted by the court reporter's transcribing\n\nthe taped conversations as they were played in open court7 or by\n\nthe parties     agreeing   on   or   the    jury   determining   the   correct\n\ntranslation;\n\n6. the government then failed to comply with the procedures of Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 10(e), which allow the government to supplement the\n\nrecord;\n\n7. thus, the Court of Appeals was placed in the position of\n\nresolving a factual dispute as to the English translation.\n\n300 F.3d at 5-9.\n\n          We trust that this sequence of events will not recur and\n\nthat the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico will meet its\n\nobligations.8    Because the sequence of events here differs and the\n\njury did have English transcripts, we do not apply Rivera-Rosario's\n\nreversible-error rule that \"violations of the English language\n\nrequirement will constitute reversible error whenever the appellant\n\ncan demonstrate that the untranslated evidence has the potential to\n\naffect the disposition of an issue raised on appeal.\"             Id. at 10.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          As we have said, this procedure is not a required one.\n     8\n          This court was informed that the U.S. Attorney's Office\nin Puerto Rico often does not prepare transcripts until it is clear\nthat defendants will not plead guilty. The government may not,\nhowever, spring translated transcripts of wiretapped conversations\non defense counsel at the last minute without raising the concerns\ndiscussed in this opinion.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            Instead, we hold that because Morales-Madera did not\n\nraise his Jones Act claim in the trial court in the context of the\n\nfacts of this case, our review of his claim is for plain error.\n\nSee United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993).                A plain\n\nerror is one that \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"          Id. at 732 (quotation\n\nmarks, alterations, and citation omitted).             In other words, an\n\nerror is     plain   if   \"a   miscarriage   of   justice   would   otherwise\n\nresult.\"    United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985).\n\n            The government has conceded that a Jones Act error\n\noccurred when it failed to introduce the English transcripts in\n\nevidence or mark those transcripts as exhibits.              On appeal, the\n\ngovernment sought to use Fed. R. App. Proc Rule 10(e) to supplement\n\nthe record with copies of the English transcripts actually used at\n\ntrial.     The framers of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n\nwho anticipated a generic class of problems involving insufficiency\n\nof the record, created the following procedure in Rule 10(e):\n\n     If anything material to either party is omitted from or\n     misstated in the record by error or by accident, the\n     omission or misstatement may be corrected and a\n     supplemental record may be certified and forwarded:\n          (A) on stipulation of the parties;\n          (B) by the district court before or after the\n          record has been forwarded; or\n          (C) by the court of appeals.\n\nAt least where there is no issue of transcription or translation\n\nerror and where the jurors and other participants had the English\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\ftranscripts available to them during the trial, the Rule 10(e)\n\nprocedures may be used to supplement the record.\n\n           Here, however, the government's attempt to supplement the\n\nrecord failed to comply with Rule 10(e).     The government did not\n\nobtain a stipulation from defense counsel or submit the transcripts\n\nto the district court for certification.    Instead, the government\n\nsimply filed in the district court what the government said were\n\naccurate copies, with a request that they be transmitted to the\n\ncourt of appeals.   The clerk of the district court did so within a\n\nday, without the trial court ever certifying that the copies\n\nsubmitted were accurate copies of the English transcripts used at\n\ntrial.   The defendant did not object to the trial court or to this\n\ncourt that these were not accurate copies of what had been used at\n\ntrial, preferring to rely on his argument that the government could\n\nnot supplement the record at all.\n\n           While the defendant may have forfeited and/or waived any\n\nobjection that the submitted transcripts are not accurate copies of\n\nthe transcripts before the jury, we are reluctant to review a\n\ncriminal conviction based on English transcripts that may not be\n\naccurate copies of those used at trial.       Accordingly, at oral\n\nargument, we asked counsel to confer and advise us whether they\n\ncould agree that the transcripts submitted by the government are\n\naccurate copies of those used at trial.    We were explicit that the\n\ninquiry did not include issues of transcription or translation\n\n\n                                -19-\n\ferror; those issues were forfeited at trial and waived in this\n\ncourt.     The parties reported back to us that the transcripts are\n\nindeed the same as those used at trial.     We therefore accept the\n\ntranscripts as supplementing the record under Rule 10(e).    We do,\n\nhowever, urge the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Puerto Rico to be\n\nmore mindful of the requirements of Rule 10(e) in the future.\n\n            With the addition of these transcripts, the English-\n\nlanguage record is sufficient for appellate review.    Fifty-one of\n\nthe fifty-two wiretaps have been transcribed and translated into\n\nEnglish.     One wiretap tape (Exhibit No. 4) is beyond our review\n\nbecause the government did not provide the jury with English\n\ntranscripts of it.      Relying on Rivera-Rosario, Morales-Madera\n\nargues that this tape might contain evidence that undermines\n\nconfidence in the jury's verdict, even if other evidence on the\n\nrecord would otherwise be sufficient to sustain his conviction. We\n\ndisagree. In Rivera-Rosario, the court was unable to review any of\n\nthe 180 tapes,    300 F.3d at 12, whereas we are able to review all\n\nbut one of the 52 tapes here.   Moreover, in Rivera-Rosario, the 180\n\ntapes constituted the \"gravamen\" of the government's case, whereas\n\nthere is no indication that Exhibit No. 4 carries such importance\n\nin this case.     The government does not rely on Exhibit No. 4 to\n\nestablish Morales-Madera's role in the conspiracy; he is not one of\n\nthe conversants and there is no indication that he was even\n\nmentioned in the conversation.    Agent Cases provided a summary of\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthe contents of the tape to the jury in his testimony, and stated\n\nonly that Naranjo-Rosa and Rivera-Rosario were discussing two\n\nplanned shipments of 500 kilograms of cocaine and the income they\n\nwould receive from those shipments. Agent Cases made no mention of\n\nMorales-Madera.   Morales-Madera has given us no reason why Exhibit\n\nNo. 4 is likely to subvert the evidence in all the other tapes.        We\n\nfind no plain error on these facts.\n\nB.   Closing Arguments\n\n           Morales-Madera    argues   that   the   government's   closing\n\narguments were improper.     His brief is unclear as to whether those\n\narguments were transcribed.     Counsel, after being asked about the\n\nissue at oral argument, informed the court that the opening and\n\nclosing   arguments   were   available   for   transcription   but   that\n\nMorales-Madera had not requested that the court reporter transcribe\n\nthem.   It is his burden to submit such a request, and by failing to\n\ndo so, he waived the issue.      In any event, the strength of the\n\ngovernment's evidence was overwhelming, and any claim of prejudice\n\nbased on the closing argument would have been an uphill battle.\n\nC.   Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n           In a sufficiency of evidence challenge, we uphold the\n\nverdict unless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe prosecution, no reasonable jury could have found the defendant\n\nguilty.   United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d 12, 27 (1st\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fCir. 2003). Here, with the wiretap tapes, the evidence was plainly\n\nsufficient to convict.\n\n            To prove the elements of conspiracy, the government must\n\ndemonstrate    \"the       existence    of   a     conspiracy,      the   defendant's\n\nknowledge    of     the    conspiracy,      and    the    defendant's      voluntary\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy.\"               United States v. Gomez-Pabon,\n\n911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir. 1990).                 To show that the defendant\n\nvoluntarily participated in the conspiracy, the government must\n\ndemonstrate that the defendant had the intent to agree to the\n\nconspiracy    and    the     intent    to   effectuate       the    object   of    the\n\nconspiracy.       United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1499 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).    This intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.\n\nNelson-Rodriguez,         319   F.3d   at   28.    But    mere    association     with\n\nconspirators or mere knowledge of the conspiracy's activities is\n\nnot sufficient alone to establish guilt.                 Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d at\n\n853.\n\n            Here, the evidence was clearly sufficient to establish\n\nthe    existence    of    the   conspiracy.         The    jury    heard   fifty-two\n\nwiretapped conversations in which conspirators used what Agent\n\nCases testified was coded language such as \"cars,\" \"whitewall\n\ntires,\" and \"parts\" to discuss the importation and distribution of\n\ndrugs.\n\n            Agent Cases's testimony and the wiretaps were sufficient\n\nto allow a jury to conclude that Morales-Madera had detailed\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fknowledge of the conspiracy's planned importation of heroin from\n\nthe Dominican Republic and the conspiracy's pricing and debt\n\ncollection practices for cocaine and heroin. Agent Cases testified\n\nthat in three wiretapped conversations on April 15, Morales-Madera\n\nused coded language to plan the exchange of bad drugs for good\n\ndrugs,    discuss   pricing        of   twenty    kilograms    of    cocaine,      and\n\ncalculate the amount of drug-related debt.                     Agent Cases also\n\ntestified that in coded language in five wiretapped conversations\n\nfrom April 29 to May 2, Morales-Madera received instructions from\n\nNaranjo-Rosa     about    the      collection      of   cocaine-related       debt,\n\ndiscussed pricing for 625 grams of heroin that had already been\n\npurchased, and referred to plans to return spoiled heroin that they\n\nhad purchased from the Dominican Republic.\n\n            A jury could also reasonably infer that Morales-Madera\n\nvoluntarily participated in the conspiracy.                   Morales-Madera was\n\napparently familiar with the coded references to drugs and prices,\n\nand planned to collect debts and import heroin for the conspiracy.\n\nOther evidence corroborates this interpretation of the wiretaps.\n\nNaranjo-Rosa    admitted      in    one    wiretapped   conversation        that    he\n\nsuspected his phone was tapped and chastised Morales-Madera for\n\nfailing    to   speak    in   code,       thus   corroborating      Agent   Cases's\n\ntestimony that the speakers were using coded language.                      Morales-\n\nMadera's role as a collector of drug debts is also corroborated by\n\nhis non-coded references in one wiretapped conversation to a\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f$30,000 debt owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo and his testimony at trial\n\nthat he helped collect debts for Guiterrez-Naranjo despite his\n\nbelief that those debts were drug-related.       Finally, passports and\n\nboarding passes indicate that Morales-Madera did in fact travel to\n\nthe Dominican Republic three times with either Naranjo-Rosa or\n\nNaranjo-Rosa's cousin, as described on the wiretaps.\n\n            We   reject    Morales-Madera's   sufficiency   of   evidence\n\nchallenge and affirm his conviction.\n\nD.   Sentencing Errors\n\n     1.    Drug Quantity\n\n            Morales-Madera argues that the district court erred in\n\ndetermining that he was responsible for more than 150 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.    As a result of this determination, Morales-Madera had a\n\nbase offense level of 38.       This offense level, combined with his\n\ncriminal history category I, resulted in a range of 235 to 293\n\nmonths imprisonment.        The district court sentenced him to 250\n\nmonths.\n\n            We review factual determinations at sentencing for clear\n\nerror.    United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nBecause Morales-Madera did not raise this issue below, our review\n\nis also for plain error.      We find no such error.\n\n            Under the Sentencing Guidelines, each defendant must be\n\nsentenced based on the amount of drugs that he handled, saw, or\n\ncould reasonably have foreseen to be embraced by the conspiracy.\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fUnited States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 149 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 & cmt. 2.   This determination must be based on a\n\npreponderance of evidence.   United States v. Nieves, 322 F.3d 51,\n\n54 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           Here, the government relies on trial testimony from Agent\n\nCases about a wiretapped conversation between Naranjo-Rosa and\n\nRivera-Rosario about two planned shipments of 500 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.   This amount, the government contends, was foreseeable to\n\nMorales-Madera because of his close relationship with Naranjo-Rosa.\n\nMorales-Madera, on the other hand, argues that Agent Cases's trial\n\ntestimony is based on a wiretapped conversation for which the jury\n\nwas not provided an English transcript; he argues that there is no\n\nway to determine, on appeal, if Agent Cases's testimony was an\n\naccurate reflection of the content of the tapes.       We need not\n\nresolve this issue because the Pre-Sentence Investigative Report\n\n(PSR) is sufficient to support the district court's finding.\n\n     The PSR found the drug quantity attributable to Morales-Madera\n\nto be in excess of 150 kilograms, and Morales-Madera did not\n\nobject.    Because drug quantity need only be determined by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence for sentencing purposes, a district\n\ncourt may generally rely on the PSR in making this determination.\n\nUnited States v. Cyr, 337 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2003).        If a\n\ndefendant's objections to the PSR are unsupported, id., or the\n\n\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fdefendant makes no objections, the court is entitled to rely on the\n\nPSR alone.      Morales-Madera's sentence was not clearly erroneous.\n\n     2.    Denial of Downward Adjustment for Minor Role\n\n               Morales-Madera argues that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to consider a two-level downward adjustment for a minor\n\nrole in the conspiracy.           U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2.    Morales-Madera did not\n\nargue for this adjustment at sentencing and did not object to its\n\nomission from the PSR.            \"[I]n [the] criminal sentencing context,\n\narguments not addressed to the trial court at the appropriate time\n\nare deemed to be abandoned.\"          United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,\n\n717 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (collecting cases)).\n\n        Even   if   Morales-Madera     had    preserved     his   objection,   his\n\nargument would fail.          Review of the decision to deny a downward\n\nadjustment for minor role is for clear error.                 United States v.\n\nRosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552, 571 (1st Cir. 1999).                No such error\n\noccurred here.       The district court could reasonably have concluded\n\nthat Morales-Madera was not a minor participant.                     Agent Cases\n\ntestified that Morales-Madera was the right-hand man of Naranjo-\n\nRosa.     This testimony is confirmed by the wiretaps, which show\n\nMorales-Madera discussing the price of 20 kilograms of cocaine,\n\nplanning       to   collect   a     $30,000   debt    for    Gutierrez-Naranjo,\n\ndetermining the price for 625 grams of heroin from the Dominican\n\nRepublic, and making travel arrangements to the Dominican Republic\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fto purchase heroin. These activities could reasonably be viewed as\n\nmore than minor participation.\n\n     3.    Credit for Time Served in Dominican Republic\n\n            Morales-Madera       also   argues      that   the    court    erred   in\n\nfailing to consider a downward departure based on a three-year\n\nsentence   that    he   served    in    the    Dominican      Republic     for   drug\n\ntrafficking offenses from May 1, 1997 until November 29, 2000.                     A\n\ndistrict court's refusal to depart downward is generally not\n\nreviewable    on    appeal,      unless       the   refusal      stemmed    from    a\n\nmisapprehension of its authority under the guidelines.                       United\n\nStates v. Rivera-Rodriguez, 318 F.3d 268, 275 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nHere, Morales-Madera argues that the district court failed to\n\nrecognize its authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0\n\nto credit him for time served.\n\n            Morales-Madera did not request a downward departure on\n\nthis basis at sentencing, but only argued that his sentence should\n\nbe at the lower end of the guidelines range because of his time\n\nserved.    \"Defendant's failure to request a downward departure on\n\nthis ground in the district court forecloses our consideration of\n\nthe issue.\"       United States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n            Even if we were to review Morales-Madera's claim for\n\nplain error, his argument would be unavailing. The parties dispute\n\nwhether the district court had the power to depart downward in this\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fsituation.     Morales-Madera concedes that his sentence in the\n\nDominican    Republic    has   already    been   discharged.    Although    a\n\ndifferent procedure exists for undischarged sentences,9 defendants\n\nwho seek credit for discharged sentences must ordinarily apply to\n\nthe Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3585(b).       See United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. 329, 335\n\n(1992).      Only after exhausting administrative review of this\n\ndetermination may defendants seek judicial review.             United States\n\nv. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 205-06 (1st Cir. 2000), vacated on\n\nother grounds, 532 U.S. 1036 (2001). Morales-Madera argues that he\n\ncan circumvent this requirement by seeking a downward departure\n\nfrom the district court at sentencing.           He relies on Application\n\nNote 7 to U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3, which discusses potential downward\n\ndepartures    for   discharged   sentences.       The   government    argues\n\notherwise, citing cases from other circuits denying district courts\n\nthe authority to depart downward based on time served.            See United\n\nStates v. Luna-Reynoso, 258 F.3d 111, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. McHan, 101 F.3d 1027, 1040 (4th Cir. 1996).                      The\n\ngovernment also notes that Application Note 7 did not come into\n\neffect until November 1, 2002, after Morales-Madera's sentencing on\n\nJanuary 15, 2002.\n\n\n     9\n          The Sentencing Guidelines require sentences to run\nconcurrently if the defendant faces an \"undischarged term of\nimprisonment\" for another offense that is already fully taken into\naccount in sentencing for the instant offense. U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3.\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f            We need not resolve this issue.      Even assuming arguendo\n\nthat the district court had the power to depart downward on this\n\nbasis, Morales-Madera's substantial rights are not affected. He is\n\nnot prejudiced because he can apply to the Bureau of Prisons under\n\n§ 3585(b) to obtain credit for his time served in the Dominican\n\nRepublic.     Thus, no plain error occurred.\n\nE.   Purported Adoption of Co-Defendants' Arguments\n\n            Five   individuals   who   were   originally   indicted   with\n\nMorales-Madera were convicted in a separate trial.          Two of those\n\nfive defendants had their convictions reversed on appeal in Rivera-\n\nRosario, 300 F.3d at 21.      Morales-Madera requests leave to adopt\n\nthe factual and legal arguments raised by those five defendants in\n\ntheir appeal.      We deny his request.\n\n            The English-language issues in this trial are not the\n\nsame as those in Rivera-Rosario and are disposed of in this\n\nopinion.    To the extent Morales-Madera purports to raise other\n\nissues, his cursory attempt at adoption does not tell us what those\n\nissues are.    He has not met his burden of showing that he is in the\n\nsame legal and factual position as the defendants in Rivera-Rosario\n\nwith regard to those issues. Those arguments are therefore waived.\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                  III.\n\n            Morales-Madera's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f",

This case arises in the federal courts of Puerto Rico. These courts often face the difficult task of admitting evidence that originates in the Spanish language while seeking to comply with the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, which requires that court proceedings be conducted in English. In this case, the evidence involved fifty-two recordings of wiretapped conversations in Spanish among members of a drug importation and distribution conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, Gabriel Morales-Madera, was convicted of participating in a massive drug conspiracy. He was sentenced to 250 months imprisonment and six years of supervised release. On appeal, the primary issue raised is that English-language transcripts of the wiretapped conversations were neither marked as exhibits nor admitted in evidence, and that the court reporter did not transcribe and translate the wiretapped conversations into the record as the tapes were being played.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera urges this court to adopt a bright-line rule that where English transcripts of taped conversations conducted in Spanish are not admitted in evidence, there is such harm to the national interest in maintaining English as the language of the courts that any ensuing conviction should be overturned. He reads our opinion in <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2002), to require that result. We reject both his reading of <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> and his proposed bright-line rule. Instead, we evaluate a number of factors, taking into account the nature of the problem at trial, the objections made by the defendant below, the use of Fed.R.App.P. 10(e) to supplement the record for purposes of appellate review, and any prejudice to the defendant. Morales-Madera also argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict and that there were sentencing errors. We reject his challenges to his conviction and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Morales-Madera, we state the facts in the light most favorable to his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment against twenty-four defendants allegedly involved in a drug trafficking organization. Count One charged that from about December 1994 until the time of the indictment, Morales-Madera and twenty-two other individuals conspired to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, and multi-pound quantities of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera was tried alone in a four-day jury trial that started on August 6, 2001. At trial, FBI Special Agent Carlos Cases testified that Federico Naranjo-Rosa and his nephew Carlos Gutierrez-Naranjo operated a drug-trafficking organization. According to Agent Cases's testimony, the organization imported cocaine and heroin from the Dominican Republic and Columbia and distributed marijuana in Puerto Rico. Agent Cases testified that Morales-Madera was Naranjo-Rosa's right-hand man and had the task of collecting drug debts and helping Naranjo-Rosa obtain drugs from the Dominican Republic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government played to the jury recordings of fifty-two tapes of telephone conversations between the conspirators that were intercepted and recorded by the FBI pursuant to a wiretap order. These wiretapped conversations took place in Spanish. The court reporter did not transcribe or translate the contents of the tapes in the record. Instead, the government provided Spanish transcripts of the tapes and English translations of those transcripts to the district court, the jury, and defense counsel at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The jury used the transcripts as aids while the wiretap tapes were played, and returned the transcripts to the government afterwards. The court instructed the jury to \"consider in [their] deliberations what [they] heard on tape, not what the transcript says.\" The transcripts were not marked as exhibits or entered in evidence, and they were not taken into the jury room during deliberations. At trial, defense counsel did not object to the use of the transcripts or to their accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Agent Cases's testimony, most of the wiretaps consisted of conversations using coded language to discuss drug sales and the collection of drug debts. Nine tapes involved wiretapped conversations between Morales-Madera and Naranjo-Rosa in April and May 1997. In one conversation on April 15, Morales-Madera referred in coded language to returning bad drugs in exchange for good drugs. Later that day, Morales-Madera called Naranjo-Rosa to ask how much money he should collect for twenty kilograms of cocaine (\"twenty parts\"). After consulting with Gutierrez-Naranjo, Naranjo-Rosa called Morales-Madera back to tell him in coded language that the price would be $15,000 per kilogram. On April 18, Naranjo-Rosa and Morales-Madera discussed a $30,000 debt owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo. During the conversation, Naranjo-Rosa became upset because Morales-Madera used non-coded language to discuss the debt, and warned Morales-Madera that his phone might be tapped. On April 29, Naranjo-Rosa told Morales-Madera that they had five-eighths of a kilogram, or 625 grams, of heroin (\"five whitewall tires\"), for which the two discussed an appropriate price. The two also discussed the collection of debt for cocaine (\"parts\"). On April 30, Naranjo-Rosa instructed Morales in coded language to call someone who would give him $45,000, and the two discussed cocaine (\"tires\"). In three conversations on May 1 and 2, the two made plans to purchase heroin (\"15 wide whitewall tires\") in the Dominican Republic and discussed in coded language $1,000 that was missing from a $39,000 payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another tape involved a phone call on April 11 from Morales-Madera, who was using Naranjo-Rosa's wiretapped phone, to American Airlines to arrange their flight to the Dominican Republic that day. FBI Agent Cases testified, based on other wiretapped conversations, that the purpose of this trip was to purchase heroin to be imported into Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also played tapes of conversations in which Morales-Madera did not participate. Three tapes involved coded discussions by co-conspirators regarding Morales-Madera's activities. On April 15, Naranjo-Rosa and Gutierrez-Naranjo discussed Morales-Madera's call to Naranjo-Rosa earlier that day, in which Morales-Madera had asked how much money he should collect for twenty kilograms of cocaine. Later that same day, Naranjo-Rosa told Gomez Felix that he would send him money via Morales-Madera. On April 30, Naranjo-Rosa and Gomez-Felix discussed four and one-half eighths of a kilogram of heroin that Naranjo-Rosa and Morales-Madera were supposed to pick up from the Dominican Republic. Approximately thirty other recordings involved coded conversations between co-conspirators about drug importation or distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the wiretapped conversations, the government introduced passports, boarding passes, and testimony from Agent Cases about Morales-Madera's travel to the Dominican Republic. Morales-Madera traveled to the Dominican Republic with Naranjo-Rosa on April 11 and again on April 21. Morales-Madera also took one trip to the Dominican Republic with Naranjo-Rosa's cousin on May 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera testified at trial in his own defense. In his testimony, he admitted that he had sought to collect debts owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo and that he had assumed at the time that those debts were drug-related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 9, 2001, the jury found Morales-Madera guilty of Count One of the indictment. On January 22, 2002, Morales-Madera was sentenced to 250 months imprisonment, plus a supervised release term of six years and a special monetary assessment of $100. Seeking to reverse his conviction and sentence, Morales-Madera filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. English Language Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue involves two statutes: (1) the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, which provides that \"[a]ll pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language,\" and (2) the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b), which requires that \"all proceedings in criminal cases [held] in open court ... shall be recorded verbatim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera's first theory confuses the different statutes and different types of evidence. He argues that the Court Reporter Act required the reporter to transcribe literally and somehow translate into English the wiretap tapes as they were played to the jury. That, in our view, is a misreading of the statute. When the court reporter transcribes the testimony of a witness who testifies in Spanish, the interpreter's English translation is the evidence entered in the record under the Jones Act. <i>United States v. Dejesus Boria,</i> 518 F.2d 368, 370 (1st Cir.1975); <i>Bordas &amp; Co. v. Pizarro,</i> 314 F.2d 291, 292 (1st Cir.1963). The playing of recordings, however, presents a different issue. The conversations on the wiretap tapes are not testimony from witnesses before the court that must be recorded in a verbatim transcript.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Language in some opinions, ours and others, indicates that the Court Reporter Act is violated when the court reporter fails to simultaneously transcribe the contents of recordings heard by the jury. <i>See United States v. Andiarena,</i> 823 F.2d 673, 676 (1st Cir.1987); <i>United States v. McCusker,</i> 936 F.2d 781, 785 (5th Cir.1981). We harbor considerable doubts about this proposition. The Court Reporter Act is not usually understood to require the reporter to record separately the contents of exhibits admitted in evidence. The tapes of the recordings are not testimony but are themselves admitted in evidence as exhibits. <i>See United States v. Young,</i> 105 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Craig,</i> 573 F.2d 455, 480 (7th Cir.1977) (finding \"no merit\" to the argument that there was a violation of the Court Reporter Act because the reporter did not transcribe the recorded conversations). We held in <i>United States v. Rengifo,</i> 789 F.2d 975 (1st Cir.1986), that a transcript of a composite audio recording was not \"testimony\" even when the transcript was read aloud to the jury. <i>Id.</i> at 977, 983. At any rate, this issue need not be resolved. Even among those courts that find an error under the Court Reporter Act based on the failure to transcribe an audio recording, it is agreed that the error is harmless when the recording itself is entered in the record. <i>See Andiarena,</i> 823 F.2d at 676; <i>McCusker,</i> 936 F.2d at 785.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera's next argument is a Jones Act claim that implicates several issues. At the trial level, separate issues arise regarding the submission of English transcripts of Spanish audio recordings to the jury as aids, the proper procedures for ensuring reliable transcription of the taped conversations and reliable translation of those transcripts into English, and the admissibility of English transcripts as evidence. At the appellate level, issues arise regarding compliance at the trial court level with the Jones Act and the Court Reporter Act, the adequacy of the record on which appellate review is based, and the appropriate remedy for non-compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Submitting English Transcripts to the Jury</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an audio recording is in English, the common practice is to play the recording, make a transcript available, mark the transcript as an exhibit, and use it as an aid. Our court, and many others, have approved such use of transcripts as aids to the jury, provided the court makes clear to the jury that the tape rather than the transcript constitutes the best evidence. <i>United States v. Ademaj,</i> 170 F.3d 58, 65 (1st Cir.1999). In ordinary circumstances, the district court does not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to use the transcripts during deliberations. <i>Rengifo,</i> 789 F.2d at 980.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Providing an English-language transcript of wiretap evidence is more than merely useful when the recorded language is not English; for Jones Act purposes, it is necessary. The language of the federal courts is English. Participants, including judges, jurors, and counsel, are entitled to understand the proceedings in English.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Even apart from the mandates of the Jones Act, in Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the primary language of most of the population, there are nevertheless jurors, parties, and counsel whose primary language is English.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the submission of English transcripts was required, assuming the transcripts were translated and transcribed accurately (an issue discussed <i>infra</i>). Unlike in <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> where the \"English translation was ... cast aside\" and the jurors used Spanish transcripts instead, 300 F.3d at 5, the English transcripts here were made available to the jurors and used while the tapes were playing. Furthermore, in this case, counsel made no objection below to the provision of the English transcripts to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Ensuring the Reliability of Translation and of Transcription When Using English Transcripts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before transcripts may be submitted to the jury even as aids, issues must be addressed both about the reliability of the transcription in the original language of the wiretaps and about the accuracy of the translation of those transcripts from the original language to English (here, from Spanish to English). Commonly, the transcripts and the English translations of those transcripts are produced by the government and copies are then given to the defendant. Sound trial management and considerations of fairness caution that the government provide these copies to defense counsel adequately in advance, so that disputes concerning the reliability of the transcription in the original language and of the English translation may be brought to the attention of the district court or resolved by agreement. Counsel, of course, may agree to the accuracy in both senses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court outlined in <i>Rengifo</i> the proper procedure for addressing transcription error:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that it is advisable for the district court to try to obtain a stipulated transcript from the parties before trial or, at least, before a transcript is used. Failing such stipulation, each party should be allowed to introduce its own transcript of the recording provided that it is properly authenticated. When the jury receives two transcripts of the same recording, it should, of course, be instructed that there is a difference of opinion as to the accuracy of the transcripts and that it is up to them to decide which, if any, version to accept. The jurors should also be instructed that they can disregard any portion of the transcript (or transcripts) which they think differs from what they hear on the tape recording. Further limiting instructions will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">789 F.2d at 983. In short, if the defendant believes the transcription of the tape is in error as to what was said, then the dispute should be brought to the attention of the court. Usually, the judge either makes a determination as to the correct transcription after listening to the tape or determines that the dispute is an issue of fact for the jury to decide. This procedure applies to transcription disputes regarding both English and non-English transcripts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of tapes of non-English conversations, however, there is the additional problem of potential <i>translation</i> error. If the parties do not agree that the English transcript submitted is correctly translated, the preferred solution is to obtain agreement from counsel as to an accurate translation. If agreement is not possible, the district court should have the parties present testimony from translators and allow the jury to decide the issue. <i>See</i> Weinstein &amp; Berger, <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> &#167; 901.09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, because Morales-Madera did not object to the accuracy of the translation or the transcription and he makes no claim on appeal that the English transcripts before the jury were inaccurate, no issue of that type is before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Admitting English Transcripts In Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once translation and transcription disputes have been addressed and the transcripts have been submitted to the jury for its use, parties using audio recordings in other languages should ensure that the English transcripts become part of the record by introducing them in evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The English transcripts should be marked and admitted in evidence in addition to the wiretaps themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The issue of jury instructions was not raised either at trial or on appeal and has not been briefed, so it is not before us. Nonetheless, in these circumstances hereafter, an instruction that the jury should consider only what is on the tape and not what is in the English transcript would not be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties frequently, as here, use the transcripts only as aids and fail to admit them in evidence. The usual reason given for not introducing transcripts in evidence is that the wiretap tapes themselves are the best evidence of the conversation, not the transcripts. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Warner,</i> 204 F.3d 799, 801 (8th Cir.2000); Fed.R.Evid. 1002 (\"To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The best evidence rule requires that the tape recordings themselves must be furnished, absent agreement to the contrary, but does not require that English translations of those tapes be excluded from evidence. Non-English recordings present unique problems of compliance with the Jones Act, which requires proceedings to be conducted in English. Accordingly, almost 20 years ago, this court approved the introduction in evidence of English transcripts for wiretaps of Spanish conversations, provided the reliability issues were worked out. <i>Rengifo,</i> 789 F.2d at 983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The Eleventh Circuit reached the same conclusion about the admission in evidence of English transcripts of recorded conversations in Spanish in <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 765 F.2d 1020, 1022-24 (11th Cir.1985), as did the Seventh Circuit in <i>United States v. Jordan,</i> 223 F.3d 676, 688 (7th Cir.2000). This practice of admitting reliable English transcripts in evidence is entirely consistent with the best evidence rule. The rationale behind the best evidence rule &#8212; that \"the [recording itself] is a more reliable, complete and accurate source of information as to its contents and meaning than anyone's description\" of it, <i>Gordon v. United States,</i> 344 U.S. 414, 421, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447 (1953) &#8212; is not undercut when the original recording is played to the jury and the undisputedly accurate English transcript is admitted in evidence. <i>See United States v. Holton,</i> 116 F.3d 1536 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\"concerns addressed by the best evidence rule are not at issue\" in this situation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government concedes that it committed error in failing to enter the English transcripts in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Adequacy of English Language Record for Judicial Review</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, English transcripts are not part of the record, the issue arises of creating a sufficient record to allow judicial review under the Jones Act. This problem exists not only on appellate review but also in the district court's review of the record when deciding Rule 29 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Morales-Madera's argument focuses on the adequacy of appellate review. In simple terms, he argues that because the trial record before this court has no English translation of the many wiretaps played to the jury, this court is unable to review the record to determine if the evidence was sufficient to convict. Absent the wiretaps, he says, the remaining evidence is plainly insufficient. He argues that <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> compels acceptance of his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Morales-Madera's argument that <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> controls this case. This court's opinion in <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> is distinguishable on several grounds. Unlike this case, <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> involved a situation in which the jury was deprived of having English-language transcripts at all. <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> involved a unique sequence of events:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. the government failed to provide English transcripts in advance, thus apparently depriving the defendants of a fair opportunity to raise and resolve issues of reliability as to the 180 tapes that constituted the heart of the government's case;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. there was a dispute raised by the defendants at trial about the accuracy of the English translation of the transcripts of the wiretap tapes;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. that dispute was neither resolved by the trial court by obtaining agreement nor submitted to the jury for resolution;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. as a consequence, and this is a key distinction, the English transcripts were never submitted to the jury at all;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. this problem was not mooted by the court reporter's transcribing the taped conversations as they were played in open court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> or by the parties agreeing on or the jury determining the correct translation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. the government then failed to comply with the procedures of Fed.R.App.P. 10(e), which allow the government to supplement the record;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. thus, the Court of Appeals was placed in the position of resolving a factual dispute as to the English translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">300 F.3d at 5-9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We trust that this sequence of events will not recur and that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico will meet its obligations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because the sequence of events here differs and the jury did have English transcripts, we do not apply <i>Rivera-Rosario's</i> reversible-error rule that \"violations of the English language requirement will constitute reversible error whenever the appellant can demonstrate that the untranslated evidence has the potential to affect the disposition of an issue raised on appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we hold that because Morales-Madera did not raise his Jones Act claim in the trial court in the context of the facts of this case, our review of his claim is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). A plain error is one that \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 732 (quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). In other words, an error is plain if \"a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\" <i>United States v. Young,</i> 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has conceded that a Jones Act error occurred when it failed to introduce the English transcripts in evidence or mark those transcripts as exhibits. On appeal, the government sought to use Fed. R.App. Proc.Rule 10(e) to supplement the record with copies of the English transcripts actually used at trial. The framers of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, who anticipated a generic class of problems involving insufficiency of the record, created the following procedure in Rule 10(e):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or by accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified and forwarded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) on stipulation of the parties;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) by the court of appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least where there is no issue of transcription or translation error and where the jurors and other participants had the English transcripts available to them during the trial, the Rule 10(e) procedures may be used to supplement the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the government's attempt to supplement the record failed to comply with Rule 10(e). The government did not obtain a stipulation from defense counsel or submit the transcripts to the district court for certification. Instead, the government simply filed in the district court what the government said were accurate copies, with a request that they be transmitted to the court of appeals. The clerk of the district court did so within a day, without the trial court ever certifying that the copies submitted were accurate copies of the English transcripts used at trial. The defendant did not object to the trial court or to this court that these were not accurate copies of what had been used at trial, preferring to rely on his argument that the government could not supplement the record at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the defendant may have forfeited and/or waived any objection that the submitted transcripts are not accurate copies of the transcripts before the jury, we are reluctant to review a criminal conviction based on English transcripts that may not be accurate copies of those used at trial. Accordingly, at oral argument, we asked counsel to confer and advise us whether they could agree that the transcripts submitted by the government are accurate copies of those used at trial. We were explicit that the inquiry did not include issues of transcription or translation error; those issues were forfeited at trial and waived in this court. The parties reported back to us that the transcripts are indeed the same as those used at trial. We therefore accept the transcripts as supplementing the record under Rule 10(e). We do, however, urge the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Puerto Rico to be more mindful of the requirements of Rule 10(e) in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the addition of these transcripts, the English-language record is sufficient for appellate review. Fifty-one of the fifty-two wiretaps have been transcribed and translated into English. One wiretap tape (Exhibit No. 4) is beyond our review because the government did not provide the jury with English transcripts of it. Relying on <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> Morales-Madera argues that this tape might contain evidence that undermines confidence in the jury's verdict, even if other evidence on the record would otherwise be sufficient to sustain his conviction. We disagree. In <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> the court was unable to review any of the 180 tapes, 300 F.3d at 12, whereas we are able to review all but one of the 52 tapes here. Moreover, in <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> the 180 tapes constituted the \"gravamen\" of the government's case, whereas there is no indication that Exhibit No. 4 carries such importance in this case. The government does not rely on Exhibit No. 4 to establish Morales-Madera's role in the conspiracy; he is not one of the conversants and there is no indication that he was even mentioned in the conversation. Agent Cases provided a summary of the contents of the tape to the jury in his testimony, and stated only that Naranjo-Rosa and Rivera-Rosario were discussing two planned shipments of 500 kilograms of cocaine and the income they would receive from those shipments. Agent Cases made no mention of Morales-Madera. Morales-Madera has given us no reason why Exhibit No. 4 is likely to subvert the evidence in all the other tapes. We find no plain error on these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera argues that the government's closing arguments were improper. His brief is unclear as to whether those arguments were transcribed. Counsel, after being asked about the issue at oral argument, informed the court that the opening and closing arguments were available for transcription but that Morales-Madera had not requested that the court reporter transcribe them. It is his burden to submit such a request, and by failing to do so, he waived the issue. In any event, the strength of the government's evidence was overwhelming, and any claim of prejudice based on the closing argument would have been an uphill battle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a sufficiency of evidence challenge, we uphold the verdict unless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty. <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 27 (1st Cir.2003). Here, with the wiretap tapes, the evidence was plainly sufficient to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the elements of conspiracy, the government must demonstrate \"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir.1990). To show that the defendant voluntarily participated in the conspiracy, the government must demonstrate that the defendant had the intent to agree to the conspiracy and the intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> 105 F.3d 1492, 1499 (1st Cir.1997). This intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. <i>Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d at 28. But mere association with conspirators or mere knowledge of the conspiracy's activities is not sufficient alone to establish guilt. <i>Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d at 853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence was clearly sufficient to establish the existence of the conspiracy. The jury heard fifty-two wiretapped conversations in which conspirators used what Agent Cases testified was coded language such as \"cars,\" \"whitewall tires,\" and \"parts\" to discuss the importation and distribution of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Cases's testimony and the wiretaps were sufficient to allow a jury to conclude that Morales-Madera had detailed knowledge of the conspiracy's planned importation of heroin from the Dominican Republic and the conspiracy's pricing and debt collection practices for cocaine and heroin. Agent Cases testified that in three wiretapped conversations on April 15, Morales-Madera used coded language to plan the exchange of bad drugs for good drugs, discuss pricing of twenty kilograms of cocaine, and calculate the amount of drug-related debt. Agent Cases also testified that in coded language in five wiretapped conversations from April 29 to May 2, Morales-Madera received instructions from Naranjo-Rosa about the collection of cocaine-related debt, discussed pricing for 625 grams of heroin that had already been purchased, and referred to plans to return spoiled heroin that they had purchased from the Dominican Republic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could also reasonably infer that Morales-Madera voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. Morales-Madera was apparently familiar with the coded references to drugs and prices, and planned to collect debts and import heroin for the conspiracy. Other evidence corroborates this interpretation of the wiretaps. Naranjo-Rosa admitted in one wiretapped conversation that he suspected his phone was tapped and chastised Morales-Madera for failing to speak in code, thus corroborating Agent Cases's testimony that the speakers were using coded language. Morales-Madera's role as a collector of drug debts is also corroborated by his non-coded references in one wiretapped conversation to a $30,000 debt owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo and his testimony at trial that he helped collect debts for Guiterrez-Naranjo despite his belief that those debts were drug-related. Finally, passports and boarding passes indicate that Morales-Madera did in fact travel to the Dominican Republic three times with either Naranjo-Rosa or Naranjo-Rosa's cousin, as described on the wiretaps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Morales-Madera's sufficiency of evidence challenge and affirm his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Sentencing Errors</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera argues that the district court erred in determining that he was responsible for more than 150 kilograms of cocaine. As a result of this determination, Morales-Madera had a base offense level of 38. This offense level, combined with his criminal history category I, resulted in a range of 235 to 293 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced him to 250 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review factual determinations at sentencing for clear error. <i>United States v. Damon,</i> 127 F.3d 139, 141 (1st Cir.1997). Because Morales-Madera did not raise this issue below, our review is also for plain error. We find no such error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, each defendant must be sentenced based on the amount of drugs that he handled, saw, or could reasonably have foreseen to be embraced by the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 162 F.3d 135, 149 (1st Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 &amp; cmt. 2. This determination must be based on a preponderance of evidence. <i>United States v. Nieves,</i> 322 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government relies on trial testimony from Agent Cases about a wiretapped conversation between Naranjo-Rosa and Rivera-Rosario about two planned shipments of 500 kilograms of cocaine. This amount, the government contends, was foreseeable to Morales-Madera because of his close relationship with Naranjo-Rosa. Morales-Madera, on the other hand, argues that Agent Cases's trial testimony is based on a wiretapped conversation for which the jury was not provided an English transcript; he argues that there is no way to determine, on appeal, if Agent Cases's testimony was an accurate reflection of the content of the tapes. We need not resolve this issue because the Pre-Sentence Investigative Report (PSR) is sufficient to support the district court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR found the drug quantity attributable to Morales-Madera to be in excess of 150 kilograms, and Morales-Madera did not object. Because drug quantity need only be determined by a preponderance of the evidence for sentencing purposes, a district court may generally rely on the PSR in making this determination. <i>United States v. Cyr,</i> 337 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2003). If a defendant's objections to the PSR are unsupported, <i>id.,</i> or the defendant makes no objections, the court is entitled to rely on the PSR alone. Morales-Madera's sentence was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Denial of Downward Adjustment for Minor Role</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera argues that the district court erred in failing to consider a two-level downward adjustment for a minor role in the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2. Morales-Madera did not argue for this adjustment at sentencing and did not object to its omission from the PSR. \"[I]n [the] criminal sentencing context, arguments not addressed to the trial court at the appropriate time are deemed to be abandoned.\" <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1st Cir.1992) (citing <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Morales-Madera had preserved his objection, his argument would fail. Review of the decision to deny a downward adjustment for minor role is for clear error. <i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 199 F.3d 552, 571 (1st Cir.1999). No such error occurred here. The district court could reasonably have concluded that Morales-Madera was not a minor participant. Agent Cases testified that Morales-Madera was the right-hand man of Naranjo-Rosa. This testimony is confirmed by the wiretaps, which show Morales-Madera discussing the price of 20 kilograms of cocaine, planning to collect a $30,000 debt for Gutierrez-Naranjo, determining the price for 625 grams of heroin from the Dominican Republic, and making travel arrangements to the Dominican Republic to purchase heroin. These activities could reasonably be viewed as more than minor participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Credit for Time Served in Dominican Republic</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera also argues that the court erred in failing to consider a downward departure based on a three-year sentence that he served in the Dominican Republic for drug trafficking offenses from May 1, 1997 until November 29, 2000. A district court's refusal to depart downward is generally not reviewable on appeal, unless the refusal stemmed from a misapprehension of its authority under the guidelines. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 318 F.3d 268, 275 (1st Cir.2003). Here, Morales-Madera argues that the district court failed to recognize its authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 to credit him for time served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera did not request a downward departure on this basis at sentencing, but only argued that his sentence should be at the lower end of the guidelines range because of his time served. \"Defendant's failure to request a downward departure on this ground in the district court forecloses our consideration of the issue.\" <i>United States v. Field,</i> 39 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to review Morales-Madera's claim for plain error, his argument would be unavailing. The parties dispute whether the district court had the power to depart downward in this situation. Morales-Madera concedes that his sentence in the Dominican Republic has already been discharged. Although a different procedure exists for undischarged sentences,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> defendants who seek credit for discharged sentences must ordinarily apply to the Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3585(b). <i>See United States v. Wilson,</i> 503 U.S. 329, 335, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). Only after exhausting administrative review of this determination may defendants seek judicial review. <i>United States v. Collazo-Aponte,</i> 216 F.3d 163, 205-06 (1st Cir.2000), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 532 U.S. 1036, 121 S.Ct. 1996, 149 L.Ed.2d 1000 (2001). Morales-Madera argues that he can circumvent this requirement by seeking a downward departure from the district court at sentencing. He relies on Application Note 7 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, which discusses potential downward departures for discharged sentences. The government argues otherwise, citing cases from other circuits denying district courts the authority to depart downward based on time served. <i>See United States v. Luna-Reynoso,</i> 258 F.3d 111, 116-17 (2d Cir.2001); <i>United States v. McHan,</i> 101 F.3d 1027, 1040 (4th Cir. 1996). The government also notes that Application Note 7 did not come into effect until November 1, 2002, after Morales-Madera's sentencing on January 15, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this issue. Even assuming arguendo that the district court had the power to depart downward on this basis, Morales-Madera's substantial rights are not affected. He is not prejudiced because he can apply to the Bureau of Prisons under &#167; 3585(b) to obtain credit for his time served in the Dominican Republic. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Purported Adoption of Co-Defendants' Arguments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five individuals who were originally indicted with Morales-Madera were convicted in a separate trial. Two of those five defendants had their convictions reversed on appeal in <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d at 21. Morales-Madera requests leave to adopt the factual and legal arguments raised by those five defendants in their appeal. We deny his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The English-language issues in this trial are not the same as those in <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> and are disposed of in this opinion. To the extent Morales-Madera purports to raise other issues, his cursory attempt at adoption does not tell us what those issues are.

This case arises in the federal courts of Puerto Rico. These courts often face the difficult task of admitting evidence that originates in the Spanish language while seeking to comply with the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, which requires that court proceedings be conducted in English. In this case, the evidence involved fifty-two recordings of wiretapped conversations in Spanish among members of a drug importation and distribution conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, Gabriel Morales-Madera, was convicted of participating in a massive drug conspiracy. He was sentenced to 250 months imprisonment and six years of supervised release. On appeal, the primary issue raised is that English-language transcripts of the wiretapped conversations were neither marked as exhibits nor admitted in evidence, and that the court reporter did not transcribe and translate the wiretapped conversations into the record as the tapes were being played.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera urges this court to adopt a bright-line rule that where English transcripts of taped conversations conducted in Spanish are not admitted in evidence, there is such harm to the national interest in maintaining English as the language of the courts that any ensuing conviction should be overturned. He reads our opinion in <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span> (1st Cir.2002), to require that result. We reject both his reading of <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> and his proposed bright-line rule. Instead, we evaluate a number of factors, taking into account the nature of the problem at trial, the objections made by the defendant below, the use of Fed.R.App.P. 10(e) to supplement the record for purposes of appellate review, and any prejudice to the defendant. Morales-Madera also argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict and that there were sentencing errors. We reject his challenges to his conviction and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Morales-Madera, we state the facts in the light most favorable to his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 10, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment against twenty-four defendants allegedly involved in a drug trafficking organization. Count One charged that from about December 1994 until the time of the indictment, Morales-Madera and twenty-two other individuals conspired to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, and multi-pound quantities of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera was tried alone in a four-day jury trial that started on August 6, 2001. At trial, FBI Special Agent Carlos Cases testified that Federico Naranjo-Rosa and his nephew Carlos Gutierrez-Naranjo operated a drug-trafficking organization. According to Agent Cases's testimony, the organization imported cocaine and heroin from the Dominican Republic and Columbia and distributed marijuana in Puerto Rico. Agent Cases testified that Morales-Madera was Naranjo-Rosa's right-hand man and had the task of collecting drug debts and helping Naranjo-Rosa obtain drugs from the Dominican Republic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government played to the jury recordings of fifty-two tapes of telephone conversations between the conspirators that were intercepted and recorded by the FBI pursuant to a wiretap order. These wiretapped conversations took place in Spanish. The court reporter did not transcribe or translate the contents of the tapes in the record. Instead, the government provided Spanish transcripts of the tapes and English translations of those transcripts to the district court, the jury, and defense counsel at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The jury used the transcripts as aids while the wiretap tapes were played, and returned the transcripts to the government afterwards. The court instructed the jury to \"consider in [their] deliberations what [they] heard on tape, not what the transcript says.\" The transcripts were not marked as exhibits or entered in evidence, and they were not taken into the jury room during deliberations. At trial, defense counsel did not object to the use of the transcripts or to their accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Agent Cases's testimony, most of the wiretaps consisted of conversations using coded language to discuss drug sales and the collection of drug debts. Nine tapes involved wiretapped conversations between Morales-Madera and Naranjo-Rosa in April and May 1997. In one conversation on April 15, Morales-Madera referred in coded language to returning bad drugs in exchange for good drugs. Later that day, Morales-Madera called Naranjo-Rosa to ask how much money he should collect for twenty kilograms of cocaine (\"twenty parts\"). After consulting with Gutierrez-Naranjo, Naranjo-Rosa called Morales-Madera back to tell him in coded language that the price would be $15,000 per kilogram. On April 18, Naranjo-Rosa and Morales-Madera discussed a $30,000 debt owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo. During the conversation, Naranjo-Rosa became upset because Morales-Madera used non-coded language to discuss the debt, and warned Morales-Madera that his phone might be tapped. On April 29, Naranjo-Rosa told Morales-Madera that they had five-eighths of a kilogram, or 625 grams, of heroin (\"five whitewall tires\"), for which the two discussed an appropriate price. The two also discussed the collection of debt for cocaine (\"parts\"). On April 30, Naranjo-Rosa instructed Morales in coded language to call someone who would give him $45,000, and the two discussed cocaine (\"tires\"). In three conversations on May 1 and 2, the two made plans to purchase heroin (\"15 wide whitewall tires\") in the Dominican Republic and discussed in coded language $1,000 that was missing from a $39,000 payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another tape involved a phone call on April 11 from Morales-Madera, who was using Naranjo-Rosa's wiretapped phone, to American Airlines to arrange their flight to the Dominican Republic that day. FBI Agent Cases testified, based on other wiretapped conversations, that the purpose of this trip was to purchase heroin to be imported into Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also played tapes of conversations in which Morales-Madera did not participate. Three tapes involved coded discussions by co-conspirators regarding Morales-Madera's activities. On April 15, Naranjo-Rosa and Gutierrez-Naranjo discussed Morales-Madera's call to Naranjo-Rosa earlier that day, in which Morales-Madera had asked how much money he should collect for twenty kilograms of cocaine. Later that same day, Naranjo-Rosa told Gomez Felix that he would send him money via Morales-Madera. On April 30, Naranjo-Rosa and Gomez-Felix discussed four and one-half eighths of a kilogram of heroin that Naranjo-Rosa and Morales-Madera were supposed to pick up from the Dominican Republic. Approximately thirty other recordings involved coded conversations between co-conspirators about drug importation or distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the wiretapped conversations, the government introduced passports, boarding passes, and testimony from Agent Cases about Morales-Madera's travel to the Dominican Republic. Morales-Madera traveled to the Dominican Republic with Naranjo-Rosa on April 11 and again on April 21. Morales-Madera also took one trip to the Dominican Republic with Naranjo-Rosa's cousin on May 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera testified at trial in his own defense. In his testimony, he admitted that he had sought to collect debts owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo and that he had assumed at the time that those debts were drug-related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 9, 2001, the jury found Morales-Madera guilty of Count One of the indictment. On January 22, 2002, Morales-Madera was sentenced to 250 months imprisonment, plus a supervised release term of six years and a special monetary assessment of $100. Seeking to reverse his conviction and sentence, Morales-Madera filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. English Language Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue involves two statutes: (1) the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, which provides that \"[a]ll pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language,\" and (2) the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b), which requires that \"all proceedings in criminal cases [held] in open court ... shall be recorded verbatim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera's first theory confuses the different statutes and different types of evidence. He argues that the Court Reporter Act required the reporter to transcribe literally and somehow translate into English the wiretap tapes as they were played to the jury. That, in our view, is a misreading of the statute. When the court reporter transcribes the testimony of a witness who testifies in Spanish, the interpreter's English translation is the evidence entered in the record under the Jones Act. <i>United States v. Dejesus Boria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328542\"><a href=\"/opinion/328542/united-states-v-nicolas-dejesus-boria/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 370 (1st Cir.1975); <i>Bordas &amp; Co. v.

The playing of recordings, however, presents a different issue. The conversations on the wiretap tapes are not testimony from witnesses before the court that must be recorded in a verbatim transcript.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Language in some opinions, ours and others, indicates that the Court Reporter Act is violated when the court reporter fails to simultaneously transcribe the contents of recordings heard by the jury. <i>See United States v. Andiarena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491458\"><a href=\"/opinion/491458/united-states-v-oscar-andiarena/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 676 (1st Cir.1987); <i>United States v. McCusker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563678\"><a href=\"/opinion/563678/united-states-v-john-thomas-mccusker/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span>, 785 (5th Cir.1981). We harbor considerable doubts about this proposition. The Court Reporter Act is not usually understood to require the reporter to record separately the contents of exhibits admitted in evidence. The tapes of the recordings are not testimony but are themselves admitted in evidence as exhibits. <i>See United States v. Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197172\"><a href=\"/opinion/197172/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Craig,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354275\"><a href=\"/opinion/354275/united-states-v-robert-craig-frank-p-north-jr-peter-v-pappas-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 480 (7th Cir.1977) (finding \"no merit\" to the argument that there was a violation of the Court Reporter Act because the reporter did not transcribe the recorded conversations). We held in <i>United States v. Rengifo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469367\"><a href=\"/opinion/469367/united-states-v-felix-rengifo/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1986), that a transcript of a composite audio recording was not \"testimony\" even when the transcript was read aloud to the jury. <i>Id.</i> at 977, 983. At any rate, this issue need not be resolved. Even among those courts that find an error under the Court Reporter Act based on the failure to transcribe an audio recording, it is agreed that the error is harmless when the recording itself is entered in the record. <i>See Andiarena,</i> 823 F.2d at 676; <i>McCusker,</i> 936 F.2d at 785.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera's next argument is a Jones Act claim that implicates several issues. At the trial level, separate issues arise regarding the submission of English transcripts of Spanish audio recordings to the jury as aids, the proper procedures for ensuring reliable transcription of the taped conversations and reliable translation of those transcripts into English, and the admissibility of English transcripts as evidence. At the appellate level, issues arise regarding compliance at the trial court level with the Jones Act and the Court Reporter Act, the adequacy of the record on which appellate review is based, and the appropriate remedy for non-compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Submitting English Transcripts to the Jury</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an audio recording is in English, the common practice is to play the recording, make a transcript available, mark the transcript as an exhibit, and use it as an aid. Our court, and many others, have approved such use of transcripts as aids to the jury, provided the court makes clear to the jury that the tape rather than the transcript constitutes the best evidence. <i>United States v. Ademaj,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198352\"><a href=\"/opinion/198352/united-states-v-ademaj/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.1999). In ordinary circumstances, the district court does not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to use the transcripts during deliberations. <i>Rengifo,</i> 789 F.2d at 980.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Providing an English-language transcript of wiretap evidence is more than merely useful when the recorded language is not English; for Jones Act purposes, it is necessary. The language of the federal courts is English. Participants, including judges, jurors, and counsel, are entitled to understand the proceedings in English.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Even apart from the mandates of the Jones Act, in Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the primary language of most of the population, there are nevertheless jurors, parties, and counsel whose primary language is English.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the submission of English transcripts was required, assuming the transcripts were translated and transcribed accurately (an issue discussed <i>infra</i>). Unlike in <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> where the \"English translation was ... cast aside\" and the jurors used Spanish transcripts instead, 300 F.3d at 5, the English transcripts here were made available to the jurors and used while the tapes were playing. Furthermore, in this case, counsel made no objection below to the provision of the English transcripts to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Ensuring the Reliability of Translation and of Transcription When Using English Transcripts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before transcripts may be submitted to the jury even as aids, issues must be addressed both about the reliability of the transcription in the original language of the wiretaps and about the accuracy of the translation of those transcripts from the original language to English (here, from Spanish to English). Commonly, the transcripts and the English translations of those transcripts are produced by the government and copies are then given to the defendant. Sound trial management and considerations of fairness caution that the government provide these copies to defense counsel adequately in advance, so that disputes concerning the reliability of the transcription in the original language and of the English translation may be brought to the attention of the district court or resolved by agreement. Counsel, of course, may agree to the accuracy in both senses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court outlined in <i>Rengifo</i> the proper procedure for addressing transcription error:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that it is advisable for the district court to try to obtain a stipulated transcript from the parties before trial or, at least, before a transcript is used. Failing such stipulation, each party should be allowed to introduce its own transcript of the recording provided that it is properly authenticated. When the jury receives two transcripts of the same recording, it should, of course, be instructed that there is a difference of opinion as to the accuracy of the transcripts and that it is up to them to decide which, if any, version to accept. The jurors should also be instructed that they can disregard any portion of the transcript (or transcripts) which they think differs from what they hear on the tape recording. Further limiting instructions will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">789 F.2d at 983. In short, if the defendant believes the transcription of the tape is in error as to what was said, then the dispute should be brought to the attention of the court. Usually, the judge either makes a determination as to the correct transcription after listening to the tape or determines that the dispute is an issue of fact for the jury to decide. This procedure applies to transcription disputes regarding both English and non-English transcripts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of tapes of non-English conversations, however, there is the additional problem of potential <i>translation</i> error. If the parties do not agree that the English transcript submitted is correctly translated, the preferred solution is to obtain agreement from counsel as to an accurate translation. If agreement is not possible, the district court should have the parties present testimony from translators and allow the jury to decide the issue. <i>See</i> Weinstein &amp; Berger, <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> &#167; 901.09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, because Morales-Madera did not object to the accuracy of the translation or the transcription and he makes no claim on appeal that the English transcripts before the jury were inaccurate, no issue of that type is before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Admitting English Transcripts In Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once translation and transcription disputes have been addressed and the transcripts have been submitted to the jury for its use, parties using audio recordings in other languages should ensure that the English transcripts become part of the record by introducing them in evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The English transcripts should be marked and admitted in evidence in addition to the wiretaps themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The issue of jury instructions was not raised either at trial or on appeal and has not been briefed, so it is not before us. Nonetheless, in these circumstances hereafter, an instruction that the jury should consider only what is on the tape and not what is in the English transcript would not be appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parties frequently, as here, use the transcripts only as aids and fail to admit them in evidence. The usual reason given for not introducing transcripts in evidence is that the wiretap tapes themselves are the best evidence of the conversation, not the transcripts. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Warner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767776\"><a href=\"/opinion/767776/united-states-v-randy-d-warner/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span>, 801 (8th Cir.2000); Fed.R.Evid. 1002 (\"To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The best evidence rule requires that the tape recordings themselves must be furnished, absent agreement to the contrary, but does not require that English translations of those tapes be excluded from evidence. Non-English recordings present unique problems of compliance with the Jones Act, which requires proceedings to be conducted in English. Accordingly, almost 20 years ago, this court approved the introduction in evidence of English transcripts for wiretaps of Spanish conversations, provided the reliability issues were worked out. <i>Rengifo,</i> 789 F.2d at 983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The Eleventh Circuit reached the same conclusion about the admission in evidence of English transcripts of recorded conversations in Spanish in <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454381\"><a href=\"/opinion/454381/united-states-v-leonicio-fernando-cruz-orlando-vincent-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1022-24 (11th Cir.1985), as did the Seventh Circuit in <i>United States v.

This practice of admitting reliable English transcripts in evidence is entirely consistent with the best evidence rule. The rationale behind the best evidence rule &#8212; that \"the [recording itself] is a more reliable, complete and accurate source of information as to its contents and meaning than anyone's description\" of it, <i>Gordon v.

In simple terms, he argues that because the trial record before this court has no English translation of the many wiretaps played to the jury, this court is unable to review the record to determine if the evidence was sufficient to convict. Absent the wiretaps, he says, the remaining evidence is plainly insufficient.

This court's opinion in <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> is distinguishable on several grounds. Unlike this case, <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> involved a situation in which the jury was deprived of having English-language transcripts at all. <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> involved a unique sequence of events:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. the government failed to provide English transcripts in advance, thus apparently depriving the defendants of a fair opportunity to raise and resolve issues of reliability as to the 180 tapes that constituted the heart of the government's case;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. there was a dispute raised by the defendants at trial about the accuracy of the English translation of the transcripts of the wiretap tapes;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. that dispute was neither resolved by the trial court by obtaining agreement nor submitted to the jury for resolution;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. as a consequence, and this is a key distinction, the English transcripts were never submitted to the jury at all;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. this problem was not mooted by the court reporter's transcribing the taped conversations as they were played in open court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> or by the parties agreeing on or the jury determining the correct translation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. the government then failed to comply with the procedures of Fed.R.App.P. 10(e), which allow the government to supplement the record;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. thus, the Court of Appeals was placed in the position of resolving a factual dispute as to the English translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">300 F.3d at 5-9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We trust that this sequence of events will not recur and that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico will meet its obligations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because the sequence of events here differs and the jury did have English transcripts, we do not apply <i>Rivera-Rosario's</i> reversible-error rule that \"violations of the English language requirement will constitute reversible error whenever the appellant can demonstrate that the untranslated evidence has the potential to affect the disposition of an issue raised on appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we hold that because Morales-Madera did not raise his Jones Act claim in the trial court in the context of the facts of this case, our review of his claim is for plain error. <i>See United States v.

On appeal, the government sought to use Fed. R.App. Proc.Rule 10(e) to supplement the record with copies of the English transcripts actually used at trial. The framers of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, who anticipated a generic class of problems involving insufficiency of the record, created the following procedure in Rule 10(e):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or by accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected and a supplemental record may be certified and forwarded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) on stipulation of the parties;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) by the district court before or after the record has been forwarded; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(C) by the court of appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least where there is no issue of transcription or translation error and where the jurors and other participants had the English transcripts available to them during the trial, the Rule 10(e) procedures may be used to supplement the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the government's attempt to supplement the record failed to comply with Rule 10(e). The government did not obtain a stipulation from defense counsel or submit the transcripts to the district court for certification. Instead, the government simply filed in the district court what the government said were accurate copies, with a request that they be transmitted to the court of appeals. The clerk of the district court did so within a day, without the trial court ever certifying that the copies submitted were accurate copies of the English transcripts used at trial. The defendant did not object to the trial court or to this court that these were not accurate copies of what had been used at trial, preferring to rely on his argument that the government could not supplement the record at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the defendant may have forfeited and/or waived any objection that the submitted transcripts are not accurate copies of the transcripts before the jury, we are reluctant to review a criminal conviction based on English transcripts that may not be accurate copies of those used at trial. Accordingly, at oral argument, we asked counsel to confer and advise us whether they could agree that the transcripts submitted by the government are accurate copies of those used at trial. We were explicit that the inquiry did not include issues of transcription or translation error; those issues were forfeited at trial and waived in this court. The parties reported back to us that the transcripts are indeed the same as those used at trial. We therefore accept the transcripts as supplementing the record under Rule 10(e). We do, however, urge the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Puerto Rico to be more mindful of the requirements of Rule 10(e) in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the addition of these transcripts, the English-language record is sufficient for appellate review. Fifty-one of the fifty-two wiretaps have been transcribed and translated into English. One wiretap tape (Exhibit No. 4) is beyond our review because the government did not provide the jury with English transcripts of it. Relying on <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> Morales-Madera argues that this tape might contain evidence that undermines confidence in the jury's verdict, even if other evidence on the record would otherwise be sufficient to sustain his conviction. We disagree. In <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> the court was unable to review any of the 180 tapes, 300 F.3d at 12, whereas we are able to review all but one of the 52 tapes here. Moreover, in <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> the 180 tapes constituted the \"gravamen\" of the government's case, whereas there is no indication that Exhibit No. 4 carries such importance in this case. The government does not rely on Exhibit No. 4 to establish Morales-Madera's role in the conspiracy; he is not one of the conversants and there is no indication that he was even mentioned in the conversation. Agent Cases provided a summary of the contents of the tape to the jury in his testimony, and stated only that Naranjo-Rosa and Rivera-Rosario were discussing two planned shipments of 500 kilograms of cocaine and the income they would receive from those shipments. Agent Cases made no mention of Morales-Madera. Morales-Madera has given us no reason why Exhibit No. 4 is likely to subvert the evidence in all the other tapes. We find no plain error on these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera argues that the government's closing arguments were improper. His brief is unclear as to whether those arguments were transcribed. Counsel, after being asked about the issue at oral argument, informed the court that the opening and closing arguments were available for transcription but that Morales-Madera had not requested that the court reporter transcribe them. It is his burden to submit such a request, and by failing to do so, he waived the issue. In any event, the strength of the government's evidence was overwhelming, and any claim of prejudice based on the closing argument would have been an uphill battle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a sufficiency of evidence challenge, we uphold the verdict unless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, no reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty. <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780802\"><a href=\"/opinion/780802/united-states-v-milton-a-nelson-rodriguez-luis-a-romero-lopez-miguel-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2003). Here, with the wiretap tapes, the evidence was plainly sufficient to convict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the elements of conspiracy, the government must demonstrate \"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Gomez-Pabon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546890\"><a href=\"/opinion/546890/united-states-v-luis-e-gomez-pabon-united-states-v-wilfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span>, 852 (1st Cir.1990). To show that the defendant voluntarily participated in the conspiracy, the government must demonstrate that the defendant had the intent to agree to the conspiracy and the intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197172\"><a href=\"/opinion/197172/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>492, 1499 (1st Cir.1997). This intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. <i>Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d at 28. But mere association with conspirators or mere knowledge of the conspiracy's activities is not sufficient alone to establish guilt. <i>Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d at 853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the evidence was clearly sufficient to establish the existence of the conspiracy. The jury heard fifty-two wiretapped conversations in which conspirators used what Agent Cases testified was coded language such as \"cars,\" \"whitewall tires,\" and \"parts\" to discuss the importation and distribution of drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Cases's testimony and the wiretaps were sufficient to allow a jury to conclude that Morales-Madera had detailed knowledge of the conspiracy's planned importation of heroin from the Dominican Republic and the conspiracy's pricing and debt collection practices for cocaine and heroin. Agent Cases testified that in three wiretapped conversations on April 15, Morales-Madera used coded language to plan the exchange of bad drugs for good drugs, discuss pricing of twenty kilograms of cocaine, and calculate the amount of drug-related debt. Agent Cases also testified that in coded language in five wiretapped conversations from April 29 to May 2, Morales-Madera received instructions from Naranjo-Rosa about the collection of cocaine-related debt, discussed pricing for 625 grams of heroin that had already been purchased, and referred to plans to return spoiled heroin that they had purchased from the Dominican Republic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could also reasonably infer that Morales-Madera voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. Morales-Madera was apparently familiar with the coded references to drugs and prices, and planned to collect debts and import heroin for the conspiracy. Other evidence corroborates this interpretation of the wiretaps. Naranjo-Rosa admitted in one wiretapped conversation that he suspected his phone was tapped and chastised Morales-Madera for failing to speak in code, thus corroborating Agent Cases's testimony that the speakers were using coded language. Morales-Madera's role as a collector of drug debts is also corroborated by his non-coded references in one wiretapped conversation to a $30,000 debt owed to Gutierrez-Naranjo and his testimony at trial that he helped collect debts for Guiterrez-Naranjo despite his belief that those debts were drug-related. Finally, passports and boarding passes indicate that Morales-Madera did in fact travel to the Dominican Republic three times with either Naranjo-Rosa or Naranjo-Rosa's cousin, as described on the wiretaps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Morales-Madera's sufficiency of evidence challenge and affirm his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

As a result of this determination, Morales-Madera had a base offense level of 38. This offense level, combined with his criminal history category I, resulted in a range of 235 to 293 months imprisonment.

This amount, the government contends, was foreseeable to Morales-Madera because of his close relationship with Naranjo-Rosa. Morales-Madera, on the other hand, argues that Agent Cases's trial testimony is based on a wiretapped conversation for which the jury was not provided an English transcript; he argues that there is no way to determine, on appeal, if Agent Cases's testimony was an accurate reflection of the content of the tapes. We need not resolve this issue because the Pre-Sentence Investigative Report (PSR) is sufficient to support the district court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR found the drug quantity attributable to Morales-Madera to be in excess of 150 kilograms, and Morales-Madera did not object. Because drug quantity need only be determined by a preponderance of the evidence for sentencing purposes, a district court may generally rely on the PSR in making this determination. <i>United States v.

If a defendant's objections to the PSR are unsupported, <i>id.,</i> or the defendant makes no objections, the court is entitled to rely on the PSR alone.

Review of the decision to deny a downward adjustment for minor role is for clear error. <i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir.1999). No such error occurred here. The district court could reasonably have concluded that Morales-Madera was not a minor participant. Agent Cases testified that Morales-Madera was the right-hand man of Naranjo-Rosa. This testimony is confirmed by the wiretaps, which show Morales-Madera discussing the price of 20 kilograms of cocaine, planning to collect a $30,000 debt for Gutierrez-Naranjo, determining the price for 625 grams of heroin from the Dominican Republic, and making travel arrangements to the Dominican Republic to purchase heroin. These activities could reasonably be viewed as more than minor participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Credit for Time Served in Dominican Republic</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera also argues that the court erred in failing to consider a downward departure based on a three-year sentence that he served in the Dominican Republic for drug trafficking offenses from May 1, 1997 until November 29, 2000. A district court's refusal to depart downward is generally not reviewable on appeal, unless the refusal stemmed from a misapprehension of its authority under the guidelines. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200334\"><a href=\"/opinion/200334/united-states-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 275 (1st Cir.2003). Here, Morales-Madera argues that the district court failed to recognize its authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 to credit him for time served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Madera did not request a downward departure on this basis at sentencing, but only argued that his sentence should be at the lower end of the guidelines range because of his time served. \"Defendant's failure to request a downward departure on this ground in the district court forecloses our consideration of the issue.\" <i>United States v. Field,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195707\"><a href=\"/opinion/195707/united-states-v-field/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to review Morales-Madera's claim for plain error, his argument would be unavailing. The parties dispute whether the district court had the power to depart downward in this situation. Morales-Madera concedes that his sentence in the Dominican Republic has already been discharged. Although a different procedure exists for undischarged sentences,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> defendants who seek credit for discharged sentences must ordinarily apply to the Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3585(b). <i>See United States v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112711\"><a href=\"/opinion/112711/united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span>, 335, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112711\"><a href=\"/opinion/112711/united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span> (1992). Only after exhausting administrative review of this determination may defendants seek judicial review. <i>United States v. Collazo-Aponte,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></span>, 205-06 (1st Cir.2000), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1996</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span> (2001). Morales-Madera argues that he can circumvent this requirement by seeking a downward departure from the district court at sentencing. He relies on Application Note 7 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, which discusses potential downward departures for discharged sentences. The government argues otherwise, citing cases from other circuits denying district courts the authority to depart downward based on time served. <i>See United States v. Luna-Reynoso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774134\"><a href=\"/opinion/774134/united-states-v-nelson-luna-reynoso-aka-nelson-meraldo-luna-reynoso-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 116-17 (2d Cir.2001); <i>United States v. McHan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730852\"><a href=\"/opinion/730852/united-states-v-charles-william-mchan-united-states-of-america-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1040 (4th Cir. 1996). The government also notes that Application Note 7 did not come into effect until November 1, 2002, after Morales-Madera's sentencing on January 15, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve this issue. Even assuming arguendo that the district court had the power to depart downward on this basis, Morales-Madera's substantial rights are not affected. He is not prejudiced because he can apply to the Bureau of Prisons under &#167; 3585(b) to obtain credit for his time served in the Dominican Republic. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Purported Adoption of Co-Defendants' Arguments</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five individuals who were originally indicted with Morales-Madera were convicted in a separate trial. Two of those five defendants had their convictions reversed on appeal in <i>Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d at 21. Morales-Madera requests leave to adopt the factual and legal arguments raised by those five defendants in their appeal. We deny his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The English-language issues in this trial are not the same as those in <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> and are disposed of in this opinion. To the extent Morales-Madera purports to raise other issues, his cursory attempt at adoption does not tell us what those issues are. He has not met his burden of showing that he is in the same legal and factual position as the defendants in <i>Rivera-Rosario</i> with regard to those issues. Those arguments are therefore waived. <i>United States v.
