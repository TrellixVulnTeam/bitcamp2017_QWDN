R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-1245\n\n                              DANNIE LARCK,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n      JOANNE B.

John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n\n\n\n     Francis M.

Boyd, Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney, Social\nSecurity Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            October 14, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.      Claimant Dannie Larck appeals from a decision\n\nof the district court upholding the Commissioner's denial of\n\ndisability and disability insurance benefits under the Social\n\nSecurity Act.      After carefully reviewing the briefs and record\n\nbelow, we affirm the Commissioner's decision, essentially for the\n\nreasons set out in the Magistrate Judge's October 31, 2003, Report\n\nand Recommendation.      We add only that, contrary to claimant's\n\ncontention, neither Dr. Graf's opinion that claimant's impairment\n\nwas equivalent to a listed impairment, see 20 C.F.R. Part 404,\n\nSubpart P, Appendix 1, nor Dr. Holzaepfel's finding that claimant\n\ncould lift no more than ten pounds are entitled to controlling\n\nweight.   Both of the cited conclusions are plainly inconsistent\n\nwith or unsupported by contemporaneous findings made by the same\n\nand other physicians.     Cf. Prince v. Bowen, 894 F.2d 283, 285-86\n\n(8th Cir. 1990).      The Commissioner's findings are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n     In light of our conclusion, we find it unnecessary to address\n\nthe Commissioner's contention that claimant's amendment of the\n\nalleged onset date limited the period under review to a single day.\n\nWe also decline to address claimant's arguments concerning the\n\nappropriate weight to afford disability determinations of other\n\nagencies, as this argument was not presented to the district court.\n\n\n\n     Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
