Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert G. Dellelo and George Nassar on brief pro se.\n     Stephen G. Dietrick, Deputy General Counsel, and Nancy\nAnkers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n                           August 23, 2007\n\f               Per Curiam.   Pro se appellants Robert Dellelo and\n\n  George Nassar appeal the dismissal of their 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n\n  suit against state administrators and corrections officials.\n\n  After considering the arguments made in the original and\n\n  supplemental briefs,1 we affirm.\n\n               1.   State-Law Haverty Claim\n\n               In their complaint seeking money damages, appellants\n\n  raised   a    pendent   state-law   claim   based   on   Haverty   v.\n\n  Commissioner of Correction, 437 Mass. 737 (2002).        In Haverty,\n\n  an inmate class action suit seeking declaratory and injunctive\n\n  relief, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"SJC\")\n\n  concluded, as a matter of state law, that prison officials must\n\n  comply with certain state regulations before housing inmates\n\n  for nondisciplinary reasons in the East Wing at MCI-Cedar\n\n  Junction.    Id. at 763 (excepting \"brief\" housing assignments).\n\n  The district court dismissed appellant Dellelo's Haverty claim\n\n  for lack of exhaustion.     It dismissed appellant Nassar's claim\n\n  based on a lower state court decision involving a different\n\n  inmate's Haverty claim, which concluded that prison officials\n\n  had qualified immunity from suit.\n\n\n     1\n      When this appeal first came before the court, we ordered the\nappeal stayed pending a decision by the state's highest court on a\npertinent state-law issue. As is indicated below, the state court\nhas recently issued its decision. Therefore, we lifted the stay\norder and directed supplemental briefing addressing that decision.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           Recently,         the       SJC    affirmed       the     lower   court's\n\nqualified immunity ruling.                   It held that prison officials\n\n\"could have reasonably . . . concluded, prior to October 10,\n\n2002, the date the Haverty opinion was issued, that the law did\n\nnot compel their compliance with the [state] regulations.\" See\n\nLongval v. Commissioner of Correction, 448 Mass. 412, 422\n\n(2007). In their supplemental brief, appellants argue that the\n\nSJC erroneously decided the qualified immunity issue. However,\n\n\"the views of the state's highest court with respect to state\n\nlaw are binding on the federal courts.\"                    Wainwright v. Goode,\n\n464 U.S. 78, 84 (1983); see also Largess v. Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt for the State of Massachusetts, 373 F.3d 219, 224 (1st\n\nCir.) (noting that \"the decisions of a state's highest court on\n\nissues    of    state    law       .    .    .     are   generally      treated   as\n\nauthoritative by federal courts\"), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1002\n\n(2004).        Based    on   Longval,         we    affirm     the    dismissal   of\n\nappellants' Haverty claims.\n\n           2.     Remaining Claims\n\n           The district court dismissed the remaining claims on\n\nthe   ground      that       appellants           had    not    exhausted      their\n\nadministrative remedies, as required by federal and state law.\n\nOn appeal, appellants allege only that the district court's\n\ndecision failed to address the numerous contentions they made\n\nin that court on the exhaustion question.                      They identify the\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fdistrict court filing containing their contentions, but fail to\n\ndiscuss any particular argument, let alone establish that it\n\nhad   merit.    Following     our     usual   practice,   we    decline    to\n\nconsider appellants' undeveloped claim.           See Executive Leasing\n\nv. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 48 F.3d 66, 68 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(deeming   an   appellate     claim    \"waived\"   where   the    appellant\n\nprovided no supporting argument but merely referred the court\n\nof appeals to its district court filings).\n\n                  Affirmed.      Appellants'      pending      motions    are\n\ndenied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
