This appeal requires us to apply\n\n§ 253 of the Federal Telecommunications Act (\"TCA\"), 47 U.S.C.\n\n§ 253, which sets limits on the authority of state and local\n\ngovernments     to     regulate   telecommunications           providers.      The\n\nMunicipality     of     Guayanilla      (\"the     Municipality\")     enacted   an\n\nordinance imposing a 5% gross revenue fee on telecommunications\n\nproviders for their use of public rights of                     way1 within the\n\nMunicipality.        Puerto Rico Telephone Company (\"PRTC\") filed suit\n\nagainst   the   Municipality      and    Mayor    Edgardo   Arlequín-Vélez     in\n\nfederal district court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the\n\nordinance is preempted by TCA § 253.               PRTC also argued that the\n\nordinance is preempted by the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act,\n\nLaw No. 213 of September 12, 1996, 27 P.R. Laws Ann. § 265 (\"Law\n\n213\").    The district court granted PRTC's motion for summary\n\njudgment, holding that the ordinance was preempted by § 253.                   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n           On November 1, 2001, Mayor Arlequín-Vélez signed into law\n\nOrdinance No. 14, Series 2001-2002, to \"regulate and establish\n\ncharges for the use and maintenance of the rights of way of public\n\nproperties    and     utilities   of    the     Municipality    of   Guayanilla.\"\n\n\n\n1\n  The typical \"use of public rights of way\" by telecommunications\nproviders includes, for example, the placement of utility poles on\npublic property and the installation of conduits and other\nequipment under public streets.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fOrdinance No. 14 required telecommunications providers to pay a\n\nmonthly fee, consisting of 5% of their gross revenues earned from\n\ndoing business in the Municipality. Under Ordinance No. 14, the 5%\n\nfee   appeared   to   apply   to   \"1)     revenue    from    calls   within    the\n\nMunicipality; 2) revenue from calls originated from a phone within\n\nthe Municipality and received elsewhere; and 3) revenue from calls\n\noriginated elsewhere and received within the Municipality.\"                    P.R.\n\nTel. Co. v. Municipality of Guayanilla, 283 F. Supp. 2d 534, 545\n\n(D.P.R. 2003) (\"P.R. Tel. Co. I\").\n\n           On June 13, 2002, PRTC was served with a letter from the\n\nFinance Director of the Municipality, asking PRTC to pay the amount\n\ndue pursuant to Ordinance No. 14 from November 1, 2001 to date.                  On\n\nAugust 6, 2002, PRTC filed an action in federal district court\n\nagainst   the    Municipality      and    Mayor    Arlequín-Vélez     seeking     a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the ordinance was preempted by TCA § 253.\n\nPRTC also argued that the ordinance was preempted by Law 213, the\n\nstate law counterpart of the TCA.\n\n           The    Municipality      filed      a   motion    to   dismiss   PRTC's\n\ncomplaint, arguing that Ordinance No. 14 was permissible under TCA\n\n§ 253 and Law 213 because the 5% gross revenue fee was \"fair and\n\nreasonable compensation\"2 as a matter of law.                The district court\n\ndenied the motion, stating that the fee may violate § 253 and Law\n\n\n\n2\n  This language refers to § 253(c) of the TCA, discussed in detail\nin Part II.B.2 of this opinion.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f213 and that discovery was necessary because \"the parties are yet\n\nto present any concrete evidence on the fairness of the price being\n\ncharged.\"    P.R. Tel. Co. I, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 545.   The parties\n\nconducted discovery.    PRTC filed a motion for reconsideration of\n\nthe motion to dismiss, arguing that it was entitled to declaratory\n\nrelief.    PRTC also filed a motion for summary judgment.\n\n            During the pendency of the proceedings, the Municipality\n\namended Ordinance No. 14 by enacting Ordinance No. 40.3       Under\n\n\n3\n    Ordinance No. 40 imposes\n\n            a charge of five percent (5%) of the gross\n            income    from    any  invoicing    that   the\n            telecommunications services may have for\n            telephone     calls   originating    in    the\n            Municipality of Guayanilla and which make use\n            of the rights of way of said municipality. . .\n            .\n\n            The income subject to the payment of five\n            percent (5%) . . . shall be calculated from\n            January 1st through December 31st of every\n            year. On or before the April 15th subsequent\n            to said calendar year, the telecommunications\n            providers must submit to the Municipality of\n            Guayanilla an annual certification of its\n            income, which are [sic] subject to the payment\n            of five percent (5%) . . . . Together with\n            said certification, the telecommunications\n            service    providers    shall    submit    the\n            corresponding payment of five percent (5%) . .\n            . .\n\n            The telecommunications service providers shall\n            submit . . . a certification specifying the\n            locations where they make use or physical\n            occupancy exists of the rights of way of the\n            Municipality of Guayanilla.\n\nMunicipality of Guayanilla Ordinance No. 40, Series 2003-2004.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fOrdinance No. 40, the 5% fee on gross revenues applies only to\n\nrevenue from calls originating within the Municipality.                       Ordinance\n\nNo.   40   also     replaces      Ordinance      No.   14's    monthly     reporting\n\nrequirement with an annual reporting requirement and requires\n\ntelecommunications         providers      to     certify      places    within       the\n\nMunicipality where they use or physically occupy rights of way\n\ncontrolled by the Municipality.\n\n            On January 28, 2005, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of PRTC and denied PRTC's motion to reconsider\n\nthe motion to dismiss as moot.            Based on its review of the summary\n\njudgment record, the district court concluded that Ordinance No. 40\n\nviolates § 253(a) because the estimated cost to PRTC under the\n\nordinance,    particularly        if    other    municipalities      adopt     similar\n\nordinances,       \"may   very    well   result    in   making    the    offering     of\n\ntelecommunications         service      prohibitive.\"         P.R.     Tel.    Co.   v.\n\nMunicipality of Guayanilla, 354 F. Supp. 2d 107, 111 (D.P.R. 2005)\n\n(\"P.R. Tel. Co. II\").           The district court then concluded that the\n\nordinance was not saved by the safe harbor provision of § 253(c)\n\nbecause the Municipality did not meet its burden of establishing\n\nthat its chosen fee constituted \"fair and reasonable compensation.\"\n\nId.   at   112.      The   district      court    entered     judgement       declaring\n\nOrdinance No. 40 null and void.                   The Municipality and Mayor\n\nArlequín-Vélez appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f                                            II.\n\n               We review the grant of a summary judgment motion de novo.\n\nHadfield v. McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005).                      Summary\n\njudgment is proper \"if the record, read favorably to the non-moving\n\nparty,    reflects       no   genuine      issues    of   material    fact   and   the\n\nundisputed facts indicate that the movant is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"          Id.\n\n               Appellants raise three main arguments. First, they argue\n\nthat the district court erred in determining that PRTC established\n\nthat Ordinance No. 40 violates TCA § 253(a).                   Second, they argue\n\nthat     the    district      court     improperly        placed   the   burden    of\n\nestablishing the applicability of the \"safe harbor\" provision of\n\n§ 253(c) on the appellants.                Third, they argue that the district\n\ncourt misapplied the appropriate test for determining whether\n\nOrdinance No. 40 is \"fair and reasonable\" under § 253(c).\n\n               In    response,      PRTC    argues    that   the     district   court\n\ncorrectly applied the TCA in concluding that federal law preempted\n\nOrdinance No. 40.         PRTC also argues that, in the alternative, we\n\ncan affirm the judgment based on Law 213's preemption of the\n\nordinance.          See Ingram v. Brink's, Inc., 414 F.3d 222, 228 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (explaining that we may affirm a district court's\n\njudgment on the basis of \"any ground manifest in the record\"\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). We examine that\n\ncontention first.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fA.    Law 213\n\n            Courts have applied different principles in approaching\n\npreemption claims based on both the TCA and state law.                      Citing\n\nconstitutional avoidance concerns, some courts have held that they\n\nshould first decide whether an ordinance is preempted by state law\n\nbefore considering whether it is preempted by the TCA.                   See Qwest\n\nCorp. v. City of Santa Fe, 380 F.3d 1258, 1267 n.7 (10th Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"Because federal preemption of a state or local law is premised on\n\nthe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and because\n\nof the longstanding principle that federal courts should avoid\n\nreaching constitutional questions if there are other grounds upon\n\nwhich a case can be decided, we first decide whether the ordinances\n\nare preempted by [] state law before considering whether they are\n\npreempted    by    §    253.\"   (internal    quotation   marks     and    citation\n\nomitted)); BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. Town of Palm Beach, 252\n\nF.3d 1169, 1176 (11th Cir. 2001) (same); Bell Atl. Md., Inc. v.\n\nPrince George's County, 212 F.3d 863, 866 (4th Cir. 2000) (vacating\n\nand   remanding     case,      concluding    that   district   court     committed\n\nreversible      error    \"by    deciding    the   constitutional    question    of\n\npreemption in advance of considering the state law questions upon\n\nwhich the case might have been disposed of\").\n\n            By contrast, one court has stated that the doctrine of\n\nconstitutional avoidance is inapplicable to questions of federal\n\npreemption.       See N.J. Payphone Ass'n v. Town of W. N.Y., 299 F.3d\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f235, 239 n.2 (3d Cir. 2002).    Thus, as that court explains, it is\n\nappropriate in some circumstances to decide a case based on federal\n\npreemption notwithstanding state law claims:\n\n            [T]he basic question involved in [preemption\n            claims under the Supremacy Clause] is never\n            one   of   interpretation   of   the   Federal\n            Constitution but inevitably one of comparing\n            two statutes.    For this reason, preemption\n            questions are treated as \"statutory\" for\n            purposes of our practice of deciding statutory\n            claims    first     to    avoid    unnecessary\n            constitutional adjudications. . . .\n\n            While principles of federalism and comity are\n            to some extent implicated, we are not\n            convinced that they are better served by\n            ruling on a state law issue intimately\n            concerned with local budgeting and the\n            apportionment of powers between state and\n            local governments than by interpreting a\n            federal statute that was expressly intended by\n            Congress to preempt certain types of local\n            ordinances touching on issues within its power\n            to regulate. Therefore, we see no reason to\n            address the state law issues, which have not\n            been extensively briefed, in preference to the\n            TCA claim that is the focus of this appeal.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n            This case does not require us to adopt definitively\n\neither of these approaches.      Law 213 states that \"departments,\n\nagencies,    public   corporations,   municipalities,   and   political\n\nsubdivisions of the Government of Puerto Rico may charge reasonable\n\nfees for the use of their properties, rights of way and easements\n\npursuant to the regulations of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications\n\nRegulatory Board and the federal laws and regulations applicable.\"\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f27 P.R. Laws Ann. 269g.4   Although the district court observed that\n\n\"the Ordinance might be in contravention of Puerto Rico's own\n\nTelecommunications Act, Law 213,\"      P.R. Tel. Co. II, 354 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 115, the district court aptly explained that the state law at\n\nissue\n\n          was created precisely in response to the\n          [TCA].   As such, it is most reasonable to\n          assume that the allowance of a \"reasonable\n          fee\" in Law 213 was intended to go hand in\n          hand with the equivalent provision in the\n          [TCA].      Under   these  circumstances,   we\n          understand that the analysis to be made of the\n          definition of what is a \"reasonable fee\" or a\n          \"fair   and    reasonable   compensation\"   is\n          identical under both Commonwealth and federal\n          law. Accordingly, and in the absence of any\n          Commonwealth    precedent  interpreting   this\n          particular section of Law 213, we will proceed\n          to resolve this question on the basis of the\n          existing federal case law.\n\nP.R. Tel. Co. I, 283 F. Supp. 2d at 539.       We find this approach\n\nappropriate.   Law 213 appears to permit municipalities to enact\n\nordinances that will be consistent with the TCA.     As the district\n\ncourt reasoned, it therefore makes sense to resolve this case on\n\nthe basis of federal law.     We therefore consider whether the TCA\n\npreempts Ordinance No. 40.5\n\n\n4\n  Neither party cited any Commonwealth case law interpreting the\nterm \"reasonable fees\" in this provision, and the district court\nfound no such precedents. Furthermore, according to the parties,\nthe Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board has not yet\nestablished regulations pursuant to Law 213.\n5\n  For the first time on appeal, PRTC raises another state law\nclaim, arguing that the Municipality had no power under\nCommonwealth law to assess fees for the use of rights of way at the\n\n                                 -9-\n\fB.   Preemption by the TCA\n\n           We have acknowledged, without resolving, the difficult\n\nquestion of whether any section of the TCA provides a private cause\n\nof action.   See Cablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Public Improvement\n\nComm'n, 184 F.3d 88, 99 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"It is not clear . . .\n\nwhether Congress intended FCC preemption to be the sole means of\n\nenforcing § 253(a) and (b), or, if a private cause of action does\n\nexist to enforce either of these subsections, whether the FCC is\n\nintended to have primary jurisdiction\" or \"whether the proper cause\n\nof action for a § 253(c) claim [assuming a private cause of action\n\nexists] is created by § 253(c) itself or arises from some other\n\nsource.\").    Other   circuits   have   addressed   this   issue.   See\n\nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 252 F.3d at 1191 (holding that \"a\n\nprivate cause of action in federal district court exists under §\n\n253 to seek preemption of a state or local statute, ordinance, or\n\nother regulation only when that statute, ordinance, or regulation\n\npurports to address the management of the public rights-of-way,\n\nthereby potentially implicating subsection (c)\"); TCG Detroit v.\n\nCity of Dearborn, 206 F.3d 618, 624 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that\n\n\"§ 253(c) of the Act authorizes a private right of action in\n\n\ntime it enacted Ordinance No. 40, citing our decision in Liberty\nCablevision of P.R., Inc. v. Municipality of Caguas, 417 F.3d 216,\n223 (1st Cir. 2005). The appellants counter by arguing that Law\n213 explicitly gave them the authority to enact the ordinance. In\nany event, this issue was not raised before the district court and\nwe will not consider it on appeal. See P.R. Hosp. Supply, Inc. v.\nBoston Sci. Corp., 426 F.3d 503, 505 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                 -10-\n\ffederal court for telecommunications providers aggrieved by a\n\nmunicipality's allegedly discriminatory or allegedly unfair and\n\nunreasonable rates\").       We do not need to resolve this issue in this\n\ncase, however, because PRTC brought this action to challenge\n\nOrdinance No. 40 under the Supremacy Clause.              See City of Santa Fe,\n\n380 F.3d at 1266 (\"A party may bring a claim under the Supremacy\n\nClause that a local enactment is preempted even if the federal law\n\nat issue does not create a private right of action.\"); see also\n\nWright Elec., Inc. v. Minn. State Bd. of Elec., 322 F.3d 1025, 1028\n\n(8th Cir. 2003); Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Port Authority of New\n\nYork & New Jersey, 817 F.2d 222, 225 (2d Cir. 1987).               We proceed on\n\nthat basis.\n\n          Congress         enacted         the      TCA    to   ensure      that\n\ntelecommunications providers have competitive access to state and\n\nlocal telecommunications markets. See Cablevision of Boston, Inc.,\n\n184 F.3d at 97-98.         At the same time, Congress \"recognized the\n\ncontinuing    need   for   state     and    local    governments    to   regulate\n\ntelecommunications providers on grounds such as consumer protection\n\nand public safety\" and \"to manage and demand compensation for the\n\nuse of their rights of way.\"          Id. at 98.      The provisions of § 253\n\nbalance these interests, providing in relevant part:\n\n          (a) In general\n          No State or local statute or regulation, or\n          other State or local legal requirement, may\n          prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the\n          ability   of   any  entity   to  provide   any\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f          interstate   or   intrastate   telecommunications\n          service.\n\n          (b) State regulatory authority\n          Nothing in this section shall affect the\n          ability   of   a  State   to   impose,  on   a\n          competitively neutral basis and consistent\n          with section 254 of this section, requirements\n          necessary to preserve and advance universal\n          service, protect the public safety and\n          welfare, ensure the continued quality of\n          telecommunications services, and safeguard the\n          rights of consumers.\n\n          (c) State and local government authority\n          Nothing in this section affects the authority\n          of a State or local government to manage the\n          public rights of way or to require fair and\n          reasonable         compensation         from\n          telecommunications     providers,     on    a\n          competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory\n          basis, for use of public rights of way on a\n          nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation\n          required is publicly disclosed by such\n          government.\n\n          (d) Preemption\n          If, after notice and an opportunity for public\n          comment,    the    [Federal     Communications\n          Commission] determines that a State or local\n          government has permitted or imposed any\n          statute, regulation, or legal requirement that\n          violates subsection (a) or (b) of this\n          section, the Commission shall preempt the\n          enforcement of such statute, regulation, or\n          legal requirement to the extent necessary to\n          correct such violation or inconsistency.\n\n47 U.S.C. § 253.   The parties in this case focus on the impact of\n\nsubsection (a), which limits the authority of state and local\n\ngovernments   to   regulate    telecommunications    providers,   and\n\nsubsection (c), a \"safe harbor\" provision that, notwithstanding the\n\nlimits imposed by § 253(a), permits state and local governments to\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fenforce regulations that require fair and reasonable compensation\n\nfor the use of public rights of way.      Specifically, the appellants\n\nargue that the district court erred in concluding that Ordinance\n\nNo. 40 violates § 253(a) and is not saved by the safe harbor of\n\n§ 253(c).    We discuss these two sections of § 253 in turn.\n\n            1.   Section 253(a)\n\n            It   is   well-established    that    §   253(a)    \"authorizes\n\npreemption of state and local laws and regulations expressly or\n\neffectively prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide\n\ntelecommunications services.\"       Nixon v. Mo. Mun. League, 541 U.S.\n\n125, 128 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also City\n\nof Santa Fe, 380 F.3d at 1269 (\"[Section] 253(a) contains a clear\n\nexpression by Congress of an intent to preempt local ordinances\n\nwhich prohibit the provision of telecommunications services.\");\n\nN.J. Payphone Ass'n, 299 F.3d at 242 (\"Section 253 expressly\n\npreempts    state     or   local   statutes,     regulations,    or   other\n\nrequirements that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting market\n\nentry.\").    Thus, under the Supremacy Clause,6 any state or local\n\n\n6\n  The Supremacy Clause states:\n          This Constitution, and the Laws of the United\n          States which shall be made in Pursuance\n          thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall\n          be made, under the Authority of the United\n          States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;\n          and the Judges in every State shall be bound\n          thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws\n          of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\nU.S. Const. art.

See City of Sante Fe, 380 F.3d at 1269.\n\n             The appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that Ordinance No. 40 violates § 253(a).                        First, the\n\nappellants challenge the district court's conclusion that the cost\n\nestimates provided by PRTC are undisputed facts.                    Second, they\n\nargue that, even if the estimates are undisputed, the district\n\ncourt should not have considered them in its § 253(a) analysis\n\nbecause the estimates are based on the speculative premise that all\n\nmunicipalities       throughout       Puerto    Rico     will     adopt    similar\n\nordinances.        Finally, the appellants argue that, even if the\n\nestimates    are    proper    considerations     for    the     district   court's\n\n§   253(a)   analysis,       the    district   court    nonetheless       erred   in\n\nconcluding    that    PRTC    has    demonstrated      that    Ordinance    No.   40\n\nviolates S 253(a).       These arguments are unavailing.\n\n             i.    Cost estimates as undisputed facts\n\n             The district court did not err by considering PRTC's\n\nestimates to be undisputed facts in analyzing the summary judgment\n\nmotion.      Through    deposition      transcripts      and    other     documents\n\nsubmitted with its motion for summary judgment, PRTC presented the\n\nfollowing facts relevant to the § 253(a) analysis, which the\n\nappellants now challenge:           1) PRTC's annual profit from the most\n\nrecent fiscal year was about $70 million; 2) if every municipality\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fin the Commonwealth were to impose ordinances with a 5% fee, the\n\nfees would cost PRTC approximately $60 million a year, ten times\n\nthe $6 million that PRTC currently pays in municipal license taxes;\n\nand 3) the total amount of recurring taxes that PRTC already pays\n\nto municipalities (which includes municipal license taxes, real\n\nproperty     taxes,   and    personal       property     taxes,   but    excludes\n\nconstruction excise taxes) is approximately $58 million annually.\n\nThe    district   court     noted    that    the   \"[d]efendants        have   not\n\ncontroverted PRTC's numbers\" for purposes of summary judgment.\n\n             We agree.      The appellants did not provide evidence of\n\nalternative estimates, challenge PRTC's method of estimating the\n\nimpact of the ordinance fee, or offer an alternative basis for\n\ncalculating    the    financial     effect    of   the   fee.      Instead,    the\n\nappellants merely argue in their briefs that PRTC's estimates are\n\nincorrect, without any evidence to support their claim.                 Thus, the\n\nappellants' arguments amount to conclusory and unsubstantiated\n\ndenials of the facts set forth by PRTC.                   We therefore cannot\n\nconclude that the district court erred in finding PRTC's estimates\n\nto be undisputed.      See Magee v. United States, 121 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (\"Neither party may rely on conclusory allegations or\n\nunsubstantiated denials, but must identify specific facts derived\n\nfrom   the   pleadings,     depositions,      answers     to    interrogatories,\n\nadmissions and affidavits to demonstrate either the existence or\n\nabsence of an issue of fact.\").\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f            ii.     Costs across all municipalities\n\n            PRTC     provides    telecommunications       services     throughout\n\nPuerto Rico.         PRTC does not –- and previously had never been\n\nrequired     to    –-   track    its   gross   revenues      and    profit   on    a\n\nmunicipality-by-municipality basis; indeed, part of its objection\n\nto the ordinance stems from the financial burden that changes to\n\nits accounting and records systems would entail.7                  PRTC does have\n\ninformation on its gross revenues and profit from its services\n\nthroughout Puerto Rico as a whole. Thus, in arguing that Ordinance\n\nNo. 40 violates § 253(a), PRTC relies on its estimates of the\n\naggregate cost to PRTC if all municipalities impose a 5% gross\n\nrevenue fee.\n\n            PRTC advances two arguments to explain why the district\n\ncourt properly considered these estimates as part of its § 253(a)\n\nanalysis.         First, PRTC argues that the estimates reflect the\n\nlegitimate    concern     that    other   municipalities      are    or    will    be\n\nadopting similar gross revenue fee requirements.                   In its brief,\n\nPRTC cites three other municipalities in Puerto Rico that have\n\nalready enacted ordinances that apply similar gross revenue fees to\n\ntelecommunications providers.             The appellants acknowledged this\n\nfact during oral argument.             Given the interconnected nature of\n\nutility    services     across    communities    and   the    strain      that    the\n\n\n7\n  PRTC tracks its revenue based on \"study areas,\" which are not\nbased on municipal boundary lines and do not indicate whether the\nrevenue is generated from outgoing, as opposed to incoming, calls.\n\n                                       -16-\n\fenactment of gross revenue fees in multiple municipalities would\n\nhave   on    PRTC's   provision   of    services,        the   Commonwealth-wide\n\nestimates are relevant to determining how the ordinance affects\n\nPRTC's \"ability . . . to provide any interstate or intrastate\n\ntelecommunications service.\"       47 U.S.C. § 253(a).\n\n             PRTC does not, however, rest its case solely on the\n\nnotion that all other municipalities will follow the Municipality\n\nof Guyanilla's lead by enacting gross revenue fees. It also argues\n\nthat the Commonwealth-wide estimates serve as an indicator of how\n\nOrdinance No. 40 will affect the profitability of PRTC's operations\n\nwithin      the   Municipality    itself.          Extrapolating      from    its\n\nCommonwealth-wide profit margin and the impact that a Commonwealth-\n\nwide 5% gross revenue fee would have on its overall profits (an 86%\n\ndecline), PRTC argues that a similarly significant decline in the\n\nprofitability of its operations within the Municipality would occur\n\nunder Ordinance No. 40 alone.                 Indeed, PRTC argues that the\n\nCommonwealth-wide figures may even underestimate Ordinance No. 40's\n\neffect. As PRTC explains, \"[g]iven that Guayanilla is a relatively\n\nsmall, rural municipality\" and that it generally \"costs more to\n\nprovide services in rural or less heavily populated areas than it\n\ndoes in large urban centers,\" PRTC's \"profit margin on services\n\nthat it sells within the Municipality is likely lower than the\n\ncompany's     overall,    island-wide         margins.         Accordingly,   the\n\ncumulative figures submitted by PRT [i.e., an 86% reduction in\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fprofits] may well understate the impact of the Municipality's 5%\n\nfee on PRT's operations\" in the Municipality.\n\n              Taken in this sense, PRTC's estimates are an appropriate\n\nbasis   for    analysis     in   this    case.     The   estimates,   which   are\n\nuncontroverted, represent the best information readily available to\n\neither party by which to measure the impact of Ordinance No. 40 on\n\nPRTC's operations.         The district court did not err by considering\n\nthem as part of its analysis.\n\n              iii.   Preemption of Ordinance No. 40 by TCA § 253(a)\n\n              Section 253(a) preempts laws that \"may prohibit or have\n\nthe effect of prohibiting\" the provision of telecommunications\n\nservices.      47 U.S.C. § 253(a).              As the Federal Communications\n\nCommission (\"FCC\")8         has explained, \"in determining whether an\n\nordinance      has   the    effect      of   prohibiting    the   provision    of\n\ntelecommunications services, it 'considers whether the ordinance\n\nmaterially inhibits or limits the ability of any competitor or\n\npotential competitor to compete in a fair and balanced legal and\n\nregulatory environment.'\"         TCG N.Y., Inc. v. City of White Plains,\n\n305 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Cal. Payphone Ass'n, 12\n\n\n\n8\n  The FCC enforces certain provisions of the TCA. See 47 U.S.C. §\n253(d) (\"If, after notice and an opportunity for public comment,\nthe [FCC] determines that a State or local government has permitted\nor imposed any statute, regulation, or legal requirement that\nviolates subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the [FCC] shall\npreempt the enforcement of such statute, regulation, or legal\nrequirement to the extent necessary to correct such violation or\ninconsistency.\").\n\n                                         -18-\n\fF.C.C.R. 14191 (1997)). Courts have also noted that \"a prohibition\n\ndoes not need to be complete or 'insurmountable' to run afoul of\n\n§ 253(a).\" Id.; see also City of Sante Fe, 380 F.3d at 1269 (\"[A]\n\nregulation need not erect an absolute barrier to entry in order to\n\nbe found prohibitive.\").           Applying these considerations to the\n\nfacts, we conclude that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40\n\nviolates § 253(a).\n\n              The ordinance imposes a 5% gross revenue fee.                PRTC\n\npresently pays a 0.5% municipal license tax on its gross revenues\n\nfor   doing    business   within    the   Municipality9    and    argues   that\n\nOrdinance No. 40 will significantly increase its costs and reduce\n\nthe profitability of its operations.            While PRTC does not, as we\n\npreviously     noted,   track   its   gross     revenue   and    profits   on   a\n\nmunicipality-by-municipality           basis,      its     Commonwealth-wide\n\ncalculations demonstrate that the imposition of 5% gross revenue\n\nfees across all municipalities would present an additional cost of\n\n$60 million annually -- ten times the $6 million that PRTC already\n\npays in municipal license taxes and more than double the amount\n\nthat PRTC pays to municipalities for a variety of taxes and fees\n\n\n\n9\n  The municipal license tax is applied to revenue attributable to\nthe municipality according to a formula specified in Puerto Rico\nlaw. The formula divides the amount of property owned or leased in\na given municipality by the total amount of property that a company\nowns or leases in Puerto Rico, and multiplies the resulting\npercentage by the company's total gross revenue to determine the\ntax base in a given municipality. The municipality then selects\nthe percentage tax rate.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fcombined.    According to PRTC's calculations, the surge in costs\n\nwould reduce PRTC's annual Commonwealth-wide profit by 86%.\n\n            We agree with PRTC that these figures indicate that\n\nOrdinance No. 40 will negatively affect PRTC's profitability.           The\n\nimpact of a Commonwealth-wide 5% gross revenue fee on PRTC's\n\noverall profitability would be significant, and, as PRTC argues, it\n\nis reasonable to conclude that the effect of Ordinance No. 40 on\n\nthe profitability of its operations within the Municipality would\n\nbe similarly, or perhaps even more, substantial. Moreover, as PRTC\n\nalso notes, the multiple gross revenue fees it faces in other\n\nmunicipalities     further    strain       its   ability     to     provide\n\ntelecommunications services.      Thus, there is no reason to doubt\n\nthat the ordinance's 5% gross revenue fee would constitute a\n\nsubstantial increase in costs for PRTC in a regulatory environment\n\nthat is becoming increasingly costly due to the enactment of gross\n\nrevenue fees by other municipalities.\n\n            The ordinance's certification requirements also present\n\nanother set of costs for PRTC.         PRTC would have to change its\n\naccounting and records procedures to calculate how much of its\n\ngross revenues comes from outgoing calls, originating in the\n\nMunicipality,    using   public   rights    of   way.      PRTC's   current\n\naccounting practices do not differentiate how much income is\n\ngenerated from outgoing calls in the Municipality, as opposed to\n\nincoming calls, or how many of those outgoing calls use the\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fMunicipality's      public     rights    of    way,     as    opposed   to     private\n\neasements.         Some     features    of     PRTC's        services   make       these\n\ncalculations particularly difficult.             For example, PRTC would have\n\nto   devise    a   method    for   determining        what    portion   of     revenue\n\ngenerated from its unlimited local telephone service -- which\n\ncharges a flat fee for outgoing and incoming calls -- would\n\nconstitute revenue from outgoing calls alone.\n\n              Together,     the    ordinance's        gross     revenue      fee     and\n\ncertification requirements place a significant burden on PRTC.                        We\n\nagree with the district court that PRTC has established that\n\nOrdinance No. 40 \"materially inhibits or limits the ability\" of\n\nPRTC \"to compete in a fair and balanced legal and regulatory\n\nenvironment.\"       TCG N.Y., Inc., 305 F.3d at 76 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted); see also City of Sante Fe, 380 F.3d at\n\n1270-71 (concluding that costs imposed by a local ordinance, which\n\n\"would nearly quadruple [the telecommunications provider's] cost of\n\ndoing business,\" were \"sufficient to show that the [ordinance's]\n\nrental provisions are prohibitive because they create a massive\n\nincrease in cost\").         Thus, we affirm the district court's holding\n\nthat Ordinance No. 40 violates § 253(a).                     We must now consider\n\nwhether the ordinance falls under the safe harbor of § 253(c).\n\n              2.   Section 253(c)\n\n              Section 253(c) provides that \"[n]othing in this section\n\naffects the authority of a State or local government to manage the\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fpublic rights-of-way or to require fair and reasonable compensation\n\nfrom telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and\n\nnondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights-of-way on a\n\nnondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation required is publicly\n\ndisclosed by such government.\"        47 U.S.C. § 253(c).         We have\n\nexplained that this subsection \"take[s] the form of [a] savings\n\nclause[],   preserving   certain   state   or   local   laws   that   might\n\notherwise be preempted under § 253(a).\"         Cablevision of Boston,\n\nInc., 184 F.3d at 98.    However, we have noted that § 253(c) could\n\nbe interpreted in two ways:\n\n            One explanation is that Congress intended §\n            253(c) . . . to be a savings clause only.\n            Under this interpretation, § 253(c) could only\n            be used defensively, in the context of a §\n            253(a) challenge; the statute would simply not\n            apply to local regulations that are not\n            competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory\n            but nonetheless do not constitute prohibitions\n            on entry.\n            Alternatively, the exclusion of § 253(c) from\n            § 253(d) [which provides for FCC preemption]\n            might reflect Congress's selection of a forum\n            for § 253(c) claims, limiting jurisdiction to\n            federal or state courts instead of forcing\n            municipalities with limited resources to\n            defend rights-of-way regulations and fee\n            structures before the FCC in Washington, D.C.\n            . . . If this interpretation were correct, it\n            would become necessary to decide whether the\n            proper cause of action for a § 253(c) claim is\n            created by § 253(c) itself or arises from some\n            other source.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fId. at 99 (citations omitted).10       Under the first interpretation of\n\n§ 253(c), a telecommunications provider could not challenge an\n\nordinance or regulation directly on the basis of § 253(c).                 Id.\n\nThe telecommunications provider would have to establish that the\n\nordinance or regulation violates § 253(a), and then the burden\n\nwould shift to the state or local government to establish that the\n\nsafe harbor provision of § 253(c) applies.               Under the second\n\ninterpretation, § 253(c) could operate as an independent source of\n\nclaim   as   well   as    a   safe   harbor    provision.      Id.    If     a\n\ntelecommunications       provider    brought   an   action   challenging    an\n\nordinance directly under § 253(c), it would have the burden of\n\nestablishing that the ordinance violated § 253(c).\n\n\n10\n   The Third Circuit has also noted, without resolving, the\ndifficulties in interpreting § 253(c). See N.J. Payphone Ass'n,\n299 F.3d at 241 (\"Although Sections 253(b) and (c) are framed as\nsavings clauses, Section 253(d) speaks of 'violation' of (b)\nsuggesting that it must impose some sort of substantive limitation\nindependent of (a). This also raises the possibility that Section\n253(c), which is similarly phrased, contains a parallel\nlimitation.\").    The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have come to\ndiffering conclusions on this point. Compare BellSouth Telecomms.,\nInc., 252 F.3d at 1187, 1191 (concluding that \"subsection (a)\ncontains the only substantive limitations on state and local\ngovernment regulation of telecommunications, and that subsections\n(b) and (c) are 'safe harbors,' functioning as affirmative defenses\nto preemption of state or local exercises of authority that would\notherwise violate (a),\" and thus remanding because the district\ncourt considered whether the ordinances \"fell within the parameters\nof (c), but never addressed, in the first instance, whether the\nordinances violated subsection (a)\") with TCG Detroit, 206 F.3d at\n624 (concluding that § 253(c) operates as a separate limitation on\nstate and local governments, \"authoriz[ing] a private right of\naction in federal court for telecommunications providers aggrieved\nby a municipality's allegedly discriminatory or allegedly unfair\nand unreasonable rates\").\n\n                                     -23-\n\f              The    appellants   raise     two     arguments       regarding   the\n\napplication of § 253(c) in this case.                   First, they argue that,\n\ninsofar as PRTC has not established that the ordinance violates\n\n§ 253(a), the district court improperly placed the burden of proof\n\nfor    demonstrating       that   the     fee     was    \"fair     and   reasonable\n\ncompensation\" on the appellants. Second, they argue that, assuming\n\nthey do have the burden of establishing that the ordinance's 5%\n\ngross revenue fee on outgoing calls does fall under the safe harbor\n\nprovision of § 253(c), they have met their burden.                   Both of these\n\narguments are unpersuasive.\n\n              i.    Burden under § 253(c)\n\n              Citing Cablevision of Boston, Inc., the appellants argue\n\nthat, \"[t]o the extent § 253(c) is viewed as                  . . . imposing an\n\nindependent negative restriction on local authorities' choices\n\nregarding the management of their rights-of-way, the burden of\n\nproof to establish that the Municipality's § 253(c) fee is not fair\n\nand reasonable lies with[] PRTC.\"           Thus, the appellants argue that\n\nthe district court erred by placing the burden on them.\n\n              The appellants' argument is predicated on its assertion\n\nthat the district court erred in concluding that the ordinance\n\nviolates § 253(a).         If the appellants were correct on this point,\n\nwe    would   have    to   consider     whether    PRTC    could    challenge   the\n\nordinance as being preempted directly under § 253(c).                     However,\n\nbecause we affirm the district court's holding that PRTC has\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\festablished that Ordinance No. 40 violates § 253(a), we need only\n\nconsider whether the ordinance meets the § 253(c) safe harbor\n\nprovision, not whether § 253(c) would provide an independent basis\n\nfor preemption in this case.    See N.J. Payphone Ass'n, 299 F.3d at\n\n241 (\"[T]here is . . . no need to resolve [the scope of preemption\n\nunder § 253(c)] at this time.   As discussed below, the operation of\n\nSection 253(a) is sufficient to preempt the Ordinance in this case\n\nand it does not fall within the Section 253(c) safe harbor.\").    In\n\nthis context, the question of burden becomes more straightforward.\n\nWe join our sister circuits in holding that, once the party\n\nchallenging a regulation or ordinance establishes that it violates\n\n§ 253(a), the burden is properly on the state or local government\n\nseeking the safe harbor to establish that § 253(c) applies.      See\n\nCity of Santa Fe, 380 F.3d at 1273 n.10; N.J. Payphone Ass'n, 299\n\nF.3d at 240; Bell South Communications, Inc., 252 F.3d at 1192; see\n\nalso In re the Petition of Minnesota, 14 F.C.C.R. 21697, 21704 n.26\n\n(1999) (\"Although the party seeking preemption bears the burden of\n\nproof that there is a violation of section 253(a), the burden of\n\nproving that a statute, regulation, or legal requirement comes\n\nwithin the exemptions found in sections 253(b) and (c) falls on the\n\nparty claiming that exception applies.\").\n\n          ii.   \"Fair and reasonable compensation\" under § 253(c)\n\n          The appellants next argue that they have demonstrated\n\nthat the ordinance's 5% gross revenue fee on outgoing calls does\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\ffall under the safe harbor provision of § 253(c) as securing \"fair\n\nand reasonable compensation.\"            47 U.S.C. § 253(c).      Specifically,\n\nthe appellants point out that the 5% gross revenue fee applies only\n\nto outgoing calls that make use of public rights of way.                         By\n\ncrafting the ordinance in this manner, the appellants argue, the\n\nMunicipality     \"ensures     an    effective    distribution     of    resources,\n\nwhereby it collects compensation depending on the use a provider\n\ngives to the public rights-of-ways.\"\n\n           The TCA does not define the phrase \"fair and reasonable\n\ncompensation\" and the parties disagree over whether a gross revenue\n\nfee can ever satisfy this requirement.             PRTC argues that the term\n\n\"compensation\" indicates that any fees imposed by state or local\n\nlaw must be limited to the recovery of costs (for maintenance and\n\nrepair of public rights of way, such as sidewalk and street repair\n\nnear telephone poles and equipment), which a gross revenue fee is\n\nnot   tailored    to   do.         The   appellants    argue     that    the   term\n\n\"compensation\" encompasses both cost recovery and the notion of\n\n\"rent\" for the use of public rights of way, and thus a gross\n\nrevenue   fee    can   be    appropriate.        The   district    court,      after\n\ncarefully reviewing decisions interpreting the terms \"fair and\n\nreasonable      compensation,\"       concluded    that    \"the    most     favored\n\ninterpretation requires that the fees charged by a municipality be\n\nrelated to the degree of actual use of the public rights-of-way,\n\nbut need not be limited to recoupment of the added costs to the\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fmunicipality resulting from such use.\"      P.R. Tel. Co. I, 283 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 543.\n\n          Among the courts that have reached the issue, we agree\n\nthat most have not found gross revenue fees or other non-cost based\n\nfees to be per se invalid under § 253(c).    See, e.g., Qwest Comms.\n\nInc. v. City of Berkeley, 433 F.3d 1253, 1257 (9th Cir. 2006)\n\n(\"[W]e decline to read [past precedent] to mean that all non-cost\n\nbased fees are automatically preempted, but rather that courts must\n\nconsider the substance of the particular regulation at issue.\");\n\nTCG Detroit, 206 F.3d at 624-25 (employing a \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances test\" to conclude that a gross revenue fee was \"fair\n\nand reasonable compensation\" under § 253(c)); see also City of\n\nSante Fe, 380 F.3d at 1273 (discussing, without deciding, whether\n\nan ordinance's \"compensation scheme\" had to be limited to cost\n\nrecovery under § 253(c)); TCG N.Y., Inc., 305 F.3d at 77-78\n\n(discussing, without deciding, whether a gross revenue fee can\n\nconstitute \"fair and reasonable compensation\" under § 253(c)).\n\n          We   need   not   decide     whether   fees   imposed    on\n\ntelecommunications providers by state and local governments must be\n\nlimited to cost recovery.    We agree with the district court's\n\nreasoning that fees should be, at the very least, related to the\n\nactual use of rights of way and that \"the costs [of maintaining\n\nthose rights of way] are an essential part of the equation.\"      P.R.\n\nTel. Co. II, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 114.   In this case, the appellants\n\n\n                               -27-\n\fhave    presented    no    evidence   of     the     Municipality's    costs   of\n\nmaintaining the public rights of way.                \"Section 253(c) requires\n\ncompensation to be reasonable essentially to prevent monopolistic\n\npricing by towns.         Without access to local government rights-of-\n\nway, provision of telecommunications service using land lines is\n\ngenerally infeasible, creating the danger that local governments\n\nwill exact artificially high rates.\"            TCG N.Y., Inc., 305 F.3d at\n\n79.    As the district court noted in this case, \"[a]bsent evidence\n\nof costs, the Court cannot determine whether the Ordinance results\n\nin fair and reasonable compensation as opposed to monopolistic\n\npricing.\"    P.R. Tel. Co. II, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 113.\n\n            The     appellants   argue       that,     despite   the   lack    of\n\ninformation about the costs of maintaining the public rights of\n\nway, they have nonetheless ensured that the ordinance's fee is\n\n\"fair and reasonable compensation\" because the fee applies only to\n\nrevenue generated from calls that the providers certify are using\n\npublic rights of way.        There are two problems with this argument.\n\nFirst, the appellants concede that the 5% fee applies to the entire\n\nrevenue derived from calls that use any portion of the rights of\n\nway, regardless of whether the call traverses over one inch or 100\n\nfeet of the public rights of way.            Thus, the fee charged does not\n\ndirectly relate to the extent of actual use of public rights of\n\nway.    Second, the appellants provide no rationale for why it is\n\n\"fair and reasonable\" for the Municipality to charge 5%, as opposed\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\fto another percentage, of the revenue generated from these calls.\n\nThe appellants provide no information or estimates regarding the\n\namount of fees that they expect to collect through the ordinance.\n\nAs the district court noted, \"it is evident that the Municipality\n\nintends to delay justifying its Ordinance until after it begins to\n\nreceive payments from the different providers. We refuse to uphold\n\nthe fee on the off chance that it might prove to be fair and\n\nreasonable.\"      P.R. Tel. Co. II, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 114.\n\n            The appellants note that the Sixth Circuit approved a 4%\n\ngross revenue fee after applying a \"totality of the circumstances\"\n\ntest.   TCG Detroit, 206 F.3d at 625.            Under the \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances\"     test,   courts    examine      \"the   extent     of   the   use\n\ncontemplated, the amount other telecommunications providers would\n\nbe willing to pay, and the impact on the profitability of the\n\nbusiness\"    to    determine   whether      a   fee   scheme   is    \"fair     and\n\nreasonable.\"      City of Sante Fe, 380 F.3d at 1272-73 (citing TCG\n\nDetroit, 206 F.3d at 625).          In articulating this test, the Sixth\n\nCircuit approached § 253(c) as providing a direct cause of action\n\nfor a telecommunications provider to challenge a regulation or\n\nordinance, not as a safe harbor provision for a state or local\n\ngovernment to save its regulation or ordinance once preemption\n\nunder § 253(a) had been established.            See TCG Detroit, 206 F.3d at\n\n625.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f               We therefore question the usefulness of the second and\n\nthird factors of the test in an analysis of § 253(c) as a safe\n\nharbor provision following a determination that the regulation or\n\nordinance      in   question       violates    §   253(a).       As   a     safe    harbor\n\nprovision, § 253(c) permits state and local governments to seek\n\n\"fair and reasonable compensation . . . for the use of public\n\nrights-of-way,\" notwithstanding the limitations on their authority\n\nto regulate telecommunications providers as set forth in § 253(a).\n\nTo give effect to this safe harbor provision, it appears that we\n\nmust focus our inquiry (regarding what constitutes \"fair and\n\nreasonable compensation\") on examining the burdens imposed on the\n\nstate or local government through the use of its public rights of\n\nway,     rather       than    the     burdens      of   the     ordinance          on    the\n\ntelecommunications providers, which is the focus of the § 253(a)\n\nanalysis.\n\n               Thus, both the second and third factors in the \"totality\n\nof the circumstances\" test appear to miss the mark in the safe\n\nharbor    context.           The    second    factor    (the    amount      that        other\n\ntelecommunication providers would be willing to pay) tells us more\n\nabout telecommunications providers' resources and their desire to\n\ncomply with local regulations than it does about why the fee chosen\n\nis     \"fair    and     reasonable      compensation\"          for    the     state        or\n\nmunicipality. The third factor (the impact on the profitability of\n\nthe telecommunications provider) seems to conflate the concerns of\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fsubsection (c) with those of subsection (a).                Presumably, if a\n\nmunicipality demonstrated that the fee it imposes reflects the\n\nactual cost to the municipality for the use of its rights of way,\n\nit would be justified in charging this fee regardless of whether\n\nthe   amount   would   render   the    provision     of    telecommunications\n\nservices unprofitable for a telecommunications provider.\n\n           Accordingly,    we   do    not    adopt   the   \"totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances\" test in the context of a § 253(c) safe harbor\n\nanalysis that follows a determination of preemption under § 253(a).\n\nNevertheless, we note that even if we were to apply the three\n\nfactors of the test to this case, Ordinance No. 40 would not fit\n\nwithin § 253(c)'s safe harbor.               First, nothing in the record\n\nindicates that the ordinance accounts for the actual use of public\n\nrights of way.     As previously noted, the 5% fee applies to the\n\nentire revenue derived from all calls that use any portion of the\n\nrights of way, regardless of the actual extent of use.            Second, the\n\nappellants fail to point to any telecommunications providers who\n\nhave been willing to pay the requested fee.                Third, as we have\n\npreviously noted, the fee would represent a significant increase in\n\nPRTC's costs, undermining the profitability of its operations.\n\nThus, even under the test urged by the appellants, the ordinance\n\nfails to satisfy § 253(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f                                 III.\n\n            Congress enacted the TCA in an attempt to maintain \"the\n\nbalance . . . necessary to effectuate its intent to enhance\n\ncompetition and eliminate local monopolies while leaving room for\n\nreasonable regulation of issues of particular state and local\n\nconcern.\"   N.J. Payphone Ass'n, 299 F.3d at 245.   Ordinance No. 40\n\ndisrupts this balance.    While we recognize the difficult task that\n\nmunicipalities face when enacting ordinances that regulate public\n\nrights of way, we conclude that the ordinance in this case is\n\npreempted by § 253(a) of the TCA and is not saved by the safe\n\nharbor provision of § 253(c).    The decision of the district court\n\nis therefore affirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\f",

The Municipality of Guayanilla (\"the Municipality\") enacted an ordinance imposing a 5% gross revenue fee on telecommunications providers for their use of public rights of way<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> within the Municipality.

Based on its review of the summary judgment record, the district court concluded that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a) because the estimated cost to PRTC under the ordinance, particularly if other municipalities adopt similar ordinances, \"may very well result in making the offering of telecommunications service prohibitive.\" <i>P.R.

Brink's, Inc.,</i> 414 F.3d 222, 228 (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that we may affirm a district court's judgment on the basis of \"any ground manifest in the record\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).

Law 213</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have applied different principles in approaching preemption claims based on both the TCA and state law. Citing constitutional avoidance concerns, some courts have held that they should first decide whether an ordinance is preempted by state law before considering whether it is preempted by the TCA. <i>See Qwest Corp. v. City of Santa Fe,</i> 380 F.3d 1258, 1267 n. 7 (10th Cir.2004) (\"Because federal preemption of a state or local law is premised on the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and because of the longstanding principle that federal courts should avoid reaching constitutional questions if there are other grounds upon which a case can be decided, we first decide whether the ordinances are preempted by [] state law before considering whether they are preempted by &#167; 253.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <i>BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. Town of Palm Beach,</i> 252 F.3d 1169, 1176 (11th Cir.2001) (same); <i>Bell Atl. Md., Inc. v. Prince George's County,</i> 212 F.3d 863, 866 (4th Cir.2000) (vacating and remanding case, concluding that district court committed reversible error \"by deciding the constitutional question of preemption in advance of considering the state law questions upon which the case might have been disposed of\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, one court has stated that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is inapplicable to questions of federal preemption. <i>See N.J. Payphone Ass'n v. Town of W. N.Y.,</i> 299 F.3d 235, 239 n. 2 (3d Cir.2002). Thus, as that court explains, it is appropriate in some circumstances to decide a case based on federal preemption notwithstanding state law claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he basic question involved in [preemption claims under the Supremacy Clause] is never one of interpretation of the Federal Constitution but inevitably one of comparing two statutes. For this reason, preemption questions are treated as \"statutory\" for purposes of our practice of deciding statutory claims first to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudications....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While principles of federalism and comity are to some extent implicated, we are not convinced that they are better served by ruling on a state law issue intimately concerned with local budgeting and the apportionment of powers between state and local governments than by interpreting a federal statute that was expressly intended by Congress to preempt certain types of local ordinances touching on issues within its power to regulate. Therefore, we see no reason to address the state law issues, which have not been extensively briefed, in preference to the TCA claim that is the focus of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not require us to adopt definitively either of these approaches. Law 213 states that \"departments, agencies, public corporations, municipalities, and political subdivisions of the Government of Puerto Rico may charge reasonable fees for the use of their properties, rights of way and easements pursuant to the regulations of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board and the federal laws and regulations applicable.\" 27 P.R. Laws Ann. 269g.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Although the district court observed that \"the Ordinance might be in contravention of Puerto Rico's own Telecommunications Act, Law 213,\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co.

As such, it is most reasonable to assume that the allowance of a \"reasonable fee\" in Law 213 was intended to go hand in hand with the equivalent provision in the [TCA]. Under these circumstances, we understand that the analysis to be made of the definition of what is a \"reasonable fee\" or a \"fair and reasonable compensation\" is identical under both Commonwealth and federal law. Accordingly, and in the absence of any Commonwealth precedent interpreting this particular section of Law 213, we will proceed to resolve this question on the basis of the existing federal case law. <i>P.R. Tel. Co. I,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 539. We find this approach appropriate. Law 213 appears to permit municipalities to enact ordinances that will be consistent with the TCA. As the district court reasoned, it therefore makes sense to resolve this case on the basis of federal law. We therefore consider whether the TCA preempts Ordinance No. 40.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Other circuits have addressed this issue. <i>See BellSouth Telecomms., Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d at 1191 (holding that \"a private cause of action in federal district court exists under &#167; 253 to seek preemption of a state or local statute, ordinance, or other regulation only when that statute, ordinance, or regulation purports to address the management of the public rights-of-way, thereby potentially implicating subsection (c)\"); <i>TCG Detroit v. City of Dearborn,</i> 206 F.3d 618, 624 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that \"&#167; 253(c) of the Act authorizes a private right of action in federal court for telecommunications providers aggrieved by a municipality's allegedly discriminatory or allegedly unfair and unreasonable rates\"). We do not need to resolve this issue in this case, however, because PRTC brought this action to challenge Ordinance No. 40 under the Supremacy Clause. <i>See City of Santa Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1266 (\"A party may bring a claim under the Supremacy Clause that a local enactment is preempted even if the federal law at issue does not create a private right of action.\"); <i>see also Wright Elec., Inc. v.

At the same time, Congress \"recognized the continuing need for state and local governments to regulate telecommunications providers on grounds such as consumer protection and public safety\" and \"to manage and demand compensation for the use of their rights of way.\" <i>Id.</i> at 98.

Specifically, the appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a) and is not saved by the safe harbor of &#167; 253(c).

League,</i> 541 U.S. 125, 128, 124 S.Ct. 1555, 158 L.Ed.2d 291 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also City of Santa Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1269 (\"[Section] 253(a) contains a clear expression by Congress of an intent to preempt local ordinances which prohibit the provision of telecommunications services.\"); <i>N.J. Payphone Ass'n,</i> 299 F.3d at 242 (\"Section 253 expressly preempts state or local statutes, regulations, or other requirements that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting market entry.\"). Thus, under the Supremacy Clause,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> any state or local law that is inconsistent with the requirements of &#167; 253(a) will be null and void, unless it falls under one of the safe harbor provisions in &#167; 253. <i>See City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1269.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that the district court erred in finding that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a). First, the appellants challenge the district court's conclusion that the cost estimates provided by PRTC are undisputed facts. Second, they argue that, even if the estimates are undisputed, the district court should not have considered them in its &#167; 253(a) analysis because the estimates are based on the speculative premise that all municipalities throughout Puerto Rico will adopt similar ordinances. Finally, the appellants argue that, even if the estimates are proper considerations for the district court's &#167; 253(a) analysis, the district court nonetheless erred in concluding that PRTC has demonstrated that Ordinance No. 40 violates S 253(a). These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Cost estimates as undisputed facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err by considering PRTC's estimates to be undisputed facts in analyzing the summary judgment motion. Through deposition transcripts and other documents submitted with its motion for summary judgment, PRTC presented the following facts relevant to the &#167; 253(a) analysis, which the appellants now challenge: 1) PRTC's annual profit from the most recent fiscal year was about $70 million; 2) if every municipality in the Commonwealth were to impose ordinances with a 5% fee, the fees would cost PRTC approximately $60 million a year, ten times the $6 million that PRTC currently pays in municipal license taxes; and 3) the total amount of recurring taxes that PRTC already pays to municipalities (which includes municipal license taxes, real property taxes, and personal property taxes, but excludes construction excise taxes) is approximately $58 million annually. The district court noted that the \"[d]efendants have not controverted PRTC's numbers\" for purposes of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. The appellants did not provide evidence of alternative estimates, challenge PRTC's method of estimating the impact of the ordinance fee, or offer an alternative basis for calculating the financial effect of the fee. Instead, the appellants merely argue in their briefs that PRTC's estimates are incorrect, without any evidence to support their claim. Thus, the appellants' arguments amount to conclusory and unsubstantiated denials of the facts set forth by PRTC. We therefore cannot conclude that the district court erred in finding PRTC's estimates to be undisputed. <i>See Magee v. United States,</i> 121 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997) (\"Neither party may rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated denials, but must identify specific facts derived from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits to demonstrate either the existence or absence of an issue of fact.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Costs across all municipalities</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC provides telecommunications services throughout Puerto Rico. PRTC does not &#8212; and previously had never been required to &#8212; track its gross revenues and profit on a municipality-by-municipality basis; indeed, part of its objection to the ordinance stems from the financial burden that changes to its accounting and records systems would entail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> PRTC does have information on its gross revenues and profit from its services throughout Puerto Rico as a whole. Thus, in arguing that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a), PRTC relies on its estimates of the aggregate cost to PRTC if all municipalities impose a 5% gross revenue fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC advances two arguments to explain why the district court properly considered these estimates as part of its &#167; 253(a) analysis. First, PRTC argues that the estimates reflect the legitimate concern that other municipalities are or will be adopting similar gross revenue fee requirements. In its brief, PRTC cites three other municipalities in Puerto Rico that have already enacted ordinances that apply similar gross revenue fees to telecommunications providers. The appellants acknowledged this fact during oral argument. Given the interconnected nature of utility services across communities and the strain that the enactment of gross revenue fees in multiple municipalities would have on PRTC's provision of services, the Commonwealth-wide estimates are relevant to determining how the ordinance affects PRTC's \"ability ... to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 253(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC does not, however, rest its case solely on the notion that all other municipalities will follow the Municipality of Guayanilla's lead by enacting gross revenue fees. It also argues that the Commonwealth-wide estimates serve as an indicator of how Ordinance No. 40 will affect the profitability of PRTC's operations within the Municipality itself. Extrapolating from its Commonwealth-wide profit margin and the impact that a Commonwealth-wide 5% gross revenue fee would have on its overall profits (an 86% decline), PRTC argues that a similarly significant decline in the profitability of its operations within the Municipality would occur under Ordinance No. 40 alone. Indeed, PRTC argues that the Commonwealth-wide figures may even underestimate Ordinance No. 40's effect. As PRTC explains, \"[g]iven that Guayanilla is a relatively small, rural municipality\" and that it generally \"costs more to provide services in rural or less heavily populated areas than it does in large urban centers,\" PRTC's \"profit margin on services that it sells within the Municipality is likely <i>lower</i> than the company's overall, island-wide margins. Accordingly, the cumulative figures submitted by PRT [i.e., an 86% reduction in profits] may well <i>understate</i> the impact of the Municipality's 5% fee on PRT's operations\" in the Municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in this sense, PRTC's estimates are an appropriate basis for analysis in this case. The estimates, which are uncontroverted, represent the best information readily available to either party by which to measure the impact of Ordinance No. 40 on PRTC's operations. The district court did not err by considering them as part of its analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Preemption of Ordinance No. 40 by TCA &#167; 253(a)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 253(a) preempts laws that \"may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting\" the provision of telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 253(a). As the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> has explained, \"in determining whether an ordinance has the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services, it `considers whether the ordinance materially inhibits or limits the ability of any competitor or potential competitor to compete in a fair and balanced legal and regulatory environment.'\" <i>TCG N.Y., Inc. v. City of White Plains,</i> 305 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Cal. Payphone Ass'n,</i> 12 F.C.C.R. 14191 (1997)). Courts have also noted that \"a prohibition does not need to be complete or `insurmountable' to run afoul of &#167; 253(a).\" <i>Id.; see also City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1269 (\"[A] regulation need not erect an absolute barrier to entry in order to be found prohibitive.\"). Applying these considerations to the facts, we conclude that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance imposes a 5% gross revenue fee. PRTC presently pays a 0.5% municipal license tax on its gross revenues for doing business within the Municipality<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and argues that Ordinance No. 40 will significantly increase its costs and reduce the profitability of its operations. While PRTC does not, as we previously noted, track its gross revenue and profits on a municipality-by-municipality basis, its Commonwealth-wide calculations demonstrate that the imposition of 5% gross revenue fees across all municipalities would present an additional cost of $60 million annually &#8212; ten times the $6 million that PRTC already pays in municipal license taxes and more than double the amount that PRTC pays to municipalities for a variety of taxes and fees combined. According to PRTC's calculations, the surge in costs would reduce PRTC's annual Commonwealth-wide profit by 86%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with PRTC that these figures indicate that Ordinance No. 40 will negatively affect PRTC's profitability. The impact of a Commonwealth-wide 5% gross revenue fee on PRTC's overall profitability would be significant, and, as PRTC argues, it is reasonable to conclude that the effect of Ordinance No. 40 on the profitability of its operations within the Municipality would be similarly, or perhaps even more, substantial. Moreover, as PRTC also notes, the multiple gross revenue fees it faces in other municipalities further strain its ability to provide telecommunications services. Thus, there is no reason to doubt that the ordinance's 5% gross revenue fee would constitute a substantial increase in costs for PRTC in a regulatory environment that is becoming increasingly costly due to the enactment of gross revenue fees by other municipalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance's certification requirements also present another set of costs for PRTC. PRTC would have to change its accounting and records procedures to calculate how much of its gross revenues comes from outgoing calls, originating in the Municipality, using public rights of way. PRTC's current accounting practices do not differentiate how much income is generated from outgoing calls in the Municipality, as opposed to incoming calls, or how many of those outgoing calls use the Municipality's public rights of way, as opposed to private easements. Some features of PRTC's services make these calculations particularly difficult. For example, PRTC would have to devise a method for determining what portion of revenue generated from its unlimited local telephone service &#8212; which charges a flat fee for outgoing and incoming calls &#8212; would constitute revenue from outgoing calls alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Together, the ordinance's gross revenue fee and certification requirements place a significant burden on PRTC. We agree with the district court that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40 \"materially inhibits or limits the ability\" of PRTC \"to compete in a fair and balanced legal and regulatory environment.\" <i>TCG N.Y., Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 76 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>see also City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1270-71 (concluding that costs imposed by a local ordinance, which \"would nearly quadruple [the telecommunications provider's] cost of doing business,\" were \"sufficient to show that the [ordinance's] rental provisions are prohibitive because they create a massive increase in cost\"). Thus, we affirm the district court's holding that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a). We must now consider whether the ordinance falls under the safe harbor of &#167; 253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Section 253(c)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 253(c) provides that \"[n]othing in this section affects the authority of a State or local government to manage the public rights-of-way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 253(c).

Second, they argue that, assuming they do have the burden of establishing that the ordinance's 5% gross revenue fee on outgoing calls does fall under the safe harbor provision of &#167; 253(c), they have met their burden.

If the appellants were correct on this point, we would have to consider whether PRTC could challenge the ordinance as being preempted directly under &#167; 253(c). However, because we affirm the district court's holding that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a), we need only consider whether the ordinance meets the &#167; 253(c) safe harbor provision, not whether &#167; 253(c) would provide an independent basis for preemption in this case. <i>See N.J. Payphone Ass'n,</i> 299 F.3d at 241 (\"[T]here is ... no need to resolve [the scope of preemption under &#167; 253(c)] at this time. As discussed below, the operation of Section 253(a) is sufficient to preempt the Ordinance in this case and it does not fall within the Section 253(c) safe harbor.\"). In this context, the question of burden becomes more straightforward. We join our sister circuits in holding that, once the party challenging a regulation or ordinance establishes that it violates &#167; 253(a), the burden is properly on the state or local government seeking the safe harbor to establish that &#167; 253(c) applies. <i>See City of Santa Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1273 n. 10; <i>N.J.

Specifically, the appellants point out that the 5% gross revenue fee applies only to outgoing calls that make use of public rights of way. By crafting the ordinance in this manner, the appellants argue, the Municipality \"ensures an effective distribution of resources, whereby it collects compensation depending on the use a provider gives to the public rights-of-ways.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TCA does not define the phrase \"fair and reasonable compensation\" and the parties disagree over whether a gross revenue fee can ever satisfy this requirement. PRTC argues that the term \"compensation\" indicates that any fees imposed by state or local law must be limited to the recovery of costs (for maintenance and repair of public rights of way, such as sidewalk and street repair near telephone poles and equipment), which a gross revenue fee is not tailored to do. The appellants argue that the term \"compensation\" encompasses both cost recovery and the notion of \"rent\" for the use of public rights of way, and thus a gross revenue fee can be appropriate. The district court, after carefully reviewing decisions interpreting the terms \"fair and reasonable compensation,\" concluded that \"the most favored interpretation requires that the fees charged by a municipality be related to the degree of actual use of the public rights-of-way, but need not be limited to recoupment of the added costs to the municipality resulting from such use.\" <i>P.R.

Inc. v. City of Berkeley,</i> 433 F.3d 1253, 1257 (9th Cir. 2006) (\"[W]e decline to read [past precedent] to mean that all non-cost based fees are automatically preempted, but rather that courts must consider the substance of the particular regulation at issue.\"); <i>TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 624-25 (employing a \"totality of the circumstances test\" to conclude that a gross revenue fee was \"fair and reasonable compensation\" under &#167; 253(c)); <i>see also City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1273 (discussing, without deciding, whether an ordinance's \"compensation scheme\" had to be limited to cost recovery under &#167; 253(c)); <i>TCG N.Y., Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 77-78 (discussing, without deciding, whether a gross revenue fee can constitute \"fair and reasonable compensation\" under &#167; 253(c)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether fees imposed on telecommunications providers by state and local governments must be <i>limited</i> to cost recovery. We agree with the district court's reasoning that fees should be, at the very least, <i>related</i> to the actual use of rights of way and that \"the costs [of maintaining those rights of way] are an essential part of the equation.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. II,</i> 354 F.Supp.2d at 114. In this case, the appellants have presented no evidence of the Municipality's costs of maintaining the public rights of way. \"Section 253(c) requires compensation to be reasonable essentially to prevent monopolistic pricing by towns. Without access to local government rights-of-way, provision of telecommunications service using land lines is generally infeasible, creating the danger that local governments will exact artificially high rates.\" <i>TCG N.Y., Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 79. As the district court noted in this case, \"[a]bsent evidence of costs, the Court cannot determine whether the Ordinance results in fair and reasonable compensation as opposed to monopolistic pricing.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. II,</i> 354 F.Supp.2d at 113.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that, despite the lack of information about the costs of maintaining the public rights of way, they have nonetheless ensured that the ordinance's fee is \"fair and reasonable compensation\" because the fee applies only to revenue generated from calls that the providers certify are using public rights of way. There are two problems with this argument. First, the appellants concede that the 5% fee applies to the entire revenue derived from calls that use <i>any</i> portion of the rights of way, regardless of whether the call traverses over one inch or 100 feet of the public rights of way. Thus, the fee charged does not directly relate to the extent of actual use of public rights of way. Second, the appellants provide no rationale for why it is \"fair and reasonable\" for the Municipality to charge 5%, as opposed to another percentage, of the revenue generated from these calls. The appellants provide no information or estimates regarding the amount of fees that they expect to collect through the ordinance. As the district court noted, \"it is evident that the Municipality intends to delay justifying its Ordinance until after it begins to receive payments from the different providers. We refuse to uphold the fee on the off chance that it might prove to be fair and reasonable.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. II,</i> 354 F.Supp.2d at 114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants note that the Sixth Circuit approved a 4% gross revenue fee after applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test. <i>TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 625. Under the \"totality of the circumstances\" test, courts examine \"the extent of the use contemplated, the amount other telecommunications providers would be willing to pay, and the impact on the profitability of the business\" to determine whether a fee scheme is \"fair and reasonable.\" <i>City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1272-73 (citing <i>TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 625). In articulating this test, the Sixth Circuit approached &#167; 253(c) as providing a direct cause of action for a telecommunications provider to challenge a regulation or ordinance, not as a safe harbor provision for a state or local government to save its regulation or ordinance once preemption under &#167; 253(a) had been established. <i>See TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 625.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore question the usefulness of the second and third factors of the test in an analysis of &#167; 253(c) as a safe harbor provision following a determination that the regulation or ordinance in question violates &#167; 253(a). As a safe harbor provision, &#167; 253(c) permits state and local governments to seek \"fair and reasonable compensation ... for the use of public rights-of-way,\" notwithstanding the limitations on their authority to regulate telecommunications providers as set forth in &#167; 253(a). To give effect to this safe harbor provision, it appears that we must focus our inquiry (regarding what constitutes \"fair and reasonable compensation\") on examining the burdens imposed on the state or local government through the use of its public rights of way, rather than the burdens of the ordinance on the telecommunications providers, which is the focus of the &#167; 253(a) analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, both the second and third factors in the \"totality of the circumstances\" test appear to miss the mark in the safe harbor context. The second factor (the amount that other telecommunication providers would be willing to pay) tells us more about telecommunications providers' resources and their desire to comply with local regulations than it does about why the fee chosen is \"fair and reasonable compensation\" for the state or municipality. The third factor (the impact on the profitability of the telecommunications provider) seems to conflate the concerns of subsection (c) with those of subsection (a). Presumably, if a municipality demonstrated that the fee it imposes reflects the actual cost to the municipality for the use of its rights of way, it would be justified in charging this fee regardless of whether the amount would render the provision of telecommunications services unprofitable for a telecommunications provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we do not adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test in the context of a &#167; 253(c) safe harbor analysis that follows a determination of preemption under &#167; 253(a). Nevertheless, we note that even if we were to apply the three factors of the test to this case, Ordinance No. 40 would not fit within &#167; 253(c)'s safe harbor. First, nothing in the record indicates that the ordinance accounts for the actual use of public rights of way. As previously noted, the 5% fee applies to the entire revenue derived from all calls that use any portion of the rights of way, regardless of the actual extent of use. Second, the appellants fail to point to any telecommunications providers who have been willing to pay the requested fee. Third, as we have previously noted, the fee would represent a significant increase in PRTC's costs, undermining the profitability of its operations. Thus, even under the test urged by the appellants, the ordinance fails to satisfy &#167; 253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the TCA in an attempt to maintain \"the balance ... necessary to effectuate its intent to enhance competition and eliminate local monopolies while leaving room for reasonable regulation of issues of particular state and local concern.\" <i>N.J. Payphone Ass'n,</i> 299 F.3d at 245. Ordinance No. 40 disrupts this balance. While we recognize the difficult task that municipalities face when enacting ordinances that regulate public rights of way, we conclude that the ordinance in this case is preempted by &#167; 253(a) of the TCA and is not saved by the safe harbor provision of &#167; 253(c).

PRTC also argued that the ordinance was preempted by Law 213, the state law counterpart of the TCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality filed a motion to dismiss PRTC's complaint, arguing that Ordinance No. 14 was permissible under TCA &#167; 253 and Law 213 because the 5% gross revenue fee was \"fair and reasonable compensation\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as a matter of law. The district court denied the motion, stating that the fee may violate &#167; 253 and Law 213 and that discovery was necessary because \"the parties are yet to present any concrete evidence on the fairness of the price being charged.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. I,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 545. The parties conducted discovery. PRTC filed a motion for reconsideration of the motion to dismiss, arguing that it was entitled to declaratory relief. PRTC also filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the pendency of the proceedings, the Municipality amended Ordinance No. 14 by enacting Ordinance No. 40.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Under Ordinance No. 40, the 5% fee on gross revenues applies only to revenue from calls originating within the Municipality. Ordinance No. 40 also replaces Ordinance No. 14's monthly reporting requirement with an annual reporting requirement and requires telecommunications providers to certify places within the Municipality where they use or physically occupy rights of way controlled by the Municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 2005, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of PRTC and denied PRTC's motion to reconsider the motion to dismiss as moot. Based on its review of the summary judgment record, the district court concluded that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a) because the estimated cost to PRTC under the ordinance, particularly if other municipalities adopt similar ordinances, \"may very well result in making the offering of telecommunications service prohibitive.\" <i>P.R.

The district court then concluded that the ordinance was not saved by the safe harbor provision of &#167; 253(c) because the Municipality did not meet its burden of establishing that its chosen fee constituted \"fair and reasonable compensation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 112.

PRTC also argues that, in the alternative, we can affirm the judgment based on Law 213's preemption of the ordinance. <i>See Ingram v.

Therefore, we see no reason to address the state law issues, which have not been extensively briefed, in preference to the TCA claim that is the focus of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not require us to adopt definitively either of these approaches. Law 213 states that \"departments, agencies, public corporations, municipalities, and political subdivisions of the Government of Puerto Rico may charge reasonable fees for the use of their properties, rights of way and easements pursuant to the regulations of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board and the federal laws and regulations applicable.\" 27 P.R. Laws Ann. 269g.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Although the district court observed that \"the Ordinance might be in contravention of Puerto Rico's own Telecommunications Act, Law 213,\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co.

As such, it is most reasonable to assume that the allowance of a \"reasonable fee\" in Law 213 was intended to go hand in hand with the equivalent provision in the [TCA]. Under these circumstances, we understand that the analysis to be made of the definition of what is a \"reasonable fee\" or a \"fair and reasonable compensation\" is identical under both Commonwealth and federal law. Accordingly, and in the absence of any Commonwealth precedent interpreting this particular section of Law 213, we will proceed to resolve this question on the basis of the existing federal case law. <i>P.R. Tel. Co. I,</i> 283 F.Supp.2d at 539. We find this approach appropriate. Law 213 appears to permit municipalities to enact ordinances that will be consistent with the TCA. As the district court reasoned, it therefore makes sense to resolve this case on the basis of federal law. We therefore consider whether the TCA preempts Ordinance No. 40.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Other circuits have addressed this issue. <i>See BellSouth Telecomms., Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d at 1191 (holding that \"a private cause of action in federal district court exists under &#167; 253 to seek preemption of a state or local statute, ordinance, or other regulation only when that statute, ordinance, or regulation purports to address the management of the public rights-of-way, thereby potentially implicating subsection (c)\"); <i>TCG Detroit v.

Second, they argue that, even if the estimates are undisputed, the district court should not have considered them in its &#167; 253(a) analysis because the estimates are based on the speculative premise that all municipalities throughout Puerto Rico will adopt similar ordinances. Finally, the appellants argue that, even if the estimates are proper considerations for the district court's &#167; 253(a) analysis, the district court nonetheless erred in concluding that PRTC has demonstrated that Ordinance No. 40 violates S 253(a).

Through deposition transcripts and other documents submitted with its motion for summary judgment, PRTC presented the following facts relevant to the &#167; 253(a) analysis, which the appellants now challenge: 1) PRTC's annual profit from the most recent fiscal year was about $70 million; 2) if every municipality in the Commonwealth were to impose ordinances with a 5% fee, the fees would cost PRTC approximately $60 million a year, ten times the $6 million that PRTC currently pays in municipal license taxes; and 3) the total amount of recurring taxes that PRTC already pays to municipalities (which includes municipal license taxes, real property taxes, and personal property taxes, but excludes construction excise taxes) is approximately $58 million annually. The district court noted that the \"[d]efendants have not controverted PRTC's numbers\" for purposes of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. The appellants did not provide evidence of alternative estimates, challenge PRTC's method of estimating the impact of the ordinance fee, or offer an alternative basis for calculating the financial effect of the fee. Instead, the appellants merely argue in their briefs that PRTC's estimates are incorrect, without any evidence to support their claim. Thus, the appellants' arguments amount to conclusory and unsubstantiated denials of the facts set forth by PRTC. We therefore cannot conclude that the district court erred in finding PRTC's estimates to be undisputed. <i>See Magee v.

PRTC does not &#8212; and previously had never been required to &#8212; track its gross revenues and profit on a municipality-by-municipality basis; indeed, part of its objection to the ordinance stems from the financial burden that changes to its accounting and records systems would entail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> PRTC does have information on its gross revenues and profit from its services throughout Puerto Rico as a whole. Thus, in arguing that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a), PRTC relies on its estimates of the aggregate cost to PRTC if all municipalities impose a 5% gross revenue fee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC advances two arguments to explain why the district court properly considered these estimates as part of its &#167; 253(a) analysis. First, PRTC argues that the estimates reflect the legitimate concern that other municipalities are or will be adopting similar gross revenue fee requirements. In its brief, PRTC cites three other municipalities in Puerto Rico that have already enacted ordinances that apply similar gross revenue fees to telecommunications providers. The appellants acknowledged this fact during oral argument. Given the interconnected nature of utility services across communities and the strain that the enactment of gross revenue fees in multiple municipalities would have on PRTC's provision of services, the Commonwealth-wide estimates are relevant to determining how the ordinance affects PRTC's \"ability ... to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 253(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC does not, however, rest its case solely on the notion that all other municipalities will follow the Municipality of Guayanilla's lead by enacting gross revenue fees. It also argues that the Commonwealth-wide estimates serve as an indicator of how Ordinance No. 40 will affect the profitability of PRTC's operations within the Municipality itself. Extrapolating from its Commonwealth-wide profit margin and the impact that a Commonwealth-wide 5% gross revenue fee would have on its overall profits (an 86% decline), PRTC argues that a similarly significant decline in the profitability of its operations within the Municipality would occur under Ordinance No. 40 alone. Indeed, PRTC argues that the Commonwealth-wide figures may even underestimate Ordinance No. 40's effect. As PRTC explains, \"[g]iven that Guayanilla is a relatively small, rural municipality\" and that it generally \"costs more to provide services in rural or less heavily populated areas than it does in large urban centers,\" PRTC's \"profit margin on services that it sells within the Municipality is likely <i>lower</i> than the company's overall, island-wide margins.

As the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> has explained, \"in determining whether an ordinance has the effect of prohibiting the provision of telecommunications services, it `considers whether the ordinance materially inhibits or limits the ability of any competitor or potential competitor to compete in a fair and balanced legal and regulatory environment.'\" <i>TCG N.Y., Inc. v.

Courts have also noted that \"a prohibition does not need to be complete or `insurmountable' to run afoul of &#167; 253(a).\" <i>Id.; see also City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1269 (\"[A] regulation need not erect an absolute barrier to entry in order to be found prohibitive.\"). Applying these considerations to the facts, we conclude that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance imposes a 5% gross revenue fee. PRTC presently pays a 0.5% municipal license tax on its gross revenues for doing business within the Municipality<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and argues that Ordinance No. 40 will significantly increase its costs and reduce the profitability of its operations. While PRTC does not, as we previously noted, track its gross revenue and profits on a municipality-by-municipality basis, its Commonwealth-wide calculations demonstrate that the imposition of 5% gross revenue fees across all municipalities would present an additional cost of $60 million annually &#8212; ten times the $6 million that PRTC already pays in municipal license taxes and more than double the amount that PRTC pays to municipalities for a variety of taxes and fees combined. According to PRTC's calculations, the surge in costs would reduce PRTC's annual Commonwealth-wide profit by 86%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with PRTC that these figures indicate that Ordinance No. 40 will negatively affect PRTC's profitability. The impact of a Commonwealth-wide 5% gross revenue fee on PRTC's overall profitability would be significant, and, as PRTC argues, it is reasonable to conclude that the effect of Ordinance No. 40 on the profitability of its operations within the Municipality would be similarly, or perhaps even more, substantial. Moreover, as PRTC also notes, the multiple gross revenue fees it faces in other municipalities further strain its ability to provide telecommunications services. Thus, there is no reason to doubt that the ordinance's 5% gross revenue fee would constitute a substantial increase in costs for PRTC in a regulatory environment that is becoming increasingly costly due to the enactment of gross revenue fees by other municipalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance's certification requirements also present another set of costs for PRTC. PRTC would have to change its accounting and records procedures to calculate how much of its gross revenues comes from outgoing calls, originating in the Municipality, using public rights of way. PRTC's current accounting practices do not differentiate how much income is generated from outgoing calls in the Municipality, as opposed to incoming calls, or how many of those outgoing calls use the Municipality's public rights of way, as opposed to private easements. Some features of PRTC's services make these calculations particularly difficult. For example, PRTC would have to devise a method for determining what portion of revenue generated from its unlimited local telephone service &#8212; which charges a flat fee for outgoing and incoming calls &#8212; would constitute revenue from outgoing calls alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Together, the ordinance's gross revenue fee and certification requirements place a significant burden on PRTC. We agree with the district court that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40 \"materially inhibits or limits the ability\" of PRTC \"to compete in a fair and balanced legal and regulatory environment.\" <i>TCG N.Y., Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 76 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>see also City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1270-71 (concluding that costs imposed by a local ordinance, which \"would nearly quadruple [the telecommunications provider's] cost of doing business,\" were \"sufficient to show that the [ordinance's] rental provisions are prohibitive because they create a massive increase in cost\"). Thus, we affirm the district court's holding that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a). We must now consider whether the ordinance falls under the safe harbor of &#167; 253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Section 253(c)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 253(c) provides that \"[n]othing in this section affects the authority of a State or local government to manage the public rights-of-way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 253(c). We have explained that this subsection \"take[s] the form of [a] savings clause[], preserving certain state or local laws that might otherwise be preempted under &#167; 253(a).\" <i>Cablevision of Boston, Inc.,</i> 184 F.3d at 98. However, we have noted that &#167; 253(c) could be interpreted in two ways:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One explanation is that Congress intended &#167; 253(c) ... to be a savings clause only. Under this interpretation, &#167; 253(c) could only be used defensively, in the context of a &#167; 253(a) challenge; the statute would simply not apply to local regulations that are not competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory but nonetheless do not constitute prohibitions on entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the exclusion of &#167; 253(c) from &#167; 253(d) [which provides for FCC preemption] might reflect Congress's selection of a forum for &#167; 253(c) claims, limiting jurisdiction to federal or state courts instead of forcing municipalities with limited resources to defend rights-of-way regulations and fee structures before the FCC in Washington, D.C.... If this interpretation were correct, it would become necessary to decide whether the proper cause of action for a &#167; 253(c) claim is created by &#167; 253(c) itself or arises from some other source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 99 (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Under the first interpretation of &#167; 253(c), a telecommunications provider could not challenge an ordinance or regulation directly on the basis of &#167; 253(c). <i>Id.</i> The telecommunications provider would have to establish that the ordinance or regulation violates &#167; 253(a), and then the burden would shift to the state or local government to establish that the safe harbor provision of &#167; 253(c) applies. Under the second interpretation, &#167; 253(c) could operate as an independent source of claim as well as a safe harbor provision. <i>Id.</i> If a telecommunications provider brought an action challenging an ordinance directly under &#167; 253(c), it would have the burden of establishing that the ordinance violated &#167; 253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants raise two arguments regarding the application of &#167; 253(c) in this case. First, they argue that, insofar as PRTC has not established that the ordinance violates &#167; 253(a), the district court improperly placed the burden of proof for demonstrating that the fee was \"fair and reasonable compensation\" on the appellants. Second, they argue that, assuming they do have the burden of establishing that the ordinance's 5% gross revenue fee on outgoing calls does fall under the safe harbor provision of &#167; 253(c), they have met their burden.

If the appellants were correct on this point, we would have to consider whether PRTC could challenge the ordinance as being preempted directly under &#167; 253(c). However, because we affirm the district court's holding that PRTC has established that Ordinance No. 40 violates &#167; 253(a), we need only consider whether the ordinance meets the &#167; 253(c) safe harbor provision, not whether &#167; 253(c) would provide an independent basis for preemption in this case. <i>See N.J. Payphone Ass'n,</i> 299 F.3d at 241 (\"[T]here is ... no need to resolve [the scope of preemption under &#167; 253(c)] at this time. As discussed below, the operation of Section 253(a) is sufficient to preempt the Ordinance in this case and it does not fall within the Section 253(c) safe harbor.\"). In this context, the question of burden becomes more straightforward. We join our sister circuits in holding that, once the party challenging a regulation or ordinance establishes that it violates &#167; 253(a), the burden is properly on the state or local government seeking the safe harbor to establish that &#167; 253(c) applies. <i>See City of Santa Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1273 n. 10; <i>N.J.

Specifically, the appellants point out that the 5% gross revenue fee applies only to outgoing calls that make use of public rights of way. By crafting the ordinance in this manner, the appellants argue, the Municipality \"ensures an effective distribution of resources, whereby it collects compensation depending on the use a provider gives to the public rights-of-ways.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The TCA does not define the phrase \"fair and reasonable compensation\" and the parties disagree over whether a gross revenue fee can ever satisfy this requirement. PRTC argues that the term \"compensation\" indicates that any fees imposed by state or local law must be limited to the recovery of costs (for maintenance and repair of public rights of way, such as sidewalk and street repair near telephone poles and equipment), which a gross revenue fee is not tailored to do. The appellants argue that the term \"compensation\" encompasses both cost recovery and the notion of \"rent\" for the use of public rights of way, and thus a gross revenue fee can be appropriate. The district court, after carefully reviewing decisions interpreting the terms \"fair and reasonable compensation,\" concluded that \"the most favored interpretation requires that the fees charged by a municipality be related to the degree of actual use of the public rights-of-way, but need not be limited to recoupment of the added costs to the municipality resulting from such use.\" <i>P.R.

We agree with the district court's reasoning that fees should be, at the very least, <i>related</i> to the actual use of rights of way and that \"the costs [of maintaining those rights of way] are an essential part of the equation.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. II,</i> 354 F.Supp.2d at 114. In this case, the appellants have presented no evidence of the Municipality's costs of maintaining the public rights of way. \"Section 253(c) requires compensation to be reasonable essentially to prevent monopolistic pricing by towns. Without access to local government rights-of-way, provision of telecommunications service using land lines is generally infeasible, creating the danger that local governments will exact artificially high rates.\" <i>TCG N.Y., Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d at 79. As the district court noted in this case, \"[a]bsent evidence of costs, the Court cannot determine whether the Ordinance results in fair and reasonable compensation as opposed to monopolistic pricing.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. II,</i> 354 F.Supp.2d at 113.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that, despite the lack of information about the costs of maintaining the public rights of way, they have nonetheless ensured that the ordinance's fee is \"fair and reasonable compensation\" because the fee applies only to revenue generated from calls that the providers certify are using public rights of way. There are two problems with this argument. First, the appellants concede that the 5% fee applies to the entire revenue derived from calls that use <i>any</i> portion of the rights of way, regardless of whether the call traverses over one inch or 100 feet of the public rights of way. Thus, the fee charged does not directly relate to the extent of actual use of public rights of way. Second, the appellants provide no rationale for why it is \"fair and reasonable\" for the Municipality to charge 5%, as opposed to another percentage, of the revenue generated from these calls. The appellants provide no information or estimates regarding the amount of fees that they expect to collect through the ordinance. As the district court noted, \"it is evident that the Municipality intends to delay justifying its Ordinance until after it begins to receive payments from the different providers. We refuse to uphold the fee on the off chance that it might prove to be fair and reasonable.\" <i>P.R. Tel. Co. II,</i> 354 F.Supp.2d at 114.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants note that the Sixth Circuit approved a 4% gross revenue fee after applying a \"totality of the circumstances\" test. <i>TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 625. Under the \"totality of the circumstances\" test, courts examine \"the extent of the use contemplated, the amount other telecommunications providers would be willing to pay, and the impact on the profitability of the business\" to determine whether a fee scheme is \"fair and reasonable.\" <i>City of Sante Fe,</i> 380 F.3d at 1272-73 (citing <i>TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 625). In articulating this test, the Sixth Circuit approached &#167; 253(c) as providing a direct cause of action for a telecommunications provider to challenge a regulation or ordinance, not as a safe harbor provision for a state or local government to save its regulation or ordinance once preemption under &#167; 253(a) had been established. <i>See TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 625.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore question the usefulness of the second and third factors of the test in an analysis of &#167; 253(c) as a safe harbor provision following a determination that the regulation or ordinance in question violates &#167; 253(a). As a safe harbor provision, &#167; 253(c) permits state and local governments to seek \"fair and reasonable compensation ... for the use of public rights-of-way,\" notwithstanding the limitations on their authority to regulate telecommunications providers as set forth in &#167; 253(a). To give effect to this safe harbor provision, it appears that we must focus our inquiry (regarding what constitutes \"fair and reasonable compensation\") on examining the burdens imposed on the state or local government through the use of its public rights of way, rather than the burdens of the ordinance on the telecommunications providers, which is the focus of the &#167; 253(a) analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, both the second and third factors in the \"totality of the circumstances\" test appear to miss the mark in the safe harbor context. The second factor (the amount that other telecommunication providers would be willing to pay) tells us more about telecommunications providers' resources and their desire to comply with local regulations than it does about why the fee chosen is \"fair and reasonable compensation\" for the state or municipality. The third factor (the impact on the profitability of the telecommunications provider) seems to conflate the concerns of subsection (c) with those of subsection (a). Presumably, if a municipality demonstrated that the fee it imposes reflects the actual cost to the municipality for the use of its rights of way, it would be justified in charging this fee regardless of whether the amount would render the provision of telecommunications services unprofitable for a telecommunications provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we do not adopt the \"totality of the circumstances\" test in the context of a &#167; 253(c) safe harbor analysis that follows a determination of preemption under &#167; 253(a). Nevertheless, we note that even if we were to apply the three factors of the test to this case, Ordinance No. 40 would not fit within &#167; 253(c)'s safe harbor. First, nothing in the record indicates that the ordinance accounts for the actual use of public rights of way. As previously noted, the 5% fee applies to the entire revenue derived from all calls that use any portion of the rights of way, regardless of the actual extent of use. Second, the appellants fail to point to any telecommunications providers who have been willing to pay the requested fee. Third, as we have previously noted, the fee would represent a significant increase in PRTC's costs, undermining the profitability of its operations. Thus, even under the test urged by the appellants, the ordinance fails to satisfy &#167; 253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the TCA in an attempt to maintain \"the balance ... necessary to effectuate its intent to enhance competition and eliminate local monopolies while leaving room for reasonable regulation of issues of particular state and local concern.\" <i>N.J. Payphone Ass'n,</i> 299 F.3d at 245. Ordinance No. 40 disrupts this balance. While we recognize the difficult task that municipalities face when enacting ordinances that regulate public rights of way, we conclude that the ordinance in this case is preempted by &#167; 253(a) of the TCA and is not saved by the safe harbor provision of &#167; 253(c).

This also raises the possibility that Section 253(c), which is similarly phrased, contains a parallel limitation.\"). The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have come to differing conclusions on this point. <i>Compare BellSouth Telecomms., Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d at 1187, 1191 (concluding that \"subsection (a) contains the only substantive limitations on state and local government regulation of telecommunications, and that subsections (b) and (c) are `safe harbors,' functioning as affirmative defenses to preemption of state or local exercises of authority that would otherwise violate (a),\" and thus remanding because the district court considered whether the ordinances \"fell within the parameters of (c), but never addressed, in the first instance, whether the ordinances violated subsection (a)\") <i>with TCG Detroit,</i> 206 F.3d at 624 (concluding that &#167; 253(c) operates as a separate limitation on state and local governments, \"authoriz[ing] a private right of action in federal court for telecommunications providers aggrieved by a municipality's allegedly discriminatory or allegedly unfair and unreasonable rates\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
