Keenan, Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before MAGRUDER, Chief Judge, and WOODBURY and HARTIGAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HARTIGAN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on March 4, 1954, granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint may be summarized as follows: The plaintiffs Arthur Gottlieb and Michael Pariser are citizens of New York. The defendants George A. Isenman and Manuel Isenman are citizens of Massachusetts and the defendants Beacon Chemical Industries, Inc., is a Massachusetts corporation. Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship and the required amount. From about January, 1942 until about June 30, 1950, the defendants George Isenman and Manuel Isenman jointly operated a business known under the name of The Beacon Company of Boston which was set up as a sales outlet for some or all of the products of the defendant corporation. The president of the corporation is Manuel Isenman and its treasurer and clerk is George Isenman. They own or control all the shares of the corporation. In 1949, the individual defendants and the defendant corporation were engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing chemicals of various kinds, including wax products known by the trade name of Beacon Wax. Pariser went to Boston on or about December 24, 1949 and met George Isenman and one Cecil Landau who was represented to be the sales manager for the Beacon Wax Products. George Isenman, acting in behalf of the co-partnership and the defendant corporation, asked Pariser to find a customer to purchase the entire wax products business of the defendant for a total sales price of five million dollars, of which twenty per cent must be a down payment and the balance to be paid over a period of not more than three years. He also offered Pariser and Gottlieb a commission of five per cent of the total sales price if they produced a customer. Pariser, acting on behalf of himself and Gottlieb, agreed with the defendants to use their best efforts to produce a customer on the terms and for the commission as stated above. As the result of their efforts, the plaintiffs produced as a customer the June Dairy Products Co. which was ready, willing and able to purchase the wax products business upon the terms and under the conditions previously agreed upon by the parties. Also, as a result of the efforts of the plaintiffs, the defendant George Isenman and Cecil Landau met and conferred with Louis Bandler, president and treasurer of June Dairy Products Co. in New York City on or about March 3, 1950. Bandler informed the defendants that his company was ready, willing and able to buy the wax products business upon the terms set by the defendants. The complaint further alleges that in bad faith and without reasonable justification, the defendants and their agents failed, neglected, and refused to disclose to Bandler the financial statements covering the wax products business, even though Bandler was ready then and there to make a definite commitment in behalf of his company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' answer admits that Pariser met Cecil Landau and George Isenman on or about December 24, 1949 in Boston and that George Isenman and Landau met Louis Bandler in New York on or about March 3, 1950, but denies the other material allegations of the complaint. After many depositions had been taken by the parties, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on January 11, 1954. The plaintiffs filed an affidavit of Louis Bandler made on July 8, 1953 in opposition to the motion. The motion was granted and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court would be warranted in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavit of Louis Bandler show \"* * * that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. * *\" Rule 56(c), Fed.Rules of Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A. The plaintiffs have a right to a trial \"* * * where there is the slightest doubt as to the facts.\" Peckham v. Ronrico Corporation, 1 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 653, 657; Landy v. Silverman, 1 Cir., 1951, 189 F.2d 80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants contend that, even assuming the existence of the brokerage agreement, they are entitled to summary judgment because the alleged buyer as a matter of law could not and did not accept the alleged offer to sell. Under the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, we look to the Massachusetts decisions in order to determine the law governing the validity of this contention. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., 1941, 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477. Since the alleged brokerage contract was made in Massachusetts and its performance was not contemplated in any particular state, a Massachusetts court would apply its own law to determine the rights and duties of the parties under the alleged contract. Wetherell Bros. Co. v. United States Steel Co., 1 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 761, and the Massachusetts cases cited therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fitzpatrick v. Gilson, 1900, 176 Mass. 477, 478, 57 N.E. 1000, the court stated: \"* * * When a broker has found a customer for that for which his principal has employed him to find a customer, the broker has performed his duty, and has earned his commission; or, as the proposition is usually stated, if the person produced by the broker is able, ready, and willing to buy, sell, or lend, as the case may be, the broker's commission is earned. * * *\" If the broker does produce a customer able, ready, and willing to buy on the seller's terms, then the broker's \"right to a commission is not affected by the failure of a customer and seller to enter into a binding agreement, or by the refusal of the seller to carry out the transaction.\" Drake v. Sweet, 1950, 325 Mass. 542, 545, 91 N.E.2d 346, 347, 348.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Louis Bandler stated in his deposition that June Dairy Products Co. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Moon Foods, Inc. Under the terms of a loan agreement with the Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company, June Dairy Products Co. and Blue Moon Foods, Inc. had agreed not to incur any indebtedness without the written consent of Provident. No such consent had been obtained on or before March 3, 1950. The defendants therefore contend that the alleged buyer was not able, ready, and willing to purchase because the consummation of the purchase was dependent upon arrangements which had to be made with Provident and other financial institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Driscoll v. Bunar, 1952, 328 Mass. 398, 401, 103 N.E.2d 809, 812, the court stated: \"* * * The plaintiff was not obliged to show that Kennedy had the necessary cash in his possession or in a bank, for one may be financially able if from his own resources, or on his own credit or on the security of the property he is to purchase, he will be able to command the necessary funds when the time comes for the completion of the transaction. * * *\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Louis Bandler testified in his deposition as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A. * * * We had a choice of taking the money from the Provident Mutual, who wanted to give us two million dollars, or work with Goldman-Sachs. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>* * * * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q.

So that by March 3, 1950, in any event, you had not made any arrangements specifically with anybody to get any money for the Beacon deal? A. We knew we had the money within our own people or could get it from outside sources. That we knew definitely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. You knew that you could get how much money? A.

In other words, Mr. Whitney indicated to you that if you could buy the Beacon Wax Company for five million dollars, he would arrange the necessary funds, is that correct? A. He would.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. You could get the whole five million dollars? A.

So that the manner of financing the thing would be a decision to be made by the Board of Directors? A. Yes. That is just mechanics. Shall we get it from the private bankers, or shall we raise the money ourselves, or through our own stockholders, with rights?

That's correct.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that on the basis of this testimony a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether or not June Dairy Products Co. and Blue Moon Foods, Inc. were financially able, ready, and willing to purchase on the alleged sellers' terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants next contend that, assuming the existence of the brokerage agreement, the alleged offer to sell could have been accepted only by the alleged buyer's board of directors and that there was no such acceptance on or before March 3, 1950. The defendants, therefore, conclude that the alleged buyer was not an able buyer on March 3, 1950. Blue Moon Foods, Inc. and June Dairy Products Co., however, would constitute an able, ready, and willing buyer without a formal meeting and vote of acceptance by the board of directors if certain officers and directors of the corporations had apparent or ostensible authority to bind the corporations as an able, ready, and willing buyer. Boston Food Products Co. v. Wilson &amp; Co., 1923, 245 Mass. 550, 139 N.E. 637; Lonergan v. Highland Trust Co., 1934, 287 Mass. 550, 192 N.E. 34; cf. Hurley v. Ornsteen, 1942, 311 Mass. 477, 42 N.E.2d 273. In Rintamaki v. Cunard S. S. Co., 1910, 205 Mass. 115, 117, 91 N.E. 220, 221, the court stated: \"* * * the principal question relates to the matter of Blomquist's apparent authority as distinguished from his actual or express authority. The question whether one is acting within the apparent scope of his authority as agent for another is usually one of fact the answer to which depends on the inference to be drawn from a variety of circumstances relating to the conduct of the apparent agent, and the knowledge or means of knowledge of the alleged principal of what is claimed to have been done in his behalf. If the circumstances are such by reason of the acquiescence or negligence of the alleged principal, or by reason of the nature of the duties intrusted to the supposed agent, and the situation in which the alleged principal has put him, as to warrant third parties in the exercise of a reasonable prudence and discretion in dealing with him as having authority to represent the alleged principal in regard to the transaction in question, then such principal will be bound; otherwise not.\" See also Ross v.

Nathan Bandler, a director and president of the corporations, stated that the majority of the securities of Blue Moon Foods, Inc. were held by the Bandler family.

Furthermore, the testimony quoted above tends to show that the negotiations were terminated at the meeting of March 3, 1950, because the defendants did not provide the alleged buyer with figures substantiating their statements to Pariser, even though they had promised to do so.

The defendants George A. Isenman and Manuel Isenman are citizens of Massachusetts and the defendants Beacon Chemical Industries, Inc., is a Massachusetts corporation. Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship and the required amount. From about January, 1942 until about June 30, 1950, the defendants George Isenman and Manuel Isenman jointly operated a business known under the name of The Beacon Company of Boston which was set up as a sales outlet for some or all of the products of the defendant corporation. The president of the corporation is Manuel Isenman and its treasurer and clerk is George Isenman. They own or control all the shares of the corporation. In 1949, the individual defendants and the defendant corporation were engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing chemicals of various kinds, including wax products known by the trade name of Beacon Wax. Pariser went to Boston on or about December 24, 1949 and met George Isenman and one Cecil Landau who was represented to be the sales manager for the Beacon Wax Products. George Isenman, acting in behalf of the co-partnership and the defendant corporation, asked Pariser to find a customer to purchase the entire wax products business of the defendant for a total sales price of five million dollars, of which twenty per cent must be a down payment and the balance to be paid over a period of not more than three years. He also offered Pariser and Gottlieb a commission of five per cent of the total sales price if they produced a customer. Pariser, acting on behalf of himself and Gottlieb, agreed with the defendants to use their best efforts to produce a customer on the terms and for the commission as stated above. As the result of their efforts, the plaintiffs produced as a customer the June Dairy Products Co. which was ready, willing and able to purchase the wax products business upon the terms and under the conditions previously agreed upon by the parties. Also, as a result of the efforts of the plaintiffs, the defendant George Isenman and Cecil Landau met and conferred with Louis Bandler, president and treasurer of June Dairy Products Co. in New York City on or about March 3, 1950. Bandler informed the defendants that his company was ready, willing and able to buy the wax products business upon the terms set by the defendants. The complaint further alleges that in bad faith and without reasonable justification, the defendants and their agents failed, neglected, and refused to disclose to Bandler the financial statements covering the wax products business, even though Bandler was ready then and there to make a definite commitment in behalf of his company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' answer admits that Pariser met Cecil Landau and George Isenman on or about December 24, 1949 in Boston and that George Isenman and Landau met Louis Bandler in New York on or about March 3, 1950, but denies the other material allegations of the complaint. After many depositions had been taken by the parties, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on January 11, 1954. The plaintiffs filed an affidavit of Louis Bandler made on July 8, 1953 in opposition to the motion. The motion was granted and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court would be warranted in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavit of Louis Bandler show \"* * * that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. * *\" Rule 56(c), Fed.Rules of Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A.

No such consent had been obtained on or before March 3, 1950.

Louis Bandler's insistence upon certified figures verifying the statements which Pariser testified Isenman made would not prevent Blue Moon Foods, Inc. and June Dairy Products Co. from being an able, ready, and willing buyer if such insistence \"* * * did not constitute a condition precedent to the existence of an agreement, but a reservation to be complied with before the agreement should be carried out, * * *.\" Hutchinson v.

Furthermore, the testimony quoted above tends to show that the negotiations were terminated at the meeting of March 3, 1950, because the defendants did not provide the alleged buyer with figures substantiating their statements to Pariser, even though they had promised to do so. It, therefore, \"* * * does not lie in the defendant's mouth to claim, in order to defeat the plaintiff's recovery, that other evidence was necessary to prove that the customer was ready, able and willing to purchase.\" Whitkin v.
