Tutty Andayani, her husband, and their two\n\nminor children,1 petition for review of an order of the Board of\n\nImmigration      Appeals     (BIA)    summarily   affirming    an   Immigration\n\nJudge’s      (IJ)   denial    of     their    applications    for   asylum   and\n\nwithholding of removal.         We deny the petition.\n\n              Andayani is a native and citizen of Indonesia who, with\n\nher two children, entered the United States on September 7, 2001 as\n\na non-immigrant with authorization to remain until February 6,\n\n2002.       Her husband, also a native and citizen of Indonesia, had\n\npreviously been admitted to the country on a visa.                  The entire\n\nfamily overstayed their authorizations.\n\n              In March 2002, Andayani filed an application for, inter\n\nalia, asylum and withholding of removal, and was subsequently\n\ninterviewed by an asylum officer.2             The officer did not grant the\n\napplication.        Subsequently, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (“INS”) filed a Notice to Appear charging that Andayani,\n\nher husband, and her two children were subject to removal.\n\n              Thereafter, a hearing was held before an IJ at which\n\n\n\n     1\n      Andayani is designated as the lead petitioner in this case.\nBecause the claims of her husband and their two minor children are\nderivative of Andayani’s asylum application, we do not discuss them\nseparately. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3); Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d\n1, 4 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n        2\n      Andayani also sought relief under the Convention Against\nTorture but has not briefed this claim on appeal, and therefore, we\nconsider it waived. See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5 (1st\nCir. 2002).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fAndayani and her family admitted the factual allegations in the\n\nNotice to Appear, conceded removability, and asked for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.           Andayani testified in support of her\n\napplication as follows.\n\n            In 2001, Andayani lived with her husband and two children\n\nin Bandung, Indonesia.       She characterized herself as a “moderate”\n\nMuslim and anti-fundamentalist but stated that as a “native” and a\n\nMuslim, she felt a certain degree of safety.\n\n            Andayani’s husband came to the United States to study in\n\nearly 2001.      Shortly thereafter, Muslim “extremists” from a group\n\ncalled   the    “Jihad    Army”   began   visiting   houses     in    Andayani’s\n\nneighborhood, asking for donations and participants to carry out\n\ntheir plans.\n\n            Initially, the men asked Andayani to join them, but when\n\nshe   refused,    they    demanded   money   and   threatened    her    and   her\n\nchildren.      They asked about Andayani’s husband and became upset\n\nwhen they learned he had gone to the United States.                  They called\n\nher husband a traitor and did not believe Andayani when she said\n\nshe had no money.        Andayani convinced the men to come back in two\n\ndays for the money.       They returned as requested and collected the\n\nequivalent of about $50 U.S. dollars. Over the next several weeks,\n\nthese individuals returned several more times, and Andayani paid\n\nthem the equivalent of about $200 U.S. dollars in total.\n\n            Andayani tried reporting the problem to the police, but\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe police insisted on bribes and refused to take action. Andayani\n\nlater sold her house in the summer of 2001 and moved to live with\n\nher parents in Jakarta.     She experienced no further problems until\n\nshe left for the United States in September 2001.\n\n           The IJ found Andayani credible but concluded that she\n\nfailed to demonstrate an entitlement to relief.         The IJ based this\n\nfinding   on   Andayani’s   success   in   relocating   within   Indonesia\n\nwithout further significant incident.          The IJ also noted that\n\nAndayani did not claim any physical violence and the only damage to\n\nher property was damage to her front door because it had been\n\nkicked in by the extremists during one of the visits.            Andayani\n\nappealed to the BIA, which affirmed without opinion. Andayani then\n\ntimely petitioned this court for review.\n\n           Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ’s decision, we\n\nreview the IJ’s decision directly.3         Tota v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d\n\n161, 165 (1st Cir. 2006); Akinfolarin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 39, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).           We review the IJ’s\n\ndenial of asylum and withholding of removal under the “substantial\n\nevidence” standard.    Chreng v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Under this standard, the decision will stand unless the\n\n\n\n     3\n      Andayani asserts that the BIA’s use of its summary affirmance\nprocedure, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4), denied her due process of\nlaw.    We have rejected such challenges before, see Disu v.\nAshcroft, 338 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003); Albathani v. INS, 318\nF.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir. 2003); El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d\n195, 205-06 (1st Cir. 2003), and do so again.\n\n                                  -4-\n\frecord evidence “would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a\n\ncontrary determination.”        Pan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 60, 61 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n             Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), the\n\nAttorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant\n\nasylum to an applicant who establishes “refugee” status.                          8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1158(b)(1)(A).        Applicants     can    meet       this     burden        by    (1)\n\ndemonstrating    past     persecution    on    the       basis    of     one      of   five\n\nstatutory grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion; or (2) establishing\n\nthey have a well-founded fear of future persecution based on one of\n\nthe   five    statutory     grounds.         See     8    C.F.R.        §     208.13(b).\n\nEstablishing a well-founded fear of future persecution requires\n\napplicants to demonstrate that their fear is both genuine and\n\nobjectively reasonable. See Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    By establishing past persecution, applicants create a\n\nrebuttable     presumption      of   a   well-founded             fear       of    future\n\npersecution.     See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\n             Andayani   first    asserts      that       the     IJ’s       decision     is\n\nunsupported because she established past persecution as a result of\n\nharassment on account of her perceived religious status as a\n\n“moderate” Muslim.        Past persecution requires “more than mere\n\ndiscomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.”\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).                         Conduct\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fof the quality and degree experienced by Andayani does not compel\n\na finding of persecution. See Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 59\n\n(1st       Cir.    2006)    (affirming     finding    of     no    persecution   where\n\npetitioners were subjected to vandalization of their home, bombing\n\nof their church, and threats from crowds); see also Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2005) (affirming finding\n\nof no persecution where petitioner suffered two police beatings\n\nwithin two years); Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (compiling cases; affirming finding of no persecution where\n\npetitioner was subjected to three episodes of solitary confinement,\n\nphysical abuse, periodic surveillance, threatening phone calls, and\n\noccasional stops and searches).4\n\n                  Andayani also has failed to show that the IJ’s rejection\n\nof her future persecution claim was unsupported by substantial\n\nevidence.           To    show   a    well-founded    fear    of    persecution,   “an\n\napplicant          must    not   only    harbor   a    genuine      fear   of    future\n\npersecution, but also must establish an objectively reasonable\n\nbasis for that fear.”                Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155,\n\n161 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 65\n\n\n       4\n      Andayani challenges the cases relied on by the IJ to support\nthe finding of no persecution, Disu v. Ashcroft, 338 F.3d 13 (1st\nCir. 2003), Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55 (1st Cir. 2003), and\nKhem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2003), on the grounds that\nthey are either factually distinguishable or involved less credible\napplicants. The IJ, however, only referred to those cases to make\nthe general point that Andayani’s claim does not rise to the level\nof past persecution.    The differences between these cases and\nAndayani’s do not undermine the soundness of the IJ’s decision.\n\n                                            -6-\n\f(1st   Cir.    2004)).    Andayani       contends   that   the   IJ   failed   to\n\nappreciate her fear of returning to Indonesia because he did not\n\nadequately consider the United States State Department Country\n\nCondition Report on Indonesia as evidence of targeted persecution\n\nof Muslim moderates by armed Islamic fundamentalist groups.\n\n              We have held that State Department Reports are “generally\n\nprobative of country conditions,” but that their findings must be\n\nconsidered within the context of the petitioner's specific claim.\n\nChreng, 471 F.3d at 21.       The Country Condition Report does show\n\nthat there are certain parts of Indonesia where armed extremist\n\ngroups attack Muslims.      But the Report does not suggest that these\n\nabuses take place in Jakarta, where Andayani moved after receiving\n\nthe threats.\n\n              An ability to relocate to another part of the country to\n\navoid persecution weighs heavily against a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture   persecution.        See     8    C.F.R.    §   1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B),\n\n(b)(2)(ii); see also Susanto, 439 F.3d at 61 (family relocated to\n\nsafer region during violent riots).             This is particularly true\n\nwhere, as here, the applicant’s relatives have lived peacefully in\n\nanother part of the country for an extended period.               See Silva v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005) (applicant’s wife and\n\ndaughter lived peacefully for a year at a relative’s house in\n\nanother area); Velasquez, 342 F.3d at 59 (numerous relatives of\n\npetitioners lived undisturbed in another part of the country for\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fover   twenty   years),   abrogated    on   other   grounds   by   Bocova   v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999) (“[T]he fact that close\n\nrelatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland\n\nundercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.”).\n\nAndayani’s parents have lived in Jakarta for many years without\n\never   being    bothered    by   fundamentalist       Islamic      militants.\n\nAccordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ’s conclusion that\n\nAndayani does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.5\n\n            For these reasons, the denials of Andayani’s claims for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal are supported by substantial\n\nevidence.   The petition for review is therefore denied.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       Since Andayani failed to satisfy the more lenient asylum\nstandard, she cannot satisfy the more demanding withholding of\nremoval standard. See Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

The IJ, however, only referred to those cases to make\nthe general point that Andayani’s claim does not rise to the level\nof past persecution.    The differences between these cases and\nAndayani’s do not undermine the soundness of the IJ’s decision.\n\n                                            -6-\n\f(1st   Cir.    2004)).    Andayani       contends   that   the   IJ   failed   to\n\nappreciate her fear of returning to Indonesia because he did not\n\nadequately consider the United States State Department Country\n\nCondition Report on Indonesia as evidence of targeted persecution\n\nof Muslim moderates by armed Islamic fundamentalist groups.\n\n              We have held that State Department Reports are “generally\n\nprobative of country conditions,” but that their findings must be\n\nconsidered within the context of the petitioner's specific claim.\n\nChreng, 471 F.3d at 21.       The Country Condition Report does show\n\nthat there are certain parts of Indonesia where armed extremist\n\ngroups attack Muslims.      But the Report does not suggest that these\n\nabuses take place in Jakarta, where Andayani moved after receiving\n\nthe threats.\n\n              An ability to relocate to another part of the country to\n\navoid persecution weighs heavily against a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture   persecution.        See     8    C.F.R.    §   1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B),\n\n(b)(2)(ii); see also Susanto, 439 F.3d at 61 (family relocated to\n\nsafer region during violent riots).
