Reilly, Attorney General, was on\nbrief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          July 28, 2003\n\f               SELYA,    Circuit    Judge.      This    convoluted      habeas    case\n\npresents a tangled scenario that gives rise to difficult questions\n\nof justiciability and constitutional law.                    The case has taken\n\ninnumerable twists and turns. It began when the petitioner pleaded\n\nguilty    to    a    charged    crime,   started       serving   a     state-imposed\n\nsentence, and then was charged with a second, more serious crime —\n\none potentially incompatible with the first.                     He responded by\n\nmoving to vacate his original conviction.                The state court granted\n\nhis motion.\n\n               On reflection, the petitioner moved to reinstate that\n\nconviction and attempted instead to raise a double jeopardy defense\n\nto the second charge.              The state courts (trial and appellate)\n\nrebuffed these initiatives, and the petitioner repaired to the\n\nfederal    courts.        The   district     court     denied    the    petitioner's\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, ruling that the vacation\n\nof the first conviction thwarted any claim of double jeopardy.\n\n               If that were not complicated enough, the petitioner then\n\nstruck out in a new direction.           During the pendency of the federal\n\nhabeas proceeding, he pleaded guilty to the second charge in\n\nexchange       for   a   reduced    sentence.        After   learning      what    had\n\ntranspired, the district court rescinded its earlier ruling and\n\ndismissed the habeas petition as moot.\n\n               The petitioner assails both of the district court's\n\norders.        We agree with the petitioner that, in the peculiar\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcircumstances of this case, his guilty plea to the second charge\n\ndid not render the habeas proceeding moot. Nevertheless, we affirm\n\nthe denial of habeas relief.       Adhering to the strictures of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No.\n\n104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), we conclude that the state courts\n\nneither acted contrary to, nor unreasonably applied, Supreme Court\n\nprecedent when they refused to honor the petitioner's claim of\n\ndouble jeopardy.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            During the afternoon of March 20, 1996, an armed intruder\n\nentered a doctor's office in Jamaica Plain and departed with, among\n\nother things, a checkbook.     Later that day, police in Cambridge\n\narrested    petitioner-appellant    Arthur   Jackson   while   he   was\n\nattempting to cash one of the purloined checks.        The locales are\n\nsignificant because prosecutorial responsibility in Massachusetts\n\noperates on a county-by-county basis.     See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12,\n\n§§ 12-32.     Jamaica Plain (where the robbery took place) is in\n\nSuffolk County but Cambridge (where the attempted check-passing\n\noccurred) is in Middlesex County.\n\n            When the Middlesex County District Attorney charged the\n\npetitioner with receiving stolen property (the purloined checks),\n\nhe entered a guilty plea to that charge in Cambridge District\n\nCourt.     The court imposed a thirty-month sentence (one year to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fserve and the balance suspended). The petitioner began serving his\n\nsentence on April 4, 1996.\n\n           One day later, the Suffolk County District Attorney swore\n\nout a criminal complaint charging the petitioner with armed robbery\n\nin connection with the March 20 heist.               The petitioner first\n\nlearned of this charge five months into his incarcerative term when\n\nan   outstanding   arrest   warrant   (which   had    never   been   served)\n\nrendered him ineligible to participate in a work-release program.\n\nFearing that his guilty plea to receiving stolen property would be\n\nused against him at a trial for armed robbery, the petitioner filed\n\na pro se motion on November 25, 1996.            The motion sought to\n\nwithdraw the earlier plea, annul the petitioner's conviction, and\n\nset the stage for a new trial on the original charge.1         The gist of\n\nthe petitioner's argument was that the presiding judge in the\n\nCambridge District Court had conducted an insufficient colloquy\n\nand, therefore, had erred in accepting his guilty plea. See, e.g.,\n\nCommonwealth v. Lopez, 690 N.E.2d 809, 812 (Mass. 1998) (discussing\n\nthe constitutional requirements for acceptance of a guilty plea);\n\nsee also Mass. R. Crim. P. 12(c) (establishing certain procedural\n\nprerequisites for same).\n\n           On December 5, 1996, the petitioner was summonsed to the\n\nWest Roxbury District Court for arraignment on the Suffolk County\n\n\n\n      1\n      For ease in reference, we hereafter refer to this motion\nsimply as a motion to vacate the conviction.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fcomplaint.       One week later, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted\n\nhim for armed robbery.        The new indictment included an allegation\n\nthat the petitioner was a habitual offender.                 If proven, this\n\nallegation would require a sentence of life imprisonment.                See\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 17; id. ch. 279, § 25.\n\n              On December 28, 1996, the petitioner completed serving\n\nthe incarcerative portion of his sentence for receiving stolen\n\nproperty.      His freedom was short-lived.       When he appeared the next\n\nweek at Suffolk Superior Court for a pretrial hearing on the armed\n\nrobbery charge, he was detained.            His detention lasted from that\n\ndate       (January   2,   1997)   until    his   eventual   release,   under\n\ncircumstances that we shortly shall explain, on July 2, 2002.\n\n              On January 14, 1997, the petitioner appeared pro se in\n\nthe Cambridge District Court for a hearing on his previously filed\n\nmotion to vacate his conviction for receiving stolen property.2            At\n\nthe request of court personnel, an itinerant attorney consulted\n\nwith the petitioner and informed the presiding judge that the\n\npetitioner \"really need[ed] to be represented by counsel in this\n\ncase.\" The lawyer urged the court to withhold any action until the\n\npetitioner's court-appointed counsel in the armed robbery case\n\ncould appear.         Speaking for himself, the petitioner pressed for\n\n\n       2\n      Since the motion amounted to a collateral attack on a final\njudgment of conviction, the petitioner was not entitled as of right\nto court-appointed counsel in connection with it. Pennsylvania v.\nFinley, 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987); Commonwealth v. Conceicao, 446\nN.E.2d 383, 387 (Mass. 1983).\n\n                                      -5-\n\fvacation of the receiving stolen property conviction, emphasizing\n\nthat he had not been given proper warnings in advance of his guilty\n\nplea.     The court announced its intention to listen to a tape\n\nrecording of the plea proceeding and continued the hearing until\n\nJanuary 30 so the petitioner's attorney could attend.\n\n            For reasons that remain obscure, neither the petitioner\n\nnor his court-appointed counsel in the armed robbery case appeared\n\nat the January 30 hearing.       The court, however, had reviewed the\n\ntape of the plea proceeding and found the colloquy inadequate.\n\nStating that \"I am the one who erred, and I am correcting the error\n\nnow,\" the presiding judge vacated the petitioner's conviction for\n\nreceiving   stolen   property.      The   district   attorney's   office\n\neventually declined to reprosecute the receiving stolen property\n\ncharge.\n\n            The armed robbery case remained velivolant and, after\n\nseveral months had passed, the petitioner began to have second\n\nthoughts about his strategy.       On November 19, 1997, he filed a\n\ncounseled motion in the Cambridge District Court requesting the\n\nreinstatement of his prior conviction. At around the same time, he\n\nfiled a counseled motion in the Suffolk Superior Court seeking\n\ndismissal of the armed robbery charge on double jeopardy grounds.\n\nBoth motions were denied.    The petitioner then appealed the double\n\njeopardy ruling to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC).\n\nA single justice of the SJC, acting pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f211, § 3, ruled that the petitioner's interlocutory appeal was\n\nimmediately reviewable but nonetheless rejected the appeal on the\n\nmerits.     On   October   14,    1999,     the   full   court   affirmed   that\n\ndecision.     See Jackson v. Commonwealth, 717 N.E.2d 1001, 1005\n\n(Mass. 1999).\n\n            While still awaiting trial in the armed robbery case, the\n\npetitioner filed a federal habeas petition.              The federal district\n\ncourt held a hearing on March 7, 2002, and took the matter under\n\nadvisement.      On July 2, 2002, the petitioner and Suffolk County\n\nprosecutors reached an accord anent the armed robbery charge:                in\n\nexchange for the petitioner's guilty plea, the Commonwealth agreed\n\nto abandon the habitual offender allegation and recommend a \"time-\n\nserved\" sentence.     The Suffolk Superior Court accepted the plea,\n\nimposed the agreed sentence, and released the petitioner on a term\n\nof supervised probation.         The federal district court later stated\n\nthat it was not notified of these developments when they occurred.3\n\n            On July 30, 2002, the federal district court, still\n\nunaware of the recent plea, denied the petition for habeas relief\n\n\n\n     3\n      The court apparently suspected that the failure of\nnotification resulted from inadvertence. After all, the parties\nwere represented by different counsel in the two cases (i.e., the\npetitioner was represented by one lawyer in the armed robbery case\nand by a second, unrelated lawyer in the federal habeas case,\nwhereas the Commonwealth was represented by the district attorney's\noffice in the former case and by the Attorney General in the latter\ncase). For their part, the petitioner's lawyers contend that they\ndid furnish contemporaneous notice of the guilty plea to the\ndistrict court. We need not resolve this conflict.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fon the merits.     See Jackson v. Coalter, 2002 WL 1760879, at *4 (D.\n\nMass.   July    30,    2002).     Approximately      two    weeks   later,   the\n\nCommonwealth moved to reconsider the order.                In that motion, the\n\nAttorney General informed the court of the plea bargain in the\n\narmed robbery case and argued that the consummation of that bargain\n\nrendered the habeas petition moot.           The district court agreed; in\n\nsuccessive orders, it first vacated its earlier merits decision and\n\nthen dismissed the habeas petition as moot.\n\n           The petitioner seasonably appealed both the order of\n\ndismissal on the merits and the subsequent order declaring the\n\ncontroversy moot.           The appeal is properly before us, as the\n\ndistrict   court      has   granted    a   broadly   worded    certificate    of\n\nappealability.        See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           To prevail in this appeal, the petitioner must overcome\n\ntwo adverse rulings.         Common sense suggests that we address these\n\nrulings in reverse chronological order.\n\n                                 A.    Mootness.\n\n           We    afford      plenary   review   to   the     district   court's\n\ndetermination that the petitioner's guilty plea to the armed\n\nrobbery charge rendered his habeas petition moot.               See Simpson v.\n\nMatesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 205 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Scarpa v.\n\nDubois, 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1994).           Initially, however, we deal\n\nwith a pair of preliminary matters.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f           First, we note that even though the guilty plea to the\n\narmed robbery charge ended the petitioner's incarceration, he\n\nremains under supervised probation. Thus, he is still sufficiently\n\n\"in custody\" to pursue federal habeas relief.            See Lefkowitz v.\n\nFair, 816 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1987) (collecting cases); see\n\ngenerally Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 240 (1963) (holding\n\nthat the \"in custody\" requirement for habeas relief necessitates\n\nonly \"restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the\n\npublic generally\").\n\n           Second, the petitioner filed his habeas application under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254. The district court perspicaciously observed that\n\nthe petitioner was still awaiting trial on the armed robbery charge\n\nwhen he sought habeas relief; that his status was, therefore, that\n\nof a pretrial detainee; and that this circumstance called into\n\nquestion the appropriateness of the jurisdictional allegation. See\n\nJackson v. Coalter, 2002 WL 1760879, at *1; see also 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(a) (indicating that section 2254 relief is available only to\n\n\"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\").\n\nThe district court nonetheless proceeded to adjudicate the matter\n\non the basis that, under 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3), a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus is potentially available to any state prisoner \"in custody\n\nin violation of the Constitution or laws . . . of the United\n\nStates.\"    This   problem   does   not   concern   us   inasmuch   as   the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fpetitioner has now pleaded guilty to the armed robbery charge, and\n\nhis guilty plea subjected him to a state court judgment.\n\n            Against   this   backdrop,     we   turn    to   the    question   of\n\nmootness.   A habeas petition is moot if it fails to present a live\n\ncase or controversy.       See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998);\n\nsee generally Lewis v. Cont'l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990)\n\n(explaining that the \"case-or-controversy requirement subsists\n\nthrough all stages of federal judicial proceedings\"). The question\n\nbefore us is whether the petitioner's guilty plea foreclosed his\n\nhabeas claims (and, thus, rendered his petition moot).\n\n            In   arguing   the   affirmative     of    the   proposition,      the\n\nCommonwealth chiefly relies upon the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563 (1989).                   In Broce, the\n\ndefendants were charged with rigging two separate sets of bids for\n\nstate highway contracts.         Id. at 565.       They eventually pleaded\n\nguilty to two counts of conspiracy.             Id. at 566.        After another\n\ncourt, trying a different group of defendants, had ruled that the\n\nrigged bids were part and parcel of a single conspiracy, the Broce\n\ndefendants mounted a collateral attack on their second conviction.\n\nId. at 567.      The Supreme Court concluded that \"[a] plea of guilty\n\nand the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal\n\nelements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt\n\nand a lawful sentence.\" Id. at 569. Consequently, the defendants'\n\nguilty pleas foreclosed any opportunity to revisit the factual\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fpredicate upon which their convictions rested.               See id. at 571\n\n(\"When respondents pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy on\n\nthe explicit premise of two agreements which started at different\n\ntimes and embraced separate objectives, they conceded guilt to two\n\nseparate offenses.\").\n\n             The Commonwealth says that Broce stands for the black-\n\nletter   rule    that   a   defendant's     guilty    plea   pretermits   any\n\nsubsequent    collateral    attack   aimed   at   negating    the   resulting\n\nconviction.     That formulation, however, reaches beyond the holding\n\nin Broce, which contemplated \"exception[s] to the rule barring\n\ncollateral attack on a guilty plea.\"          Id. at 574.     The exceptions\n\ninclude guilty pleas such as that discussed in Menna v. New York,\n\n423 U.S. 61 (1975) (per curiam), that is, pleas entered in response\n\nto charges \"which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\"\n\nId. at 62 n.2.\n\n            Menna is of considerable interest here.           In that case,\n\nthe defendant, having been granted immunity, refused to testify and\n\nwas sentenced for contempt of court.              Id. at 61.        After his\n\nrelease, the state indicted him for once again refusing to answer\n\nthe same questions.     Id. He pleaded guilty to this criminal charge\n\nbut then appealed his conviction on double jeopardy grounds.              Id.\n\nat 61-62.    The state courts ruled that his guilty plea waived his\n\nright to assert a double jeopardy claim.             Id. at 62.   The Supreme\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fCourt reversed, holding that a guilty plea does not forgive the\n\nunconstitutionality of an indictment.     Id.\n\n          The Menna Court emphasized that a guilty plea acts\n\nprimarily to \"remove[] the issue of factual guilt from [a] case.\"\n\nId. at 62 n.2.       In most instances, factual guilt is the only\n\npertinent question and \"[a] guilty plea, therefore, simply renders\n\nirrelevant   those     constitutional   violations    not   logically\n\ninconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt.\"      Id.\n\nA guilty plea, however, does not bar a defendant from contending\n\n\"that the State may not convict [him] no matter how validly his\n\nfactual guilt is established.\"    Id.\n\n          The Commonwealth suggests that Broce trumps Menna.      We\n\nreject this suggestion. The guilty pleas in Broce admitted factual\n\nelements that were logically inconsistent with the defendants'\n\nsubsequent allegations of a constitutional breach.     See Broce, 488\n\nU.S. at 570-71.   In contrast, the defendant in Menna disputed the\n\nvery legitimacy of a second indictment; his guilty plea admitted no\n\nfactual predicate that sufficed to make irrelevant his double\n\njeopardy claim.   See Menna, 423 U.S. at 61.    The decision in Broce\n\ndid not overrule Menna, see Broce, 488 U.S. at 574 (\"Menna v. New\n\nYork . . . has no application to the case at bar.\"), and the\n\ndecision in Menna remains good law.     Therefore, we must adhere to\n\nit. See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza, 318 F.3d 323,\n\n335 n.19 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Our marching orders are clear:     follow\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f[Supreme Court] decisions until the Supreme Court overrules them.\")\n\n(quoting United Airlines, Inc. v. Mesa Airlines, Inc., 219 F.3d\n\n605, 608 (7th Cir. 2000)).\n\n            The distinction between Broce and Menna is critically\n\nimportant in the case at hand.     Here, as in Menna, the petitioner's\n\nchallenge    implicates   the   legitimacy   ab   initio   of   the   second\n\nindictment. He contends, in effect, that even assuming his factual\n\nguilt, the Commonwealth could not constitutionally prosecute him on\n\nthe armed robbery charge. Menna teaches that \"[w]here the State is\n\nprecluded by the United States Constitution from haling a defendant\n\ninto court on a charge, federal law requires that a conviction on\n\nthat charge be set aside even if the conviction was entered\n\npursuant to a counseled plea of guilty.\"          Menna, 423 U.S. at 62.\n\nThe petitioner's thesis is that the Commonwealth was so precluded\n\nhere, and, thus, acted unconstitutionally when it brought the\n\nsecond indictment.    This thesis — the validity of which we shall\n\ntest in     the next section of this opinion — presents a live\n\ncontroversy.    See id. at 62 n.2 (noting that \"a plea of guilty to\n\na charge does not waive a claim that — judged on its face — the\n\ncharge is one which the State may not constitutionally prosecute\").\n\nConsequently, the habeas case is not moot.         See Spencer, 523 U.S.\n\nat 7-8 (holding that a habeas petitioner satisfies the case or\n\ncontroversy requirement so long as he suffers from or is threatened\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fby a concrete injury that is traceable to allegedly improper state\n\naction and redressable by the invalidation of that action).\n\n                                  B.   The Merits.\n\n              We   divide   our    discussion    of   the    merits    into   three\n\nsegments corresponding to the petitioner's three principal claims.\n\n              1.     The Double Jeopardy Claim.             We review the SJC's\n\ndenial   of    the    petitioner's      double   jeopardy      claim   under   the\n\nconstraints of the AEDPA.              Consequently, we may grant relief\n\nthereunder only if the state court adjudication either \"resulted in\n\na decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), or\n\n\"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light\n\nof the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\" id. §\n\n2254(d)(2).\n\n              The relevant provision for purposes of this appeal is\n\nsection 2254(d)(1).         In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000),\n\nthe Supreme Court fleshed out a petitioner's obligations under that\n\nsection and outlined the narrow circumstances in which federal\n\nhabeas courts are permitted to disturb state convictions.                      The\n\nCourt interpreted \"contrary to\" to mean \"diametrically different\"\n\nor \"mutually opposed.\"            Id. at 405.     Therefore, a state court\n\ndecision is \"contrary to\" established Supreme Court precedent if\n\nthe state court manages to \"arrive[] at a conclusion opposite to\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fthat reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law\" or\n\n\"decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set\n\nof materially indistinguishable facts.\"     Id. at 413.\n\n          As to the other facet of section 2254(d)(1), the Court\n\nsaid that an \"unreasonable application\" of Supreme Court case law\n\noccurs if \"the state court identifies the correct governing legal\n\nprinciple from th[e] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies\n\nthat principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\"          Id.   This\n\ntype of scenario may emerge when a state court either \"unreasonably\n\nextends a legal principle . . . to a new context where it should\n\nnot apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new\n\ncontext where it should apply.\"    Id. at 407.   The Court emphasized,\n\nhowever, that not every incorrect application of federal law\n\namounts to an unreasonable application of federal law. Id. at 410.\n\nThe difference is one of degree.    See McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d\n\n24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (requiring an \"increment of\n\nincorrectness\" in the state court ruling that is \"great enough to\n\nmake the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective\n\njudgment of the federal court\").     It follows, then, that    a habeas\n\npetitioner must do more than merely identify an incorrect result.\n\n          We assess the petitioner's challenge to the SJC's double\n\njeopardy ruling under this restrictive framework.          The Double\n\nJeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \"be subject for the\n\nsame offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"          U.S.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fConst. amend. V, cl. 2.    This proviso affords protection in three\n\ndifferent types of situations:\n\n          It protects against a second prosecution for\n          the same offense after acquittal. It protects\n          against a second prosecution for the same\n          offense after conviction.     And it protects\n          against multiple punishments for the same\n          offense.\n\nUnited States v. Ortiz-Alarcon, 917 F.2d 651, 653 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(quoting N. Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969)); accord\n\nUnited States v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir. 1996); United\n\nStates v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 714 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          Building on the second of these three safeguards, the\n\npetitioner constructs the following hypothesis:          (1) he pleaded\n\nguilty to receiving stolen property and that plea ripened into a\n\nconviction; (2) from and after the date of that conviction, double\n\njeopardy protections precluded the Commonwealth from indicting him\n\nfor a mutually exclusive crime (for that would constitute \"the same\n\noffense\"); and (3) the crimes of receiving stolen property and\n\narmed robbery, when involving the same objects, are mutually\n\nexclusive.      Hence,   the   Double    Jeopardy   Clause   forbade   the\n\nCommonwealth from initiating the armed robbery prosecution.\n\n             The first element on which the petitioner's hypothesis\n\nrests is unassailable:    at least in these circumstances,       a guilty\n\nplea is itself a conviction.      See Kercheval v. United States, 274\n\nU.S. 220, 223 (1927).      The SJC assumed, without deciding, the\n\nvalidity of the third element.     See Jackson, 717 N.E.2d at 1003 &\n\n                                  -16-\n\fn.4 (suggesting that Massachusetts case law would deem the crimes\n\nof receiving stolen property and armed robbery of the same property\n\nto constitute a single offense).4          Since this is largely a question\n\nof Massachusetts law, we too will assume arguendo that a defendant\n\ncannot lawfully be convicted of both crimes.                Thus, our inquiry\n\nfocuses on the second element of the petitioner's hypothesis.\n\n              Central   to   our   analysis    is   a   recognition   that   the\n\npetitioner and the SJC have configured the double jeopardy issue\n\ndifferently.      The petitioner does not look beyond the fact of the\n\noriginal conviction for receiving stolen property, treating the\n\nvacation of that conviction as irrelevant to the double jeopardy\n\nanalysis.       In his view, the Commonwealth was constitutionally\n\nbarred from soliciting the armed robbery indictment after it\n\nobtained the original conviction for receiving stolen property; it\n\nsecured the armed robbery indictment while that conviction was\n\nstill    on    the   books;    and   so,      because    the   indictment    was\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Other courts have divided on whether a person may be\nconvicted of both robbery of certain property and receiving that\nproperty. Compare, e.g., Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415,\n419-20 (1959) (holding, under federal criminal statutes, that a\ndefendant may not be punished for both armed bank robbery and\nreceiving stolen bank property), and Dove v. Peyton, 343 F.2d 210,\n213-14 (4th Cir. 1965) (similar; applying Virginia law), with,\ne.g., Ex parte Howard, 710 So. 2d 460, 463 (Ala. 1997) (holding\nthat Alabama law permits a prosecution for robbery following a\nconviction for receiving stolen property), and State v. Sardeson,\n437 N.W.2d 473, 480-81 (Neb. 1989) (similar; applying Nebraska\nlaw).\n\n                                      -17-\n\funconstitutional when contrived, the Commonwealth should not have\n\nbeen permitted to pursue it.\n\n            The SJC used a wider-angled lens.                 It examined the\n\nconstitutionality of the second indictment in light of both the\n\nprior conviction and the subsequent vacation of that conviction.\n\nGauging the constitutionality of the armed robbery indictment from\n\nthat perspective, \"there [wa]s no longer a final adjudication of\n\nguilt or innocence\" on the receiving stolen property charge.\n\nJackson, 717 N.E.2d at 1003.          Far from deeming the petitioner's\n\nvoluntary withdrawal of his guilty plea as irrelevant, the SJC\n\nthought it was \"[c]ritical to the disposition\" of his double\n\njeopardy argument.       Id.   In short, the petitioner and the SJC were\n\narguing    past   each    other,   advocating     parallel     but   materially\n\ndifferent analyses.\n\n            Given the unique facts of this case, that discrepancy is\n\nproblematic for the petitioner.             On habeas review, the AEDPA\n\nrequires us to focus our attention on the state court's analysis.\n\nThe petitioner's obligation is not simply to offer a plausible\n\nargument   for    the    unconstitutionality      of   his   conviction,      but,\n\nrather, to identify how the state court's analytical path strayed\n\nbeyond permissible bounds.         See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n            In    this   instance,   the    SJC   relied     primarily   on   the\n\ndecision in United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82 (1978).              There, the\n\ndefendant sought and won dismissal of criminal charges. Id. at 84.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fAfter the government had appealed, he attempted to invoke double\n\njeopardy protections to forestall a subsequent trial.          Id.    The\n\nSupreme Court rejected this tactic, holding that the government\n\ncould appeal the dismissal without triggering double jeopardy\n\nconcerns.   Id. at 86-87.    The court pointed out that the defendant\n\nhad opted to move for dismissal in the first place and stated that\n\n\"the Double Jeopardy Clause . . . does not relieve a defendant from\n\nthe consequences of his voluntary choice.\"       Id. at 99.\n\n            The petitioner insists that Scott is inapposite.          He\n\nposits that its holding would apply only if he had moved to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea for receiving stolen property and then\n\nrelied upon the Double Jeopardy Clause in an effort to preclude the\n\nCommonwealth from retrying him on that same charge. The petitioner\n\nsees this case as falling instead within a different precedential\n\norbit.\n\n            One of the cases comprising that orbit is Blackledge v.\n\nPerry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974).      There, while a convicted defendant's\n\nappeal was pending, the government indicted him for a more serious\n\n(yet mutually exclusive) crime.       Id. at 22-23.    Even though the\n\ndefendant pleaded guilty to this second charge, the Supreme Court\n\nlater    approved   habeas   relief   because   it   found   the   second\n\nprosecution to be a vindictive response to the defendant's exercise\n\nof his right to appeal, so that \"[t]he very initiation of the\n\nproceedings . . . operated to deny [the petitioner] due process of\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\flaw.\"    Id. at 30-31.   The petitioner's second supporting authority\n\nis Menna.    As noted above, Menna prohibits a state from \"haling a\n\ndefendant into court on a charge\" when double jeopardy applies.\n\nMenna, 423 U.S. at 62.       The petitioner likens the armed robbery\n\nindictment    to   a   constructive   \"haling\"   that    the   Constitution\n\nprohibited the Commonwealth from pursuing.\n\n             To be sure, all three of these cases offer plausible\n\nanalogies to the case that confronts us.                The fact remains,\n\nhowever, that none of them is sufficiently on point to dictate the\n\nresult.     Scott differs materially from the instant case because\n\nthere, unlike here, the defendant's motion to vacate the original\n\nconviction was granted before the state sought a second (allegedly\n\nincompatible) indictment.5     See Scott, 437 U.S. at 84.       Blackledge\n\nis distinguishable because there, unlike here, the state's decision\n\nto pursue a second indictment had the effect of punishing the\n\ndefendant for exercising his right to appeal.       See Blackledge, 417\n\nU.S. at 28.    Menna is distinguishable because there, unlike here,\n\nthe second conviction occurred at a time when the first conviction\n\nremained intact.       See Menna, 423 U.S. at 61.       Since there is no\n\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent directly on point, the\n\nSJC's rejection of the petitioner's double jeopardy claim does not\n\ntransgress the \"contrary to\" prong of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).           See\n\n\n     5\n      This sequencing also serves to distinguish other cases on\nwhich the Commonwealth relies. See, e.g., Pearce, 395 U.S. at 719-\n20; United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671-72 (1896).\n\n                                  -20-\n\fWilliams, 529 U.S. at 405-06; see also Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d\n\n19, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Where a relevant but not factually\n\ncongruent precedent exists, the state court need only apply a test\n\nconsistent with the one announced by the Supreme Court in order to\n\navoid the toils of section 2254(d)(1)'s 'contrary to' clause.\").\n\n           Given the idiosyncratic nature of this case and the\n\ndearth of pertinent authority, we likewise conclude that the SJC's\n\nreliance on Scott, rather than Blackledge or Menna, is not an\n\nunreasonable application of Supreme Court case law. Reasonableness\n\ndepends   on     context.         For   the     purposes     of    determining         the\n\nreasonableness      of    a   state       court's     decision       under        section\n\n2254(d)(1), we have declared that \"if it is a close question\n\nwhether the state decision is in error, then the state decision\n\ncannot be an unreasonable application.\"               McCambridge, 303 F.3d at\n\n36.   This principle carries the day here.              There is support in the\n\nSupreme Court's      case     law   for    the    competing       positions       of   the\n\npetitioner and the SJC, and nothing in Blackledge, Menna, or their\n\nprogeny is so compelling as to render the SJC's reliance on Scott\n\nunreasonable.\n\n           The     petitioner's         fallback     position      bears      a     close\n\nrelationship to his main argument.                  He asserts that since the\n\nCommonwealth was constitutionally barred from indicting him for\n\narmed   robbery    when     the   grand    jury     acted,   it    could     cure      the\n\nconstitutional violation only by restoring the status quo ante\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f(that is, by withdrawing the offending indictment).              To support\n\nthis claim, the petitioner leans heavily upon a concurring opinion\n\nauthored by Justice Blackmun and a smattering of decisions from\n\nfederal courts of appeals.      See, e.g., Morris v. Mathews, 475 U.S.\n\n237, 255 (1986) (Blackmun, J., concurring); Murphy v. Puckett, 893\n\nF.2d 94, 97 (5th Cir. 1990).\n\n            We need not dwell on these authorities because none of\n\nthem suffices to overcome the obstacle created by the AEDPA.              The\n\nreference in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) to \"clearly established Federal\n\nlaw\" encompasses only the holdings of the Supreme Court.                  See\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 412 (\"That statutory phrase refers to the\n\nholdings,   as   opposed   to   the   dicta,   of   th[e   Supreme]   Court's\n\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\");\n\nRashad v. Walsh, 300 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that\n\n\"factually similar cases from the lower federal courts may inform\"\n\ndeterminations under section 2254(d)(1), but only Supreme Court\n\nholdings can provide the \"seal of approval\").          Generally speaking,\n\nthis formulation excludes concurring and dissenting opinions of\n\nindividual Justices as well as decisions of the courts of appeals.6\n\n\n     6\n      We hasten to add that authorities of this kind occasionally\nmay offer insight into a section 2254(d)(1) determination. We have\nacknowledged, for example, that \"[r]eference to such cases may be\nespecially helpful when the governing Supreme Court precedent\narticulates a broad principle that applies to a wide variety of\nfactual patterns.\"    Ouber, 293 F.3d at 26.     That principle is\ninapposite here inasmuch as the petitioner advances a proposition\nthat simply has not been embraced by the Supreme Court.         The\npetitioner's authorities are the proposition's originating sources,\n\n                                      -22-\n\f           On a more fundamental level, the petitioner's argument\n\nagain fails to address the bona fides of the SJC's approach.             Even\n\nif the Commonwealth were barred from indicting the petitioner for\n\narmed robbery before the conviction for receiving stolen property\n\nwas   vacated,   our   decision   must    account    for    the   petitioner's\n\nvoluntary motion to vacate that conviction — a step that opened the\n\ndoor for the successful prosecution of the armed robbery charge.\n\nThe SJC ruled that the Commonwealth was not constitutionally barred\n\nfrom pursuing the second indictment after the vacation of the first\n\nconviction at the petitioner's behest.              Jackson, 717 N.E.2d at\n\n1003.   For the reasons discussed above, that ruling — whether or\n\nnot precisely correct as a matter of constitutional law — neither\n\ncontravenes nor unreasonably applies Supreme Court precedent.              On\n\nthis record, then, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not open an\n\navenue leading to habeas relief.\n\n           2.    The Collateral Estoppel Claim.            We turn next to the\n\npetitioner's asseveration that principles of collateral estoppel\n\nprecluded a finding that he committed the armed robbery.              Section\n\n2254(d)(1) governs this asseveration as well, so our analysis of it\n\nassumes the same contours as our discussion of the petitioner's\n\ndouble jeopardy claim.\n\n\n\n\nnot clarifying or explanatory sources; as such they do not meet the\ndemands of section 2254(d)(1).\n\n                                   -23-\n\f           Collateral estoppel \"means simply that when a[n] issue of\n\nultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final\n\njudgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same\n\nparties in any future lawsuit.\"     Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443\n\n(1970). The petitioner seeks to apply this tenet in support of the\n\nclaim that the conviction for receiving stolen property remained a\n\nvalid and final judgment notwithstanding its vacation (and, thus,\n\nprecluded the Commonwealth from proceeding on the armed robbery\n\ncharge).   To this end, he insists that the conviction rested on the\n\nfactual predicate that he received stolen property; that its\n\nvacation had no corrosive effect on these (previously established)\n\nultimate facts; and that, therefore, the indictment accusing him of\n\nstealing that very property was founded on a legal impossibility.\n\nThe SJC rejected this theory, concluding that vacatur of the\n\nconviction meant that \"there now is no final determination of the\n\nfacts,\" so that \"[c]ollateral estoppel does not apply.\"         Jackson,\n\n717 N.E.2d at 1004.\n\n           This   conclusion   is   neither    contrary   to,   nor   an\n\nunreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent.       After all,\n\nit is hornbook law that \"[a] vacated judgment has no preclusive\n\nforce either as a matter of collateral or direct estoppel or as a\n\nmatter of the law of the case.\"          No East-West Highway Comm. v.\n\nChandler, 767 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1985); accord U.S. Philips\n\nCorp. v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 55 F.3d 592, 598 (Fed. Cir. 1995);\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fFranklin Sav. Ass'n v. Office of Thrift Superv., 35 F.3d 1466, 1469\n\n(10th Cir. 1994); 18A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice\n\nand Procedure § 4432 (2002).       The petitioner points to no decision\n\nof the Supreme Court that casts doubt upon this hoary principle.\n\nThus, the AEDPA forbids us from disturbing the SJC's resolution of\n\nthe collateral estoppel claim.\n\n            3.   The Due Process Claim.       The petitioner also contends\n\nthat the vacation of his conviction for receiving stolen property\n\noccurred at the expense of his right to procedural due process.\n\nThis abridgement occurred, the petitioner says, when the Cambridge\n\nDistrict Court \"denied [him] a meaningful opportunity to be heard\n\non his motion [to vacate his conviction].\"            Appellant's Br. at 37.\n\nThe federal district court determined that this claim was not ripe\n\nfor habeas review since its merits had never been fully adjudicated\n\nby the state courts.      Jackson v. Coalter, 2002 WL 1760879, at *3.\n\nWe uphold this determination.\n\n            The AEDPA directs that habeas relief \"shall not be\n\ngranted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the\n\nremedies available in the courts of the State.\"                 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(b)(1)(A).       This exhaustion requirement codified preexisting\n\nlaw.     The Supreme Court has long maintained \"that as a matter of\n\ncomity, federal courts should not consider a claim in a habeas\n\ncorpus    petition    until    after    the   state   courts   have   had   an\n\nopportunity to act.\"          Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 515 (1982)\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f(discussing Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251 (1886)).          We have\n\ninterpreted this imperative as requiring a habeas petitioner to\n\n\"have presented both the factual and legal underpinnings of his\n\nclaim to the state courts in order for us to find it exhausted.\"\n\nNadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1st Cir. 1989).          Moreover,\n\nwe have made no bones about the fact that a failure to exhaust\n\nordinarily is \"fatal\" to the prosecution of a habeas petition.\n\nMartens v. Shannon, 836 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          The   petitioner   concedes    that,    as   a   general   rule,\n\nexhaustion is required.   He maintains, however, that he exhausted\n\nthis claim by invoking due process protections in the state courts.\n\nThis is partially true, but misleading.          The issue that he now\n\nseeks to advance was never properly exhausted. We explain briefly.\n\n          The petitioner mounted two legal campaigns that led him\n\nto the SJC.     The first foray culminated in the SJC's opinion\n\nrejecting his double jeopardy and collateral estoppel claims.          See\n\nJackson, 717 N.E.2d at 1003-04.         Careful perscrutation of the\n\nrecord indicates that the petitioner never adequately articulated\n\na due process claim at or before that stage of the proceedings.\n\nThe closest that he came was his plaint that the Cambridge District\n\nCourt allowed his \"uncounseled\" motion to vacate the original\n\nconviction despite the fact that he \"needed counsel to determine\n\nwhether to proceed with the motion at all.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -26-\n\f           The SJC treated this plaint as a claim rooted in the\n\npetitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel and concluded that no\n\nviolation of that right had occurred.           Id. at 1005.       This was a\n\nreasonable reading of the petitioner's claim as then presented.7\n\nMore importantly, it did not suffice to exhaust the differently\n\ngrounded Fifth Amendment claim that the petitioner now seeks to\n\npursue.   See Adelson v. DiPaola, 131 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(holding that to satisfy the exhaustion requirement \"a habeas\n\npetitioner    bears   a   heavy   burden   to   show   that   he   fairly   and\n\nrecognizably presented to the state courts the factual and legal\n\nbases of this federal claim\"); Martens, 836 F.2d at 717 (\"[T]he\n\nexhaustion doctrine requires a habeas applicant to do more than\n\nscatter some makeshift needles in the haystack of the state court\n\nrecord.   The ground relied upon must be presented face-up and\n\nsquarely; the federal question must be plainly defined.\").\n\n             Following the SJC's rejection of his initial appeal, the\n\npetitioner persevered in the state courts.               During his second\n\ncampaign, he filed a motion to dismiss the armed robbery charge —\n\na motion that included a better-articulated due process claim. The\n\nSuffolk Superior Court rejected that claim, but the SJC refused to\n\nentertain an immediate appeal, holding that interlocutory review\n\nwas not available.        Jackson v. Commonwealth, 770 N.E.2d 469, 471\n\n\n     7\n      Before us, the petitioner does not challenge the SJC's\nresolution of his Sixth Amendment claim. Accordingly, we take no\nview of that ruling.\n\n                                    -27-\n\f(Mass. 2002) (noting that the petitioner had \"failed to demonstrate\n\nthat an appeal following conviction on the armed robbery charges\n\nwould not be adequate\").8         Since the date of that ruling, the\n\npetitioner has done nothing further to exhaust this due process\n\nclaim in the state courts.       The state courts, therefore, have not\n\nhad    an     appropriate   opportunity    to   adjudicate   the   claim.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's determination that the\n\npetitioner's procedural due process claim is unexhausted.          See   28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(c) (\"An applicant shall not be deemed to have\n\nexhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within\n\nthe meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of\n\nthe State to raise, by any available procedure, the question\n\npresented.\"); cf. Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d 817, 820\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (requiring that \"one who seeks to invoke the\n\nfederal habeas power must fairly present — or do his best to\n\npresent — the issue to the state's highest tribunal\").\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.   The petitioner, ably represented\n\nbefore us by appointed counsel, has raised difficult issues.             In\n\n\n       8\n      Adopting the rule in Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651,\n660-62 (1977), Massachusetts affords interlocutory review of double\njeopardy claims. See Neverson v. Commonwealth, 546 N.E.2d 876, 877\n(Mass. 1989) (\"A criminal defendant who raises a double jeopardy\nclaim of substantial merit is entitled to review of the claim\nbefore he is retried.\"). Most other issues must await the entry of\nfinal judgment before a right of appellate review attaches. See\nS.J.C. Rule 2:21(2); see also Glawson v. Commonwealth, 764 N.E.2d\n869, 869-70 (Mass. 2002).\n\n                                   -28-\n\fthe end, however, he cannot prevail.           Although we agree that his\n\nguilty   plea   to   the   armed   robbery    charge     did    not    render   his\n\napplication for habeas relief moot, we nonetheless conclude that\n\nthe application fails on the merits.\n\n\n\n           The district court's order of September 12, 2002 is\n\nvacated.      The    district   court's     order   of   July    30,    2002     is\n\nreinstated.     The judgment in favor of the respondent is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f",

The case has taken innumerable twists and turns. It began when the petitioner pleaded guilty to a charged crime, started serving a state-imposed sentence, and then was charged with a second, more serious crime &#8212; one potentially incompatible with the first. He responded by moving to vacate his original conviction. The state court granted his motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On reflection, the petitioner moved to reinstate that conviction and attempted instead to raise a double jeopardy defense to the second charge. The state courts (trial and appellate) rebuffed these initiatives, and the petitioner repaired to the federal courts. The district court denied the petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, ruling that the vacation of the first conviction thwarted any claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that were not complicated enough, the petitioner then struck out in a new direction. During the pendency of the federal habeas proceeding, he pleaded guilty to the second charge in exchange for a reduced sentence. After learning what had transpired, the district court rescinded its earlier ruling and dismissed the habeas petition as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner assails both of the district court's orders. We agree with the petitioner that, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, his guilty plea to the second charge did not render the habeas proceeding moot. Nevertheless, we affirm the denial of habeas relief. Adhering to the strictures of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), we conclude that the state courts neither acted contrary to, nor unreasonably applied, Supreme Court precedent when they refused to honor the petitioner's claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the afternoon of March 20, 1996, an armed intruder entered a doctor's office in Jamaica Plain and departed with, among other things, a checkbook. Later that day, police in Cambridge arrested petitioner-appellant Arthur Jackson while he was attempting to cash one of the purloined checks. The locales are significant because prosecutorial responsibility in Massachusetts operates on a county-by-county basis. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 12-32. Jamaica Plain (where the robbery took place) is in Suffolk County but Cambridge (where the attempted check-passing occurred) is in Middlesex County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Middlesex County District Attorney charged the petitioner with receiving stolen property (the purloined checks), he entered a guilty plea to that charge in Cambridge District Court. The court imposed a thirty-month sentence (one year to serve and the balance suspended). The petitioner began serving his sentence on April 4, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One day later, the Suffolk County District Attorney swore out a criminal complaint charging the petitioner with armed robbery in connection with the March 20 heist. The petitioner first learned of this charge five months into his incarcerative term when an outstanding arrest warrant (which had never been served) rendered him ineligible to participate in a work-release program. Fearing that his guilty plea to receiving stolen property would be used against him at a trial for armed robbery, the petitioner filed a pro se motion on November 25, 1996. The motion sought to withdraw the earlier plea, annul the petitioner's conviction, and set the stage for a new trial on the original charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The gist of the petitioner's argument was that the presiding judge in the Cambridge District Court had conducted an insufficient colloquy and, therefore, had erred in accepting his guilty plea. <i>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Lopez,</i> 426 Mass. 657, 690 N.E.2d 809, 812 (1998) (discussing the constitutional requirements for acceptance of a guilty plea); <i>see also</i> Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c) (establishing certain procedural prerequisites for same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 5, 1996, the petitioner was summonsed to the West Roxbury District Court for arraignment on the Suffolk County complaint. One week later, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted him for armed robbery. The new indictment included an allegation that the petitioner was a habitual offender. If proven, this allegation would require a sentence of life imprisonment. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 17; <i>id.</i> ch. 279, &#167; 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1996, the petitioner completed serving the incarcerative portion of his sentence for receiving stolen property. His freedom was short-lived. When he appeared the next week at Suffolk Superior Court for a pretrial hearing on the armed robbery charge, he was detained. His detention lasted from that date (January 2, 1997) until his eventual release, under circumstances that we shortly shall explain, on July 2, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1997, the petitioner appeared pro se in the Cambridge District Court for a hearing on his previously filed motion to vacate his conviction for receiving stolen property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At the request of court personnel, an itinerant attorney consulted with the petitioner and informed the presiding judge that the petitioner \"really need[ed] to be represented by counsel in this case.\" The lawyer urged the court to withhold any action until the petitioner's court-appointed counsel in the armed robbery case could appear. Speaking for himself, the petitioner pressed for vacation of the receiving stolen property conviction, emphasizing that he had not been given proper warnings in advance of his guilty plea. The court announced its intention to listen to a tape recording of the plea proceeding and continued the hearing until January 30 so the petitioner's attorney could attend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that remain obscure, neither the petitioner nor his court-appointed counsel in the armed robbery case appeared at the January 30 hearing. The court, however, had reviewed the tape of the plea proceeding and found the colloquy inadequate. Stating that \"I am the one who erred, and I am correcting the error now,\" the presiding judge vacated the petitioner's conviction for receiving stolen property. The district attorney's office eventually declined to reprosecute the receiving stolen property charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The armed robbery case remained velivolant and, after several months had passed, the petitioner began to have second thoughts about his strategy. On November 19, 1997, he filed a counseled motion in the Cambridge District Court requesting the reinstatement of his prior conviction. At around the same time, he filed a counseled motion in the Suffolk Superior Court seeking dismissal of the armed robbery charge on double jeopardy grounds. Both motions were denied. The petitioner then appealed the double jeopardy ruling to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC). A single justice of the SJC, acting pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &#167; 3, ruled that the petitioner's interlocutory appeal was immediately reviewable but nonetheless rejected the appeal on the merits. On October 14, 1999, the full court affirmed that decision. <i>See Jackson v. Commonwealth,</i> 430 Mass. 260, 717 N.E.2d 1001, 1005 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While still awaiting trial in the armed robbery case, the petitioner filed a federal habeas petition. The federal district court held a hearing on March 7, 2002, and took the matter under advisement. On July 2, 2002, the petitioner and Suffolk County prosecutors reached an accord anent the armed robbery charge: in exchange for the petitioner's guilty plea, the Commonwealth agreed to abandon the habitual offender allegation and recommend a \"time-served\" sentence. The Suffolk Superior Court accepted the plea, imposed the agreed sentence, and released the petitioner on a term of supervised probation. The federal district court later stated that it was not notified of these developments when they occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 30, 2002, the federal district court, still unaware of the recent plea, denied the petition for habeas relief on the merits. <i>See Jackson v. Coalter,</i> 2002 WL 1760879, at *4 (D.Mass. July 30, 2002). Approximately two weeks later, the Commonwealth moved to reconsider the order. In that motion, the Attorney General informed the court of the plea bargain in the armed robbery case and argued that the consummation of that bargain rendered the habeas petition moot. The district court agreed; in successive orders, it first vacated its earlier merits decision and then dismissed the habeas petition as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner seasonably appealed both the order of dismissal on the merits and the subsequent order declaring the controversy moot. The appeal is properly before us, as the district court has granted a broadly worded certificate of appealability. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail in this appeal, the petitioner must overcome two adverse rulings. Common sense suggests that we address these rulings in reverse chronological order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Mootness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford plenary review to the district court's determination that the petitioner's guilty plea to the armed robbery charge rendered his habeas petition moot. <i>See Simpson v. Matesanz,</i> 175 F.3d 200, 205 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1994). Initially, however, we deal with a pair of preliminary matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we note that even though the guilty plea to the armed robbery charge ended the petitioner's incarceration, he remains under supervised probation. Thus, he is still sufficiently \"in custody\" to pursue federal habeas relief. <i>See Lefkowitz v. Fair,</i> 816 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases); <i>see generally Jones v. Cunningham,</i> 371 U.S. 236, 240, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963) (holding that the \"in custody\" requirement for habeas relief necessitates only \"restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the petitioner filed his habeas application under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. The district court perspicaciously observed that the petitioner was still awaiting trial on the armed robbery charge when he sought habeas relief; that his status was, therefore, that of a pretrial detainee; and that this circumstance called into question the appropriateness of the jurisdictional allegation. <i>See Jackson v. Coalter,</i> 2002 WL 1760879, at *1; <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(a) (indicating that section 2254 relief is available only to \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"). The district court nonetheless proceeded to adjudicate the matter on the basis that, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c)(3), a writ of habeas corpus is potentially available to any state prisoner \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws ... of the United States.\" This problem does not concern us inasmuch as the petitioner has now pleaded guilty to the armed robbery charge, and his guilty plea subjected him to a state court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the question of mootness. A habeas petition is moot if it fails to present a live case or controversy. <i>See Spencer v. Kemna,</i> 523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <i>see generally Lewis v. Cont'l Bank Corp.,</i> 494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990) (explaining that the \"case-or-controversy requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings\"). The question before us is whether the petitioner's guilty plea foreclosed his habeas claims (and, thus, rendered his petition moot).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing the affirmative of the proposition, the Commonwealth chiefly relies upon the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Broce,</i> 488 U.S. 563, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989). In <i>Broce,</i> the defendants were charged with rigging two separate sets of bids for state highway contracts. <i>Id.</i> at 565, 109 S.Ct. 757. They eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 566, 109 S.Ct. 757. After another court, trying a different group of defendants, had ruled that the rigged bids were part and parcel of a single conspiracy, the <i>Broce</i> defendants mounted a collateral attack on their second conviction. <i>Id.</i> at 567, 109 S.Ct. 757. The Supreme Court concluded that \"[a] plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 569, 109 S.Ct. 757. Consequently, the defendants' guilty pleas foreclosed any opportunity to revisit the factual predicate upon which their convictions rested. <i>See id.</i> at 571, 109 S.Ct. 757 (\"When respondents pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy on the explicit premise of two agreements which started at different times and embraced separate objectives, they conceded guilt to two separate offenses.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth says that <i>Broce</i> stands for the black-letter rule that a defendant's guilty plea pretermits any subsequent collateral attack aimed at negating the resulting conviction. That formulation, however, reaches beyond the holding in <i>Broce,</i> which contemplated \"exception[s] to the rule barring collateral attack on a guilty plea.\" <i>Id.</i> at 574, 109 S.Ct. 757. The exceptions include guilty pleas such as that discussed in <i>Menna v. New York,</i> 423 U.S. 61, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975) (per curiam), that is, pleas entered in response to charges \"which the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Menna</i> is of considerable interest here. In that case, the defendant, having been granted immunity, refused to testify and was sentenced for contempt of court. <i>Id.</i> at 61, 96 S.Ct. 241. After his release, the state indicted him for once again refusing to answer the same questions. <i>Id.</i> He pleaded guilty to this criminal charge but then appealed his conviction on double jeopardy grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 61-62, 96 S.Ct. 241. The state courts ruled that his guilty plea waived his right to assert a double jeopardy claim. <i>Id.</i> at 62, 96 S.Ct. 241. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that a guilty plea does not forgive the unconstitutionality of an indictment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Menna</i> Court emphasized that a guilty plea acts primarily to \"remove[] the issue of factual guilt from [a] case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241. In most instances, factual guilt is the only pertinent question and \"[a] guilty plea, therefore, simply renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt.\" <i>Id.</i> A guilty plea, however, does not bar a defendant from contending \"that the State may not convict [him] no matter how validly his factual guilt is established.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth suggests that <i>Broce</i> trumps <i>Menna.</i> We reject this suggestion. The guilty pleas in <i>Broce</i> admitted factual elements that were logically inconsistent with the defendants' subsequent allegations of a constitutional breach. <i>See Broce,</i> 488 U.S. at 570-71, 109 S.Ct. 757. In contrast, the defendant in <i>Menna</i> disputed the very legitimacy of a second indictment; his guilty plea admitted no factual predicate that sufficed to make irrelevant his double jeopardy claim. <i>See Menna,</i> 423 U.S. at 61, 96 S.Ct. 241. The decision in <i>Broce</i> did not overrule <i>Menna, see Broce,</i> 488 U.S. at 574, 109 S.Ct. 757 (\"<i>Menna v. New York</i>... has no application to the case at bar.\"), and the decision in <i>Menna</i> remains good law. Therefore, we must adhere to it. <i>See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 335 n. 19 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Our marching orders are clear: follow [Supreme Court] decisions until the Supreme Court overrules them.\") (quoting <i>United Airlines, Inc. v. Mesa Airlines, Inc.,</i> 219 F.3d 605, 608 (7th Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between <i>Broce</i> and <i>Menna</i> is critically important in the case at hand. Here, as in <i>Menna,</i> the petitioner's challenge implicates the legitimacy <i>ab initio</i> of the second indictment. He contends, in effect, that even assuming his factual guilt, the Commonwealth could not constitutionally prosecute him on the armed robbery charge. <i>Menna</i> teaches that \"[w]here the State is precluded by the United States Constitution from haling a defendant into court on a charge, federal law requires that a conviction on that charge be set aside even if the conviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty.\" <i>Menna,</i> 423 U.S. at 62, 96 S.Ct. 241. The petitioner's thesis is that the Commonwealth was so precluded here, and, thus, acted unconstitutionally when it brought the second indictment. This thesis &#8212; the validity of which we shall test in the next section of this opinion &#8212; presents a live controversy. <i>See id.</i> at 62 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241 (noting that \"a plea of guilty to a charge does not waive a claim that &#8212; judged on its face &#8212; the charge is one which the State may not constitutionally prosecute\"). Consequently, the habeas case is not moot. <i>See Spencer,</i> 523 U.S. at 7-8, 118 S.Ct. 978 (holding that a habeas petitioner satisfies the case or controversy requirement so long as he suffers from or is threatened by a concrete injury that is traceable to allegedly improper state action and redressable by the invalidation of that action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the merits into three segments corresponding to the petitioner's three principal claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Double Jeopardy Claim.</i> We review the SJC's denial of the petitioner's double jeopardy claim under the constraints of the AEDPA. Consequently, we may grant relief thereunder only if the state court adjudication either \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2254(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant provision for purposes of this appeal is section 2254(d)(1). In <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), the Supreme Court fleshed out a petitioner's obligations under that section and outlined the narrow circumstances in which federal habeas courts are permitted to disturb state convictions. The Court interpreted \"contrary to\" to mean \"diametrically different\" or \"mutually opposed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Therefore, a state court decision is \"contrary to\" established Supreme Court precedent if the state court manages to \"arrive[] at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law\" or \"decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the other facet of section 2254(d)(1), the Court said that an \"unreasonable application\" of Supreme Court case law occurs if \"the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from th[e] Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> This type of scenario may emerge when a state court either \"unreasonably extends a legal principle... to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\" <i>Id.</i> at 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495. The Court emphasized, however, that not every incorrect application of federal law amounts to an unreasonable application of federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495. The difference is one of degree. <i>See McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (requiring an \"increment of incorrectness\" in the state court ruling that is \"great enough to make the decision unreasonable in the independent and objective judgment of the federal court\"). It follows, then, that a habeas petitioner must do more than merely identify an incorrect result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assess the petitioner's challenge to the SJC's double jeopardy ruling under this restrictive framework. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 2. This proviso affords protection in three different types of situations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Ortiz-Alarcon,</i> 917 F.2d 651, 653 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>N. Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969)); <i>accord United States v. Morris,</i> 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Stoller,</i> 78 F.3d 710, 714 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Building on the second of these three safeguards, the petitioner constructs the following hypothesis: (1) he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property and that plea ripened into a conviction; (2) from and after the date of that conviction, double jeopardy protections precluded the Commonwealth from indicting him for a mutually exclusive crime (for that would constitute \"the same offense\"); and (3) the crimes of receiving stolen property and armed robbery, when involving the same objects, are mutually exclusive. Hence, the Double Jeopardy Clause forbade the Commonwealth from initiating the armed robbery prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first element on which the petitioner's hypothesis rests is unassailable: at least in these circumstances, a guilty plea is itself a conviction. <i>See Kercheval v. United States,</i> 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927). The SJC assumed, without deciding, the validity of the third element. <i>See Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003 &amp; n. 4 (suggesting that Massachusetts case law would deem the crimes of receiving stolen property and armed robbery of the same property to constitute a single offense).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Since this is largely a question of Massachusetts law, we too will assume arguendo that a defendant cannot lawfully be convicted of both crimes. Thus, our inquiry focuses on the second element of the petitioner's hypothesis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Central to our analysis is a recognition that the petitioner and the SJC have configured the double jeopardy issue differently. The petitioner does not look beyond the fact of the original conviction for receiving stolen property, treating the vacation of that conviction as irrelevant to the double jeopardy analysis. In his view, the Commonwealth was constitutionally barred from soliciting the armed robbery indictment after it obtained the original conviction for receiving stolen property; it secured the armed robbery indictment while that conviction was still on the books; and so, because the indictment was unconstitutional when contrived, the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to pursue it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC used a wider-angled lens. It examined the constitutionality of the second indictment in light of both the prior conviction and the subsequent vacation of that conviction. Gauging the constitutionality of the armed robbery indictment from that perspective, \"there [wa]s no longer a final adjudication of guilt or innocence\" on the receiving stolen property charge. <i>Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003. Far from deeming the petitioner's voluntary withdrawal of his guilty plea as irrelevant, the SJC thought it was \"[c]ritical to the disposition\" of his double jeopardy argument. <i>Id.</i> In short, the petitioner and the SJC were arguing past each other, advocating parallel but materially different analyses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the unique facts of this case, that discrepancy is problematic for the petitioner. On habeas review, the AEDPA requires us to focus our attention on the state court's analysis. The petitioner's obligation is not simply to offer a plausible argument for the unconstitutionality of his conviction, but, rather, to identify how the state court's analytical path strayed beyond permissible bounds. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the SJC relied primarily on the decision in <i>United States v. Scott,</i> 437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978). There, the defendant sought and won dismissal of criminal charges. <i>Id.</i> at 84, 98 S.Ct. 2187. After the government had appealed, he attempted to invoke double jeopardy protections to forestall a subsequent trial. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court rejected this tactic, holding that the government could appeal the dismissal without triggering double jeopardy concerns. <i>Id.</i> at 86-87, 98 S.Ct. 2187. The court pointed out that the defendant had opted to move for dismissal in the first place and stated that \"the Double Jeopardy Clause ... does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 99, 98 S.Ct. 2187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner insists that <i>Scott</i> is inapposite. He posits that its holding would apply only if he had moved to withdraw his guilty plea for receiving stolen property and then relied upon the Double Jeopardy Clause in an effort to preclude the Commonwealth from retrying him <i>on that same charge.</i> The petitioner sees this case as falling instead within a different precedential orbit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the cases comprising that orbit is <i>Blackledge v. Perry,</i> 417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974). There, while a convicted defendant's appeal was pending, the government indicted him for a more serious (yet mutually exclusive) crime. <i>Id.</i> at 22-23, 94 S.Ct. 2098. Even though the defendant pleaded guilty to this second charge, the Supreme Court later approved habeas relief because it found the second prosecution to be a vindictive response to the defendant's exercise of his right to appeal, so that \"[t]he very initiation of the proceedings ... operated to deny [the petitioner] due process of law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 30-31, 94 S.Ct. 2098. The petitioner's second supporting authority is <i>Menna.</i> As noted above, <i>Menna</i> prohibits a state from \"haling a defendant into court on a charge\" when double jeopardy applies. <i>Menna,</i> 423 U.S. at 62, 96 S.Ct. 241. The petitioner likens the armed robbery indictment to a constructive \"haling\" that the Constitution prohibited the Commonwealth from pursuing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, all three of these cases offer plausible analogies to the case that confronts us. The fact remains, however, that none of them is sufficiently on point to dictate the result. <i>Scott</i> differs materially from the instant case because there, unlike here, the defendant's motion to vacate the original conviction was granted <i>before</i> the state sought a second (allegedly incompatible) indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Scott,</i> 437 U.S. at 84, 98 S.Ct. 2187. <i>Blackledge</i> is distinguishable because there, unlike here, the state's decision to pursue a second indictment had the effect of punishing the defendant for exercising his right to appeal. <i>See Blackledge,</i> 417 U.S. at 28, 94 S.Ct. 2098. <i>Menna</i> is distinguishable because there, unlike here, the second conviction occurred at a time when the first conviction remained intact. <i>See Menna,</i> 423 U.S. at 61, 96 S.Ct. 241. Since there is no clearly established Supreme Court precedent directly on point, the SJC's rejection of the petitioner's double jeopardy claim does not transgress the \"contrary to\" prong of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). <i>See Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <i>see also Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.2002) (\"Where a relevant but not factually congruent precedent exists, the state court need only apply a test consistent with the one announced by the Supreme Court in order to avoid the toils of section 2254(d)(1)'s `contrary to' clause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the idiosyncratic nature of this case and the dearth of pertinent authority, we likewise conclude that the SJC's reliance on <i>Scott,</i> rather than <i>Blackledge</i> or <i>Menna,</i> is not an unreasonable application of Supreme Court case law. Reasonableness depends on context. For the purposes of determining the reasonableness of a state court's decision under section 2254(d)(1), we have declared that \"if it is a close question whether the state decision is in error, then the state decision cannot be an unreasonable application.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 303 F.3d at 36. This principle carries the day here. There is support in the Supreme Court's case law for the competing positions of the petitioner and the SJC, and nothing in <i>Blackledge, Menna,</i> or their progeny is so compelling as to render the SJC's reliance on <i>Scott</i> unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fallback position bears a close relationship to his main argument. He asserts that since the Commonwealth was constitutionally barred from indicting him for armed robbery when the grand jury acted, it could cure the constitutional violation only by restoring the status quo ante (that is, by withdrawing the offending indictment). To support this claim, the petitioner leans heavily upon a concurring opinion authored by Justice Blackmun and a smattering of decisions from federal courts of appeals. <i>See, e.g., Morris v. Mathews,</i> 475 U.S. 237, 255, 106 S.Ct. 1032, 89 L.Ed.2d 187 (1986) (Blackmun, J., concurring); <i>Murphy v. Puckett,</i> 893 F.2d 94, 97 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on these authorities because none of them suffices to overcome the obstacle created by the AEDPA. The reference in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1) to \"clearly established Federal law\" encompasses only the <i>holdings</i> of the Supreme Court. <i>See Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495 (\"That statutory phrase refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of th[e Supreme] Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\"); <i>Rashad v. Walsh,</i> 300 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"factually similar cases from the lower federal courts may inform\" determinations under section 2254(d)(1), but only Supreme Court holdings can provide the \"seal of approval\"). Generally speaking, this formulation excludes concurring and dissenting opinions of individual Justices as well as decisions of the courts of appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a more fundamental level, the petitioner's argument again fails to address the bona fides of the SJC's approach. Even if the Commonwealth were barred from indicting the petitioner for armed robbery before the conviction for receiving stolen property was vacated, our decision must account for the petitioner's voluntary motion to vacate that conviction &#8212; a step that opened the door for the successful prosecution of the armed robbery charge. The SJC ruled that the Commonwealth was not constitutionally barred from pursuing the second indictment after the vacation of the first conviction at the petitioner's behest. <i>Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003. For the reasons discussed above, that ruling &#8212; whether or not precisely correct as a matter of constitutional law &#8212; neither contravenes nor unreasonably applies Supreme Court precedent. On this record, then, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not open an avenue leading to habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Collateral Estoppel Claim.</i> We turn next to the petitioner's asseveration that principles of collateral estoppel precluded a finding that he committed the armed robbery. Section 2254(d)(1) governs this asseveration as well, so our analysis of it assumes the same contours as our discussion of the petitioner's double jeopardy claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collateral estoppel \"means simply that when a[n] issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\" <i>Ashe v. Swenson,</i> 397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). The petitioner seeks to apply this tenet in support of the claim that the conviction for receiving stolen property remained a valid and final judgment notwithstanding its vacation (and, thus, precluded the Commonwealth from proceeding on the armed robbery charge). To this end, he insists that the conviction rested on the factual predicate that he received stolen property; that its vacation had no corrosive effect on these (previously established) ultimate facts; and that, therefore, the indictment accusing him of stealing that very property was founded on a legal impossibility. The SJC rejected this theory, concluding that vacatur of the conviction meant that \"there now is no final determination of the facts,\" so that \"[c]ollateral estoppel does not apply.\" <i>Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. After all, it is hornbook law that \"[a] vacated judgment has no preclusive force either as a matter of collateral or direct estoppel or as a matter of the law of the case.\" <i>No East-West Highway Comm. v. Chandler,</i> 767 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1985); <i>accord U.S. Philips Corp. v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 55 F.3d 592, 598 (Fed.Cir.1995); <i>Franklin Savs. Ass'n v. Office of Thrift Superv.,</i> 35 F.3d 1466, 1469 (10th Cir.1994); 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4432 (2002). The petitioner points to no decision of the Supreme Court that casts doubt upon this hoary principle. Thus, the AEDPA forbids us from disturbing the SJC's resolution of the collateral estoppel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Due Process Claim.</i> The petitioner also contends that the vacation of his conviction for receiving stolen property occurred at the expense of his right to procedural due process. This abridgement occurred, the petitioner says, when the Cambridge District Court \"denied [him] a meaningful opportunity to be heard on his motion [to vacate his conviction].\" Appellant's Br. at 37. The federal district court determined that this claim was not ripe for habeas review since its merits had never been fully adjudicated by the state courts. <i>Jackson v. Coalter,</i> 2002 WL 1760879, at *3. We uphold this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AEDPA directs that habeas relief \"shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(b)(1)(A). This exhaustion requirement codified preexisting law. The Supreme Court has long maintained \"that as a matter of comity, federal courts should not consider a claim in a habeas corpus petition until after the state courts have had an opportunity to act.\" <i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> 455 U.S. 509, 515, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982) (discussing <i>Ex parte Royall,</i> 117 U.S. 241, 251, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886)). We have interpreted this imperative as requiring a habeas petitioner to \"have presented both the factual and legal underpinnings of his claim to the state courts in order for us to find it exhausted.\" <i>Nadworny v. Fair,</i> 872 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1st Cir.1989). Moreover, we have made no bones about the fact that a failure to exhaust ordinarily is \"fatal\" to the prosecution of a habeas petition. <i>Martens v. Shannon,</i> 836 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner concedes that, as a general rule, exhaustion is required. He maintains, however, that he exhausted this claim by invoking due process protections in the state courts. This is partially true, but misleading. The issue that he now seeks to advance was never properly exhausted. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner mounted two legal campaigns that led him to the SJC. The first foray culminated in the SJC's opinion rejecting his double jeopardy and collateral estoppel claims. <i>See Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003-04. Careful perscrutation of the record indicates that the petitioner never adequately articulated a due process claim at or before that stage of the proceedings. The closest that he came was his plaint that the Cambridge District Court allowed his \"uncounseled\" motion to vacate the original conviction despite the fact that he \"needed counsel to determine whether to proceed with the motion at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC treated this plaint as a claim rooted in the petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel and concluded that no violation of that right had occurred. <i>Id.</i> at 1005. This was a reasonable reading of the petitioner's claim as then presented.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> More importantly, it did not suffice to exhaust the differently grounded Fifth Amendment claim that the petitioner now seeks to pursue. <i>See Adelson v. DiPaola,</i> 131 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that to satisfy the exhaustion requirement \"a habeas petitioner bears a heavy burden to show that he fairly and recognizably presented to the state courts the factual and legal bases of this federal claim\"); <i>Martens,</i> 836 F.2d at 717 (\"[T]he exhaustion doctrine requires a habeas applicant to do more than scatter some makeshift needles in the haystack of the state court record. The ground relied upon must be presented face-up and squarely; the federal question must be plainly defined.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the SJC's rejection of his initial appeal, the petitioner persevered in the state courts. During his second campaign, he filed a motion to dismiss the armed robbery charge &#8212; a motion that included a better-articulated due process claim. The Suffolk Superior Court rejected that claim, but the SJC refused to entertain an immediate appeal, holding that interlocutory review was not available. <i>Jackson v. Commonwealth,</i> 437 Mass. 1008, 770 N.E.2d 469, 471 (2002) (noting that the petitioner had \"failed to demonstrate that an appeal following conviction on the armed robbery charges would not be adequate\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Since the date of that ruling, the petitioner has done nothing further to exhaust this due process claim in the state courts. The state courts, therefore, have not had an appropriate opportunity to adjudicate the claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's determination that the petitioner's procedural due process claim is unexhausted. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(c) (\"An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.\"); <i>cf. Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court,</i> 850 F.2d 817, 820 (1st Cir.1988) (requiring that \"one who seeks to invoke the federal habeas power must fairly present &#8212; or do his best to present &#8212; the issue to the state's highest tribunal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The petitioner, ably represented before us by appointed counsel, has raised difficult issues. In the end, however, he cannot prevail.

The case has taken innumerable twists and turns. It began when the petitioner pleaded guilty to a charged crime, started serving a state-imposed sentence, and then was charged with a second, more serious crime &#8212; one potentially incompatible with the first. He responded by moving to vacate his original conviction. The state court granted his motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On reflection, the petitioner moved to reinstate that conviction and attempted instead to raise a double jeopardy defense to the second charge. The state courts (trial and appellate) rebuffed these initiatives, and the petitioner repaired to the federal courts. The district court denied the petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, ruling that the vacation of the first conviction thwarted any claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that were not complicated enough, the petitioner then struck out in a new direction. During the pendency of the federal habeas proceeding, he pleaded guilty to the second charge in exchange for a reduced sentence. After learning what had transpired, the district court rescinded its earlier ruling and dismissed the habeas petition as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner assails both of the district court's orders. We agree with the petitioner that, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, his guilty plea to the second charge did not render the habeas proceeding moot. Nevertheless, we affirm the denial of habeas relief. Adhering to the strictures of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), we conclude that the state courts neither acted contrary to, nor unreasonably applied, Supreme Court precedent when they refused to honor the petitioner's claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the afternoon of March 20, 1996, an armed intruder entered a doctor's office in Jamaica Plain and departed with, among other things, a checkbook. Later that day, police in Cambridge arrested petitioner-appellant Arthur Jackson while he was attempting to cash one of the purloined checks. The locales are significant because prosecutorial responsibility in Massachusetts operates on a county-by-county basis. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 12-32. Jamaica Plain (where the robbery took place) is in Suffolk County but Cambridge (where the attempted check-passing occurred) is in Middlesex County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Middlesex County District Attorney charged the petitioner with receiving stolen property (the purloined checks), he entered a guilty plea to that charge in Cambridge District Court. The court imposed a thirty-month sentence (one year to serve and the balance suspended). The petitioner began serving his sentence on April 4, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One day later, the Suffolk County District Attorney swore out a criminal complaint charging the petitioner with armed robbery in connection with the March 20 heist. The petitioner first learned of this charge five months into his incarcerative term when an outstanding arrest warrant (which had never been served) rendered him ineligible to participate in a work-release program. Fearing that his guilty plea to receiving stolen property would be used against him at a trial for armed robbery, the petitioner filed a pro se motion on November 25, 1996. The motion sought to withdraw the earlier plea, annul the petitioner's conviction, and set the stage for a new trial on the original charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The gist of the petitioner's argument was that the presiding judge in the Cambridge District Court had conducted an insufficient colloquy and, therefore, had erred in accepting his guilty plea. <i>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></span>, 812 (1998) (discussing the constitutional requirements for acceptance of a guilty plea); <i>see also</i> Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c) (establishing certain procedural prerequisites for same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 5, 1996, the petitioner was summonsed to the West Roxbury District Court for arraignment on the Suffolk County complaint. One week later, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted him for armed robbery. The new indictment included an allegation that the petitioner was a habitual offender. If proven, this allegation would require a sentence of life imprisonment. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 17; <i>id.</i> ch. 279, &#167; 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1996, the petitioner completed serving the incarcerative portion of his sentence for receiving stolen property. His freedom was short-lived. When he appeared the next week at Suffolk Superior Court for a pretrial hearing on the armed robbery charge, he was detained. His detention lasted from that date (January 2, 1997) until his eventual release, under circumstances that we shortly shall explain, on July 2, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 1997, the petitioner appeared pro se in the Cambridge District Court for a hearing on his previously filed motion to vacate his conviction for receiving stolen property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> At the request of court personnel, an itinerant attorney consulted with the petitioner and informed the presiding judge that the petitioner \"really need[ed] to be represented by counsel in this case.\" The lawyer urged the court to withhold any action until the petitioner's court-appointed counsel in the armed robbery case could appear. Speaking for himself, the petitioner pressed for vacation of the receiving stolen property conviction, emphasizing that he had not been given proper warnings in advance of his guilty plea. The court announced its intention to listen to a tape recording of the plea proceeding and continued the hearing until January 30 so the petitioner's attorney could attend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For reasons that remain obscure, neither the petitioner nor his court-appointed counsel in the armed robbery case appeared at the January 30 hearing. The court, however, had reviewed the tape of the plea proceeding and found the colloquy inadequate. Stating that \"I am the one who erred, and I am correcting the error now,\" the presiding judge vacated the petitioner's conviction for receiving stolen property. The district attorney's office eventually declined to reprosecute the receiving stolen property charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The armed robbery case remained velivolant and, after several months had passed, the petitioner began to have second thoughts about his strategy. On November 19, 1997, he filed a counseled motion in the Cambridge District Court requesting the reinstatement of his prior conviction. At around the same time, he filed a counseled motion in the Suffolk Superior Court seeking dismissal of the armed robbery charge on double jeopardy grounds. Both motions were denied. The petitioner then appealed the double jeopardy ruling to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC). A single justice of the SJC, acting pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211, &#167; 3, ruled that the petitioner's interlocutory appeal was immediately reviewable but nonetheless rejected the appeal on the merits. On October 14, 1999, the full court affirmed that decision. <i>See Jackson v. Commonwealth,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span>, 1005 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While still awaiting trial in the armed robbery case, the petitioner filed a federal habeas petition. The federal district court held a hearing on March 7, 2002, and took the matter under advisement. On July 2, 2002, the petitioner and Suffolk County prosecutors reached an accord anent the armed robbery charge: in exchange for the petitioner's guilty plea, the Commonwealth agreed to abandon the habitual offender allegation and recommend a \"time-served\" sentence. The Suffolk Superior Court accepted the plea, imposed the agreed sentence, and released the petitioner on a term of supervised probation. The federal district court later stated that it was not notified of these developments when they occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 30, 2002, the federal district court, still unaware of the recent plea, denied the petition for habeas relief on the merits. <i>See Jackson v. Coalter,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1760879</span></span>, at *4 (D.Mass. July 30, 2002). Approximately two weeks later, the Commonwealth moved to reconsider the order. In that motion, the Attorney General informed the court of the plea bargain in the armed robbery case and argued that the consummation of that bargain rendered the habeas petition moot. The district court agreed; in successive orders, it first vacated its earlier merits decision and then dismissed the habeas petition as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner seasonably appealed both the order of dismissal on the merits and the subsequent order declaring the controversy moot. The appeal is properly before us, as the district court has granted a broadly worded certificate of appealability. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail in this appeal, the petitioner must overcome two adverse rulings. Common sense suggests that we address these rulings in reverse chronological order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Mootness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford plenary review to the district court's determination that the petitioner's guilty plea to the armed robbery charge rendered his habeas petition moot. <i>See Simpson v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198459\"><a href=\"/opinion/198459/simpson-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also Scarpa v.

Initially, however, we deal with a pair of preliminary matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we note that even though the guilty plea to the armed robbery charge ended the petitioner's incarceration, he remains under supervised probation. Thus, he is still sufficiently \"in custody\" to pursue federal habeas relief. <i>See Lefkowitz v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486539\"><a href=\"/opinion/486539/alan-lefkowitz-v-michael-fair-commissioner-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1987) (collecting cases); <i>see generally Jones v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span> (1963) (holding that the \"in custody\" requirement for habeas relief necessitates only \"restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the petitioner filed his habeas application under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. The district court perspicaciously observed that the petitioner was still awaiting trial on the armed robbery charge when he sought habeas relief; that his status was, therefore, that of a pretrial detainee; and that this circumstance called into question the appropriateness of the jurisdictional allegation. <i>See Jackson v. Coalter,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1760879</span></span>, at *1; <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(a) (indicating that section 2254 relief is available only to \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"). The district court nonetheless proceeded to adjudicate the matter on the basis that, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c)(3), a writ of habeas corpus is potentially available to any state prisoner \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws ... of the United States.\" This problem does not concern us inasmuch as the petitioner has now pleaded guilty to the armed robbery charge, and his guilty plea subjected him to a state court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the question of mootness. A habeas petition is moot if it fails to present a live case or controversy. <i>See Spencer v.

The question before us is whether the petitioner's guilty plea foreclosed his habeas claims (and, thus, rendered his petition moot).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing the affirmative of the proposition, the Commonwealth chiefly relies upon the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v.

Hence, the Double Jeopardy Clause forbade the Commonwealth from initiating the armed robbery prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first element on which the petitioner's hypothesis rests is unassailable: at least in these circumstances, a guilty plea is itself a conviction. <i>See Kercheval v.

The SJC assumed, without deciding, the validity of the third element. <i>See Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003 &amp; n. 4 (suggesting that Massachusetts case law would deem the crimes of receiving stolen property and armed robbery of the same property to constitute a single offense).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Since this is largely a question of Massachusetts law, we too will assume arguendo that a defendant cannot lawfully be convicted of both crimes.

The petitioner does not look beyond the fact of the original conviction for receiving stolen property, treating the vacation of that conviction as irrelevant to the double jeopardy analysis. In his view, the Commonwealth was constitutionally barred from soliciting the armed robbery indictment after it obtained the original conviction for receiving stolen property; it secured the armed robbery indictment while that conviction was still on the books; and so, because the indictment was unconstitutional when contrived, the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to pursue it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SJC used a wider-angled lens. It examined the constitutionality of the second indictment in light of both the prior conviction and the subsequent vacation of that conviction. Gauging the constitutionality of the armed robbery indictment from that perspective, \"there [wa]s no longer a final adjudication of guilt or innocence\" on the receiving stolen property charge. <i>Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003. Far from deeming the petitioner's voluntary withdrawal of his guilty plea as irrelevant, the SJC thought it was \"[c]ritical to the disposition\" of his double jeopardy argument. <i>Id.</i> In short, the petitioner and the SJC were arguing past each other, advocating parallel but materially different analyses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the unique facts of this case, that discrepancy is problematic for the petitioner. On habeas review, the AEDPA requires us to focus our attention on the state court's analysis. The petitioner's obligation is not simply to offer a plausible argument for the unconstitutionality of his conviction, but, rather, to identify how the state court's analytical path strayed beyond permissible bounds. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the SJC relied primarily on the decision in <i>United States v.

Reasonableness depends on context. For the purposes of determining the reasonableness of a state court's decision under section 2254(d)(1), we have declared that \"if it is a close question whether the state decision is in error, then the state decision cannot be an unreasonable application.\" <i>McCambridge,</i> 303 F.3d at 36. This principle carries the day here. There is support in the Supreme Court's case law for the competing positions of the petitioner and the SJC, and nothing in <i>Blackledge, Menna,</i> or their progeny is so compelling as to render the SJC's reliance on <i>Scott</i> unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fallback position bears a close relationship to his main argument. He asserts that since the Commonwealth was constitutionally barred from indicting him for armed robbery when the grand jury acted, it could cure the constitutional violation only by restoring the status quo ante (that is, by withdrawing the offending indictment). To support this claim, the petitioner leans heavily upon a concurring opinion authored by Justice Blackmun and a smattering of decisions from federal courts of appeals. <i>See, e.g., Morris v.

Even if the Commonwealth were barred from indicting the petitioner for armed robbery before the conviction for receiving stolen property was vacated, our decision must account for the petitioner's voluntary motion to vacate that conviction &#8212; a step that opened the door for the successful prosecution of the armed robbery charge. The SJC ruled that the Commonwealth was not constitutionally barred from pursuing the second indictment after the vacation of the first conviction at the petitioner's behest. <i>Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003. For the reasons discussed above, that ruling &#8212; whether or not precisely correct as a matter of constitutional law &#8212; neither contravenes nor unreasonably applies Supreme Court precedent.

The petitioner seeks to apply this tenet in support of the claim that the conviction for receiving stolen property remained a valid and final judgment notwithstanding its vacation (and, thus, precluded the Commonwealth from proceeding on the armed robbery charge). To this end, he insists that the conviction rested on the factual predicate that he received stolen property; that its vacation had no corrosive effect on these (previously established) ultimate facts; and that, therefore, the indictment accusing him of stealing that very property was founded on a legal impossibility. The SJC rejected this theory, concluding that vacatur of the conviction meant that \"there now is no final determination of the facts,\" so that \"[c]ollateral estoppel does not apply.\" <i>Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent.

The first foray culminated in the SJC's opinion rejecting his double jeopardy and collateral estoppel claims. <i>See Jackson,</i> 717 N.E.2d at 1003-04. Careful perscrutation of the record indicates that the petitioner never adequately articulated a due process claim at or before that stage of the proceedings.

This was a reasonable reading of the petitioner's claim as then presented.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> More importantly, it did not suffice to exhaust the differently grounded Fifth Amendment claim that the petitioner now seeks to pursue. <i>See Adelson v.

During his second campaign, he filed a motion to dismiss the armed robbery charge &#8212; a motion that included a better-articulated due process claim. The Suffolk Superior Court rejected that claim, but the SJC refused to entertain an immediate appeal, holding that interlocutory review was not available. <i>Jackson v.

The state courts, therefore, have not had an appropriate opportunity to adjudicate the claim.
