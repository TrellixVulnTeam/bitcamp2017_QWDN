Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges\n\n\n\n     Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Hector E.\nGuzman-Silva, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nappellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres-Pabón,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 1, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.      In this sentencing appeal, the defendant,\n\nIsmael Esteban Figueroa-De-La-Cruz (\"Figueroa\"), argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in two ways:             (1) in basing his sentence on\n\ntheft of more than $10,000 when his indictment charged him with\n\ntheft of only $10,000 and (2) in delegating authority to the\n\nprobation officer to order an unlimited number of drug tests during\n\nhis supervised release.          Because we find that Figueroa knowingly\n\nand voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence and that\n\nthe alleged sentencing errors do not constitute manifest injustice,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Waiver of Appeal\n\n            In his plea agreement, Figueroa agreed \"that if [the\n\nDistrict] Court accepts this agreement and sentences defendant\n\naccording    to    its   terms    and   conditions,   defendant   waives   and\n\nsurrenders defendant's right to appeal the judgment and sentence in\n\nthis case.\"       For such a presentence waiver of appellate rights to\n\nbe valid and enforceable, \"the baseline . . . is that the defendant\n\nenter[ed] into it knowingly and voluntarily.\"              United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir. 2001).          And \"critically important\n\nto a determination of knowledge and volition\" are \"the text of the\n\nplea agreement and the content of the change-of-plea colloquy.\"\n\nId.     Specifically, for such a           waiver to be valid, the plea\n\nagreement should \"contain[] a clear statement elucidating the\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwaiver and delineating its scope,\" id.; and, at the change-of-plea\n\nhearing, \"the court's interrogation [should] suffice to ensure that\n\nthe defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive [the] right\n\nto appeal [the] forthcoming sentence,\" id.; see also Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(b)(1)(N) (requiring such a colloquy).\n\n              Here, the language of the waiver was clear.              Indeed, as\n\nwe previously concluded with respect to an identically worded\n\nwaiver, \"[t]here can be no doubt that the plea agreement contained\n\n'a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its\n\nscope.'\"      United States v. De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (quoting Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24).                 At the end of the\n\nagreement, Figueroa certified that he \"ha[d] read this agreement\n\nand carefully reviewed every part of it with my attorney [and that\n\nhe]   fully    understand[s]     this    agreement    and    [he]   voluntarily\n\nagree[s] to it.\"       His attorney signed a certification to the same\n\neffect.       \"These    desiderata      furnish   prima     facie   evidence   of\n\n[Figueroa's] knowledge and volition.\"              Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26.\n\nFurther indicia of Figueroa's ability to understand the agreement\n\nare   his   age     (36),   education    (high    school    graduate    and   some\n\nuniversity studies), and experience (teaching a GED course).\n\n              The   colloquy   at    Figueroa's     plea    hearing     was   also\n\nsufficient to ensure that he understood his preexisting waiver of\n\nappeal.       After the court specifically pointed out the waiver\n\nprovision and confirmed that Figueroa's attorney had explained the\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fprovision to him and that Figueroa understood it, the court further\n\nasked, \"So you understand that by entering into this Plea Agreement\n\nyou will have waived or given up your right to appeal all or part\n\nof the sentence as long as it complies with [the waiver provision]\n\nof   the    Plea     Agreement?\";   and    Figueroa   responded,     \"Yes.\"      In\n\nassessing the sufficiency of a virtually identical exchange, we\n\nreadily rejected an argument that \"[t]he plain language of the\n\ndistrict court's inquiry\" was somehow misleading.                      De-La-Cruz\n\nCastro, 299 F.3d at 11.          The colloquy here was thus very different\n\nfrom the one that we found deficient in Teeter, where the district\n\ncourt      neither    directed     defendant's   attention      to   the    waiver\n\nprovision of the plea agreement nor otherwise discussed that\n\nprovision      but,     instead,     affirmatively     sought    and       obtained\n\nconfirmation of defendant's understanding that she would have a\n\nright to appeal any sentence the court imposed.\n\n               Thus, Figueroa's waiver of appeal was sufficiently\n\nknowing and voluntary to satisfy the Teeter criteria.                Although we\n\nmay nevertheless refuse to honor such a waiver where a miscarriage\n\nof justice has occurred, Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26, that prerogative\n\nis \"applied sparingly and without undue generosity\" and only \"where\n\na miscarriage of justice occurred,\" id.\n\nB.   Computing Sentence Based on Theft of More Than $10,000\n\n              Figueroa had ample notice, when he pleaded guilty, of the\n\namount of loss that the court would use to compute his sentence and\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fof the resulting sentencing range, and he expressly stipulated to\n\nthe truth of the underlying facts.              Given the lack of a factual\n\ndispute as to the amount of loss, Figueroa was not prejudiced by\n\nthe indictment's reference to a theft of \"$10,000,\" rather than the\n\nhigher amount that was ultimately used to calculate his sentence.\n\nSee United States v. Riggs, 347 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2003), cert.\n\ndenied, 540 U.S. 1126 (2004); United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56,\n\n62 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nC.   Delegation of Sentencing Authority\n\n           Figueroa's remaining claim of error is that the district\n\ncourt   impermissibly    delegated    to        the   probation   officer   the\n\nresponsibility for determining the maximum number of drug tests\n\nthat Figueroa is required to undergo during his supervised release.\n\nAlthough the government confesses error on this point, we find no\n\nerror and therefore affirm the district court's sentence in this\n\nrespect. See United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 8 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (stating that court of appeals need not accept agreed-\n\nupon but mistaken legal propositions).\n\n           Although     we   have    invalidated         supervised    release\n\nconditions   expressly   delegating        to   the   probation   officer   the\n\nresponsibility for determining the number of drug tests that a\n\ndefendant must undergo, United States v. Vega, 398 F.3d 149, 154\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Padilla, 393 F.3d 256, 258-59 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam); United States v. Melendez-Santana, 353\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fF.3d 93, 103 (1st Cir. 2003), the condition here does not embody any\n\nsuch express delegation to the probation officer.       Rather, the\n\ndistrict court's oral sentence required Figueroa to \"submit to a\n\ndrug test within 15 days of release, and at least t[w]o periodic\n\ntests thereafter.\"    Its written sentence, which appears to be a\n\nform, is virtually identical:     \"The defendant shall submit to one\n\ndrug test within 15 days of release from imprisonment and at least\n\ntwo periodic drug tests thereafter.\"      Neither the oral nor the\n\nwritten sentence expressly delegates the determination of the\n\nmaximum number of tests to the probation officer.\n\n           Recently, we construed the very language used here as\n\njudicially capping the number of drug tests at three, rather than\n\nimpermissibly delegating the determination of the maximum number of\n\ntests to the probation officer.    United States v. Lewandowski, 372\n\nF.3d 470, 471 (1st Cir. 2004).      We apply that same construction\n\nhere.   As so construed, no improper delegation--and, therefore, no\n\nmanifest injustice--has occurred.\n\n           The sentence is affirmed.    See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
