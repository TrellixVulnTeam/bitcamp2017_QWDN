Petitioner Claudia Patricia\n\nCórdoba-Quiroz (\"Córdoba\") appeals the denial of a motion for\n\nreconsideration     before    the   Board    of   Immigration   Appeals    (the\n\n\"BIA\").     She claims that the BIA should have exercised its sua\n\nsponte authority to reopen her removal proceedings on the basis of\n\na change in the law affecting her eligibility for relief.                   We\n\naffirm the BIA's decision.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n              Córdoba is a thirty-five-year-old native and citizen of\n\nColombia.      In February 2002, she came to the United States and\n\nrequested asylum.      On March 5, 2002, Córdoba was paroled into the\n\nUnited States and placed in removal proceedings.                She filed an\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder   the    Convention    Against    Torture    in   February   2003.    An\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied her request for relief and ordered\n\nher removed on May 4, 2004.\n\n              On May 28, 2004, Córdoba married Miguel Arroyo-Vargas, a\n\nU.S. citizen, who filed an I-130 petition for an immigrant visa on\n\nher behalf on April 7, 2005.           As of the time of this appeal, the\n\npetition had not been approved.\n\n              Córdoba then filed an appeal of the IJ's decision, which\n\nthe BIA denied without opinion on August 23, 2005.           Córdoba did not\n\nappeal this decision, but instead filed a motion to reopen her\n\nremoval proceedings based on the First Circuit's decision in Succar\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fv. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2005), which she claims is a\n\nsignificant change in the law affecting her eligibility for relief.\n\nHer motion was received on November 22, 2005 -- one day late1 --\n\ndue to a clerical error; she prepared the package for overnight\n\nmailing via UPS, but it was inadvertently sent via second day air\n\ninstead.   On December 28, 2005, the BIA denied her motion to reopen\n\nas untimely.\n\n              Córdoba then filed a motion for reconsideration.                  On\n\nMarch 7, 2006, the BIA denied the motion on the ground that\n\nCórdoba's stated reason for the untimeliness of the motion to\n\nreopen   --    clerical   error    --    did    not   rise   to   the   level   of\n\n\"exceptional circumstances\" sufficient to warrant the exercise of\n\nthe BIA's sua sponte authority.               Córdoba now appeals the BIA's\n\ndenial of her motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                  II. Analysis\n\n              On appeal, Córdoba argues that the BIA erred in denying\n\nher motion for reconsideration because it failed to consider all\n\nthe relevant factors in her case.              Specifically, she claims that\n\nthe BIA should have exercised its sua sponte authority to reopen\n\nher removal proceedings based on a significant change in the law,\n\nand that her motion to reopen was not untimely because she filed it\n\nwithin a reasonable time after the change in the law.\n\n\n1\n   Córdoba's motion to reopen was due ninety days after the final\nagency decision, which in this case was the BIA's denial of her\nappeal of the IJ's decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fA. Sua Sponte Authority\n\n           The BIA has the discretionary authority to reopen removal\n\nproceedings on its own motion at any time, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2\n\n(a),   although    it   reserves   that   discretion   for   \"exceptional\n\nsituations.\"      In re J-J-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 976, 984 (1997) (\"The\n\npower to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a\n\ngeneral cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the\n\nregulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.\").        In\n\nthis case, the BIA determined that a clerical error did not rise to\n\nthe level of an exceptional circumstance.       Córdoba argues that the\n\nBIA should have exercised its sua sponte authority because Succar,\n\n394 F.3d 8, represents a significant change in the law, which\n\naffects her eligibility for relief.       See In re X-G-W-, 22 I. & N.\n\nDec. 71, 73 (1998) (finding an exceptional circumstance warranting\n\nsua sponte relief where \"a significant change in the immigration\n\nlaw made relief available to the applicant on the basis of the same\n\nasylum application he filed initially\").2\n\n           As we have explained before, \"the decision of the BIA\n\nwhether to invoke its sua sponte authority is committed to its\n\nunfettered discretion.\"      Luis v. INS, 196 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n2\n   The \"significant change\" in this case amounted to an about-face\nin immigration law concerning the possibility of relief for aliens\nwho had suffered under coercive population control policies. In re\nX-G-W-, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 73. The BIA announced the close of its\npolicy of granting untimely motions to reopen removal proceedings\non that basis in In re G-C-L, 23 I. & N. Dec. 359, 361-62 (2002).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f1999).    Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to review the BIA's\n\ndiscretionary         decision    because    \"[t]here   are   no     guidelines   or\n\nstandards which dictate how and when the BIA should invoke its sua\n\nsponte power.\"         Id. at 41; accord Zhang v. Gonzáles, 469 F.3d 51,\n\n53 (1st Cir. 2006); Prado v. Reno, 198 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).        In re X-G-W-, 22 I. & N. Dec. 71, in which the BIA\n\nexercised its authority based on a profound change in immigration\n\nlaw, does not change this analysis.               It is merely an example of a\n\nsituation in which the BIA found it appropriate to exercise its sua\n\nsponte power; the case provides no meaningful guidance on the\n\ncircumstances under which the BIA should exercise its discretionary\n\nauthority. Luis, 196 F.3d at 40-41 (\"[I]f no judicially manageable\n\nstandards are available for judging how and when an agency should\n\nexercise its discretion, then it is impossible to evaluate agency\n\naction    for    'abuse    of     discretion.'\"     (alteration      in   original)\n\n(quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985))); see also\n\nEkimian v. INS, 303 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"The cases in\n\nwhich    we    have    reviewed    a   BIA   decision   under   an    'exceptional\n\ncircumstances' standard have been those in which a relevant statute\n\nexplicitly      defined     what       Congress   considers     an    'exceptional\n\ncircumstance.'\").         Thus, we have no jurisdiction to review the\n\nBIA's denial of Córdoba's request to reopen her removal proceedings\n\nsua sponte.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fB. Timeliness\n\n           The BIA initially rejected Córdoba's motion to reopen\n\nbecause it was not filed within ninety days of the BIA's final\n\ndecision in her case.   Córdoba argues on appeal that her motion to\n\nreopen was not untimely because she filed it within a reasonable\n\ntime after Succar -- the case that she alleges significantly\n\nchanged the law affecting her eligibility for relief -- was handed\n\ndown.3   We review the BIA's denial of a motion for reconsideration\n\nfor abuse of discretion.    Keo Chan v. Gonzáles, 413 F.3d 161, 164\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); see also Roberts v. Gonzáles, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (\"[W]e review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen\n\nbased on timeliness grounds under a highly deferential abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard.    In order to prevail under this standard, the\n\nmovant must carry the heavy burden of establishing that the BIA\n\nmade an error of law or acted in a manifestly arbitrary or\n\ncapricious manner.\" (citation omitted)).\n\n           Generally, an alien must file a motion to reopen within\n\nninety days of a final administrative decision.    8 U.S.C. § 1229a\n\n(c)(7)(C); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (delineating exceptions\n\n\n\n3\n   It is unclear whether Córdoba raised this issue before the BIA\nand therefore whether we should reach her argument at all. See\nBernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Usually\nissues not raised before the BIA may not be raised for the first\ntime on a petition for review.\"). Because it does not affect the\noutcome of the case, however, we will assume for purposes of our\nreview that she did raise the issue in her motion for\nreconsideration.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fto the general rule, none of which are applicable in this case).\n\nCórdoba's motion was received ninety-one days after the BIA's final\n\ndecision in her case.      Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Córdoba's motion for reconsideration because it reached\n\nthe   correct   legal    conclusion    that   her   motion   to   reopen   was\n\nuntimely.4    See Chen v. Gonzáles, 415 F.3d 151, 153 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"An abuse of discretion exists 'where the BIA misinterprets the\n\nlaw, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.'\").\n\n                             III. Conclusion\n\n             For the reasons stated above, we affirm the BIA's denial\n\nof Córdoba's motion for reconsideration.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   To the extent that Córdoba's timeliness argument relies on the\nBIA's sua sponte power to reopen her removal proceedings despite\nher tardiness, we reiterate that we have no jurisdiction to review\nthe BIA's use of that discretion. See Zhang, 469 F.3d at 53.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f",
