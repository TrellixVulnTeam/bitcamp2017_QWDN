Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lance 3X Hullum on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Annette C. Benedetto,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                June 30, 2004\n\f          PER CURIAM.    This habeas appeal presents a single issue\n\ninvolving the Double Jeopardy Clause.         To prevail on this claim,\n\npetitioner must establish that the state court's decision \"was\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States.\"   28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).          As petitioner has not\n\ncome close to making such a showing, we affirm the denial of habeas\n\nrelief.\n\n          Following his brutal assault on a fellow Massachusetts\n\ninmate,   petitioner    Lance   Hullum       was   subjected      to   prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings and sanctioned with a 66-month sentence to\n\nthe Departmental Disciplinary Unit (DDU) at MCI Cedar Junction.\n\nFor that same conduct, he was also indicted in state court for\n\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon (along with another\n\ncharge that was later dropped).      Claiming that the administrative\n\nsanction constituted    punishment     for    double   jeopardy    purposes,\n\npetitioner moved for dismissal of the indictment.         He prevailed on\n\nthis argument at the trial court level, but the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (SJC), in a pair of opinions addressing successive appeals\n\nbrought by petitioner and other inmates, found no double jeopardy\n\nviolation.   See Commonwealth v. Forte, 423 Mass. 672 (1996); Clark\n\nv. Commonwealth, 428 Mass. 1011 (1998) (rescript).                Petitioner\n\nthereafter pled guilty to the criminal charge.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          After another round of state court challenges, petitioner\n\nsought habeas relief in federal court, advancing four separate\n\nclaims.   The district court ended up denying relief under United\n\nStates v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563 (1989), concluding that petitioner's\n\nvoluntary and counseled guilty plea effected a waiver of any\n\nensuing attempt to collaterally attack his conviction.    The court\n\ndid, however, certify the double jeopardy issue for appeal.\n\n          At the outset, petitioner disputes the finding of waiver.\n\nHe claims to fall within an exception to the Broce rule announced\n\nin Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61 (1975) (per curiam).   Addressing\n\nan analogous double jeopardy claim, the Court there held that\n\n\"[w]here the State is precluded by the United States Constitution\n\nfrom haling a defendant into court on a charge, federal law\n\nrequires that a conviction on that charge be set aside even if the\n\nconviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty.\"\n\nId. at 62 (citing Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 30 (1974)).\n\nPetitioner's reliance on Menna is arguably justified.    See, e.g.,\n\nJackson v. Coalter, 337 F.3d 74, 78-81 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying\n\nMenna exception under somewhat comparable circumstances). For this\n\nreason, and because petitioner's claim so plainly fails to meet the\n\nrigorous § 2254(d)(1) standards, we sidestep the waiver issue and\n\nturn to the merits.\n\n          As mentioned, our task is not to decide whether the SJC's\n\ndouble jeopardy ruling was correct, but only whether it contravened\n\n\n                               -3-\n\for unreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent.    It clearly did\n\nneither of those things.   At the time petitioner first raised his\n\ndouble jeopardy claim, the view was widely accepted that \"prison\n\ndiscipline does not preclude a subsequent criminal prosecution or\n\npunishment for the same acts.\"    Garrity v. Fiedler, 41 F.3d 1150,\n\n1152 (7th Cir.   1994) (listing cases from eight other circuit\n\ncourts).   In concluding that a different result was nonetheless\n\nwarranted, the first superior court judge in petitioner's case\n\nrelied on United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989)–-and in\n\nparticular its comment that \"a civil sanction that cannot fairly be\n\nsaid solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be\n\nexplained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes,\n\nis punishment,\" id. at 448.\n\n           Yet Halper does not assist petitioner.   For one thing,\n\nthose federal courts that reconsidered the issue in the wake of\n\nHalper uniformly deemed that decision inapplicable in the prison-\n\ndiscipline context.   See, e.g., United States v. Mayes, 158 F.3d\n\n1215, 1220 n.9 (11th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases); cf. United\n\nStates v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 717-18 (1st Cir. 1996) (limiting\n\nHalper to compensatory, monetary penalties).   More important, the\n\nSupreme Court narrowed the Halper decision in United States v.\n\nUrsery, 518 U.S. 267, 284 n.2, 286 (1996), and then \"in large part\n\ndisavow[ed]\" the entire Halper analysis in Hudson v. United States,\n\n522 U.S. 93, 96, 100-02 (1997).\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            The Hudson Court noted that \"[i]f a sanction must be\n\n'solely'     remedial    (i.e.,      entirely     nondeterrent)    to    avoid\n\nimplicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties\n\nare beyond the scope of the Clause.\"                Id. at 102.     Instead,\n\nreverting to \"traditional double jeopardy doctrine,\" id. at 101,\n\nit declared that double jeopardy \"protects only against the\n\nimposition    of     multiple   criminal    punishments      for   the    same\n\noffense,\" id. at 99.        As it did in Ursery, see 518 U.S. at 288,\n\nthe Hudson Court applied a two-part test to determine \"[w]hether\n\na particular punishment is criminal or civil,\" 522 U.S. at 99.\n\nThe first step is to ascertain what the government intended in\n\nthis regard.         See id.      The second is to ask \"whether the\n\nstatutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as\n\nto transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into\n\na criminal penalty.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).    The Court listed seven \"guideposts\" to facilitate the\n\nlatter inquiry, see id. at 99-100, and added that \"only the\n\nclearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent\" in\n\nthat respect, id. at 100 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Far from deviating from these principles, the SJC's\n\ndisposition     of    the   double     jeopardy     issue   was    consistent\n\ntherewith.    It determined that \"imposition of prison discipline\n\nis a civil proceeding,\" Forte, 423 Mass. at 676, and that DDU\n\nconfinement had a \"remedial purpose\" as well as a punitive one,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fid. at 677.    On the sparse record in Forte, it also found no\n\nshowing \"that DDU confinement is so extreme as to any defendant\n\nin relation to his wrongdoing that the double jeopardy clause is\n\nimplicated.\"   Id at 678.    The superior court on remand reached\n\nthe same conclusion after making detailed findings of fact, and\n\nthe SJC justifiably endorsed that determination in Clark.      See\n\n428 Mass. at 997.     Nothing in the SJC's analysis contravened or\n\nunreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent.     Cf. Jackson, 337\n\nF.3d at 81-85 (holding that double jeopardy claim failed to\n\nsatisfy § 2254(d)(1) standards).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
