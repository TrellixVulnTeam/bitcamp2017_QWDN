Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Angel L. Rivera Colón on brief for appellants.\n     Daliah Lugo Auffant and Perez Vargas & Lugo Auffant Law\nOffices, P.S.C. on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                       September 19, 2006\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge. This appeal follows a jury verdict\n\nawarding a grand total of $1,300,000 in compensatory and punitive\n\ndamages to plaintiffs Pedro Casillas-Díaz (Casillas) and the Estate\n\nof Eliomar López-Claudio (López).     In reaching this verdict, the\n\njury found that four police officers, defendants Romualdo Palau,\n\nJuan Martínez, Liz Díaz, and Gabriel De León, had used excessive\n\nforce in an encounter with Casillas and López.   In this venue, the\n\nofficers, as appellants, maintain that the lower court erred in\n\ndenying their motion for judgment as a matter of law and their\n\nalternative motion for a new trial or a remittitur.   Discerning no\n\npreserved error, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We rehearse the facts as the jury supportably could have\n\nfound them, guided by the rule that \"when the losing party protests\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence, the court of appeals must take\n\nboth the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light\n\nmost hospitable to the jury's verdict.\"       Correa v. Hosp. San\n\nFrancisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1188 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           On September 18, 2000, at approximately 4:30 a.m., the\n\ndefendants encountered López, Casillas, and Casillas's bride-to-be,\n\nBarbara Lee Camacho, while the three civilians were making the\n\nrounds of San Juan's casinos. Officers Palau and Martínez stopped\n\nLópez's vehicle, in which the trio was riding, at the Ambassador\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fHotel. Without incident, they ticketed the operator, Casillas, for\n\ndriving against traffic and failing to wear a seat belt.\n\n             Sometime later that morning, the plaintiffs and the\n\ndefendants met again at the Condado Plaza Hotel.            The defendants\n\nclaim that they confronted Casillas and López after receiving\n\ninformation that the pair had been involved in a \"hit-and-run\"\n\nincident in the parking lot of the Ambassador Hotel.             Although all\n\nparties agree that an altercation ensued, the testimony as to\n\nexactly what transpired is widely divergent.\n\n             The plaintiffs say that at the time of the confrontation\n\nCasillas was speaking to a cabdriver outside the lobby of the\n\nCondado Plaza, while López was asleep in the back seat of his\n\nparked car.       According to their version of the events, the police\n\nberated the two men and then manhandled them for no apparent\n\nreason.     The defendants tell a vastly different tale.          They claim\n\nthat they approached Casillas near the hotel lobby, that he pushed\n\none of the officers, and that López physically interfered with the\n\nofficers' attempt to subdue Casillas.            In the officers' view,\n\nCasillas and López were the aggressors in the fracas that ensued;\n\nin the plaintiffs' view, the officers were the aggressors.\n\n             It is undisputed that, during the melee, Casillas and\n\nLópez sustained injuries, and that the defendants proceeded to take\n\nthe   two   men    into   custody.   They   charged   Casillas    with   eight\n\nmisdemeanor traffic infractions.            In addition, they swore out\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ffelony charges against both Casillas and López for alleged acts of\n\nviolence aimed at public officials.\n\n          The criminal charges came to naught.    The case against\n\nLópez was rendered moot when he committed suicide; the charges\n\nagainst Casillas were dropped.   In the meantime, the battleground\n\nshifted from the criminal courts to the civil courts: on September\n\n18, 2001, Casillas and López's parents, representing his estate,\n\nsued the officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Puerto Rico law.1\n\n          The plaintiffs' complaint alleged, variously, use of\n\nexcessive force, false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious\n\nprosecution. The defendants denied the material allegations of the\n\ncomplaint, and, in due course, a jury trial commenced.      At the\n\nclose of the plaintiffs' case in chief, the defendants moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), citing an\n\nostensible lack of evidence. The district court reserved decision.\n\nAt the close of all the evidence, the court granted judgment as a\n\nmatter of law in favor of the defendants on the claims of false\n\narrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution but allowed\n\nthe excessive force claims to go forward.\n\n          The jury found that the defendants had used excessive\n\nforce against both Casillas and López. It awarded Casillas $50,000\n\n\n     1\n      Camacho (who had married Casillas) was originally a plaintiff\nbut she is not a party to this appeal.         A variety of other\ndefendants were originally named in the suit but exonerated in the\nlower court proceedings.    For simplicity's sake, we eschew any\nfurther reference to these parties.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fin compensatory damages ($25,000 each against Palau and Martínez)\n\nand   awarded   López's    estate   $250,000   in    compensatory   damages\n\n($125,000 each against Díaz and De León).           As a coup de grace, the\n\njury awarded a total of $1,000,000 in punitive damages ($250,000\n\nagainst each of the four defendants).2\n\n           The defendants filed a timely post-trial motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial\n\nor a remittitur.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b), 59(a).         The district\n\ncourt denied the motion.       This appeal ensued.\n\nII.   LIABILITY\n\n           We divide our discussion of the defendants' challenge to\n\nthe liability verdict into three segments.\n\n                          A.   Standard of Review.\n\n           The district court's denial of a motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law poses a question of law, engendering de novo\n\nreview.   See Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d 203,\n\n208 (1st Cir. 1996).       Where, as here, such a motion contests the\n\nsufficiency of the proof, \"the court of appeals must examine the\n\nevidence and the inferences reasonably to be extracted therefrom in\n\nthe light most hospitable to the nonmovant.\"           Sánchez v. P.R. Oil\n\nCo., 37 F.3d 712, 716          (1st Cir. 1994).        In performing this\n\n\n      2\n      It is unclear from the record below how the punitive damage\nawards are to be apportioned, and any dispute in that regard must\nbe resolved by the district court. For the time being, we will\nassume that the punitive damages are to be split evenly between\nCasillas and López's estate.\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftamisage, \"we may not consider the credibility of witnesses,\n\nresolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the\n\nevidence.\"   Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          Judgment as a matter of law should be approved, or the\n\ndenial of such a judgment reversed, \"only when the evidence, viewed\n\nfrom this perspective, is such that reasonable persons could reach\n\nbut one conclusion.\"    Id.    It follows that we \"may reverse the\n\ndenial of such a motion only if reasonable persons could not have\n\nreached the conclusion that the jury embraced.\" Correa, 69 F.3d at\n\n1191 (quoting Sánchez, 37 F.3d at 716).\n\n          Our review of the district court's disposition of a Rule\n\n59(e) motion is also narrowly circumscribed.   A district court may\n\nset aside the jury's verdict and order a new trial only if the\n\nverdict is against the law, against the weight of the credible\n\nevidence, or tantamount to a miscarriage of justice.   See Sánchez,\n\n37 F.3d at 717.    A district court's disinclination to disturb a\n\njury's verdict \"can be reversed solely for abuse of discretion.\"\n\nId.\n\n                              B.   Waiver.\n\n          As a threshold issue, the plaintiffs contend that the\n\ndefendants have waived their sufficiency of the evidence challenge\n\nby not raising it until their post-trial motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.    The premise on which this contention rests is\n\nimpeccable: a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fRule 50(b) cannot assert new grounds but, rather, is \"bounded by\n\nthe movant's earlier Rule 50(a) motion.\"      Correa, 69 F.3d at 1196.\n\nIn other words, a party cannot use a Rule 50(b) motion as an\n\ninstrument for introducing a neoteric legal theory — one not\n\ndistinctly   articulated   in   his   end-of-the-evidence   motion   for\n\njudgment as a matter of law — into the case.        See id.; see also\n\nJames W. Moore, 5A Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 50.08 (2d ed. 1994)\n\n(explaining that \"any argument omitted from the motion made at the\n\nclose of the evidence is waived as a ground for judgment under Rule\n\n50(b)\").\n\n           Despite the correctness of the plaintiffs' premise, their\n\nconclusion is awry.   The record here reflects that the defendants\n\nbegan the oral presentation of their Rule 50(a) motion at the close\n\nof the plaintiffs' case with the assertion that the plaintiffs had\n\nfailed \"to put forth sufficient admissible evidence\" to allow a\n\nreasonable jury to \"find in their favor on a variety of crucial\n\nfactual issues.\" When the defendants renewed the Rule 50(a) motion\n\nat the close of all the evidence, they made transparently clear\n\ntheir belief \"that plaintiffs have failed to provide any evidence\n\nof a use of excessive force.\"     Based on these and other pertinent\n\nreferences contained in the record, we are satisfied that the\n\ndefendants raised their sufficiency of the evidence challenge in a\n\ntimely manner.    Consequently, the issue has been preserved for\n\nappeal.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                          C.   Use of Excessive Force.\n\n            Turning       to   the    merits,     we     inquire     first    whether      a\n\nreasonable juror could have reached a conclusion favorable to the\n\nplaintiffs concerning the use of excessive force.                      See Wagenmann,\n\n829 F.2d at 200.        The record here demands an affirmative answer to\n\nthat inquiry.\n\n            At trial, Casillas and Camacho testified about the events\n\nof September 18, 2000.               Their testimony, taken at face value,\n\nindicated      that   Casillas       and   López       were   attacked     without       any\n\nprovocation and savagely beaten.                   The defendants presented a\n\nmarkedly different version of the events surrounding the arrests.\n\nThey    depicted      Casillas       and   López        as    the    aggressors,         and\n\ncharacterized their own use of force as reasonably necessary under\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n            In    the   last    analysis,        the    issue   boiled       down   to    an\n\nassessment of the comparative credibility of the witnesses.                         When,\n\nas now, the credibility of witnesses comprises the crux of the\n\nmatter, a reviewing court must take special care not to intrude\n\nupon the jury's domain.          See Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union Ry.\n\nCo., 321 U.S. 29, 35 (1944); Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200.                       It is the\n\nproper province of the jury, not the court of appeals, to separate\n\nwheat   from     chaff,    resolve     inconsistencies          in   the     witnesses's\n\naccounts, and determine what testimony is or is not worthy of\n\ncredence.      See Correa, 69 F.3d at 1194.\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f          Here, the plaintiffs' evidence showed that both Casillas\n\nand López were brutally assaulted and beaten into unconsciousness,\n\nwithout legitimate reason or provocation.        Viewing the record, as\n\nwe must, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and making\n\ncredibility calls to their behoof, we cannot say that the liability\n\nverdict was irrational or unresponsive to the proof.           The short of\n\nit is that the plaintiffs' evidence, which included photographs\n\ndepicting the physical injuries inflicted by the defendants and\n\nmedical records describing those injuries, was enough to ground the\n\nliability verdict.       From that evidence, a reasonable jury could\n\nwell have concluded — as this jury did — that the defendants used\n\nextravagant force in arresting Casillas and López.             Accordingly,\n\nthe defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n          No    useful    purpose   would   be   served   by    a   separate\n\ndiscussion of the new trial motion insofar as it pertains to\n\nliability.     After all, the district judge, who saw and heard the\n\nwitnesses, declined to meddle with the jury's factfinding.            Given\n\nthe sharply divergent accounts presented by the witnesses, we are\n\nbound to defer to the trial judge's first-hand appraisal of which\n\nside had the better of its argument.        See, e.g., id.\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter.        On this variegated\n\nrecord, a finding that the officers resorted to excessive force was\n\ncontrary to neither the law nor the weight of the evidence.           By the\n\nsame token, that finding did not in any way herald a miscarriage of\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fjustice.       Accordingly,        we   hold    that      the    district        court's\n\nratification of the jury's liability verdict did not constitute an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\nIII.   COMPENSATORY DAMAGES\n\n           The Civil Rules permit a party aggrieved by a jury\n\nverdict to move within a stipulated time frame for a new trial.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).          In their timely post-trial motion, the\n\ndefendants challenged, inter alia, the size of the compensatory\n\ndamage awards, shaping this aspect of their motion as a request for\n\na remittitur.     The district court rejected the argument that the\n\nawards were overly munificent, declaring that neither award was \"so\n\ngrossly excessive or inordinate to warrant setting it aside.\"                        The\n\ndefendants now renew this argument on appeal.\n\n           It is trite, but true, that \"[t]ranslating legal damage\n\ninto   money   damages      —    especially     in   cases      which    involve     few\n\nsignificant    items   of       measurable     economic    loss    —    is   a    matter\n\npeculiarly within a jury's ken.\"                Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 215.\n\nAccordingly, only infrequently — and then, for compelling reasons\n\n— will we, from the vantage point of an algid appellate record,\n\noverride the jury's judgment as to the appropriate amount of non-\n\neconomic damages to which a plaintiff is entitled.                     See id.; Brown\n\nv. Freedman Baking Co., 810 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1987).                          That is\n\nespecially so where, as here, the trial judge, who saw and heard\n\nthe fray fought out in real time, has endorsed the award.                    See Ruiz\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fv. Caraballo, 929 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 1991). It follows logically\n\nthat a verdict approved by both the jurors and the trial judge will\n\nbe pared \"only if it is shown to exceed any rational appraisal or\n\nestimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence\n\nbefore the jury.\"    Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1249 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (quoting Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81\n\n(1st Cir. 1984)).\n\n          This standard of review is extremely deferential.             That\n\ndeference ordinarily is expressed in terms of abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Borges Colon v. Roman-Abreu, 438 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nTorres v. Ortiz Velez, 341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir. 2003), cert.\n\ndenied, 541 U.S. 972 (2004).    The defendant bears the heavy burden\n\nof demonstrating that a challenged award is \"grossly excessive,\n\ninordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high\n\nthat it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\"\n\nCorrea, 69 F.3d at 1197 (quoting Segal, 746 F.2d at 81).\n\n          The   district     court   instructed     the     jury,   without\n\nobjection,   that   in   assessing   damages   it   could    consider    any\n\nphysical, mental, or emotional harm sustained by the injured\n\nparties, their reasonable medical expenses, and the extent and\n\nduration of their injuries.     The court cautioned that the damages\n\nmust be \"reasonable\" and not \"based on speculation or guesswork.\"\n\nThe defendants take no exception to the court's instruction.            The\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fquestion, then, is factbound — but the defendants do not deal with\n\nthe facts in any meaningful way.\n\n             Few principles are more a part of the warp and woof of\n\nappellate practice than the principle that \"issues adverted to in\n\na perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\"            United States v. Zannino, 895\n\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).           We have parroted this principle with\n\na regularity bordering on the monotonous.              See, e.g., Fredera v.\n\nMun'y of Mayaguez, 440 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 2006); Cytyc Corp. v.\n\nDEKA Prods., Ltd. P'ship, 439 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2006); Goldman,\n\nAntoneeti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer & Hertell v. Medfit Int'l., Inc.,\n\n982 F.2d 686, 687 (1st Cir. 1993).              These reiterations are not\n\nmeant   to   be   regarded     as   empty   words:    our   adherence    to   this\n\nprinciple imposes on litigants an unflagging obligation to spell\n\nout their contentions \"squarely and distinctly, or else forever\n\nhold [their] peace.\"         Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.       \"[I]t is not enough\n\nmerely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,\n\nleaving the court to do counsel's work.\"              Id.\n\n             In the case at hand, the defendants' challenge to the\n\ncompensatory      damage     awards    flagrantly     violates    this   bedrock\n\nprinciple.        In   the    \"Argument\"    section    of   their   brief,     the\n\ndefendants posit that \"even if the Court does not grant a new\n\ntrial, the Court should at least reduce the amount of the damages\n\nawarded by the jury.\"           Appellants' Br. at 14.           They then cite\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fgeneral language from a few cases addressing the court's authority\n\nto order a new trial if a verdict is unreasonably high.      See id.\n\nAfter alluding to this case law, the defendants baldly state, in a\n\ncompletely conclusory fashion, that \"after reviewing the evidence\n\nand testimony presented during the trial [it] is fundamental that\n\nthe Court review the amount of damages awarded by the jury.\"     Id.\n\nat 16.\n\n            That is their entire argument on this issue.   They at no\n\npoint attempt to apply the case law to the facts adduced at trial;\n\nthey at no point marshal the evidence as to the injuries and\n\ndamages sustained by either Casillas or López; and they at no point\n\ndiscuss, let alone analyze, the pain, suffering, and emotional\n\ndistress engendered by those injuries.     To cinch matters, their\n\nbrief is devoid of any citations to the record; they attempt\n\nneither to identify the relevant evidence nor to show how that\n\nevidence relates to — let alone undermines — the compensatory\n\ndamage awards.\n\n            This slap-dash approach is wholly inadequate to preserve\n\nthe issue of excessiveness for appellate review. A case closely on\n\npoint is Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,\n\n295 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2002).    There, the defendant asserted that\n\ndamages had been calculated improperly but failed to provide any\n\nmeaningful record references or otherwise to analyze the pertinent\n\nevidence.    See id. at 82.   In the absence of any particularized\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fshowing as to why the awarded damages were incorrect, we deemed the\n\nargument waived.   See id.\n\n           The same holds true in this case.   The defendants grouse\n\nabout the size of the compensatory damage awards but then, in\n\neffect, invite us to rummage through the record, unassisted by any\n\nsemblance of developed argumentation, in order to evaluate their\n\nclaim of excessiveness. As we have explained above, sound practice\n\ndemands that we decline this unattractive invitation: if a party\n\ndoes not put enough stock in an argument to flesh it out, a\n\nreviewing court should normally dismiss the argument out of hand.3\n\nSee King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir. 1999).   To\n\ndo otherwise would be unfair both to the adverse party and to the\n\ncourt itself.   We therefore treat the claim as waived.\n\nIV.   PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n           The defendants also challenge the amount of punitive\n\ndamages. Here, too, their argument is insufficiently developed and\n\nsubject to rejection on that ground alone.     See Zannino, 895 F.2d\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      To be sure, \"[w]e have latitude, rarely indulged, to notice\nan [asserted] error not seriously developed on the appeal.\" United\nStates v. Ortiz-Cintrón, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2006) [No. 04-\n2402, slip op. at 8].    This latitude, however, is reserved for\nexceptional cases — and the case before us does not come close to\nfitting that description: accepting, as we must, the jury's\nfindings of fact, both Casillas and López were savagely beaten and\nplainly sustained severe and painful injuries. Given these facts,\nwe see no hint of injustice in holding the defendants to the easily\npredictable consequences of their failure to observe a settled rule\nof appellate practice.\n\n                               -14-\n\fat 17.   We need not rest on that ground, however, because the\n\nargument is also patently meritless.\n\n            A jury may levy punitive damages in a section 1983 action\n\nwhen a defendant's conduct is \"shown to be motivated by evil motive\n\nor intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to\n\nthe federally protected rights of others.\" Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S.\n\n30, 56 (1983); see also Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 25-26\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).    In order for punitive damages to be appropriate,\n\nthere must be \"proof that the defendant acted 'in the face of a\n\nperceived risk that [his] actions [would] violate federal law.'\"\n\nIacobucci, 193 F.3d at 26 (quoting Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527\n\nU.S. 526, 536 (1999) (alterations in original)).\n\n            We   need   not   wax   longiloquent.   The   district   court\n\ninstructed the jury, without objection, that a determination to\n\naward punitive damages was to be based on \"whether you find that\n\nthe defendants acted willfully, deliberately, maliciously, or with\n\nreckless disregard of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\"          On\n\nthe basis of the evidence recounted above, the jury easily could\n\nhave found that the defendants acted in the face of a perceived\n\n(and flatly unacceptable) risk that their actions would compromise\n\nCasillas's and López's Fourth Amendment rights.             No more was\n\nexigible.    See Borges Colon, 438 F.3d at 22.\n\n            The conclusion that an award of punitive damages was\n\npermissible does not end our journey. The defendants' challenge to\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthe amount of punitive damages presents an independent legal issue\n\n— one that engenders de novo review.    See id. at 21.    This review\n\nis \"informed by principles of fundamental fairness,\" which \"dictate\n\nthat a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will\n\nsubject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty\"\n\nthat may be imposed.   Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union, 262\n\nF.3d 70, 81 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore,\n\n517 U.S. 559, 574 (1996)).\n\n          In evaluating the reasonableness of a punitive damage\n\naward ancillary to a violation of section 1983, we consider \"(1)\n\nthe degree of reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct; (2) the\n\nratio between punitive and actual and potential damages; and (3) a\n\ncomparison of the punitive damages figure and other civil and\n\ncriminal penalties imposed for comparable conduct.\"         Davis v.\n\nRennie, 264 F.3d 86, 116 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Romano v. U-Haul\n\nInt'l, 233 F.3d 655, 672-73 (1st Cir. 2000)).   We will not disturb\n\nsuch an award \"unless we find it certain that the amount in\n\nquestion exceeds that necessary to punish and deter the alleged\n\nmisconduct.\"   Borges Colon, 438 F.3d at 21 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n          The record here satisfies the ancillary criteria that\n\nordinarily are thought to be relevant to the sustainability of\n\npunitive damage awards.     The reprehensibility of the defendants'\n\nmisconduct is the most salient of these criteria.        See BMW, 517\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fU.S. at 575; Romano, 233 F.3d at 673.               On the plaintiffs' version\n\nof events — a version that the jury evidently believed and that,\n\ntherefore, we must credit — the defendants' behavior reflects a\n\nhigh degree of culpability.            That misconduct was well outside the\n\nacceptable norms of police work.            See Nydam v. Lennerton, 948 F.2d\n\n808, 811 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing the conduct of police in\n\nassaulting a citizen who supposedly was resisting arrest).\n\n                 To add fuel to the fire, a punitive damage award may be\n\n\"justified        not    only   by   defendants'    actions   on    [the   date   in\n\nquestion] but also by their subsequent behavior.\"                  Davis, 264 F.3d\n\nat 115 (quoting Hall v. Ochs, 817 F.2d 920, 927 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\nHere, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the subsequent\n\nfiling of felony charges against Casillas and López demonstrated\n\nthe officers' improper motives and callous indifference to the\n\nplaintiffs' rights.4             Comparing the testimony of the defendants\n\nwith that of the plaintiffs' witnesses, \"a factfinder might infer\n\nthat       the   stark   clash    could   not    have   resulted    from   innocent\n\nmisrecollection and that its intentional quality intensified any\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      The defendants place great emphasis on the fact that a\nmagistrate found probable cause to charge the plaintiffs with\nresisting arrest and violence against public officials.    This\nreliance is mislaid: neither plaintiff was convicted on those\ncharges, and the jury in this case supportably found that the\ndefendants had brutally beaten both Casillas and López, in\nviolation of their constitutional rights. See Graham v. Connor,\n490 U.S. 386, 394-95 (1989).\n\n                                          -17-\n\fneed the jury may have found for punishment and deterrence.\"                Id.\n\nat 116 (quoting Hall, 817 F.2d at 928).\n\n           The punitive damage award also fits comfortably with the\n\nremaining BMW factors.      For one thing, the award was reasonable in\n\nproportion to the compensatory damage awards.                Assuming that the\n\npunitive damage award is to be divided evenly in two, see supra\n\nnote 2, the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is 10:1\n\nfor Casillas and 2:1 for López's estate.5               In Romano, we upheld a\n\n19:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, noting that\n\nthe Supreme Court has \"dismissed any simple, mathematical formula\n\nin favor of general inquiry into reasonableness.\" 233 F.3d at 673.\n\nGiven that the record supports a finding of substantial physical\n\nand emotional harm, the ratio between punitive and compensatory\n\ndamages presents no cause for concern in this case.\n\n           The final BMW factor requires us to view the punitive\n\ndamage   award    \"in   light   of    the     complex   of   statutory   schemes\n\ndeveloped to respond to the same sort of underlying conduct.\"\n\nZimmerman, 262 F.3d at 82.              \"[A] reviewing court engaged in\n\ndetermining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive\n\nshould   accord    substantial       deference    to    legislative   judgments\n\nconcerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.\"                 Id.\n\n\n\n     5\n      In mounting this inquiry, courts have compared the aggregate\nfigures to be received by the plaintiff rather than the per capita\nfigures to be paid by each defendant. See Davis 264 F.3d at 116-\n17.\n\n                                       -18-\n\fat 82-83.    In drafting section 1983, Congress did not make any\n\nreference to the quantum of damages.          We may, therefore, consider\n\nawards in similar cases to help determine if particular punitive\n\ndamages in a given case appear excessive.           See Davis, 264 F.3d at\n\n117.\n\n            A canvass of punitive damage awards upheld in comparable\n\nsection   1983    cases   makes   it    nose-on-the-face   plain   that   the\n\npunitive damages granted in this case are not out of line.                See,\n\ne.g., Estate of Moreland v. Dieter, 395 F.3d 747, 751 (7th Cir.\n\n2005) (approving award of $27,500,000 in punitive damages in an\n\nexcessive force case); Davis, 264 F.3d at 116-17 (affirming award\n\nof   $1,025,000   in   punitive   damages     in   excessive   force   case);\n\nGutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 581 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(upholding a punitive damage award of $600,000); see also Nydam,\n\n948 F.2d at 811 (characterizing as \"restrain[ed]\" an award of\n\n$65,000 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages\n\nfor excessive force).       In fine, there is no indication that the\n\nlast BMW factor undermines the integrity of the present punitive\n\ndamage award.\n\n            To sum up, the jury supportably found that the defendants\n\nbrutally beat both Casillas and López, and thereby violated their\n\ncivil rights.     It awarded substantial punitive damages — but the\n\namount, though generous, was not beyond the outer limit of what may\n\nhave been reasonably necessary to punish the offenders and deter\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fothers   from   similar   misconduct.    Consequently,   we   descry   no\n\nprincipled basis on which we might either jettison or trim the\n\naward.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reject the appeal and uphold the judgment in all respects.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f",

In reaching this verdict, the jury found that four police officers, defendants Romualdo Palau, Juan Mart&#237;nez, Liz D&#237;az, and Gabriel De Le&#243;n, had used excessive force in an encounter with Casillas and L&#243;pez. In this venue, the officers, as appellants, maintain that the lower court erred in denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law and their alternative motion for a new trial or a remittitur. Discerning no preserved error, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rehearse the facts as the jury supportably could have found them, guided by the rule that \"when the losing party protests the sufficiency of the evidence, the court of appeals must take both the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the jury's verdict.\" <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1188 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 18, 2000, at approximately 4:30 a.m., the defendants encountered L&#243;pez, Casillas, and Casillas's bride-to-be, Barbara Lee Camacho, while the three civilians were making the rounds of San Juan's casinos. Officers Palau and Mart&#237;nez stopped L&#243;pez's vehicle, in which the trio was riding, at the Ambassador Hotel. Without incident, they ticketed the operator, Casillas, for driving against traffic and failing to wear a seat belt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime later that morning, the plaintiffs and the defendants met again at the Condado Plaza Hotel. The defendants claim that they confronted Casillas and L&#243;pez after receiving information that the pair had been involved in a \"hit-and-run\" incident in the parking lot of the Ambassador Hotel. Although all parties agree that an altercation ensued, the testimony as to exactly what transpired is widely divergent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs say that at the time of the confrontation Casillas was speaking to a cabdriver outside the lobby of the Condado Plaza, while L&#243;pez was asleep in the back seat of his parked car. According to their version of the events, the police berated the two men and then manhandled them for no apparent reason. The defendants tell a vastly different tale. They claim that they approached Casillas near the hotel lobby, that he pushed one of the officers, and that L&#243;pez physically interfered with the officers' attempt to subdue Casillas. In the officers' view, Casillas and L&#243;pez were the aggressors in the fracas that ensued; in the plaintiffs' view, the officers were the aggressors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that, during the melee, Casillas and L&#243;pez sustained injuries, and that the defendants proceeded to take the two men into custody. They charged Casillas with eight misdemeanor traffic infractions. In addition, they swore out felony charges against both Casillas and L&#243;pez for alleged acts of violence aimed at public officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criminal charges came to naught. The case against L&#243;pez was rendered moot when he committed suicide; the charges against Casillas were dropped. In the meantime, the battleground shifted from the criminal courts to the civil courts: on September 18, 2001, Casillas and L&#243;pez's parents, representing his estate, sued the officers under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' complaint alleged, variously, use of excessive force, false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution. The defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint, and, in due course, a jury trial commenced. At the close of the plaintiffs' case in chief, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), citing an ostensible lack of evidence. The district court reserved decision. At the close of all the evidence, the court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants on the claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution but allowed the excessive force claims to go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that the defendants had used excessive force against both Casillas and L&#243;pez. It awarded Casillas $50,000 in compensatory damages ($25,000 each against Palau and Mart&#237;nez) and awarded L&#243;pez's estate $250,000 in compensatory damages ($125,000 each against D&#237;az and De Le&#243;n). As a coup de grace, the jury awarded a total of $1,000,000 in punitive damages ($250,000 against each of the four defendants).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed a timely post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial or a remittitur. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), 59(a). The district court denied the motion. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. LIABILITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the defendants' challenge to the liability verdict into three segments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law poses a question of law, engendering de novo review. <i>See Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 100 F.3d 203, 208 (1st Cir.1996). Where, as here, such a motion contests the sufficiency of the proof, \"the court of appeals must examine the evidence and the inferences reasonably to be extracted therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant.\" <i>S&#225;nchez v. P.R. Oil Co.,</i> 37 F.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir.1994). In performing this tamisage, \"we may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" <i>Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment as a matter of law should be approved, or the denial of such a judgment reversed, \"only when the evidence, viewed from this perspective, is such that reasonable persons could reach but one conclusion.\" <i>Id.</i> It follows that we \"may reverse the denial of such a motion only if reasonable persons could not have reached the conclusion that the jury embraced.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1191 (quoting <i>S&#225;nchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 716).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's disposition of a Rule 59(e) motion is also narrowly circumscribed. A district court may set aside the jury's verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is against the law, against the weight of the credible evidence, or tantamount to a miscarriage of justice. <i>See S&#225;nchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 717. A district court's disinclination to disturb a jury's verdict \"can be reversed solely for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Waiver.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold issue, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants have waived their sufficiency of the evidence challenge by not raising it until their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. The premise on which this contention rests is impeccable: a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) cannot assert new grounds but, rather, is \"bounded by the movant's earlier Rule 50(a) motion.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1196. In other words, a party cannot use a Rule 50(b) motion as an instrument for introducing a neoteric legal theory &#8212; one not distinctly articulated in his end-of-the-evidence motion for judgment as a matter of law &#8212; into the case. <i>See id.; see also</i> James W. Moore, 5A Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 50.08 (2d ed.1994) (explaining that \"any argument omitted from the motion made at the close of the evidence is waived as a ground for judgment under Rule 50(b)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the correctness of the plaintiffs' premise, their conclusion is awry. The record here reflects that the defendants began the oral presentation of their Rule 50(a) motion at the close of the plaintiffs' case with the assertion that the plaintiffs had failed \"to put forth sufficient admissible evidence\" to allow a reasonable jury to \"find in their favor on a variety of crucial factual issues.\" When the defendants renewed the Rule 50(a) motion at the close of all the evidence, they made transparently clear their belief \"that plaintiffs have failed to provide any evidence of a use of excessive force.\" Based on these and other pertinent references contained in the record, we are satisfied that the defendants raised their sufficiency of the evidence challenge in a timely manner. Consequently, the issue has been preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Use of Excessive Force.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we inquire first whether a reasonable juror could have reached a conclusion favorable to the plaintiffs concerning the use of excessive force. <i>See Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 200. The record here demands an affirmative answer to that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Casillas and Camacho testified about the events of September 18, 2000. Their testimony, taken at face value, indicated that Casillas and L&#243;pez were attacked without any provocation and savagely beaten. The defendants presented a markedly different version of the events surrounding the arrests. They depicted Casillas and L&#243;pez as the aggressors, and characterized their own use of force as reasonably necessary under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, the issue boiled down to an assessment of the comparative credibility of the witnesses. When, as now, the credibility of witnesses comprises the crux of the matter, a reviewing court must take special care not to intrude upon the jury's domain. <i>See Tennant v. Peoria &amp; Pekin Union Ry. Co.,</i> 321 U.S. 29, 35, 64 S.Ct. 409, 88 L.Ed. 520 (1944); <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 200. It is the proper province of the jury, not the court of appeals, to separate wheat from chaff, resolve inconsistencies in the witnesses's accounts, and determine what testimony is or is not worthy of credence. <i>See Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1194.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs' evidence showed that both Casillas and L&#243;pez were brutally assaulted and beaten into unconsciousness, without legitimate reason or provocation. Viewing the record, as we must, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and making credibility calls to their behoof, we cannot say that the liability verdict was irrational or unresponsive to the proof. The short of it is that the plaintiffs' evidence, which included photographs depicting the physical injuries inflicted by the defendants and medical records describing those injuries, was enough to ground the liability verdict. From that evidence, a reasonable jury could well have concluded &#8212; as this jury did &#8212; that the defendants used extravagant force in arresting Casillas and L&#243;pez. Accordingly, the defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No useful purpose would be served by a separate discussion of the new trial motion insofar as it pertains to liability. After all, the district judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, declined to meddle with the jury's factfinding. Given the sharply divergent accounts presented by the witnesses, we are bound to defer to the trial judge's first-hand appraisal of which side had the better of its argument. <i>See, e.g., id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. On this variegated record, a finding that the officers resorted to excessive force was contrary to neither the law nor the weight of the evidence. By the same token, that finding did not in any way herald a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we hold that the district court's ratification of the jury's liability verdict did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Civil Rules permit a party aggrieved by a jury verdict to move within a stipulated time frame for a new trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). In their timely posttrial motion, the defendants challenged, inter alia, the size of the compensatory damage awards, shaping this aspect of their motion as a request for a remittitur. The district court rejected the argument that the awards were overly munificent, declaring that neither award was \"so grossly excessive or inordinate to warrant setting it aside.\" The defendants now renew this argument on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is trite, but true, that \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money damages &#8212; especially in cases which involve few significant items of measurable economic loss &#8212; is a matter peculiarly within a jury's ken.\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 215. Accordingly, only infrequently &#8212; and then, for compelling reasons &#8212; will we, from the vantage point of an algid appellate record, override the jury's judgment as to the appropriate amount of non-economic damages to which a plaintiff is entitled. <i>See id.; Brown v. Freedman Baking Co.,</i> 810 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1987). That is especially so where, as here, the trial judge, who saw and heard the fray fought out in real time, has endorsed the award. <i>See Ruiz v. Caraballo,</i> 929 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1991). It follows logically that a verdict approved by both the jurors and the trial judge will be pared \"only if it is shown to exceed any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence before the jury.\" <i>Dopp v. Pritzker,</i> 38 F.3d 1239, 1249 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc.,</i> 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard of review is extremely deferential. That deference ordinarily is expressed in terms of abuse of discretion. <i>See Borges Colon v. Roman-Abreu,</i> 438 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Rivera-Torres v. Velez,</i> 341 F.3d 86, 102 (1st Cir. 2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 541 U.S. 972, 124 S.Ct. 1875, 158 L.Ed.2d 466 (2004). The defendant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that a challenged award is \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1197 (quoting <i>Segal,</i> 746 F.2d at 81).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury, without objection, that in assessing damages it could consider any physical, mental, or emotional harm sustained by the injured parties, their reasonable medical expenses, and the extent and duration of their injuries. The court cautioned that the damages must be \"reasonable\" and not \"based on speculation or guesswork.\" The defendants take no exception to the court's instruction. The question, then, is factbound &#8212; but the defendants do not deal with the facts in any meaningful way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Few principles are more a part of the warp and woof of appellate practice than the principle that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). We have parroted this principle with a regularity bordering on the monotonous. <i>See, e.g., Fradera v. Mun'y of Mayaguez,</i> 440 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Cytyc Corp. v. DEKA Prods., Ltd. P'ship,</i> 439 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer &amp; Hertell v. Medfit Int'l., Inc.,</i> 982 F.2d 686, 687 (1st Cir.1993). These reiterations are not meant to be regarded as empty words: our adherence to this principle imposes on litigants an unflagging obligation to spell out their contentions \"squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [their] peace.\" <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. \"[I]t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the defendants' challenge to the compensatory damage awards flagrantly violates this bedrock principle. In the \"Argument\" section of their brief, the defendants posit that \"even if the Court does not grant a new trial, the Court should at least reduce the amount of the damages awarded by the jury.\" Appellants' Br. at 14. They then cite general language from a few cases addressing the court's authority to order a new trial if a verdict is unreasonably high. <i>See id.</i> After alluding to this case law, the defendants baldly state, in a completely conclusory fashion, that \"after reviewing the evidence and testimony presented during the trial [it] is fundamental that the Court review the amount of damages awarded by the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is their entire argument on this issue. They at no point attempt to apply the case law to the facts adduced at trial; they at no point marshal the evidence as to the injuries and damages sustained by either Casillas or L&#243;pez; and they at no point discuss, let alone analyze, the pain, suffering, and emotional distress engendered by those injuries. To cinch matters, their brief is devoid of any citations to the record; they attempt neither to identify the relevant evidence nor to show how that evidence relates to &#8212; let alone undermines &#8212; the compensatory damage awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This slap-dash approach is wholly inadequate to preserve the issue of excessiveness for appellate review. A case closely on point is <i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> 295 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2002). There, the defendant asserted that damages had been calculated improperly but failed to provide any meaningful record references or otherwise to analyze the pertinent evidence. <i>See id.</i> at 82. In the absence of any particularized showing as to why the awarded damages were incorrect, we deemed the argument waived. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same holds true in this case. The defendants grouse about the size of the compensatory damage awards but then, in effect, invite us to rummage through the record, unassisted by any semblance of developed argumentation, in order to evaluate their claim of excessiveness. As we have explained above, sound practice demands that we decline this unattractive invitation: if a party does not put enough stock in an argument to flesh it out, a reviewing court should normally dismiss the argument out of hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See King v. Town of Hanover,</i> 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir.1997). To do otherwise would be unfair both to the adverse party and to the court itself. We therefore treat the claim as waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also challenge the amount of punitive damages. Here, too, their argument is insufficiently developed and subject to rejection on that ground alone. <i>See Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. We need not rest on that ground, however, because the argument is also patently meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury may levy punitive damages in a section 1983 action when a defendant's conduct is \"shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\" <i>Smith v. Wade,</i> 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983); <i>see also Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir.1999). In order for punitive damages to be appropriate, there must be \"proof that the defendant acted `in the face of a perceived risk that [his] actions [would] violate federal law.'\" <i>Iacobucci,</i> 193 F.3d at 26 (quoting <i>Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n,</i> 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999) (alterations in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax long eloquent. The district court instructed the jury, without objection, that a determination to award punitive damages was to be based on \"whether you find that the defendants acted willfully, deliberately, maliciously, or with reckless disregard of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\" On the basis of the evidence recounted above, the jury easily could have found that the defendants acted in the face of a perceived (and flatly unacceptable) risk that their actions would compromise Casillas's and L&#243;pez's Fourth Amendment rights. No more was exigible. <i>See Borges Colon,</i> 438 F.3d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion that an award of punitive damages was permissible does not end our journey. The defendants' challenge to the <i>amount</i> of punitive damages presents an independent legal issue &#8212; one that engenders de novo review. <i>See id.</i> at 21. This review is \"informed by principles of fundamental fairness,\" which \"dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty\" that may be imposed. <i>Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit Union,</i> 262 F.3d 70, 81 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore,</i> 517 U.S. 559, 574, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the reasonableness of a punitive damage award ancillary to a violation of section 1983, we consider \"(1) the degree of reprehensibility of a defendant's conduct; (2) the ratio between punitive and actual and potential damages; and (3) a comparison of the punitive damages figure and other civil and criminal penalties imposed for comparable conduct.\" <i>Davis v. Rennie,</i> 264 F.3d 86, 116 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Romano v. U-Haul Int'l,</i> 233 F.3d 655, 672-73 (1st Cir.2000)). We will not disturb such an award \"unless we find it certain that the amount in question exceeds that necessary to punish and deter the alleged misconduct.\" <i>Borges Colon,</i> 438 F.3d at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here satisfies the ancillary criteria that ordinarily are thought to be relevant to the sustainability of punitive damage awards. The reprehensibility of the defendants' misconduct is the most salient of these criteria. <i>See BMW,</i> 517 U.S. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1589; <i>Romano,</i> 233 F.3d at 673. On the plaintiffs' version of events &#8212; a version that the jury evidently believed and that, therefore, we must credit &#8212; the defendants' behavior reflects a high degree of culpability. That misconduct was well outside the acceptable norms of police work. <i>See Nydam v. Lennerton,</i> 948 F.2d 808, 811 (1st Cir.1991) (discussing the conduct of police in assaulting a citizen who supposedly was resisting arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To add fuel to the fire, a punitive damage award may be \"justified not only by defendants' actions on [the date in question] but also by their subsequent behavior.\" <i>Davis,</i> 264 F.3d at 115 (quoting <i>Hall v. Ochs,</i> 817 F.2d 920, 927 (1st Cir.1987)). Here, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the subsequent filing of felony charges against Casillas and L&#243;pez demonstrated the officers' improper motives and callous indifference to the plaintiffs' rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Comparing the testimony of the defendants with that of the plaintiffs' witnesses, \"a factfinder might infer that the stark clash could not have resulted from innocent misrecollection and that its <i>intentional</i> quality intensified any need the jury may have found for punishment and deterrence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 116 (quoting <i>Hall,</i> 817 F.2d at 928).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The punitive damage award also fits comfortably with the remaining <i>BMW</i> factors. For one thing, the award was reasonable in proportion to the compensatory damage awards. Assuming that the punitive damage award is to be divided evenly in two, <i>see supra</i> note 2, the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is 10:1 for Casillas and 2:1 for L&#243;pez's estate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In <i>Romano,</i> we upheld a 19:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, noting that the Supreme Court has \"dismissed any simple, mathematical formula in favor of general inquiry into reasonableness.\" 233 F.3d at 673. Given that the record supports a finding of substantial physical and emotional harm, the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages presents no cause for concern in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final <i>BMW</i> factor requires us to view the punitive damage award \"in light of the complex of statutory schemes developed to respond to the same sort of underlying conduct.\" <i>Zimmerman,</i> 262 F.3d at 82. \"[A] reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should accord substantial deference to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 82-83. In drafting section 1983, Congress did not make any reference to the quantum of damages. We may, therefore, consider awards in similar cases to help determine if particular punitive damages in a given case appear excessive. <i>See Davis,</i> 264 F.3d at 117.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A canvass of punitive damage awards upheld in comparable section 1983 cases makes it nose-on-the-face plain that the punitive damages granted in this case are not out of line. <i>See, e.g., Estate of Moreland v. Dieter,</i> 395 F.3d 747, 751 (7th Cir.2005) (approving award of $27,500,000 in punitive damages in an excessive force case); <i>Davis,</i> 264 F.3d at 116-17 (affirming award of $1,025,000 in punitive damages in excessive force case); <i>Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena,</i> 882 F.2d 553, 581 (1st Cir.1989) (upholding a punitive damage award of $600,000); <i>see also Nydam,</i> 948 F.2d at 811 (characterizing as \"restrain[ed]\" an award of $65,000 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages for excessive force). In fine, there is no indication that the last <i>BMW</i> factor undermines the integrity of the present punitive damage award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the jury supportably found that the defendants brutally beat both Casillas and L&#243;pez, and thereby violated their civil rights. It awarded substantial punitive damages &#8212; but the amount, though generous, was not beyond the outer limit of what may have been reasonably necessary to punish the offenders and deter others from similar misconduct. Consequently, we descry no principled basis on which we might either jettison or trim the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

In reaching this verdict, the jury found that four police officers, defendants Romualdo Palau, Juan Mart&#237;nez, Liz D&#237;az, and Gabriel De Le&#243;n, had used excessive force in an encounter with Casillas and L&#243;pez.

Officers Palau and Mart&#237;nez stopped L&#243;pez's vehicle, in which the trio was riding, at the Ambassador Hotel.

Although all parties agree that an altercation ensued, the testimony as to exactly what transpired is widely divergent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs say that at the time of the confrontation Casillas was speaking to a cabdriver outside the lobby of the Condado Plaza, while L&#243;pez was asleep in the back seat of his parked car. According to their version of the events, the police berated the two men and then manhandled them for no apparent reason. The defendants tell a vastly different tale. They claim that they approached Casillas near the hotel lobby, that he pushed one of the officers, and that L&#243;pez physically interfered with the officers' attempt to subdue Casillas. In the officers' view, Casillas and L&#243;pez were the aggressors in the fracas that ensued; in the plaintiffs' view, the officers were the aggressors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that, during the melee, Casillas and L&#243;pez sustained injuries, and that the defendants proceeded to take the two men into custody. They charged Casillas with eight misdemeanor traffic infractions. In addition, they swore out felony charges against both Casillas and L&#243;pez for alleged acts of violence aimed at public officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criminal charges came to naught. The case against L&#243;pez was rendered moot when he committed suicide; the charges against Casillas were dropped. In the meantime, the battleground shifted from the criminal courts to the civil courts: on September 18, 2001, Casillas and L&#243;pez's parents, representing his estate, sued the officers under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' complaint alleged, variously, use of excessive force, false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution. The defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint, and, in due course, a jury trial commenced. At the close of the plaintiffs' case in chief, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), citing an ostensible lack of evidence. The district court reserved decision. At the close of all the evidence, the court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants on the claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution but allowed the excessive force claims to go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that the defendants had used excessive force against both Casillas and L&#243;pez. It awarded Casillas $50,000 in compensatory damages ($25,000 each against Palau and Mart&#237;nez) and awarded L&#243;pez's estate $250,000 in compensatory damages ($125,000 each against D&#237;az and De Le&#243;n). As a coup de grace, the jury awarded a total of $1,000,000 in punitive damages ($250,000 against each of the four defendants).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed a timely post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial or a remittitur. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), 59(a).

A district court may set aside the jury's verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is against the law, against the weight of the credible evidence, or tantamount to a miscarriage of justice. <i>See S&#225;nchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 717. A district court's disinclination to disturb a jury's verdict \"can be reversed solely for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Waiver.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold issue, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants have waived their sufficiency of the evidence challenge by not raising it until their post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. The premise on which this contention rests is impeccable: a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) cannot assert new grounds but, rather, is \"bounded by the movant's earlier Rule 50(a) motion.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1196. In other words, a party cannot use a Rule 50(b) motion as an instrument for introducing a neoteric legal theory &#8212; one not distinctly articulated in his end-of-the-evidence motion for judgment as a matter of law &#8212; into the case. <i>See id.; see also</i> James W. Moore, 5A Moore's Federal Practice &#182; 50.08 (2d ed.1994) (explaining that \"any argument omitted from the motion made at the close of the evidence is waived as a ground for judgment under Rule 50(b)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the correctness of the plaintiffs' premise, their conclusion is awry. The record here reflects that the defendants began the oral presentation of their Rule 50(a) motion at the close of the plaintiffs' case with the assertion that the plaintiffs had failed \"to put forth sufficient admissible evidence\" to allow a reasonable jury to \"find in their favor on a variety of crucial factual issues.\" When the defendants renewed the Rule 50(a) motion at the close of all the evidence, they made transparently clear their belief \"that plaintiffs have failed to provide any evidence of a use of excessive force.\" Based on these and other pertinent references contained in the record, we are satisfied that the defendants raised their sufficiency of the evidence challenge in a timely manner. Consequently, the issue has been preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Use of Excessive Force.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we inquire first whether a reasonable juror could have reached a conclusion favorable to the plaintiffs concerning the use of excessive force. <i>See Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 200. The record here demands an affirmative answer to that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Casillas and Camacho testified about the events of September 18, 2000. Their testimony, taken at face value, indicated that Casillas and L&#243;pez were attacked without any provocation and savagely beaten. The defendants presented a markedly different version of the events surrounding the arrests. They depicted Casillas and L&#243;pez as the aggressors, and characterized their own use of force as reasonably necessary under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, the issue boiled down to an assessment of the comparative credibility of the witnesses. When, as now, the credibility of witnesses comprises the crux of the matter, a reviewing court must take special care not to intrude upon the jury's domain. <i>See Tennant v. Peoria &amp; Pekin Union Ry. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103923\"><a href=\"/opinion/103923/tennant-v-peoria-pekin-union-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 35, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span> (1944); <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 200. It is the proper province of the jury, not the court of appeals, to separate wheat from chaff, resolve inconsistencies in the witnesses's accounts, and determine what testimony is or is not worthy of credence. <i>See Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1194.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs' evidence showed that both Casillas and L&#243;pez were brutally assaulted and beaten into unconsciousness, without legitimate reason or provocation. Viewing the record, as we must, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and making credibility calls to their behoof, we cannot say that the liability verdict was irrational or unresponsive to the proof. The short of it is that the plaintiffs' evidence, which included photographs depicting the physical injuries inflicted by the defendants and medical records describing those injuries, was enough to ground the liability verdict. From that evidence, a reasonable jury could well have concluded &#8212; as this jury did &#8212; that the defendants used extravagant force in arresting Casillas and L&#243;pez. Accordingly, the defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No useful purpose would be served by a separate discussion of the new trial motion insofar as it pertains to liability. After all, the district judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, declined to meddle with the jury's factfinding. Given the sharply divergent accounts presented by the witnesses, we are bound to defer to the trial judge's first-hand appraisal of which side had the better of its argument. <i>See, e.g., id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. On this variegated record, a finding that the officers resorted to excessive force was contrary to neither the law nor the weight of the evidence. By the same token, that finding did not in any way herald a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we hold that the district court's ratification of the jury's liability verdict did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Civil Rules permit a party aggrieved by a jury verdict to move within a stipulated time frame for a new trial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). In their timely posttrial motion, the defendants challenged, inter alia, the size of the compensatory damage awards, shaping this aspect of their motion as a request for a remittitur. The district court rejected the argument that the awards were overly munificent, declaring that neither award was \"so grossly excessive or inordinate to warrant setting it aside.\" The defendants now renew this argument on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is trite, but true, that \"[t]ranslating legal damage into money damages &#8212; especially in cases which involve few significant items of measurable economic loss &#8212; is a matter peculiarly within a jury's ken.\" <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 215. Accordingly, only infrequently &#8212; and then, for compelling reasons &#8212; will we, from the vantage point of an algid appellate record, override the jury's judgment as to the appropriate amount of non-economic damages to which a plaintiff is entitled. <i>See id.; Brown v. Freedman Baking Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482093\"><a href=\"/opinion/482093/steven-brown-v-freedman-baking-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1987). That is especially so where, as here, the trial judge, who saw and heard the fray fought out in real time, has endorsed the award. <i>See Ruiz v. Caraballo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558023\"><a href=\"/opinion/558023/marta-ruiz-aka-marta-ruiz-romero-v-generoso-gonzalez-caraballo-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1991). It follows logically that a verdict approved by both the jurors and the trial judge will be pared \"only if it is shown to exceed any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based upon the evidence before the jury.\" <i>Dopp v. Pritzker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681299\"><a href=\"/opinion/681299/paul-s-dopp-v-jay-pritzker-paul-s-dopp-v-jay-pritzker/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1249 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>Segal v.

The defendant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that a challenged award is \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1197 (quoting <i>Segal,</i> 746 F.2d at 81).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury, without objection, that in assessing damages it could consider any physical, mental, or emotional harm sustained by the injured parties, their reasonable medical expenses, and the extent and duration of their injuries. The court cautioned that the damages must be \"reasonable\" and not \"based on speculation or guesswork.\" The defendants take no exception to the court's instruction. The question, then, is factbound &#8212; but the defendants do not deal with the facts in any meaningful way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Few principles are more a part of the warp and woof of appellate practice than the principle that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" <i>United States v.

These reiterations are not meant to be regarded as empty words: our adherence to this principle imposes on litigants an unflagging obligation to spell out their contentions \"squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [their] peace.\" <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. \"[I]t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the defendants' challenge to the compensatory damage awards flagrantly violates this bedrock principle. In the \"Argument\" section of their brief, the defendants posit that \"even if the Court does not grant a new trial, the Court should at least reduce the amount of the damages awarded by the jury.\" Appellants' Br. at 14. They then cite general language from a few cases addressing the court's authority to order a new trial if a verdict is unreasonably high. <i>See id.</i> After alluding to this case law, the defendants baldly state, in a completely conclusory fashion, that \"after reviewing the evidence and testimony presented during the trial [it] is fundamental that the Court review the amount of damages awarded by the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is their entire argument on this issue. They at no point attempt to apply the case law to the facts adduced at trial; they at no point marshal the evidence as to the injuries and damages sustained by either Casillas or L&#243;pez; and they at no point discuss, let alone analyze, the pain, suffering, and emotional distress engendered by those injuries. To cinch matters, their brief is devoid of any citations to the record; they attempt neither to identify the relevant evidence nor to show how that evidence relates to &#8212; let alone undermines &#8212; the compensatory damage awards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This slap-dash approach is wholly inadequate to preserve the issue of excessiveness for appellate review. A case closely on point is <i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200019\"><a href=\"/opinion/200019/supplies-inc-v-pr-sun-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2002). There, the defendant asserted that damages had been calculated improperly but failed to provide any meaningful record references or otherwise to analyze the pertinent evidence. <i>See id.</i> at 82. In the absence of any particularized showing as to why the awarded damages were incorrect, we deemed the argument waived. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same holds true in this case. The defendants grouse about the size of the compensatory damage awards but then, in effect, invite us to rummage through the record, unassisted by any semblance of developed argumentation, in order to evaluate their claim of excessiveness. As we have explained above, sound practice demands that we decline this unattractive invitation: if a party does not put enough stock in an argument to flesh it out, a reviewing court should normally dismiss the argument out of hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See King v.

The district court instructed the jury, without objection, that a determination to award punitive damages was to be based on \"whether you find that the defendants acted willfully, deliberately, maliciously, or with reckless disregard of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\" On the basis of the evidence recounted above, the jury easily could have found that the defendants acted in the face of a perceived (and flatly unacceptable) risk that their actions would compromise Casillas's and L&#243;pez's Fourth Amendment rights.

The reprehensibility of the defendants' misconduct is the most salient of these criteria. <i>See BMW,</i> 517 U.S. at 575, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118026\"><a href=\"/opinion/118026/bmw-of-north-america-inc-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On the plaintiffs' version of events &#8212; a version that the jury evidently believed and that, therefore, we must credit &#8212; the defendants' behavior reflects a high degree of culpability. That misconduct was well outside the acceptable norms of police work. <i>See Nydam v.

Here, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the subsequent filing of felony charges against Casillas and L&#243;pez demonstrated the officers' improper motives and callous indifference to the plaintiffs' rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Comparing the testimony of the defendants with that of the plaintiffs' witnesses, \"a factfinder might infer that the stark clash could not have resulted from innocent misrecollection and that its <i>intentional</i> quality intensified any need the jury may have found for punishment and deterrence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 116 (quoting <i>Hall,</i> 817 F.2d at 928).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The punitive damage award also fits comfortably with the remaining <i>BMW</i> factors. For one thing, the award was reasonable in proportion to the compensatory damage awards. Assuming that the punitive damage award is to be divided evenly in two, <i>see supra</i> note 2, the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages is 10:1 for Casillas and 2:1 for L&#243;pez's estate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In <i>Romano,</i> we upheld a 19:1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, noting that the Supreme Court has \"dismissed any simple, mathematical formula in favor of general inquiry into reasonableness.\" 233 F.3d at 673. Given that the record supports a finding of substantial physical and emotional harm, the ratio between punitive and compensatory damages presents no cause for concern in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final <i>BMW</i> factor requires us to view the punitive damage award \"in light of the complex of statutory schemes developed to respond to the same sort of underlying conduct.\" <i>Zimmerman,</i> 262 F.3d at 82. \"[A] reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should accord substantial deference to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 82-83. In drafting section 1983, Congress did not make any reference to the quantum of damages. We may, therefore, consider awards in similar cases to help determine if particular punitive damages in a given case appear excessive. <i>See Davis,</i> 264 F.3d at 117.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A canvass of punitive damage awards upheld in comparable section 1983 cases makes it nose-on-the-face plain that the punitive damages granted in this case are not out of line. <i>See, e.g., Estate of Moreland v.

It awarded substantial punitive damages &#8212; but the amount, though generous, was not beyond the outer limit of what may have been reasonably necessary to punish the offenders and deter others from similar misconduct.
