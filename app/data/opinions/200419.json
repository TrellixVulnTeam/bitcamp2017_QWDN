Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Ruth Santiago for appellants.\n     Steve Frank, Attorney, Appellate Staff, Civil Division, Dep't\nof Justice, with whom Robert D. McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Robert S.\nGreenspan, Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 7, 2003\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge. This appeal requires us to address\n\nthe parameters of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1346(b), 2671-2680, and, in particular, its misrepresentation and\n\ndiscretionary function exceptions.            The plaintiffs (appellants\n\nhere) are 108 persons who own a total of 67 residential properties\n\nin Salinas, Puerto Rico.       These homes are situated in two housing\n\ndevelopments that have undergone repeated flooding.                 Noting that\n\nfederal officials played a significant role in the planning,\n\nsiting, construction, and financing of the projects, the plaintiffs\n\nseek to hold the government answerable in damages.               They sue under\n\nthe FTCA, a statutory scheme that carves out a tort-based exception\n\nto the federal government's sovereign immunity.                  But the FTCA's\n\nexception    to   sovereign    immunity     itself    contains      exceptions.\n\nBecause the plaintiffs' claims, as stated, fall within spheres that\n\nthe FTCA abjures, we conclude that the district court properly\n\ndismissed   the   amended     complaint    for     lack   of    subject    matter\n\njurisdiction.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).\n\n            We afford plenary review to a district court's order of\n\ndismissal   for   lack   of   subject     matter    jurisdiction.         Corrada\n\nBetances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nAt the pleading stage, such an order is appropriate only when the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint, taken as true, do not justify the\n\nexercise of subject matter jurisdiction.             Royal v. Leading Edge\n\nProds., Inc., 833 F.2d 1, 1 (1st Cir. 1987).                   In line with the\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fforegoing, we glean the relevant background information from the\n\nplaintiffs' amended complaint, accepting the well-pleaded factual\n\naverments contained therein and indulging all reasonable inferences\n\nin the plaintiffs' favor.    Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d\n\n358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           The plaintiffs purchased their homes at various times\n\nbetween 1973 and 1995.      All of them obtained loans through the\n\nFarmers    Home   Administration     (FmHA),   the   Federal   Housing\n\nAdministration (FHA), or some other federal agency. They attribute\n\ntheir current predicament to the government's negligence.\n\n           In their view, the principal difficulty is that the\n\ngovernment sited the housing developments along the Nigua River\n\nbasin.    That area has endured flooding both before and after the\n\ndevelopments were built. The amended complaint enumerates no fewer\n\nthan eight major floods (occurring in 1928, 1933, 1956, 1970, 1975,\n\n1985, 1992, and 1996).       Progressive soil movement has placed\n\nunaccustomed strains on foundations, and most plaintiffs report\n\nstructural damage to walls, roofs, and floors.         Moreover, poor\n\ndrainage results in a backflow of sewage whenever flooding occurs.\n\nOver time, these conditions have taken their toll:     the plaintiffs\n\nsay that their dwellings are now in \"total ruin\" and \"unfit\" for\n\nhuman habitation.   They themselves have experienced mental anguish\n\nand emotional distress.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          The plaintiffs filed unsuccessful administrative claims\n\nwith the appropriate agencies in 1998 and 2000 and, in the same\n\ntime frame, brought suit in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico.1     Their amended complaint alleges that\n\nthe government has had an intimate involvement with the planning\n\nand construction of the housing developments. For example, federal\n\nagencies (1) approved the specifications under which the dwellings\n\nwere built; (2) granted mortgage loans in which they reserved the\n\nright to inspect the properties and obligated the plaintiffs to\n\nexecute any repairs that they requested; (3) compelled the sellers\n\nof the homes to issue builders' warranties; and (4) retained the\n\nright to insist upon certain types of insurance coverage.            The\n\namended complaint proceeds to list a litany of acts and omissions\n\nthat form the basis for the government's putative liability. These\n\ninclude the government's supposed failures to (1) inspect the\n\nplaintiffs' properties with adequate care; (2) scrutinize the\n\ntopography   and   detect   the   substantial   likelihood   of   future\n\nflooding; (3) provide reasonable oversight during construction; (4)\n\nwarn the plaintiffs that their homes were in a floodway zone; (5)\n\nrequire the plaintiffs to carry flood insurance (or advise them of\n\n\n     1\n      Originally, the plaintiffs asserted claims premised not only\non the FTCA but also on the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n1346(a)(2), and Puerto Rico law.    In an unpublished order, the\ndistrict court dismissed all of the non-FTCA claims. See Muñiz-\nRivera v. United States, No. 98-2001 (D.P.R. Sept. 25, 2000).\nBecause the plaintiffs have not challenged that order, we confine\nourselves to a consideration of the FTCA claims.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe need for it); and (6) take appropriate measures to protect the\n\nhouses from flooding.\n\n          The   government    responded    to    the   plaintiffs'   amended\n\ncomplaint with a motion to dismiss.             The district court, in a\n\nscholarly opinion, granted the motion.            Muñiz-Rivera v. United\n\nStates, 204 F. Supp. 2d 305 (D.P.R. 2002).              The plaintiffs now\n\nappeal that ruling.     Although our reasoning differs slightly from\n\nthe district court's, we affirm the order of dismissal.                  See\n\nTicketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (explaining that an appeals court is \"free to affirm the\n\njudgment below on any independently sufficient ground made manifest\n\nby the record\").\n\n          The FTCA constitutes \"a limited waiver of the federal\n\ngovernment's sovereign immunity\" against private suits. Shansky v.\n\nUnited States, 164 F.3d 688, 690 (1st Cir. 1999).            The narrowing\n\nadjective is necessary because there are a number of situations in\n\nwhich the waiver will not attach. The government contends that the\n\nplaintiffs' claims fall within the compass of these exceptions. If\n\nso, the instant action is outside the ambit of federal subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.     See Hydrogen Tech. Corp. v. United States,\n\n831 F.2d 1155, 1161 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that the FTCA's\n\nexceptions   \"define    the    limits     of    federal    subject    matter\n\njurisdiction in this area\").     We test the government's hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fby classifying the plaintiffs' claims and then evaluating each\n\ncategory of claims through the prism of the FTCA's exceptions.\n\n           The first category of claims includes the plaintiffs'\n\naccusations that the government negligently failed to warn of the\n\ndanger of future flooding, advise the plaintiffs of the need for\n\nflood   insurance,   and   inform   them   that   their   homes   were   not\n\nconstructed stoutly enough to withstand the ineluctable forces of\n\nnature.   Despite the plaintiffs' disclaimers, these allegations\n\nnecessarily rest on the premise that the federal government had a\n\nduty to exercise due care in communicating useful information\n\nregarding the safety and security of the plaintiffs' properties;\n\nthat the plaintiffs reasonably relied on government officials to\n\nfulfill this duty; and that the government let them down.\n\n           We need not decide whether the government owed such a\n\nduty to the plaintiffs.      Assuming, for argument's sake, that it\n\ndid, any breach of the duty would fall squarely within the FTCA's\n\nmisrepresentation exception.\n\n           The misrepresentation exception immunizes the United\n\nStates from liability for \"[a]ny claim arising out of . . .\n\nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).       The exception extends to a wide range of\n\ncommunicative activity (including failures of communication).            The\n\nleading case on this exception is United States v. Neustadt, 366\n\nU.S. 696 (1961), in which a home buyer reasonably relied on an\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ferroneous FHA appraisal.       Id. at 698-700.           In declaring that the\n\nplaintiff's claim for ensuing economic harm was barred by the\n\nmisrepresentation exception, the Supreme Court observed that, in\n\nenacting section 2680(h), Congress \"clearly meant to exclude claims\n\narising    out     of     negligent,          as      well     as        deliberate,\n\nmisrepresentation.\" Id. at 702. Thus, the exception insulates the\n\ngovernment against liability for conveying false or inaccurate\n\ninformation.     Id. at 706-07; see also Jimenez-Nieves v. United\n\nStates,   682    F.2d     1,    4     (1st     Cir.      1982)      (noting       that\n\nmisrepresentation, as an independent tort, is comprised of the\n\ndissemination    of    false   information         and   the   reliance      by   the\n\nplaintiff upon that information). The case law makes manifest that\n\nthe prophylaxis of the misrepresentation exception extends to\n\nfailures of communication.          See, e.g., JBP Acquisitions v. United\n\nStates, 224 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2000); Green v. United\n\nStates, 629 F.2d 581, 584 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n          In this case, the plaintiffs' first set of claims are\n\ngrounded in just such a theory of liability.                     The plaintiffs\n\ncontend   that   the    government's         intimate     role      in    approving,\n\nfinancing, and monitoring the housing projects implicitly conveyed\n\nan assurance that the homes constituted secure domiciles, and that\n\nthe lack of any warning calculated to alert the plaintiffs to the\n\nlikelihood of future harm reinforced those implied assurances.\n\nEven if such acts and omissions were negligent — a matter on which\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fwe take no view — the misrepresentation exception precludes the\n\nassertion of a cause of action against the government based upon\n\neither miscommunication or non-communication of the information in\n\nquestion.    See JBP Acquisitions, 224 F.3d at 1266 (holding that a\n\n\"failure to communicate, as well as direct miscommunication, is\n\nencompassed by the misrepresentation exception\"); Green, 629 F.2d\n\nat 584 (noting that the misrepresentation exception \"bar[s] suits\n\nbased on a failure to give any warning to injured parties\").\n\n            The plaintiffs also accuse the government of negligently\n\ninspecting their homes and failing to detect the likely problems\n\nassociated   with   future   flooding.      These   claims    are    likewise\n\nprecluded    by   the   misrepresentation    exception.       A     negligent\n\ninspection, in and of itself, cannot cause injury.           Harm can occur\n\n(and, thus, liability can attach) only if the inspection leads\n\neither to the communication of inaccurate information or to a\n\nfailure to communicate precautionary information.              See Farmers\n\nState Sav. Bank v. FmHA, 891 F.2d 200, 202 (8th Cir. 1989) (holding\n\nthat injuries to FTCA plaintiffs who allege faulty inspection or\n\nassessment are \"caused by reliance on the representations of\n\ngovernment officials and not by reliance on an undertaking that\n\nthose officials performed negligently\"); see also Comm'l Union Ins.\n\nCo. v. United States, 928 F.2d 176, 179 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding\n\nthat the misrepresentation exception covers instances in which \"the\n\nchain of causation from the alleged negligence to the alleged\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\finjury   depends   upon    the   transmission      of   misinformation         by   a\n\ngovernment agent\").       This takes us full circle — and brings the\n\nnegligent    inspection        claims     within    the    purview        of     the\n\nmisrepresentation    exception.          See,   e.g.,   Schneider    v.    United\n\nStates, 936 F.2d 956, 961-62 (7th Cir. 1991) (holding that the\n\nmisrepresentation exception precludes a suit seeking recovery for\n\ndamages from a federal agency's approval of defective building\n\nmaterials); Baroni v. United States, 662 F.2d 287, 289 (5th Cir.\n\n1981) (per curiam) (holding to like effect in connection with the\n\nFHA's underestimation of the predicted flood line for a housing\n\ndevelopment); cf. Preston v. United States, 596 F.2d 232, 238 (7th\n\nCir. 1979) (holding that an FTCA claim alleging negligent auditing\n\n\"amounts to an allegation of misrepresentation by implication\").\n\n            We turn now to the second category of claims:                      those\n\nrelated to the government's role in supervising the construction of\n\nthe plaintiffs' homes.         Invoking the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nBlock v. Neal, 460 U.S. 289 (1983), the plaintiffs argue that the\n\nmisrepresentation exception does not apply and that the government\n\nmay be held liable in tort.          We agree with the first half of this\n\nargument but not with the second.\n\n            In Block, the Supreme Court ruled that although the\n\nmisrepresentation exception protects the federal government from\n\nliability   relating      to   the    negligent    communication     (or        non-\n\ncommunication) of information, \"it does not bar negligence actions\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fwhich focus . . . on the Government's breach of a different duty.\"\n\nId. at 297.   The Court further reasoned that if, as was alleged,\n\nthe FmHA undertook an active role in the construction of the\n\nplaintiff's home (thus going far beyond mere assurances regarding\n\nthe quality of the structure), it might be held to have assumed an\n\nadditional duty under the Good Samaritan doctrine.2         Id.    Such a\n\nduty would obligate the government \"to use due care to ensure that\n\nthe builder adhere to previously approved plans and cure all\n\ndefects before completing construction [which] is distinct from any\n\nduty to use due care in communicating information.\"        Id.    Applying\n\nBlock, we hold that this second category of claims lies outside the\n\nrealm of the misrepresentation exception.\n\n          This does not mean, however, that the case should have\n\nbeen allowed to proceed.    The government also invokes the FTCA's\n\ndiscretionary function exception.       On this issue, Block is wholly\n\ninapposite;   although     the   Block     Court   found     that     the\n\nmisrepresentation exception did not bar the claim there at issue,\n\nit noted explicitly that the question before it did not require\n\n\n\n     2\n      As a general matter, the Good Samaritan doctrine imposes a\nduty of due care upon one who gratuitously undertakes to perform a\nservice upon which a plaintiff justifiably relies. See Restatement\n(Second) of Torts §§ 323, 324A (1965). The doctrine is recognized\nboth in federal and Puerto Rico law.     See Indian Towing Co. v.\nUnited States, 350 U.S. 61, 69 (1955); Piñeiro Manzano v. Estado\nLibre Asociado, 102 P.R. Dec. 795, 801-02 (1974). Puerto Rico law\nis relevant on this issue because the FTCA requires a determination\nof negligence to be made \"in accordance with the law of the place\nwhere the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fconsideration of \"whether recovery is barred by any other provision\n\nof the Tort Claims Act, including the exception for . . . a\n\ndiscretionary function.\"    Id. at 294 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a)).\n\n          The discretionary function exception insulates the United\n\nStates against \"[a]ny claim . . . based upon the exercise or\n\nperformance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary\n\nfunction or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of\n\nthe Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).       Ascertaining whether the government may\n\ninvoke this exception involves a \"familiar analytic framework.\"\n\nShansky, 164 F.3d at 690.       First, an inquiring court must identify\n\nthe conduct that allegedly caused the harm.           Id. at 690-91.    Then,\n\nin determining whether Congress sought to shelter that sort of\n\nconduct from tort liability, the court must ask two interrelated\n\nquestions:   (1) Is the conduct itself discretionary?            (2) If so,\n\ndoes the exercise of discretion involve (or is it susceptible to)\n\npolicy-related    judgments?       If   both     of   these   queries   yield\n\naffirmative answers, the discretionary function exception applies\n\nand the government is shielded from liability.            See United States\n\nv. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 322-23 (1991); Berkovitz v. United\n\nStates, 486 U.S. 531, 536-37 (1988); Irving v. United States, 162\n\nF.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc); see also United States v.\n\nVarig Airlines,    467   U.S.    797,   809-10   (1984)   (\"It   is   neither\n\ndesirable nor intended that . . . the propriety of a discretionary\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fadministrative act should be tested through the medium of a damage\n\nsuit for tort.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The conduct that lies at the epicenter of the plaintiffs'\n\nremaining claims involves the government's failure carefully to\n\nsupervise    the   construction    of   the   housing     projects   and   its\n\nattendant    failure   to   protect     the   residents    from   the   easily\n\nforeseeable string of floods.         These allegations are best handled\n\ndiscretely, as identifying the precise conduct in question resolves\n\nmuch of the requisite analysis.\n\n            With respect to the duty to supervise construction, the\n\nplaintiffs target the government's role in planning the housing\n\ndevelopments, siting the homes in a floodway zone, and allowing\n\nthem to be built in such a way that they could not withstand the\n\nravages of repeated flooding.            The jurisprudence of the FTCA\n\npermits us to classify these actions as non-discretionary only if\n\na federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically instructed\n\nfederal officials to follow a specified course of action.                  See\n\nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536; Irving, 162\n\nF.3d at 163.    To fill this gap, the plaintiffs point to section 502\n\nof the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. § 1472 (2000), and the\n\nimplementing regulations that were in force when the Salinas\n\nhousing     developments    were   built.3       These    regulations,     the\n\n\n     3\n      On June 12, 1980, the regulations cited by plaintiffs were\namended to disclaim any possible government liability.       See\nPlanning and Performing Construction and Other Development\n\n                                   -12-\n\fplaintiffs    asseverate,     provided      sufficient     direction     that   the\n\nconduct in question cannot be deemed discretionary.                 We therefore\n\nexamine the regulations' content and purpose.\n\n           Section 502 of the Housing Act authorized (and still\n\nauthorizes)    the   Secretary      of    Agriculture     to    extend   financial\n\nassistance to qualified individuals \"to enable them to construct,\n\nimprove, alter, repair, or replace dwellings . . . in order to\n\nprovide   them   .   .   .   with   decent,       safe,   and   sanitary    living\n\nconditions.\"     Id. § 1471(a)(1).              The regulations in force when\n\nconstruction began in Salinas described the purpose of these loans\n\nas being \"to give families, who do not have sufficient resources .\n\n. . an opportunity to have adequate homes.\"               Neal v. Bergland, 646\n\nF.2d 1178, 1180 (6th Cir. 1981) (quoting 7 C.F.R. § 1822.2).                These\n\nprovisions operate at such a high level of generality that they are\n\nof little use to the plaintiffs here.             See Shansky, 164 F.3d at 691\n\n(explaining that general directives are insufficient to brand\n\nparticular conduct as non-discretionary).\n\n           The plaintiffs refer to additional provisions in the\n\nHousing Act and its implementing regulations that suggest that FmHA\n\nmust play a role that goes substantially beyond the mere provision\n\n\n\nAmendment-Redesignation, 45 Fed. Reg. 39,789, 39,803 (1980)\n(codified at 7 C.F.R. § 1924.9 (2002)). The revised rules, which\nare still in force, alert borrowers that they are solely\nresponsible for making the necessary inspections to ensure the\nquality of their homes. See 7 C.F.R. §§ 1924.9(a), 1924.9(b)(5)\n(2002).\n\n                                         -13-\n\fof financing for home construction.          For example, section 506 of\n\nthe Housing Act authorized (and still authorizes) the Secretary of\n\nAgriculture to provide \"technical services such as building plans,\n\nspecifications, construction supervision and inspection, and advice\n\nand information regarding farm dwellings and other buildings.\"               42\n\nU.S.C. § 1476(a). The earlier regulations suggested that providing\n\nadequate supervision was obligatory.           See 7 C.F.R. § 1822.7(a)\n\n(1977) (\"Supervision will be provided borrowers to the extent\n\nnecessary to achieve the objectives of the loan and to protect the\n\ninterests of the Government . . . .\"); see also Block, 460 U.S. at\n\n291   n.2   (describing   the   role    of   FmHA    officials   under     that\n\nregulatory regime in assisting borrowers to obtain construction and\n\ninspection services).\n\n            These   regulations   cannot     carry   the   weight   that    the\n\nplaintiffs load upon them.         Although they intimate that FmHA\n\nofficials are under an obligation to ensure that borrowers' homes\n\nmeet certain technical construction standards, they neither direct\n\nthe manner in which the supervision is to be carried out nor\n\nspecify the taking of the actions that the plaintiffs claim would\n\nhave prevented their plight.           The regulations do not speak to\n\nsupervising the planning of a housing development, selecting its\n\nlocation, or making the homes flood-proof at any cost.               Deeming\n\nadministrative action to be non-discretionary requires a specific\n\nand directly applicable prescription, see Fagot Rodriguez v. Costa\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fRica, 297 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002), and such a prescription is\n\nlacking here.        Because the plaintiffs point to no applicable\n\nstatute, regulation, or policy bearing the requisite degree of\n\nspecificity,    we    conclude     that   the   conduct    complained    of   was\n\ndiscretionary.       See Shansky, 164 F.3d at 691.\n\n          We next turn to the conduct at issue in the plaintiffs'\n\n\"failure to protect\" claim.          Here, the conduct complained of is\n\nnon-conduct, that is, inaction on the part of government officials,\n\nresulting in a failure to erect levees or pursue a comparable\n\npublic works agenda in Salinas.             The plaintiffs have offered no\n\nstatutory or regulatory provisions that provide explicit direction\n\nregarding such subjects, and the lack of such directives brands the\n\ninaction as discretionary.              Fagot Rodriguez, 297 F.3d at 10;\n\nShansky, 164 F.3d at 691.\n\n          The short of it is that the plaintiffs can point to no\n\nstatutory or regulatory provision that requires the performance of\n\nany of the charged non-communicative conduct.              Consequently, that\n\nconduct is within the purview of agency discretion.              See Gaubert,\n\n499 U.S. at 324-25 (\"For a complaint to survive a motion to\n\ndismiss, it must allege facts which would support a finding that\n\nthe challenged actions are not the kind of conduct that can be said\n\nto be grounded in the policy of a regulatory regime.\").\n\n          This       brings   us   to     the   final   question:       Is    this\n\ndiscretionary conduct grounded in policy?               There is a presumption\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthat it is.    See id. at 324; Irving, 162 F.3d at 168.          In this\n\ncase, nothing alleged by the plaintiffs regarding either the\n\nevolution of the housing projects or the lack of government action\n\nto protect residents from floods undermines that presumption.\n\n           The driving force behind these claims is the notion that\n\nthe federal government did not do enough — but such hypothesized\n\ninterventions, virtually by definition, involve examination of\n\npriorities and determinations of need that are at the heart of\n\npolicy-making.      In a world of finite public resources, government\n\nofficials must weigh competing considerations in the selection,\n\nlocation, and outfitting of housing projects. While such decisions\n\nare often difficult to make (and easy to criticize in hindsight),\n\nthey are clearly susceptible to policy analysis.       See Gaubert, 499\n\nU.S. at 325; Irving, 162 F.3d at 168.       For these reasons, courts\n\nhave acknowledged the central role of policy considerations in\n\nimplementing government loan programs and have held that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception shields the government from FTCA\n\nclaims in similar circumstances. See, e.g., Lundstrum v. Lyng, 954\n\nF.2d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (resting dismissal of\n\nFTCA   claim   on   the   discretionary   function   exception   because\n\ngovernment officials \"engage[d] in policy judgments when deciding\n\nthe most effective and efficient methods to supervise and service\n\nFMHA loan recipients\"); Pennbank v. United States, 779 F.2d 175,\n\n180 (3d Cir. 1985) (arriving at a similar result because \"the\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fprocesses and standards utilized by the agencies . . . clearly\n\ninvolve[d] the exercise of discretion\").\n\n          That ends this phase of our inquiry.          We find that the\n\nplaintiffs'   claims   against     the     government   for    negligently\n\nsupervising   the   planning     and     construction   of    the   housing\n\ndevelopments and failing to protect home buyers are barred by the\n\nFTCA's discretionary function exception.           The plaintiffs have\n\nsuffered great hardships, but an FTCA action is not the proper\n\nvehicle to demand accountability for arguably unwise or unthinking\n\ndecisions made pursuant to administrative discretion.\n\n          We need go no further. To recapitulate, we hold that the\n\nplaintiffs' claims that the government negligently failed to warn,\n\nto inform of impending danger, to mandate flood insurance, and to\n\ninspect the homes are all barred by the FTCA's misrepresentation\n\nexception. We hold that the plaintiffs' claims that the government\n\nfailed properly to supervise the planning and construction of the\n\nhousing projects and to take appropriate measures to prevent future\n\nflooding are barred by the FTCA's discretionary function exception.\n\nIn combination, these holdings confirm that the district court\n\nappropriately dismissed the plaintiffs' suit for want of federal\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.4\n\n\n     4\n      Because these holdings are dispositive of all the plaintiffs'\nclaims, we need not address other defenses raised by the United\nStates, such as the incidence of the statute of limitations, the\neffect of the change in the governing regulations as of June 12,\n1980 (see supra note 3), and the applicability vel non of the Good\n\n                                  -17-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\nSamaritan doctrine to the facts of this case.\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

The plaintiffs (appellants here) are 108 persons who own a total of 67 residential properties in Salinas, Puerto Rico. These homes are situated in two housing developments that have undergone repeated flooding. Noting that federal officials played a significant role in the planning, siting, construction, and financing of the projects, the plaintiffs seek to hold the government answerable in damages. They sue under the FTCA, a statutory scheme that carves out a tort-based exception to the federal government's sovereign immunity. But the FTCA's exception to sovereign immunity itself contains exceptions. Because the plaintiffs' claims, as stated, fall within spheres that the FTCA abjures, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford plenary review to a district court's order of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.,</i> 248 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.2001). At the pleading stage, such an order is appropriate only when the facts alleged in the complaint, taken as true, do not justify the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Royal v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc.,</i> 833 F.2d 1, 1 (1st Cir.1987). In line with the foregoing, we glean the relevant background information from the plaintiffs' amended complaint, accepting the well-pleaded factual averments contained therein and indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs' favor. <i>Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista,</i> 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs purchased their homes at various times between 1973 and 1995. All of them obtained loans through the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), or some other federal agency. They attribute their current predicament to the government's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their view, the principal difficulty is that the government sited the housing developments along the Nigua River basin. That area has endured flooding both before and after the developments were built. The amended complaint enumerates no fewer than eight major floods (occurring in 1928, 1933, 1956, 1970, 1975, 1985, 1992, and 1996). Progressive soil movement has placed unaccustomed strains on foundations, and most plaintiffs report structural damage to walls, roofs, and floors. Moreover, poor drainage results in a backflow of sewage whenever flooding occurs. Over time, these conditions have taken their toll: the plaintiffs say that their dwellings are now in \"total ruin\" and \"unfit\" for human habitation. They themselves have experienced mental anguish and emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed unsuccessful administrative claims with the appropriate agencies in 1998 and 2000 and, in the same time frame, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Their amended complaint alleges that the government has had an intimate involvement with the planning and construction of the housing developments. For example, federal agencies (1) approved the specifications under which the dwellings were built; (2) granted mortgage loans in which they reserved the right to inspect the properties and obligated the plaintiffs to execute any repairs that they requested; (3) compelled the sellers of the homes to issue builders' warranties; and (4) retained the right to insist upon certain types of insurance coverage. The amended complaint proceeds to list a litany of acts and omissions that form the basis for the government's putative liability. These include the government's supposed failures to (1) inspect the plaintiffs' properties with adequate care; (2) scrutinize the topography and detect the substantial likelihood of future flooding; (3) provide reasonable oversight during construction; (4) warn the plaintiffs that their homes were in a floodway zone; (5) require the plaintiffs to carry flood insurance (or advise them of the need for it); and (6) take appropriate measures to protect the houses from flooding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded to the plaintiffs' amended complaint with a motion to dismiss. The district court, in a scholarly opinion, granted the motion. <i>Mu&#241;iz-Rivera v. United States,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d 305 (D.P.R.2002). The plaintiffs now appeal that ruling. Although our reasoning differs slightly from the district court's, we affirm the order of dismissal. <i>See Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto,</i> 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that an appeals court is \"free to affirm the judgment below on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTCA constitutes \"a limited waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity\" against private suits. <i>Shansky v. United States,</i> 164 F.3d 688, 690 (1st Cir.1999). The narrowing adjective is necessary because there are a number of situations in which the waiver will not attach. The government contends that the plaintiffs' claims fall within the compass of these exceptions. If so, the instant action is outside the ambit of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Hydrogen Tech. Corp. v. United States,</i> 831 F.2d 1155, 1161 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that the FTCA's exceptions \"define the limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction in this area\"). We test the government's hypothesis by classifying the plaintiffs' claims and then evaluating each category of claims through the prism of the FTCA's exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first category of claims includes the plaintiffs' accusations that the government negligently failed to warn of the danger of future flooding, advise the plaintiffs of the need for flood insurance, and inform them that their homes were not constructed stoutly enough to withstand the ineluctable forces of nature. Despite the plaintiffs' disclaimers, these allegations necessarily rest on the premise that the federal government had a duty to exercise due care in communicating useful information regarding the safety and security of the plaintiffs' properties; that the plaintiffs reasonably relied on government officials to fulfill this duty; and that the government let them down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the government owed such a duty to the plaintiffs. Assuming, for argument's sake, that it did, any breach of the duty would fall squarely within the FTCA's misrepresentation exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The misrepresentation exception immunizes the United States from liability for \"[a]ny claim arising out of ... misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h). The exception extends to a wide range of communicative activity (including failures of communication). The leading case on this exception is <i>United States v. Neustadt,</i> 366 U.S. 696, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 6 L.Ed.2d 614 (1961), in which a home buyer reasonably relied on an erroneous FHA appraisal. <i>Id.</i> at 698-700, 81 S.Ct. 1294. In declaring that the plaintiff's claim for ensuing economic harm was barred by the misrepresentation exception, the Supreme Court observed that, in enacting section 2680(h), Congress \"clearly meant to exclude claims arising out of negligent, as well as deliberate, misrepresentation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702, 81 S.Ct. 1294. Thus, the exception insulates the government against liability for conveying false or inaccurate information. <i>Id.</i> at 706-07, 81 S.Ct. 1294; <i>see also Jimenez-Nieves v. United States,</i> 682 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1982) (noting that misrepresentation, as an independent tort, is comprised of the dissemination of false information and the reliance by the plaintiff upon that information). The case law makes manifest that the prophylaxis of the misrepresentation exception extends to failures of communication. <i>See, e.g., JBP Acquisitions v. United States,</i> 224 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.2000); <i>Green v. United States,</i> 629 F.2d 581, 584 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiffs' first set of claims are grounded in just such a theory of liability. The plaintiffs contend that the government's intimate role in approving, financing, and monitoring the housing projects implicitly conveyed an assurance that the homes constituted secure domiciles, and that the lack of any warning calculated to alert the plaintiffs to the likelihood of future harm reinforced those implied assurances. Even if such acts and omissions were negligent &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; the misrepresentation exception precludes the assertion of a cause of action against the government based upon either miscommunication or non-communication of the information in question. <i>See JBP Acquisitions,</i> 224 F.3d at 1266 (holding that a \"failure to communicate, as well as direct miscommunication, is encompassed by the misrepresentation exception\"); <i>Green,</i> 629 F.2d at 584 (noting that the misrepresentation exception \"bar[s] suits based on a failure to give any warning to injured parties\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also accuse the government of negligently inspecting their homes and failing to detect the likely problems associated with future flooding. These claims are likewise precluded by the misrepresentation exception. A negligent inspection, in and of itself, cannot cause injury. Harm can occur (and, thus, liability can attach) only if the inspection leads either to the communication of inaccurate information or to a failure to communicate precautionary information. <i>See Farmers State Sav. Bank v. FmHA,</i> 891 F.2d 200, 202 (8th Cir.1989) (holding that injuries to FTCA plaintiffs who allege faulty inspection or assessment are \"caused by reliance on the representations of government officials and not by reliance on an undertaking that those officials performed negligently\"); <i>see also Comm'l Union Ins. Co. v. United States,</i> 928 F.2d 176, 179 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that the misrepresentation exception covers instances in which \"the chain of causation from the alleged negligence to the alleged injury depends upon the transmission of misinformation by a government agent\"). This takes us full circle &#8212; and brings the negligent inspection claims within the purview of the misrepresentation exception. <i>See, e.g., Schneider v. United States,</i> 936 F.2d 956, 961-62 (7th Cir.1991) (holding that the misrepresentation exception precludes a suit seeking recovery for damages from a federal agency's approval of defective building materials); <i>Baroni v. United States,</i> 662 F.2d 287, 289 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam) (holding to like effect in connection with the FHA's underestimation of the predicted flood line for a housing development); <i>cf. Preston v. United States,</i> 596 F.2d 232, 238 (7th Cir.1979) (holding that an FTCA claim alleging negligent auditing \"amounts to an allegation of misrepresentation by implication\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the second category of claims: those related to the government's role in supervising the construction of the plaintiffs' homes. Invoking the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Block v. Neal,</i> 460 U.S. 289, 103 S.Ct. 1089, 75 L.Ed.2d 67 (1983), the plaintiffs argue that the misrepresentation exception does not apply and that the government may be held liable in tort. We agree with the first half of this argument but not with the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Block,</i> the Supreme Court ruled that although the misrepresentation exception protects the federal government from liability relating to the negligent communication (or non-communication) of information, \"it does not bar negligence actions which focus ... on the Government's breach of a different duty.\" <i>Id.</i> at 297, 103 S.Ct. 1089. The Court further reasoned that if, as was alleged, the FmHA undertook an active role in the construction of the plaintiff's home (thus going far beyond mere assurances regarding the quality of the structure), it might be held to have assumed an additional duty under the Good Samaritan doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> Such a duty would obligate the government \"to use due care to ensure that the builder adhere to previously approved plans and cure all defects before completing construction [which] is distinct from any duty to use due care in communicating information.\" <i>Id.</i> Applying <i>Block,</i> we hold that this second category of claims lies outside the realm of the misrepresentation exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, however, that the case should have been allowed to proceed. The government also invokes the FTCA's discretionary function exception. On this issue, <i>Block</i> is wholly inapposite; although the <i>Block</i> Court found that the misrepresentation exception did not bar the claim there at issue, it noted explicitly that the question before it did not require consideration of \"whether recovery is barred by any other provision of the Tort Claims Act, including the exception for ... a discretionary function.\" <i>Id.</i> at 294, 103 S.Ct. 1089 (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discretionary function exception insulates the United States against \"[a]ny claim ... based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a). Ascertaining whether the government may invoke this exception involves a \"familiar analytic framework.\" <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 690. First, an inquiring court must identify the conduct that allegedly caused the harm. <i>Id.</i> at 690-91. Then, in determining whether Congress sought to shelter that sort of conduct from tort liability, the court must ask two interrelated questions: (1) Is the conduct itself discretionary? (2) If so, does the exercise of discretion involve (or is it susceptible to) policy-related judgments? If both of these queries yield affirmative answers, the discretionary function exception applies and the government is shielded from liability. <i>See United States v. Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. 315, 322-23, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991); <i>Berkovitz v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 531, 536-37, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988); <i>Irving v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc); <i>see also United States v. Varig Airlines,</i> 467 U.S. 797, 809-10, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984) (\"It is neither desirable nor intended that ... the propriety of a discretionary administrative act should be tested through the medium of a damage suit for tort.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conduct that lies at the epicenter of the plaintiffs' remaining claims involves the government's failure carefully to supervise the construction of the housing projects and its attendant failure to protect the residents from the easily foreseeable string of floods. These allegations are best handled discretely, as identifying the precise conduct in question resolves much of the requisite analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the duty to supervise construction, the plaintiffs target the government's role in planning the housing developments, siting the homes in a floodway zone, and allowing them to be built in such a way that they could not withstand the ravages of repeated flooding. The jurisprudence of the FTCA permits us to classify these actions as non-discretionary only if a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically instructed federal officials to follow a specified course of action. <i>See Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 322, 111 S.Ct. 1267; <i>Berkovitz,</i> 486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 163. To fill this gap, the plaintiffs point to section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1472 (2000), and the implementing regulations that were in force when the Salinas housing developments were built.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> These regulations, the plaintiffs asseverate, provided sufficient direction that the conduct in question cannot be deemed discretionary. We therefore examine the regulations' content and purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 502 of the Housing Act authorized (and still authorizes) the Secretary of Agriculture to extend financial assistance to qualified individuals \"to enable them to construct, improve, alter, repair, or replace dwellings ... in order to provide them ... with decent, safe, and sanitary living conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1471(a)(1). The regulations in force when construction began in Salinas described the purpose of these loans as being \"to give families, who do not have sufficient resources ... an opportunity to have adequate homes.\" <i>Neal v. Bergland,</i> 646 F.2d 1178, 1180 (6th Cir. 1981) (quoting 7 C.F.R. &#167; 1822.2). These provisions operate at such a high level of generality that they are of little use to the plaintiffs here. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691 (explaining that general directives are insufficient to brand particular conduct as non-discretionary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs refer to additional provisions in the Housing Act and its implementing regulations that suggest that FmHA must play a role that goes substantially beyond the mere provision of financing for home construction. For example, section 506 of the Housing Act authorized (and still authorizes) the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \"technical services such as building plans, specifications, construction supervision and inspection, and advice and information regarding farm dwellings and other buildings.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1476(a). The earlier regulations suggested that providing adequate supervision was obligatory. <i>See</i> 7 C.F.R. &#167; 1822.7(a) (1977) (\"Supervision will be provided borrowers to the extent necessary to achieve the objectives of the loan and to protect the interests of the Government ....\"); <i>see also Block,</i> 460 U.S. at 291 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 1089 (describing the role of FmHA officials under that regulatory regime in assisting borrowers to obtain construction and inspection services).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These regulations cannot carry the weight that the plaintiffs load upon them. Although they intimate that FmHA officials are under an obligation to ensure that borrowers' homes meet certain technical construction standards, they neither direct the manner in which the supervision is to be carried out nor specify the taking of the actions that the plaintiffs claim would have prevented their plight. The regulations do not speak to supervising the planning of a housing development, selecting its location, or making the homes flood-proof at any cost. Deeming administrative action to be non-discretionary requires a specific and directly applicable prescription, <i>see Fagot Rodriguez v. Costa Rica,</i> 297 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2002), and such a prescription is lacking here. Because the plaintiffs point to no applicable statute, regulation, or policy bearing the requisite degree of specificity, we conclude that the conduct complained of was discretionary. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the conduct at issue in the plaintiffs' \"failure to protect\" claim. Here, the conduct complained of is non-conduct, that is, inaction on the part of government officials, resulting in a failure to erect levees or pursue a comparable public works agenda in Salinas. The plaintiffs have offered no statutory or regulatory provisions that provide explicit direction regarding such subjects, and the lack of such directives brands the inaction as discretionary. <i>Fagot Rodriguez,</i> 297 F.3d at 10; <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the plaintiffs can point to no statutory or regulatory provision that requires the performance of any of the charged non-communicative conduct. Consequently, that conduct is within the purview of agency discretion. <i>See Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 324-25, 111 S.Ct. 1267 (\"For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, it must allege facts which would support a finding that the challenged actions are not the kind of conduct that can be said to be grounded in the policy of a regulatory regime.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the final question: Is this discretionary conduct grounded in policy? There is a presumption that it is. <i>See id.</i> at 324, 111 S.Ct. 1267; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 168. In this case, nothing alleged by the plaintiffs regarding either the evolution of the housing projects or the lack of government action to protect residents from floods undermines that presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The driving force behind these claims is the notion that the federal government did not do enough &#8212; but such hypothesized interventions, virtually by definition, involve examination of priorities and determinations of need that are at the heart of policy-making. In a world of finite public resources, government officials must weigh competing considerations in the selection, location, and outfitting of housing projects. While such decisions are often difficult to make (and easy to criticize in hindsight), they are clearly susceptible to policy analysis. <i>See Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 168. For these reasons, courts have acknowledged the central role of policy considerations in implementing government loan programs and have held that the discretionary function exception shields the government from FTCA claims in similar circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Lundstrum v. Lyng,</i> 954 F.2d 1142, 1146 (6th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (resting dismissal of FTCA claim on the discretionary function exception because government officials \"engage[d] in policy judgments when deciding the most effective and efficient methods to supervise and service FMHA loan recipients\"); <i>Pennbank v. United States,</i> 779 F.2d 175, 180 (3d Cir.1985) (arriving at a similar result because \"the processes and standards utilized by the agencies ... clearly involve[d] the exercise of discretion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of our inquiry. We find that the plaintiffs' claims against the government for negligently supervising the planning and construction of the housing developments and failing to protect home buyers are barred by the FTCA's discretionary function exception. The plaintiffs have suffered great hardships, but an FTCA action is not the proper vehicle to demand accountability for arguably unwise or unthinking decisions made pursuant to administrative discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we hold that the plaintiffs' claims that the government negligently failed to warn, to inform of impending danger, to mandate flood insurance, and to inspect the homes are all barred by the FTCA's misrepresentation exception. We hold that the plaintiffs' claims that the government failed properly to supervise the planning and construction of the housing projects and to take appropriate measures to prevent future flooding are barred by the FTCA's discretionary function exception. In combination, these holdings confirm that the district court appropriately dismissed the plaintiffs' suit for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Originally, the plaintiffs asserted claims premised not only on the FTCA but also on the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(a)(2), and Puerto Rico law.

The plaintiffs (appellants here) are 108 persons who own a total of 67 residential properties in Salinas, Puerto Rico. These homes are situated in two housing developments that have undergone repeated flooding. Noting that federal officials played a significant role in the planning, siting, construction, and financing of the projects, the plaintiffs seek to hold the government answerable in damages. They sue under the FTCA, a statutory scheme that carves out a tort-based exception to the federal government's sovereign immunity. But the FTCA's exception to sovereign immunity itself contains exceptions. Because the plaintiffs' claims, as stated, fall within spheres that the FTCA abjures, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See</i> Fed.

That area has endured flooding both before and after the developments were built. The amended complaint enumerates no fewer than eight major floods (occurring in 1928, 1933, 1956, 1970, 1975, 1985, 1992, and 1996). Progressive soil movement has placed unaccustomed strains on foundations, and most plaintiffs report structural damage to walls, roofs, and floors. Moreover, poor drainage results in a backflow of sewage whenever flooding occurs. Over time, these conditions have taken their toll: the plaintiffs say that their dwellings are now in \"total ruin\" and \"unfit\" for human habitation. They themselves have experienced mental anguish and emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs filed unsuccessful administrative claims with the appropriate agencies in 1998 and 2000 and, in the same time frame, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Their amended complaint alleges that the government has had an intimate involvement with the planning and construction of the housing developments. For example, federal agencies (1) approved the specifications under which the dwellings were built; (2) granted mortgage loans in which they reserved the right to inspect the properties and obligated the plaintiffs to execute any repairs that they requested; (3) compelled the sellers of the homes to issue builders' warranties; and (4) retained the right to insist upon certain types of insurance coverage. The amended complaint proceeds to list a litany of acts and omissions that form the basis for the government's putative liability. These include the government's supposed failures to (1) inspect the plaintiffs' properties with adequate care; (2) scrutinize the topography and detect the substantial likelihood of future flooding; (3) provide reasonable oversight during construction; (4) warn the plaintiffs that their homes were in a floodway zone; (5) require the plaintiffs to carry flood insurance (or advise them of the need for it); and (6) take appropriate measures to protect the houses from flooding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded to the plaintiffs' amended complaint with a motion to dismiss.

The narrowing adjective is necessary because there are a number of situations in which the waiver will not attach. The government contends that the plaintiffs' claims fall within the compass of these exceptions. If so, the instant action is outside the ambit of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Hydrogen Tech. Corp. v.

Despite the plaintiffs' disclaimers, these allegations necessarily rest on the premise that the federal government had a duty to exercise due care in communicating useful information regarding the safety and security of the plaintiffs' properties; that the plaintiffs reasonably relied on government officials to fulfill this duty; and that the government let them down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the government owed such a duty to the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs contend that the government's intimate role in approving, financing, and monitoring the housing projects implicitly conveyed an assurance that the homes constituted secure domiciles, and that the lack of any warning calculated to alert the plaintiffs to the likelihood of future harm reinforced those implied assurances. Even if such acts and omissions were negligent &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; the misrepresentation exception precludes the assertion of a cause of action against the government based upon either miscommunication or non-communication of the information in question. <i>See JBP Acquisitions,</i> 224 F.3d at 1266 (holding that a \"failure to communicate, as well as direct miscommunication, is encompassed by the misrepresentation exception\"); <i>Green,</i> 629 F.2d at 584 (noting that the misrepresentation exception \"bar[s] suits based on a failure to give any warning to injured parties\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also accuse the government of negligently inspecting their homes and failing to detect the likely problems associated with future flooding. These claims are likewise precluded by the misrepresentation exception. A negligent inspection, in and of itself, cannot cause injury. Harm can occur (and, thus, liability can attach) only if the inspection leads either to the communication of inaccurate information or to a failure to communicate precautionary information. <i>See Farmers State Sav.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>. The Court further reasoned that if, as was alleged, the FmHA undertook an active role in the construction of the plaintiff's home (thus going far beyond mere assurances regarding the quality of the structure), it might be held to have assumed an additional duty under the Good Samaritan doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> Such a duty would obligate the government \"to use due care to ensure that the builder adhere to previously approved plans and cure all defects before completing construction [which] is distinct from any duty to use due care in communicating information.\" <i>Id.</i> Applying <i>Block,</i> we hold that this second category of claims lies outside the realm of the misrepresentation exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, however, that the case should have been allowed to proceed. The government also invokes the FTCA's discretionary function exception. On this issue, <i>Block</i> is wholly inapposite; although the <i>Block</i> Court found that the misrepresentation exception did not bar the claim there at issue, it noted explicitly that the question before it did not require consideration of \"whether recovery is barred by any other provision of the Tort Claims Act, including the exception for ... a discretionary function.\" <i>Id.</i> at 294, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110883\"><a href=\"/opinion/110883/block-v-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ascertaining whether the government may invoke this exception involves a \"familiar analytic framework.\" <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 690. First, an inquiring court must identify the conduct that allegedly caused the harm. <i>Id.</i> at 690-91. Then, in determining whether Congress sought to shelter that sort of conduct from tort liability, the court must ask two interrelated questions: (1) Is the conduct itself discretionary? (2) If so, does the exercise of discretion involve (or is it susceptible to) policy-related judgments? If both of these queries yield affirmative answers, the discretionary function exception applies and the government is shielded from liability. <i>See United States v.

The jurisprudence of the FTCA permits us to classify these actions as non-discretionary only if a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically instructed federal officials to follow a specified course of action. <i>See Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 322, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1954</span></a></span>; <i>Irving,</i> 162 F.3d at 163. To fill this gap, the plaintiffs point to section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1472 (2000), and the implementing regulations that were in force when the Salinas housing developments were built.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> These regulations, the plaintiffs asseverate, provided sufficient direction that the conduct in question cannot be deemed discretionary.

The regulations in force when construction began in Salinas described the purpose of these loans as being \"to give families, who do not have sufficient resources ... an opportunity to have adequate homes.\" <i>Neal v. Bergland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389536\"><a href=\"/opinion/389536/onilea-neal-v-robert-bergland/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1178</span></a></span>, 1180 (6th Cir. 1981) (quoting 7 C.F.R. &#167; 1822.2). These provisions operate at such a high level of generality that they are of little use to the plaintiffs here. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691 (explaining that general directives are insufficient to brand particular conduct as non-discretionary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs refer to additional provisions in the Housing Act and its implementing regulations that suggest that FmHA must play a role that goes substantially beyond the mere provision of financing for home construction. For example, section 506 of the Housing Act authorized (and still authorizes) the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \"technical services such as building plans, specifications, construction supervision and inspection, and advice and information regarding farm dwellings and other buildings.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1476(a). The earlier regulations suggested that providing adequate supervision was obligatory. <i>See</i> 7 C.F.R. &#167; 1822.7(a) (1977) (\"Supervision will be provided borrowers to the extent necessary to achieve the objectives of the loan and to protect the interests of the Government ....\"); <i>see also Block,</i> 460 U.S. at 291 n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110883\"><a href=\"/opinion/110883/block-v-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although they intimate that FmHA officials are under an obligation to ensure that borrowers' homes meet certain technical construction standards, they neither direct the manner in which the supervision is to be carried out nor specify the taking of the actions that the plaintiffs claim would have prevented their plight. The regulations do not speak to supervising the planning of a housing development, selecting its location, or making the homes flood-proof at any cost. Deeming administrative action to be non-discretionary requires a specific and directly applicable prescription, <i>see Fagot Rodriguez v. Costa Rica,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2002), and such a prescription is lacking here. Because the plaintiffs point to no applicable statute, regulation, or policy bearing the requisite degree of specificity, we conclude that the conduct complained of was discretionary. <i>See Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the conduct at issue in the plaintiffs' \"failure to protect\" claim. Here, the conduct complained of is non-conduct, that is, inaction on the part of government officials, resulting in a failure to erect levees or pursue a comparable public works agenda in Salinas. The plaintiffs have offered no statutory or regulatory provisions that provide explicit direction regarding such subjects, and the lack of such directives brands the inaction as discretionary. <i>Fagot Rodriguez,</i> 297 F.3d at 10; <i>Shansky,</i> 164 F.3d at 691.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the plaintiffs can point to no statutory or regulatory provision that requires the performance of any of the charged non-communicative conduct. Consequently, that conduct is within the purview of agency discretion. <i>See Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 324-25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span> (\"For a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, it must allege facts which would support a finding that the challenged actions are not the kind of conduct that can be said to be grounded in the policy of a regulatory regime.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the final question: Is this discretionary conduct grounded in policy? There is a presumption that it is. <i>See id.</i> at 324, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this case, nothing alleged by the plaintiffs regarding either the evolution of the housing projects or the lack of government action to protect residents from floods undermines that presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The driving force behind these claims is the notion that the federal government did not do enough &#8212; but such hypothesized interventions, virtually by definition, involve examination of priorities and determinations of need that are at the heart of policy-making. In a world of finite public resources, government officials must weigh competing considerations in the selection, location, and outfitting of housing projects. While such decisions are often difficult to make (and easy to criticize in hindsight), they are clearly susceptible to policy analysis. <i>See Gaubert,</i> 499 U.S. at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For these reasons, courts have acknowledged the central role of policy considerations in implementing government loan programs and have held that the discretionary function exception shields the government from FTCA claims in similar circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Lundstrum v. Lyng,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576677\"><a href=\"/opinion/576677/bankr-l-rep-p-74425-douglas-d-lundstrum-v-richard-lyng-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span>, 1146 (6th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (resting dismissal of FTCA claim on the discretionary function exception because government officials \"engage[d] in policy judgments when deciding the most effective and efficient methods to supervise and service FMHA loan recipients\"); <i>Pennbank v.

We find that the plaintiffs' claims against the government for negligently supervising the planning and construction of the housing developments and failing to protect home buyers are barred by the FTCA's discretionary function exception. The plaintiffs have suffered great hardships, but an FTCA action is not the proper vehicle to demand accountability for arguably unwise or unthinking decisions made pursuant to administrative discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

We hold that the plaintiffs' claims that the government failed properly to supervise the planning and construction of the housing projects and to take appropriate measures to prevent future flooding are barred by the FTCA's discretionary function exception.

The revised rules, which are still in force, alert borrowers that they are solely responsible for making the necessary inspections to ensure the quality of their homes. <i>See</i> 7 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1924.9(a), 1924.9(b)(5) (2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because these holdings are dispositive of all the plaintiffs' claims, we need not address other defenses raised by the United States, such as the incidence of the statute of limitations, the effect of the change in the governing regulations as of June 12, 1980 (<i>see supra</i> note 3), and the applicability vel non of the Good Samaritan doctrine to the facts of this case.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
