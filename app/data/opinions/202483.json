This appeal requires us to explore\n\nan arcane corner of the world of corporate finance.         In the\n\nunderlying series of events, a corporate shark, using fraudulent\n\nmeans, induced an allegedly innocent target corporation to enter\n\ninto an ill-advised merger.    After both the shark and the merged\n\nentity drowned in red ink, plaintiff-appellant Alan Nisselson (the\n\ntrustee), appointed by the bankruptcy court to prosecute any causes\n\nof action that the merged entity might possess, attempted to mount\n\nvarious claims arising out of the innocent target's legal rights.\n\nThose rights, of course, were twice removed from the damages that\n\nformed the basis of the suit: they were passed along once to the\n\nsurviving corporation (at the time of the merger) and again to the\n\ntrustee (during the bankruptcy proceedings).\n\n          Emphasizing this genealogy, the district court dismissed\n\nthe action on two grounds; it determined that the trustee lacked\n\nstanding to pursue the claims and that, in all events, the rascality\n\nof the shark was as a matter of law imputed to the surviving entity\n\nin the merger (and that, therefore, the hoary in pari delicto\n\ndoctrine barred the suit).    See Nisselson v. Lernout, No. 03-10843,\n\n2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *20-21 (D. Mass. Aug. 9, 2004).\n\nConcluding, as we do, that the second of these determinations\n\nwithstands scrutiny — the trustee's claims are incurably tainted\n\nbecause they derive from the itself-complicit surviving corporation\n\n— we affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We glean the pertinent facts from the amended complaint,\n\nsupplementing those facts as needed by documents fairly incorporated\n\ntherein and matters susceptible to judicial notice.                     See Centro\n\nMedico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2005); In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15-16\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).        While the scheme that lies at the center of this\n\ncase comprises a complex tale of sophisticated financial chicanery,\n\nwe rehearse here only those features essential to an understanding\n\nof the present proceeding.            We urge the reader who thirsts for\n\ngreater   knowledge      to    consult   the     array   of   published   opinions\n\nemanating from related litigation. See, e.g., Baena v. KPMG LLP, 453\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2006); Quaak v. Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler\n\nBedrijfsrevisoren, 361 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2004); Bamberg v. SG Cowen,\n\n236 F. Supp. 2d 79 (D. Mass. 2002); Filler v. Lernout, 230 F. Supp.\n\n2d 152 (D. Mass. 2002); In re Lernout & Hauspie Sec. Litig., 208 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 74 (D. Mass. 2002).\n\n           By     the   time    the   new      millennium     dawned,   Dictaphone\n\nCorporation (Old Dictaphone), a company chartered under the laws of\n\nDelaware, had established itself as a force in the healthcare speech\n\nand language applications market.              Lernout & Hauspie, N.V. (L&H), a\n\nBelgian corporation that ran its United States operations from\n\nheadquarters in Massachusetts, was itself an international leader in\n\nvarious speech and language sectors.             In hopes of swallowing up its\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fcompetitor, L&H began courting Old Dictaphone; it described in\n\nglowing terms its financial stability and the profitable synergies\n\nthat a merger could generate.       Negotiations ensued.\n\n            Not surprisingly, Old Dictaphone conducted extensive due\n\ndiligence investigations into L&H's fiscal health. During the course\n\nof that review, L&H's senior officers, investment bankers, attorneys,\n\nand auditors touted its financial prowess. Against this rose-colored\n\nbackdrop, Old Dictaphone agreed to a stock-for-stock merger.                    The\n\nparties memorialized the terms in a merger agreement dated March 7,\n\n2000.\n\n            The merger took place less than two months thereafter: L&H\n\nacquired all the outstanding stock of Old Dictaphone in exchange for\n\napproximately 9,400,000 shares of L&H common stock.                  Based on the\n\ntrading price of L&H stock at the time of the closing, the exchange\n\ncorresponded to a merger price of roughly $930,000,000.\n\n            As part and parcel of the transaction, Old Dictaphone\n\nmerged into Dark Acquisition Corp. (Dark), a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\nof   L&H   created   under   Delaware    law   for   the   express    purpose   of\n\neffectuating the merger.       L&H's chief executive officer, defendant-\n\nappellee Gaston Bastiaens, doubled in brass as Dark's chief executive\n\nand lone director.       He also signed the merger agreement on its\n\nbehalf.\n\n            Under the terms of the merger agreement, Dark inherited Old\n\nDictaphone's assets (including any existing legal claims) and assumed\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fOld Dictaphone's liabilities.        This arrangement corresponded to the\n\ndictates of Delaware law.      See Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 259(a).        Dark\n\nsurvived the merger and Old Dictaphone ceased to exist.               Dark then\n\nchanged its name to Dictaphone Corporation (New Dictaphone).\n\n          The honeymoon was brief. Shortly after the merger had been\n\nconsummated, L&H announced that the financial picture it had painted\n\nand displayed was not an accurate portrayal.         As matters turned out,\n\nnearly two-thirds of L&H's reported revenue from 1998 through mid-\n\n2000 had been improperly recorded, so that an apparent $70,000,000\n\nnet profit for that period was in fact a net loss of a similar\n\nmagnitude.     The price of L&H shares plummeted and, on November 29,\n\n2000, L&H and New Dictaphone filed voluntary petitions for relief\n\nunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n          We    fast-forward    to   New    Dictaphone's   approved    plan   of\n\nreorganization.    As part of that plan, the corporation conveyed its\n\ninterest in any claims arising out of the merger to the Dictaphone\n\nLitigation Trust (the Trust).        That assignment galvanized this suit:\n\nacting on behalf of the Trust, the trustee filed a civil action in\n\nfederal district court seeking damages to compensate for the \"loss\n\nor diminution of [Old Dictaphone's] value as a going concern.\"\n\n          The trustee's amended complaint characterizes the gross\n\nmisstatments of earnings as the mainspring of a fraudulent scheme\n\ndesigned to inflate the value of L&H's stock.                As the trustee\n\nenvisions it, this scheme, which played out over a four-year period,\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fwas concocted and executed by the defendants in this case (who\n\ninclude the officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, and\n\nauditors of L&H, and divers entities related to them).           The fallout\n\nfrom it rendered worthless the consideration that Old Dictaphone and\n\nits shareholders received (assumption of Old Dictaphone's debt and\n\nshares of L&H stock).\n\n            In his amended complaint, the trustee asserts federal\n\nsecurities and racketeering claims, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78t(a);\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, as well as supplemental\n\nstate-law   claims   for   fraud,   unfair   trade   practices,    negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, and conspiracy.         The theory underlying each and\n\nall of these initiatives is that L&H, through its senior management,\n\nknowingly engaged in a scheme to classify research and development\n\nexpenditures as fictional revenue in order to inflate the value of\n\nthe company's stock.       Then, knowing that they were selling a lie,\n\nL&H's hierarchs flaunted the company's ever-increasing stock price\n\nand used its apocryphal earnings to persuade Old Dictaphone and its\n\nshareholders to enter into a stock-for-stock merger.            L&H relied on\n\nits investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and related entities\n\nto   substantiate    its   false   claims;   those   parties,    the   trustee\n\ncontends, knew that L&H was spinning a yarn, yet assisted it in\n\nperpetrating the fraud.1\n\n\n      1\n      This suit comprised one of many filed in the wake of L&H's\nrevenue restatement.    In one such related action, Stonington\nPartners, Inc., which had owned ninety-six percent of Old\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            Various defendants, led by SG Cowen (an investment banking\n\nhouse), filed motions to dismiss.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).      All\n\nof these motions argued, in relevant part, that the trustee lacked\n\nstanding and that his claims were barred under the in pari delicto\n\ndoctrine.     Some of the motions advanced additional grounds for\n\ndismissing particular claims.       The trustee vigorously opposed the\n\nmotions.\n\n            In due course, the district court granted Cowen's motion\n\nand   dismissed   the   trustee's   federal   claims   against   Cowen   with\n\nprejudice.    See Nisselson, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *20-21.\n\nThe court rested its decision on two alternative grounds.         First, it\n\nconcluded that the in pari delicto doctrine barred the claims because\n\nthe trustee had inherited them from New Dictaphone, an entity itself\n\nimplicated in the alleged fraud.           See id. at *12-15.       Second,\n\ninterpreting and applying the Delaware standard for distinguishing\n\ndirect and derivative claims, it concluded that the trustee lacked\n\nstanding because the claims asserted belonged to Old Dictaphone's\n\nformer shareholders, not to Old Dictaphone itself. See id. at *15-20\n\n(discussing, inter alia, Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette,\n\n\n\nDictaphone prior to the merger, sued for damages allegedly incurred\nwhen it traded its once-valuable interest for what ended up being\nworthless paper.\n     For his part, the trustee has brought separate actions for\nbreach of fiduciary duty against Old Dictaphone's former directors\nand controlling shareholders and for breach of contract and\nnegligence against the accountants and investment bankers who\ncounseled Old Dictaphone during the merger negotiations.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fInc., 845 A.2d 1031, 1033 (Del. 2004)).    For the same reasons, the\n\ncourt, in a series of subsequent orders, granted the other appellees'\n\nmotions to dismiss.2   This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We review Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal orders de novo, assuming\n\nthe truth of all well-pleaded facts contained in the operative\n\nversion of the complaint and indulging all reasonable inferences in\n\nthe plaintiff's favor.    See McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 262, 266\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).   Facts distilled in that fashion may be augmented\n\nby reference to (i) documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated\n\ninto it, and (ii) matters susceptible to judicial notice. See Centro\n\nMedico del Turabo, 406 F.3d at 5; Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,\n\n389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2004).     Where, as here, a district court\n\nrests its decision on alternative grounds, an appellate court need\n\nnot explore both; if it determines that one such ground fully\n\nsupports the order of dismissal, the court may end its deliberations\n\nat that point. See Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34,\n\n41 n.7 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n           This case presents an idiosyncratic procedural feature.\n\nWhile most Rule 12(b)(6) motions are premised on a plaintiff's\n\nputative failure to state an actionable claim, such a motion may\n\n\n\n      2\n      The lower court did not reach any of the additional arguments\nproffered by the defendants, nor do we.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fsometimes be premised on the inevitable success of an affirmative\n\ndefense.    See, e.g., In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers, 324 F.3d at 16;\n\nBlackstone Realty v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001); Keene\n\nLumber   Co.    v.   Leventhal,    165    F.2d    815,   820   (1st   Cir.   1948).\n\nDismissing a case under Rule 12(b)(6) on the basis of an affirmative\n\ndefense requires that \"(i) the facts establishing the defense are\n\ndefinitively ascertainable from the complaint and the other allowable\n\nsources of information, and (ii) those facts suffice to establish the\n\naffirmative defense with certitude.\"             Rodi, 389 F.3d at 12.\n\n                                  A.   Standing.\n\n            The district court characterized both the in pari delicto\n\ndoctrine and the absence of cognizable injury as evincing a lack of\n\nstanding.      See Nisselson, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *12-13.\n\nPart of this characterization is inapt: the in pari delicto doctrine\n\ndoes not implicate a plaintiff's standing to sue                      but, rather,\n\nconstitutes an affirmative defense.             See Official Comm. of Unsecured\n\nCreditors of PSA, Inc. v. Edwards, 437 F.3d 1145, 1149-50 (11th Cir.\n\n2006); Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Color Tile, Inc. v.\n\nCoopers & Lybrand, LLP, 322 F.3d 147, 157 (2d Cir. 2003); see also\n\nBaena, 453 F.3d at 6 (noting that the doctrine is, on occasion,\n\n\"dubiously\" referred to as implicating standing).\n\n            This does not mean, however, that we must grapple with the\n\ndistrict court's alternative \"distinct injury\" holding first.                  Even\n\nthough challenges to a plaintiff's standing are often considered\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fthreshold issues in federal cases, see, e.g., Pagán v. Calderón, 448\n\nF.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006); Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d\n\n344, 351 (1st Cir. 2004), such challenges must be addressed first\n\nonly if they call into question a federal court's Article III power\n\nto hear the case.      See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523\n\nU.S. 83, 94-95 (1998).     The constitutional prerequisites for Article\n\nIII standing are satisfied so long as a plaintiff colorably alleges\n\nan actual injury that is both traceable to the defendant's conduct\n\nand redressable by a favorable decision.         See Lujan v. Defenders of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-62 (1992); Ramírez v. Sánchez Ramos, 438\n\nF.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          In this case, those prerequisites have been fulfilled. For\n\npurposes of their motions to dismiss, the defendants wisely choose\n\nnot to contest the trustee's assertion that the conduct attributed\n\nto them resulted in a redressable injury; instead, they posit that\n\nthe trustee is seeking to prosecute claims that, although cognizable\n\nin a federal court, belong exclusively to Old Dictaphone's former\n\nshareholders.     The determination of who may maintain an otherwise\n\ncognizable claim turns on a question of prudential standing, not one\n\nof Article III standing.     See Baena, 453 F.3d at 5; see also Ramírez,\n\n438 F.3d at 98.\n\n          That frees our hands: Steel Co.'s ban on hypothetical\n\njurisdiction    extends     only   to   issues    involving   Article      III\n\njurisdiction    and,    hence,   Article   III   standing.    There   is    no\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcounterpart rule that demands the resolution of objections based on\n\nprudential concerns before other issues can be adjudicated.              See\n\nBaena, 453 F.3d at 5; McBee v. Delica Co., 417 F.3d 107, 127 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n          Mandatory rules aside, courts should not rush to rely on\n\nhypothetical jurisdiction.      See Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).     Nevertheless, one situation in which hypothetical\n\njurisdiction, if otherwise proper, may be invoked is when doing so\n\nwould avoid the need to sort out thorny jurisdictional tangles. See,\n\ne.g., McBee, 417 F.3d at 127; Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees'\n\nRet. Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1999).        As we explain briefly,\n\njust such a tangle exists here.\n\n          Although the decision in Tooley may have helped to clarify\n\nthe often elusive distinction between direct and derivative claims,\n\nthat   distinction    remains   tenebrous.       See   Richard    Montgomery\n\nDonaldson, Mapping       Delaware's Elusive Divide: Clarification and\n\nFurther Movement Toward a Merits-Based Analysis for Distinguishing\n\nDerivative and Direct Claims in Agostino v. Hick and Tooley v.\n\nDonaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., 30 Del. J. Corp. L. 389, 404\n\n(2005) (listing the \"determination of who suffered the harm — the\n\ncorporation   or   the    shareholder(s)\"   as   one   of   the   potentially\n\nconfusing issues left open under Tooley).        More to the point, it is\n\nnot immediately apparent how the Delaware court's newly announced\n\ntwo-part test, 845 A.2d at 1033, should apply to the unique facts of\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthis stock-for-stock merger. Because the record reflects a clear and\n\nsufficient basis apart from standing for affirming the district\n\ncourt's judgment, we bypass these uncharted waters.\n\n                      B.   The In Pari Delicto Doctrine.\n\n            In pari delicto is both an affirmative defense and an\n\nequitable     defense.        Broadly    speaking,   the   defense    prohibits\n\nplaintiffs     from    recovering    damages   resulting    from     their   own\n\nwrongdoing.    See Terlecky v. Hurd (In re Dublin Sec.), 133 F. 3d 377,\n\n380 (6th Cir. 1997).        The label derives from the Latin phrase in pari\n\ndelicto potior est conditio possidentis, which admonishes that \"[i]n\n\na case of equal or mutual fault . . . the condition of the [defending\n\nparty] is the better one.\"           Black's Law Dictionary 791 (6th ed.\n\n1990).\n\n            The doctrine is grounded on twin premises.             The first is\n\nthat \"courts should not lend their good offices to mediating disputes\n\namong wrongdoers.\"         Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner,\n\n472 U.S. 299, 306 (1985).           The second is that \"denying judicial\n\nrelief to an admitted wrongdoer is an effective means of deterring\n\nillegality.\"    Id.\n\n            The in pari delicto defense has long been woven into the\n\nfabric of federal law.         See id. at 307 (discussing the doctrine's\n\nhistorical development); see also Fleming v. Lind-Waldock & Co., 922\n\nF.2d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 1990); Duncan v. Me. Cent. R. Co., 113 F. 508,\n\n509 (C.C.D. Me. 1902).         It does not make a difference that some of\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fthe trustee's claims are premised on state law.   Those claims invoke\n\nthe law of Massachusetts — and the Massachusetts courts, like the\n\nfederal courts, have warmly embraced the in pari delicto defense.\n\nSee, e.g., Council v. Cohen, 21 N.E.2d 967, 970 (Mass. 1939);\n\nChoquette v. Isacoff, 836 N.E.2d 329, 332 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005).\n\n            As originally conceived, the in pari delicto doctrine\n\nforged a defense of limited utility.      Over time, however, courts\n\nexpanded the doctrine's sweep, deploying it as a basis for dismissing\n\nsuits whenever a plaintiff had played any role — no matter how modest\n\n— in the harm-producing activity.    See Bateman Eichler, 472 U.S. at\n\n307.   Deploring this overly commodious construction, the Supreme\n\nCourt later reined in the doctrine and returned it to its classic\n\ncontours.    See Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 635 (1988); Bateman\n\nEichler, 472 U.S. at 310-11.   This retrenchment, which governs here,\n\nrestricts the application of the in pari delicto doctrine to those\n\nsituations in which (i) the plaintiff, as compared to the defendant,\n\nbears at least substantially equal responsibility for the wrong he\n\nseeks to redress and (ii) preclusion of the suit would not interfere\n\nwith the purposes of the underlying law or otherwise contravene the\n\npublic interest.     See Bateman Eichler, 472 U.S. at 311 (discussing\n\nthe doctrine's application to federal securities laws); see also\n\nEdwards, 437 F.3d at 1154.     Recent Massachusetts case law mirrors\n\nthese refinements.    See, e.g., Choquette, 836 N.E.2d at 332-33.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f             While the application of this binary paradigm may vary\n\nslightly depending on the nature of the particular claim asserted,\n\ncourts nonetheless speak of a single doctrine.          This is because the\n\nanalysis ordinarily will be the same across a spectrum of different\n\ncauses of action.      See Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors v. R.F.\n\nLafferty & Co., 267 F.3d 340, 345-46 (3d Cir. 2001); see also Coopers\n\n& Lybrand, 322 F.3d at 160.\n\n             The court below adopted this one-size-fits-all approach in\n\naddressing the in pari delicto defense; it neither distinguished\n\namong the various counts nor differentiated between federal and state\n\nlaw.   The trustee has not objected to this approach, so he has waived\n\nany argument either that a claim-by-claim analysis is obligatory or\n\nthat some material differences exist between applicable federal and\n\nstate law.    See Domegan v. Fair, 859 F.2d 1059, 1065 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(\"It is too familiar to warrant string citation that we will not\n\nconsider arguments which could have been, but were not, advanced\n\nbelow.\").    Consequently, we employ the same generic strain of the in\n\npari delicto doctrine throughout our review.\n\n              C.    Establishing the Appropriate Benchmark.\n\n             To    apply   the   requisite   two-part      paradigm     in    the\n\ncircumstances of this case, we must answer a threshold question: Who,\n\nexactly, are the proper parties for the purpose of determining\n\nrelative     blame?        The   trustee's   answer   to    this      query    is\n\nstraightforward.      Because his claims originate with Old Dictaphone,\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fhe asseverates that this indisputably innocent party is the relevant\n\nentity for purposes of the comparison required by the binary in pari\n\ndelicto test.       Since Old Dictaphone was the victim rather than a\n\nperpetrator of the alleged fraud, the trustee's thesis runs, it bears\n\nless responsibility than any of the defendants and, therefore, the\n\ndefendants fail to satisfy the first precondition for use of the in\n\npari   delicto   defense.     On   that      basis,   the    trustee      claims    an\n\nentitlement to recover for the injury that Old Dictaphone suffered\n\nwhen it was duped into proceeding with the merger.\n\n           We assume, for argument's sake, that Old Dictaphone would\n\nhave been a proper party to sue for the asserted injury.                  See supra\n\nPart II (A).        Even so, the trustee's reasoning is flawed; his\n\nanalysis   entirely    overlooks   that,      pursuant      to   both    the   merger\n\nagreement and the governing law, see Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 259(a),\n\nupon the consummation of the merger Old Dictaphone vanished into thin\n\nair and New Dictaphone inherited all of Old Dictaphone's choses in\n\naction.    Under the approved plan of reorganization incident to New\n\nDictaphone's bankruptcy, those litigation rights were passed along\n\nonce more — this time to the Trust (and, thus, to the trustee).                    See\n\n11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). Because the lineage of the trustee's claims\n\npasses directly through New Dictaphone, any right that the trustee\n\nmay have to assert those claims derives directly from New Dictaphone.\n\nThis   chain   of   descent   means    that    the    trustee     —     despite    his\n\nprotestations to the contrary — is not acting in the place and stead\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fof Old Dictaphone but, rather, in the place and stead of New\n\nDictaphone.\n\n          This genealogy is important.    Giving effect to it, the\n\ntrustee may assert only those claims that New Dictaphone could have\n\nasserted prior to seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court.\n\nSee Mediators, Inc. v. Manney (In re Mediators, Inc.), 105 F.3d 822,\n\n826 (2d Cir. 1997); see also 11 U.S.C. § 541.   After all, a trustee\n\nin bankruptcy cannot and does not      acquire rights or interests\n\nsuperior to, or greater than, those possessed by the debtor.     See\n\nEdwards, 437 F.3d at 1150; 5 Collier on Bankruptcy § 541.04 (15th ed.\n\n2006) (noting that \"nothing in section 541 [of the Bankruptcy Code,\n\ndefining property of the estate] can revest a debtor with property\n\nlost prepetition\" and describing property of the estate as including\n\n\"causes of action\").\n\n          Given the line of descent delineated by operation of the\n\ncorporation and bankruptcy laws, we think that the in pari delicto\n\ndefense must be available to a defendant in an action by a bankruptcy\n\ntrustee whenever that defense would have been available in an action\n\nby the debtor.   See Edwards, 437 F.3d at 1152; see also Baena, 453\n\nF.3d at 7 (assessing the debtor's culpability to determine whether\n\nthe in pari delicto doctrine barred a bankruptcy trustee's claims).\n\nAs a necessary corollary of that proposition, there is no \"innocent\n\nsuccessor\" exception available to a bankruptcy trustee in a case in\n\nwhich the defendant successfully could have mounted an in pari\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fdelicto defense against the debtor.                 See R.F. Lafferty, 267 F.3d at\n\n356-57.\n\n            The explication of these principles suffices to answer the\n\nthreshold    question     here.        Consistent        with   both   precedent    and\n\nanalytic    rigor,   we    hold    that   New        Dictaphone   is   the    relevant\n\ncomparator vis-á-vis the defendants for the purpose of determining\n\nthe viability of the latter's                 in    pari delicto defense.           Old\n\nDictaphone's innocence is irrelevant to that inquiry.\n\n                          D.    Applying the Paradigm.\n\n            Having determined that New Dictaphone is the entity of\n\ninterest for purposes of the required comparison, we move to the\n\nquestion of what actions can, at this stage of the proceedings, be\n\nimputed to it (and, thus, to the trustee).                  See Baena, 453 F.3d at\n\n7.     In an effort to mount a preemptive strike, the trustee posits\n\nthat     because   all    imputation          inquiries     entail     fact-specific\n\ndeterminations, an in pari delicto defense that relies on imputed\n\nconduct cannot be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss.                   Although the\n\ntrustee's premise is partially correct — the extent to which\n\nfraudulent conduct can be implied depends heavily on the specific\n\nfacts of a given case — he casts the net too wide.\n\n            The reporters are replete with examples of fact-dominated\n\nquestions,     normally        grist    for        the   jury's   mill,      that   may\n\nappropriately be resolved by a motion filed pursuant to Rule\n\n12(b)(6). See, e.g., Epstein v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 460 F.3d 183, 188\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f(1st Cir. 2006); Rodi, 389 F.3d at 16.              The key is whether the\n\nfactual scenario, as pleaded, is clear enough to permit peremptory\n\nresolution of the dispositive issue.              See Rodi, 389 F.3d at 16\n\n(explaining that when the facts alleged in the complaint preclude\n\na finding in the plaintiff's favor on a particular claim or defense,\n\n\"a court may enter an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\").\n\nWhen a case hinges on imputation and the pleaded facts, construed\n\nin the light most flattering to the resisting party, dictate\n\nimputation, a court is free to decide that question on a motion to\n\ndismiss.   See, e.g., Baena, 453 F.3d at 8 (affirming dismissal on\n\nin pari delicto grounds after imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor\n\ncorporation); Coopers & Lybrand, 322 F.3d at 164; (noting that the\n\ncourt historically \"has affirmed the dismissal of . . . claims on\n\nthe   pleadings    upon   findings   that    in    pari   delicto   had     been\n\nestablished   in    the   complaints\");     Terlecky,     133   F.3d   at   380\n\n(affirming dismissal when the debtor \"admit[ted] in his complaint\n\nthat the debtor's own actions were instrumental in perpetrating the\n\nfraud\").\n\n           We look to state law to ascertain when wrongful conduct\n\nshould be imputed to a corporation.         See O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC,\n\n512 U.S. 79, 84 (1994); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.\n\nv. Nickless (In re Advanced RISC Corp.), 324 B.R. 10, 14 (D. Mass.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f2005).3   Here, the case law leaves little doubt that Massachusetts\n\nlaw governs the imputation calculus.              See O'Melveny & Myers, 512\n\nU.S. at 83-85 (emphasizing the importance of the substantive law of\n\nthe state in which the causes of action arose, rather than the law\n\nof the state of incorporation, to determine imputation).\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, a parent and its wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary are generally regarded as separate and distinct entities.\n\nSee United Elec., Radio & Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp.,\n\n960 F.2d 1080, 1091 (1st Cir. 1992); Berger v. H.P. Hood, Inc., 624\n\nN.E.2d 947, 950 (Mass. 1993).         Courts may, however, disregard the\n\ncorporate form when doing so will defeat a fraud practiced by those\n\nwho control the subsidiary corporation.            See My Bread Baking Co. v.\n\nCumberland   Farms,   Inc.,     233    N.E.2d      748,   751     (Mass.   1968).\n\nRelatedly,   the   fraudulent   conduct      of    persons   or    entities   who\n\nexercise complete control over a corporation may be imputed to the\n\ncorporation when those actors have used the corporation as a vehicle\n\nfor facilitation of the fraud.         See, e.g., Consove v. Cohen (In re\n\n\n     3\n      To the extent that the trustee's claims are premised on\nfederal statutes, we arguably have discretion to use federal common\nlaw, as opposed to state law. See O'Melveny & Myers, 512 U.S. at 84\n(explaining that where a particular cause of action arises under a\nfederal statute, a federal court, for this purpose, writes on a\npristine page). Even so, license to apply a uniquely federal test\nis not tantamount to mandating such a test. Mindful that two of\nour sister circuits recently have opted for state-law tests of\nimputation in connection with federal claims, see Edwards, 437 F.3d\nat 1149; R.F. Lafferty, 267 F.3d at 358, and that no party to this\nlitigation has requested us to fashion federal common law, we use\nMassachusetts jurisprudence as the yardstick for measuring\nimputation across the board.\n\n                                      -20-\n\fRoco    Corp.),     701    F.2d    978,      984    (1st    Cir.     1983)   (applying\n\nMassachusetts law and imputing fraudulent conduct of individual who,\n\n\"as the company's president, director, and sole shareholder, . . .\n\nwas in a position to control the disposition of its property\");\n\nMerrill Lynch, 324 B.R. at 14-15 (applying Massachusetts law and\n\nimputing principals' fraudulent conduct to debtor corporation where\n\nthe    relationship       was   \"one   of    complete      control\");    Demoulas   v.\n\nDemoulas, 703 N.E.2d 1149, 1171 (Mass. 1998) (applying Massachusetts\n\nlaw and denying bona fide purchaser status to a corporation, under\n\nan imputation theory, when the \"sole voting trustee of 100 percent\n\nof the [corporation's] stock\" had actual knowledge of adverse claims\n\nagainst the purchased property).\n\n            With this backdrop in place, the trustee's remaining\n\narguments against imputing L&H's fraudulent conduct to its wholly-\n\nowned subsidiary lack force.           The trustee himself has observed that\n\nin pari delicto cases often result in imputation of fraudulent\n\nconduct to a corporation when those responsible for the scheme are\n\n\"the sole decision-maker[s] for such entity, exercising complete\n\ncontrol over its management.\"                Appellant's Br. at 43 n.21.          This\n\nobservation accurately reflects the case law.                      See, e.g., Coopers\n\n& Lybrand, 322 F.3d at 164-65 (imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor\n\nwhen    complaint     established       that       its   controlling     shareholders\n\n\"dominat[ed] and controll[ed] the corporation\" and were responsible\n\nfor \"orchestrat[ing] the fraudulent conduct\"); R.F. Lafferty, 267\n\n\n                                            -21-\n\fF.3d at 359-60 (imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor corporation\n\nand dismissing trustee's case on in pari delicto grounds where the\n\nindividuals   masterminding    the   fraud   were      the   debtor's   sole\n\nshareholders);   Merrill    Lynch,   324   B.R.   at    14-16   (dismissing\n\ntrustee's action on in pari delicto grounds when debtor corporation\n\nwas formed by the defrauders for the express purpose of carrying out\n\nthe fraudulent plan).    Since New Dictaphone, not Old Dictaphone, is\n\nthe proper focal point of our imputation inquiry, see supra Part II\n\n(C), this case fits snugly within that integument.               We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           Here, the amended complaint leaves no doubt but that L&H\n\nplayed the primary role in contriving the scheme to acquire Old\n\nDictaphone under false pretenses.          The amended complaint also\n\nestablishes that L&H created New Dictaphone (née Dark) for the\n\nexpress purpose of furthering this artifice. L&H's control over New\n\nDictaphone during the course of the scheme is indisputable.              In\n\naddition to owning all of New Dictaphone's stock, L&H installed its\n\npresident, Bastiaens, as New Dictaphone's chief executive officer\n\nand sole director.      Bastiaens, in turn, ensured New Dictaphone's\n\ncomplicity in the fraud's climactic event when he executed the\n\nmerger agreement on its behalf.\n\n           These uncontroverted facts are telling.              Because the\n\namended complaint shows beyond hope of contradiction that L&H\n\ncreated and controlled New Dictaphone in order to perpetrate the\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fharm-producing fraud, we have no principled choice but to impute its\n\nconduct to New Dictaphone for the purpose of applying the in pari\n\ndelicto paradigm.   See Merrill Lynch, 324 B.R. at 15; Demoulas, 703\n\nN.E.2d at 1172; My Bread Baking, 233 N.E.2d at 751.\n\n           The trustee tries to find sanctuary by pointing out that,\n\nafter the merger, the directors of Old Dictaphone (presumably\n\ninnocent) became directors of New Dictaphone.    This datum does not\n\nalter our conclusion.     The first prong of the in pari delicto\n\ninquiry focuses on \"the unlawful activity that is the subject of the\n\nsuit.\"   Pinter, 486 U.S. at 636. Accordingly, a party's culpability\n\nvel non must be based on its status at the time the alleged\n\nillegality occurred.     See Baena, 453   F.3d   at 10 (finding no\n\nMassachusetts case law supporting a theory that in pari delicto is\n\nin any way modified when \"prior management was at fault but the\n\nclaim [is] asserted on behalf of creditors or shareholders\").\n\n           Here, of course, the fraud that underpins the trustee's\n\nclaims was complete at the moment the companies merged.   Therefore,\n\nany post-merger changes in New Dictaphone's corporate governance or\n\nmanagement are beside the point.    Simply put, bankruptcy trustees\n\ndo not have access to an \"innocent successor\" exception as a way of\n\nshielding themselves from the operation of an in pari delicto\n\ndefense. See R.F. Lafferty, 267 F.3d at 356-57; see also Baena, 453\n\nF.3d at 10.\n\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f             The trustee's next attempt to elude the toils of the in\n\npari delicto doctrine involves the well-recognized adverse interest\n\nexception.     Generally, a wrongdoer's fraudulent acts will not be\n\nimputed to a corporation when the wrongdoer is acting contrary to\n\nthe corporation's present interests.          See, e.g., Baena, 453 F.3d at\n\n8 (listing looting as a \"classic example\" of adverse conduct);\n\nSunrise Props., Inc. v. Bacon, Wilson, Ratner, Cohen, Salvage,\n\nFialky   &   Fitzgerald,    P.C.,    679   N.E.2d    540,   543    (Mass.   1997)\n\n(concluding that \"unauthorized acts [should] not [be] imputed to the\n\nprincipal    when   the    agent    has    acted    fraudulently    toward   the\n\nprincipal\").     Endeavoring to squeeze within these narrow confines,\n\nthe trustee contends that L&H's scurrilous conduct is tantamount to\n\nlooting because L&H convinced Old Dictaphone to surrender its assets\n\nfor worthless paper.\n\n             This contention is ill-conceived, for the trustee's sights\n\nare trained on the wrong entity.           Accepting the allegations of the\n\namended complaint as true, L&H's actions were adverse to Old\n\nDictaphone and its shareholders — but they were not adverse to New\n\nDictaphone (a corporate shell which, in effect, was in league with\n\nthe defrauder and as a result received something for nothing).\n\nSince we already have determined that New Dictaphone, not Old\n\nDictaphone, is the focal point of the imputation inquiry, see supra\n\nPart II (C), the adverse interest exception does not apply.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f                  The trustee has yet another string to his bow.          He argues\n\nthat even if New Dictaphone is the proper focal point of an in pari\n\ndelicto analysis, the adverse interest exception precludes us from\n\nimputing L&H's fraud to its subsidiary because New Dictaphone was\n\n\"entirely indifferent\" about whether Old Dictaphone received fair\n\nvalue for its assets or whether L&H used skulduggery to effect the\n\nacquisition.           Appellant's Reply Br. at 19.         We find this argument\n\nunpersuasive.           In our view, mere indifference is insufficient to\n\nshow adversity.           The adverse interest exception applies only to\n\nthose whom the fraud has disadvantaged.               See Restatement (Second)\n\nof Agency § 282(1) (explaining that the exception attaches only when\n\nan agent secretly acts adversely to his principal).                        In this\n\ninstance, the allegations of the amended complaint make manifest\n\nthat New Dictaphone benefitted from the fraud: it was the surviving\n\nentity       in    a   merger   that   netted   it   over    $900,000,000.     New\n\nDictaphone, as a beneficiary of L&H's chicanery at the time the\n\nfraud       was    consummated,4   cannot   rely     on   the   adverse   interest\n\nexception to avoid imputation. After all, a party cannot accept the\n\navails of fraudulent conduct without also bearing responsibility for\n\n\n\n        4\n      Because the adverse interest exception turns on how the\nalleged wrongdoing affected the immediate interests of the party\nwho seeks its shelter, New Dictaphone's subsequent implosion is of\nno moment.

Noyes, 141 N.E. 93, 98\n\n(Mass. 1923).\n\n          To summarize succinctly, L&H was the main player in the\n\nalleged fraud and its parlous behavior must be imputed lock, stock,\n\nand barrel to its offspring (New Dictaphone). It follows inexorably\n\nthat New Dictaphone, in contemplation of law, bears at least as much\n\nresponsibility     for   the   asserted   wrongdoing   as   any   of   the\n\ndefendants.5    Hence, the moving defendants have satisfied the first\n\nrequirement for establishing an in pari delicto defense.\n\n          We move next to the second requirement.           As said, this\n\nprong implicates public policy concerns.      The trustee contends that\n\nallowing the defendants to hide behind the in pari delicto doctrine\n\nwould frustrate the purpose of the securities laws because it would\n\nallow participants in a fraudulent scheme to shield themselves from\n\nliability.     This contention is wide of the mark.\n\n          As we have pointed out, the trustee is not bringing claims\n\non behalf of an innocent target of the fraud but, rather, on behalf\n\n\n\n     5\n      As a fallback, the trustee suggests that the relevant\ncomparison entails matching New Dictaphone's culpability against\nthe culpability of L&H. That suggestion is faulty. When deciding\nwhether to recognize an in pari delicto defense, an inquiring court\nmust consider whether the party alleging injury (here, the trustee,\nwho stands in the shoes of New Dictaphone) bears substantially\nequal (or greater) responsibility as the party or parties asserting\nthe defense (here, the defendants). See Bateman Eichler, 472 U.S.\nat 306 (emphasizing the relative culpability of the \"[defending]\nparty\" as compared to the plaintiff (alteration in original)). L&H\nis not a defendant in this action.\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fof a complicit party.       Viewed in that light, the trustee's policy\n\nconcerns ring hollow.6       See Edwards, 437 F.3d at 1155 (finding\n\npublic policy exception inapplicable in analogous circumstances).\n\n           The trustee also asserts that withholding application of\n\nthe   in   pari   delicto    doctrine     would    promote   the    goal   of\n\n\"discourag[ing]   wrongdoers     from   engaging    in   future    fraudulent\n\nschemes and violations of the securities laws.\"          Appellant's Br. at\n\n38. That resupinate reasoning turns reality on its head. To permit\n\nthe trustee to proceed in these circumstances would be equivalent\n\nto giving New Dictaphone a second bite at the cherry, allowing it\n\nfirst to reap the benefits of the fraud and then to attack the\n\ndefrauders.   The securities laws were enacted to protect investors\n\nfrom deceptive practices, see Pinter, 486 U.S. at 638, not to give\n\nthe intended beneficiaries of deceptive practices a back-door means\n\nof ensuring a profit.\n\n           Finally, the trustee strives to persuade us that we should\n\nrepel the defendants' in pari delicto defense because, in the\n\nabsence of that defense, the creditors of Old Dictaphone ultimately\n\nwould receive the fruits of any recovery.           We find this argument\n\nunconvincing; despite the interposition of the in pari delicto\n\n\n\n      6\n      In all events, dismissing the claims at issue here will not\nallow the defendants to escape unscathed. The amended complaint\nand matters susceptible to judicial notice reveal that many of the\ndefendants are facing or have faced not only criminal charges but\nalso a myriad of other civil suits relating to their respective\nroles in the alleged fraud.\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdefense, the creditors remain free to proceed in their own right,\n\nuntainted by New Dictaphone's role in the alleged wrongdoing.             See\n\nEdwards, 437 F.3d at 1151; Terlecky, 133 F.3d at 380; Merrill Lynch,\n\n324 B.R. at 16.\n\n          This arrangement is especially preferable because the\n\nTrust beneficiaries may well include parties (most notably L&H) who\n\nwere themselves complicit in the underlying fraud.            If we were to\n\nsuspend the operation of the in pari delicto defense in this case,\n\ncreditors with unclean hands would profit equally with innocents.\n\nIf, however, each creditor must proceed by individual suit, the\n\nrighteous may recover while the tainted, unable to circumvent the\n\nin pari delicto bar, will be hoist by their own petard.\n\n          At    oral    argument,    the    trustee   insisted    that    the\n\nalternative    of   direct   suits   by   creditors   is   illusory   because\n\ncreditors lack contractual privity with the investment bankers,\n\nlawyers, and accountants who comprise the trustee's targets.             Thus,\n\nthe argument runs, if we afford these targets the safe haven of an\n\nin pari delicto doctrine, creditors will be completely foreclosed\n\nfrom accessing those pockets that are deep enough to compensate them\n\nat anything higher than pennies on the dollar.\n\n          This jeremiad is unavailing.           Even assuming that the\n\ntrustee's premise is true — and we have some doubt about its\n\nvalidity — the equities are not nearly so clear-cut.             First, the\n\ncreditors (or the trustee, on their behalf) may well succeed in\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fsuits    against     Old    Dictaphone's   former      directors,    controlling\n\nshareholder, and outside accounting professionals.                See supra note\n\n1.     Second — and more important — our holding today breaks no new\n\nground.       As    such,    the     potential   for    default     under   these\n\ncircumstances is something about which creditors had notice —\n\nsomething that should have been priced into their decisions to\n\nextend credit.       Equity does not require courts to provide a belt\n\nwhen creditors had fair warning that they ought to have purchased\n\nsuspenders.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            To     summarize,   we    conclude   that    uncontroverted     facts\n\nsufficient to establish the in pari delicto defense are definitively\n\nascertainable from the amended complaint and other allowable sources\n\nof information.      These include L&H's creation of New Dictaphone for\n\nthe express purpose of effectuating the fraud-inspired merger and\n\nits exercise of complete control over New Dictaphone until the fraud\n\nwas consummated.        In these circumstances, L&H's conduct must be\n\nimputed to New Dictaphone.         Consequently, New Dictaphone shares the\n\nculpability of the fraud's progenitor and, as such, bears as much\n\nor more responsibility for the wrongdoing as any of the named\n\ndefendants.      In the absence of any compelling public policy reason\n\nto allow New Dictaphone to seek damages from those that assisted in\n\nexecuting the fraudulent scheme — and the trustee has identified\n\nnone — the in pari delicto doctrine precludes New Dictaphone (and,\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fhence, the trustee) from advancing the type of claims that are at\n\nissue here.\n\n            We need go no further.   For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe hold that the district court did not err in dismissing the\n\ntrustee's amended complaint.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f",

In the underlying series of events, a corporate shark, using fraudulent means, induced an allegedly innocent target corporation to enter into an ill-advised merger. After both the shark and the merged entity drowned in red ink, plaintiff-appellant Alan Nisselson (the trustee), appointed by the bankruptcy court to prosecute any causes of action that the merged entity might possess, attempted to mount various claims arising out of the innocent target's legal rights. Those rights, of course, were twice removed from the damages that formed the basis of the suit: they were passed along once to the surviving corporation (at the time of the merger) and again to the trustee (during the bankruptcy proceedings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emphasizing this genealogy, the district court dismissed the action on two grounds; it determined that the trustee lacked standing to pursue the claims and that, in all events, the rascality of the shark was as a matter of law imputed to the surviving entity in the merger (and that, therefore, the hoary in pari delicto doctrine barred the suit). <i>See Nisselson v. Lernout,</i> 2004 WL 3953998, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *20-21 (D.Mass. Aug. 9, 2004). Concluding, as we do, that the second of these determinations withstands scrutiny&#8212;the trustee's claims are incurably tainted because they derive from the itself-complicit surviving corporation&#8212;we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We glean the pertinent facts from the amended complaint, supplementing those facts as needed by documents fairly incorporated therein and matters susceptible to judicial notice. <i>See Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2003). While the scheme that lies at the center of this case comprises a complex tale of sophisticated financial chicanery, we rehearse here only those features essential to an understanding of the present proceeding. We urge the reader who thirsts for greater knowledge to consult the array of published opinions emanating from related litigation. <i>See, e.g., Baena v. KPMG LLP,</i> 453 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Quaak v. Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler Bedrijfsrevisoren,</i> 361 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>Bamberg v. SG Cowen,</i> 236 F.Supp.2d 79 (D.Mass. 2002); <i>Filler v. Lernout,</i> 230 F.Supp.2d 152 (D.Mass. 2002); <i>In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> 208 F.Supp.2d 74 (D.Mass. 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time the new millennium dawned, Dictaphone Corporation (Old Dictaphone), a company chartered under the laws of Delaware, had established itself as a force in the healthcare speech and language applications market. Lernout &amp; Hauspie, N.V. (L &amp; H), a Belgian corporation that ran its United States operations from headquarters in Massachusetts, was itself an international leader in various speech and language sectors. In hopes of swallowing up its competitor, L &amp; H began courting Old Dictaphone; it described in glowing terms its financial stability and the profitable synergies that a merger could generate. Negotiations ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Old Dictaphone conducted extensive due diligence investigations into L &amp; H's fiscal health. During the course of that review, L &amp; H's senior officers, investment bankers, attorneys, and auditors touted its financial prowess. Against this rose-colored backdrop, Old Dictaphone agreed to a stock-for-stock merger. The parties memorialized the terms in a merger agreement dated March 7, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merger took place less than two months thereafter: L &amp; H acquired all the outstanding stock of Old Dictaphone in exchange for approximately 9,400,000 shares of L &amp; H common stock. Based on the trading price of L &amp; H stock at the time of the closing, the exchange corresponded to a merger price of roughly $930,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part and parcel of the transaction, Old Dictaphone merged into Dark Acquisition Corp. (Dark), a wholly-owned subsidiary of L &amp; H created under Delaware law for the express purpose of effectuating the merger. L &amp; H's chief executive officer, defendant-appellee Gaston Bastiaens, doubled in brass as Dark's chief executive and lone director. He also signed the merger agreement on its behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the merger agreement, Dark inherited Old Dictaphone's assets (including any existing legal claims) and assumed Old Dictaphone's liabilities. This arrangement corresponded to the dictates of Delaware law. <i>See</i> Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 259(a). Dark survived the merger and Old Dictaphone ceased to exist. Dark then changed its name to Dictaphone Corporation (New Dictaphone).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The honeymoon was brief. Shortly after the merger had been consummated, L &amp; H announced that the financial picture it had painted and displayed was not an accurate portrayal. As matters turned out, nearly two-thirds of L &amp; H's reported revenue from 1998 through mid-2000 had been improperly recorded, so that an apparent $70,000,000 net profit for that period was in fact a net loss of a similar magnitude. The price of L &amp; H shares plummeted and, on November 29, 2000, L &amp; H and New Dictaphone filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fast-forward to New Dictaphone's approved plan of reorganization. As part of that plan, the corporation conveyed its interest in any claims arising out of the merger to the Dictaphone Litigation Trust (the Trust). That assignment galvanized this suit: acting on behalf of the Trust, the trustee filed a civil action in federal district court seeking damages to compensate for the \"loss or diminution of [Old Dictaphone's] value as a going concern.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee's amended complaint characterizes the gross misstatments of earnings as the mainspring of a fraudulent scheme designed to inflate the value of L &amp; H's stock. As the trustee envisions it, this scheme, which played out over a four-year period, was concocted and executed by the defendants in this case (who include the officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, and auditors of L &amp; H, and divers entities related to them). The fallout from it rendered worthless the consideration that Old Dictaphone and its shareholders received (assumption of Old Dictaphone's debt and shares of L &amp; H stock).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his amended complaint, the trustee asserts federal securities and racketeering claims, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c); 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5, as well as supplemental state-law claims for fraud, unfair trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy. The theory underlying each and all of these initiatives is that L &amp; H, through its senior management, knowingly engaged in a scheme to classify research and development expenditures as fictional revenue in order to inflate the value of the company's stock. Then, knowing that they were selling a lie, L &amp; H's hierarchs flaunted the company's ever-increasing stock price and used its apocryphal earnings to persuade Old Dictaphone and its shareholders to enter into a stock-for-stock merger. L &amp; H relied on its investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and related entities to substantiate its false claims; those parties, the trustee contends, knew that L &amp; H was spinning a yarn, yet assisted it in perpetrating the fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Various defendants, led by SG Cowen (an investment banking house), filed motions to dismiss. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). All of these motions argued, in relevant part, that the trustee lacked standing and that his claims were barred under the in pari delicto doctrine. Some of the motions advanced additional grounds for dismissing particular claims. The trustee vigorously opposed the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court granted Cowen's motion and dismissed the trustee's federal claims against Cowen with prejudice. <i>See Nisselson,</i> 2004 WL 3953998, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *20-21. The court rested its decision on two alternative grounds. First, it concluded that the in pari delicto doctrine barred the claims because the trustee had inherited them from New Dictaphone, an entity itself implicated in the alleged fraud. <i>See id.,</i> 2004 WL 3953998, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *12-15. Second, interpreting and applying the Delaware standard for distinguishing direct and derivative claims, it concluded that the trustee lacked standing because the claims asserted belonged to Old Dictaphone's former shareholders, not to Old Dictaphone itself. <i>See id.,</i> 2004 WL 3953998, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *12-15 (discussing, inter alia, <i>Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Inc.,</i> 845 A.2d 1031, 1033 (Del. 2004)). For the same reasons, the court, in a series of subsequent orders, granted the other appellees' motions to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal orders de novo, assuming the truth of all well-pleaded facts contained in the operative version of the complaint and indulging all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. <i>See McCloskey v. Mueller,</i> 446 F.3d 262, 266 (1st Cir. 2006). Facts distilled in that fashion may be augmented by reference to (i) documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated into it, and (ii) matters susceptible to judicial notice. <i>See Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 5; <i>Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2004). Where, as here, a district court rests its decision on alternative grounds, an appellate court need not explore both; if it determines that one such ground fully supports the order of dismissal, the court may end its deliberations at that point. <i>See Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp.,</i> 942 F.2d 34, 41 n. 7 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an idiosyncratic procedural feature. While most Rule 12(b)(6) motions are premised on a plaintiff's putative failure to state an actionable claim, such a motion may sometimes be premised on the inevitable success of an affirmative defense. <i>See, e.g., In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 16; <i>Blackstone Realty v. FDIC,</i> 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001); <i>Keene Lumber Co. v. Leventhal,</i> 165 F.2d 815, 820 (1st Cir. 1948). Dismissing a case under Rule 12(b)(6) on the basis of an affirmative defense requires that \"(i) the facts establishing the defense are definitively ascertainable from the complaint and the other allowable sources of information, and (ii) those facts suffice to establish the affirmative defense with certitude.\" <i>Rodi,</i> 389 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standing.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court characterized both the in pari delicto doctrine and the absence of cognizable injury as evincing a lack of standing. <i>See Nisselson,</i> 2004 WL 3953998, at *3, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28655, at *12-13. Part of this characterization is inapt: the in pari delicto doctrine does not implicate a plaintiff's standing to sue but, rather, constitutes an affirmative defense. <i>See Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of PSA, Inc. v. Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d 1145, 1149-50 (11th Cir. 2006); <i>Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Color Tile, Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP,</i> 322 F.3d 147, 157 (2d Cir. 2003); <i>see also Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 6 (noting that the doctrine is, on occasion, \"dubiously\" referred to as implicating standing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, however, that we must grapple with the district court's alternative \"distinct injury\" holding first. Even though challenges to a plaintiff's standing are often considered threshold issues in federal cases, <i>see, e.g., Pag&#225;n v. Calder&#243;n,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 351 (1st Cir. 2004), such challenges must be addressed first only if they call into question a federal court's Article III power to hear the case. <i>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). The constitutional prerequisites for Article III standing are satisfied so long as a plaintiff colorably alleges an actual injury that is both traceable to the defendant's conduct and redressable by a favorable decision. <i>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-62, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <i>Ram&#237;rez v. S&#225;nchez Ramos,</i> 438 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, those prerequisites have been fulfilled. For purposes of their motions to dismiss, the defendants wisely choose not to contest the trustee's assertion that the conduct attributed to them resulted in a redressable injury; instead, they posit that the trustee is seeking to prosecute claims that, although cognizable in a federal court, belong exclusively to Old Dictaphone's former shareholders. The determination of who may maintain an otherwise cognizable claim turns on a question of prudential standing, not one of Article III standing. <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 5; <i>see also Ram&#237;rez,</i> 438 F.3d at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That frees our hands: <i>Steel Co.'s</i> ban on hypothetical jurisdiction extends only to issues involving Article III jurisdiction and, hence, Article III standing. There is no counterpart rule that demands the resolution of objections based on prudential concerns before other issues can be adjudicated. <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 5; <i>McBee v. Delica Co.,</i> 417 F.3d 107, 127 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandatory rules aside, courts should not rush to rely on hypothetical jurisdiction. <i>See Berner v. Delahanty,</i> 129 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, one situation in which hypothetical jurisdiction, if otherwise proper, may be invoked is when doing so would avoid the need to sort out thorny jurisdictional tangles. <i>See, e.g., McBee,</i> 417 F.3d at 127; <i>Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys.,</i> 173 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1999). As we explain briefly, just such a tangle exists here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the decision in <i>Tooley</i> may have helped to clarify the often elusive distinction between direct and derivative claims, that distinction remains tenebrous. <i>See</i> Richard Montgomery Donaldson, <i>Mapping Delaware's Elusive Divide: Clarification and Further Movement Toward a Merits-Based Analysis for Distinguishing Derivative and Direct Claims in Agostino v. Hick and Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Inc.,</i> 30 Del. J. Corp. L. 389, 404 (2005) (listing the \"determination of who suffered the harm&#8212;the corporation or the shareholder(s)\" as one of the potentially confusing issues left open under <i>Tooley</i>). More to the point, it is not immediately apparent how the Delaware court's newly announced two-part test, 845 A.2d at 1033, should apply to the unique facts of this stock-for-stock merger. Because the record reflects a clear and sufficient basis apart from standing for affirming the district court's judgment, we bypass these uncharted waters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The In Pari Delicto Doctrine.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In pari delicto is both an affirmative defense and an equitable defense. Broadly speaking, the defense prohibits plaintiffs from recovering damages resulting from their own wrongdoing. <i>See Terlecky v. Hurd (In re Dublin Sec.),</i> 133 F.3d 377, 380 (6th Cir. 1997). The label derives from the Latin phrase <i>in pari delicto potior est conditio possidentis,</i> which admonishes that \"[i]n a case of equal or mutual fault ... the condition of the [defending party] is the better one.\" Black's Law Dictionary 791 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine is grounded on twin premises. The first is that \"courts should not lend their good offices to mediating disputes among wrongdoers.\" <i>Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner,</i> 472 U.S. 299, 306, 105 S.Ct. 2622, 86 L.Ed.2d 215 (1985). The second is that \"denying judicial relief to an admitted wrongdoer is an effective means of deterring illegality.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The in pari delicto defense has long been woven into the fabric of federal law. <i>See id.</i> at 307, 105 S.Ct. 2622 (discussing the doctrine's historical development); <i>see also Fleming v. Lind-Waldock &amp; Co.,</i> 922 F.2d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 1990); <i>Duncan v. Me. Cent. R. Co.,</i> 113 F. 508, 509 (C.C.D.Me. 1902). It does not make a difference that some of the trustee's claims are premised on state law. Those claims invoke the law of Massachusetts&#8212;and the Massachusetts courts, like the federal courts, have warmly embraced the in pari delicto defense. <i>See, e.g., Council v. Cohen,</i> 303 Mass. 348, 21 N.E.2d 967, 970 (1939); <i>Choquette v. Isacoff,</i> 65 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 836 N.E.2d 329, 332 (2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As originally conceived, the in pari delicto doctrine forged a defense of limited utility. Over time, however, courts expanded the doctrine's sweep, deploying it as a basis for dismissing suits whenever a plaintiff had played any role&#8212;no matter how modest&#8212;in the harm-producing activity. <i>See Bateman Eichler,</i> 472 U.S. at 307, 105 S.Ct. 2622. Deploring this overly commodious construction, the Supreme Court later reined in the doctrine and returned it to its classic contours. <i>See Pinter v. Dahl,</i> 486 U.S. 622, 635, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d 658 (1988); <i>Bateman Eichler,</i> 472 U.S. at 310-11, 105 S.Ct. 2622. This retrenchment, which governs here, restricts the application of the in pari delicto doctrine to those situations in which (i) the plaintiff, as compared to the defendant, bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the wrong he seeks to redress and (ii) preclusion of the suit would not interfere with the purposes of the underlying law or otherwise contravene the public interest. <i>See Bateman Eichler,</i> 472 U.S. at 311, 105 S.Ct. 2622 (discussing the doctrine's application to federal securities laws); <i>see also Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1154. Recent Massachusetts case law mirrors these refinements. <i>See, e.g., Choquette,</i> 836 N.E.2d at 332-33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the application of this binary paradigm may vary slightly depending on the nature of the particular claim asserted, courts nonetheless speak of a single doctrine. This is because the analysis ordinarily will be the same across a spectrum of different causes of action. <i>See Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors v. R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 340, 345-46 (3d Cir. 2001); <i>see also Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</i> 322 F.3d at 160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below adopted this one-size-fits-all approach in addressing the in pari delicto defense; it neither distinguished among the various counts nor differentiated between federal and state law. The trustee has not objected to this approach, so he has waived any argument either that a claim-by-claim analysis is obligatory or that some material differences exist between applicable federal and state law. <i>See Domegan v. Fair,</i> 859 F.2d 1059, 1065 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"It is too familiar to warrant string citation that we will not consider arguments which could have been, but were not, advanced below.\"). Consequently, we employ the same generic strain of the in pari delicto doctrine throughout our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Establishing the Appropriate Benchmark.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To apply the requisite two-part paradigm in the circumstances of this case, we must answer a threshold question: Who, exactly, are the proper parties for the purpose of determining relative blame? The trustee's answer to this query is straightforward. Because his claims originate with Old Dictaphone, he asseverates that this indisputably innocent party is the relevant entity for purposes of the comparison required by the binary in pari delicto test. Since Old Dictaphone was the victim rather than a perpetrator of the alleged fraud, the trustee's thesis runs, it bears less responsibility than any of the defendants and, therefore, the defendants fail to satisfy the first precondition for use of the in pari delicto defense. On that basis, the trustee claims an entitlement to recover for the injury that Old Dictaphone suffered when it was duped into proceeding with the merger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, for argument's sake, that Old Dictaphone would have been a proper party to sue for the asserted injury. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Even so, the trustee's reasoning is flawed; his analysis entirely overlooks that, pursuant to both the merger agreement and the governing law, <i>see</i> Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 259(a), upon the consummation of the merger Old Dictaphone vanished into thin air and New Dictaphone inherited all of Old Dictaphone's choses in action. Under the approved plan of reorganization incident to New Dictaphone's bankruptcy, those litigation rights were passed along once more&#8212;this time to the Trust (and, thus, to the trustee). <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1). Because the lineage of the trustee's claims passes directly through New Dictaphone, any right that the trustee may have to assert those claims derives directly from New Dictaphone. This chain of descent means that the trustee&#8212;despite his protestations to the contrary&#8212;is not acting in the place and stead of Old Dictaphone but, rather, in the place and stead of New Dictaphone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This genealogy is important. Giving effect to it, the trustee may assert only those claims that New Dictaphone could have asserted prior to seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court. <i>See Mediators, Inc. v. Manney (In re Mediators, Inc.),</i> 105 F.3d 822, 826 (2d Cir. 1997); <i>see also</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541. After all, a trustee in bankruptcy cannot and does not acquire rights or interests superior to, or greater than, those possessed by the debtor. <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1150; 5 Collier on Bankruptcy &#167; 541.04 (15th ed. 2006) (noting that \"nothing in section 541 [of the Bankruptcy Code, defining property of the estate] can revest a debtor with property lost prepetition\" and describing property of the estate as including \"causes of action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the line of descent delineated by operation of the corporation and bankruptcy laws, we think that the in pari delicto defense must be available to a defendant in an action by a bankruptcy trustee whenever that defense would have been available in an action by the debtor. <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1152; <i>see also Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 7 (assessing the debtor's culpability to determine whether the in pari delicto doctrine barred a bankruptcy trustee's claims). As a necessary corollary of that proposition, there is no \"innocent successor\" exception available to a bankruptcy trustee in a case in which the defendant successfully could have mounted an in pari delicto defense against the debtor. <i>See R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 356-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The explication of these principles suffices to answer the threshold question here. Consistent with both precedent and analytic rigor, we hold that New Dictaphone is the relevant comparator vis-&#225;-vis the defendants for the purpose of determining the viability of the latter's in pari delicto defense. Old Dictaphone's innocence is irrelevant to that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Applying the Paradigm.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that New Dictaphone is the entity of interest for purposes of the required comparison, we move to the question of what actions can, at this stage of the proceedings, be imputed to it (and, thus, to the trustee). <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 7. In an effort to mount a preemptive strike, the trustee posits that because all imputation inquiries entail fact-specific determinations, an in pari delicto defense that relies on imputed conduct cannot be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss. Although the trustee's premise is partially correct&#8212;the extent to which fraudulent conduct can be implied depends heavily on the specific facts of a given case&#8212;he casts the net too wide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reporters are replete with examples of fact-dominated questions, normally grist for the jury's mill, that may appropriately be resolved by a motion filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <i>See, e.g., Epstein v. C.R. Bard, Inc.,</i> 460 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Rodi,</i> 389 F.3d at 16. The key is whether the factual scenario, as pleaded, is clear enough to permit peremptory resolution of the dispositive issue. <i>See Rodi,</i> 389 F.3d at 16 (explaining that when the facts alleged in the complaint preclude a finding in the plaintiff's favor on a particular claim or defense, \"a court may enter an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\"). When a case hinges on imputation and the pleaded facts, construed in the light most flattering to the resisting party, dictate imputation, a court is free to decide that question on a motion to dismiss. <i>See, e.g., Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 8 (affirming dismissal on in pari delicto grounds after imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor corporation); <i>Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</i> 322 F.3d at 164; (noting that the court historically \"has affirmed the dismissal of ... claims on the pleadings upon findings that in pari delicto had been established in the complaints\"); <i>Terlecky,</i> 133 F.3d at 380 (affirming dismissal when the debtor \"admit[ted] in his complaint that the debtor's own actions were instrumental in perpetrating the fraud\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look to state law to ascertain when wrongful conduct should be imputed to a corporation. <i>See O'Melveny &amp; Myers v. FDIC,</i> 512 U.S. 79, 84, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994); <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Nickless (In re Advanced RISC Corp.),</i> 324 B.R. 10, 14 (D.Mass. 2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Here, the case law leaves little doubt that Massachusetts law governs the imputation calculus. <i>See O'Melveny &amp; Myers,</i> 512 U.S. at 83-85, 114 S.Ct. 2048 (emphasizing the importance of the substantive law of the state in which the causes of action arose, rather than the law of the state of incorporation, to determine imputation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary are generally regarded as separate and distinct entities. <i>See United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp.,</i> 960 F.2d 1080, 1091 (1st Cir. 1992); <i>Berger v. H.P. Hood, Inc.,</i> 416 Mass. 652, 624 N.E.2d 947, 950 (1993). Courts may, however, disregard the corporate form when doing so will defeat a fraud practiced by those who control the subsidiary corporation. <i>See My Bread Baking Co. v. Cumberland Farms, Inc.,</i> 353 Mass. 614, 233 N.E.2d 748, 751 (1968). Relatedly, the fraudulent conduct of persons or entities who exercise complete control over a corporation may be imputed to the corporation when those actors have used the corporation as a vehicle for facilitation of the fraud. <i>See, e.g., Consove v. Cohen (In re Roco Corp.),</i> 701 F.2d 978, 984 (1st Cir. 1983) (applying Massachusetts law and imputing fraudulent conduct of individual who, \"as the company's president, director, and sole shareholder, ... was in a position to control the disposition of its property\"); <i>Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 14-15 (applying Massachusetts law and imputing principals' fraudulent conduct to debtor corporation where the relationship was \"one of complete control\"); <i>Demoulas v. Demoulas,</i> 428 Mass. 555, 703 N.E.2d 1149, 1171 (1998) (applying Massachusetts law and denying bona fide purchaser status to a corporation, under an imputation theory, when the \"sole voting trustee of 100 percent of the [corporation's] stock\" had actual knowledge of adverse claims against the purchased property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this backdrop in place, the trustee's remaining arguments against imputing L &amp; H's fraudulent conduct to its wholly-owned subsidiary lack force. The trustee himself has observed that in pari delicto cases often result in imputation of fraudulent conduct to a corporation when those responsible for the scheme are \"the sole decision-maker[s] for such entity, exercising complete control over its management.\" Appellant's Br. at 43 n. 21. This observation accurately reflects the case law. <i>See, e.g., Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</i> 322 F.3d at 164-65 (imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor when complaint established that its controlling shareholders \"dominat[ed] and controll[ed] the corporation\" and were responsible for \"orchestrat[ing] the fraudulent conduct\"); <i>R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 359-60 (imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor corporation and dismissing trustee's case on in pari delicto grounds where the individuals masterminding the fraud were the debtor's sole shareholders); <i>Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 14-16 (dismissing trustee's action on in pari delicto grounds when debtor corporation was formed by the defrauders for the express purpose of carrying out the fraudulent plan). Since New Dictaphone, not Old Dictaphone, is the proper focal point of our imputation inquiry, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), this case fits snugly within that integument. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the amended complaint leaves no doubt but that L &amp; H played the primary role in contriving the scheme to acquire Old Dictaphone under false pretenses. The amended complaint also establishes that L &amp; H created New Dictaphone (n&#233;e Dark) for the express purpose of furthering this artifice. L &amp; H's control over New Dictaphone during the course of the scheme is indisputable. In addition to owning all of New Dictaphone's stock, L &amp; H installed its president, Bastiaens, as New Dictaphone's chief executive officer and sole director. Bastiaens, in turn, ensured New Dictaphone's complicity in the fraud's climactic event when he executed the merger agreement on its behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These uncontroverted facts are telling. Because the amended complaint shows beyond hope of contradiction that L &amp; H created and controlled New Dictaphone in order to perpetrate the harm-producing fraud, we have no principled choice but to impute its conduct to New Dictaphone for the purpose of applying the in pari delicto paradigm. <i>See Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 15; <i>Demoulas,</i> 703 N.E.2d at 1172; <i>My Bread Baking,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 751.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee tries to find sanctuary by pointing out that, <i>after</i> the merger, the directors of Old Dictaphone (presumably innocent) became directors of New Dictaphone. This datum does not alter our conclusion. The first prong of the in pari delicto inquiry focuses on \"the unlawful activity that is the subject of the suit.\" <i>Pinter,</i> 486 U.S. at 636, 108 S.Ct. 2063. Accordingly, a party's culpability vel non must be based on its status at the time the alleged illegality occurred. <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 10 (finding no Massachusetts case law supporting a theory that in pari delicto is in any way modified when \"prior management was at fault but the claim [is] asserted on behalf of creditors or shareholders\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, of course, the fraud that underpins the trustee's claims was complete at the moment the companies merged. Therefore, any post-merger changes in New Dictaphone's corporate governance or management are beside the point. Simply put, bankruptcy trustees do not have access to an \"innocent successor\" exception as a way of shielding themselves from the operation of an in pari delicto defense. <i>See R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 356-57; <i>see also Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee's next attempt to elude the toils of the in pari delicto doctrine involves the well-recognized adverse interest exception. Generally, a wrongdoer's fraudulent acts will not be imputed to a corporation when the wrongdoer is acting contrary to the corporation's present interests. <i>See, e.g., Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 8 (listing looting as a \"classic example\" of adverse conduct); <i>Sunrise Props., Inc. v. Bacon, Wilson, Ratner, Cohen, Salvage, Fialky &amp; Fitzgerald, P.C.,</i> 425 Mass. 63, 679 N.E.2d 540, 543 (1997) (concluding that \"unauthorized acts [should] not [be] imputed to the principal when the agent has acted fraudulently toward the principal\"). Endeavoring to squeeze within these narrow confines, the trustee contends that L &amp; H's scurrilous conduct is tantamount to looting because L &amp; H convinced Old Dictaphone to surrender its assets for worthless paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is ill-conceived, for the trustee's sights are trained on the wrong entity. Accepting the allegations of the amended complaint as true, L &amp; H's actions were adverse to Old Dictaphone and its shareholders&#8212;but they were not adverse to New Dictaphone (a corporate shell which, in effect, was in league with the defrauder and as a result received something for nothing). Since we already have determined that New Dictaphone, not Old Dictaphone, is the focal point of the imputation inquiry, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), the adverse interest exception does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee has yet another string to his bow. He argues that even if New Dictaphone is the proper focal point of an in pari delicto analysis, the adverse interest exception precludes us from imputing L &amp; H's fraud to its subsidiary because New Dictaphone was \"entirely indifferent\" about whether Old Dictaphone received fair value for its assets or whether L &amp; H used skulduggery to effect the acquisition. Appellant's Reply Br. at 19. We find this argument unpersuasive. In our view, mere indifference is insufficient to show adversity. The adverse interest exception applies only to those whom the fraud has disadvantaged. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 282(1) (explaining that the exception attaches only when an agent secretly acts <i>adversely</i> to his principal). In this instance, the allegations of the amended complaint make manifest that New Dictaphone <i>benefitted</i> from the fraud: it was the surviving entity in a merger that netted it over $900,000,000. New Dictaphone, as a beneficiary of L &amp; H's chicanery at the time the fraud was consummated,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> cannot rely on the adverse interest exception to avoid imputation. After all, a party cannot accept the avails of fraudulent conduct without also bearing responsibility for that conduct. <i>See Tremont Trust Co. v. Noyes,</i> 246 Mass. 197, 141 N.E. 93, 98 (1923).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize succinctly, L &amp; H was the main player in the alleged fraud and its parlous behavior must be imputed lock, stock, and barrel to its offspring (New Dictaphone). It follows inexorably that New Dictaphone, in contemplation of law, bears at least as much responsibility for the asserted wrongdoing as any of the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Hence, the moving defendants have satisfied the first requirement for establishing an in pari delicto defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move next to the second requirement. As said, this prong implicates public policy concerns. The trustee contends that allowing the defendants to hide behind the in pari delicto doctrine would frustrate the purpose of the securities laws because it would allow participants in a fraudulent scheme to shield themselves from liability. This contention is wide of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have pointed out, the trustee is not bringing claims on behalf of an innocent target of the fraud but, rather, on behalf of a complicit party. Viewed in that light, the trustee's policy concerns ring hollow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1155 (finding public policy exception inapplicable in analogous circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also asserts that withholding application of the in pari delicto doctrine would promote the goal of \"discourag[ing] wrongdoers from engaging in future fraudulent schemes and violations of the securities laws.\" Appellant's Br. at 38. That resupinate reasoning turns reality on its head. To permit the trustee to proceed in these circumstances would be equivalent to giving New Dictaphone a second bite at the cherry, allowing it first to reap the benefits of the fraud and then to attack the defrauders. The securities laws were enacted to protect investors from deceptive practices, <i>see Pinter,</i> 486 U.S. at 638, 108 S.Ct. 2063, not to give the intended beneficiaries of deceptive practices a back-door means of ensuring a profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trustee strives to persuade us that we should repel the defendants' in pari delicto defense because, in the absence of that defense, the creditors of Old Dictaphone ultimately would receive the fruits of any recovery. We find this argument unconvincing; despite the interposition of the in pari delicto defense, the creditors remain free to proceed in their own right, untainted by New Dictaphone's role in the alleged wrongdoing. <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1151; <i>Terlecky,</i> 133 F.3d at 380; <i>Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This arrangement is especially preferable because the Trust beneficiaries may well include parties (most notably L &amp; H) who were themselves complicit in the underlying fraud. If we were to suspend the operation of the in pari delicto defense in this case, creditors with unclean hands would profit equally with innocents. If, however, each creditor must proceed by individual suit, the righteous may recover while the tainted, unable to circumvent the in pari delicto bar, will be hoist by their own petard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the trustee insisted that the alternative of direct suits by creditors is illusory because creditors lack contractual privity with the investment bankers, lawyers, and accountants who comprise the trustee's targets. Thus, the argument runs, if we afford these targets the safe haven of an in pari delicto doctrine, creditors will be completely foreclosed from accessing those pockets that are deep enough to compensate them at anything higher than pennies on the dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This jeremiad is unavailing. Even assuming that the trustee's premise is true&#8212; and we have some doubt about its validity&#8212;the equities are not nearly so clear-cut. First, the creditors (or the trustee, on their behalf) may well succeed in suits against Old Dictaphone's former directors, controlling shareholder, and outside accounting professionals. See <i>supra</i> note 1. Second&#8212;and more important&#8212;our holding today breaks no new ground. As such, the potential for default under these circumstances is something about which creditors had notice&#8212;something that should have been priced into their decisions to extend credit. Equity does not require courts to provide a belt when creditors had fair warning that they ought to have purchased suspenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we conclude that uncontroverted facts sufficient to establish the in pari delicto defense are definitively ascertainable from the amended complaint and other allowable sources of information. These include L &amp; H's creation of New Dictaphone for the express purpose of effectuating the fraud-inspired merger and its exercise of complete control over New Dictaphone until the fraud was consummated. In these circumstances, L &amp; H's conduct must be imputed to New Dictaphone. Consequently, New Dictaphone shares the culpability of the fraud's progenitor and, as such, bears as much or more responsibility for the wrongdoing as any of the named defendants. In the absence of any compelling public policy reason to allow New Dictaphone to seek damages from those that assisted in executing the fraudulent scheme&#8212;and the trustee has identified none&#8212;the in pari delicto doctrine precludes New Dictaphone (and, hence, the trustee) from advancing the type of claims that are at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Even so, license to apply a uniquely federal test is not tantamount to mandating such a test. Mindful that two of our sister circuits recently have opted for state-law tests of imputation in connection with federal claims, <i>see Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1149; <i>R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 358, and that no party to this litigation has requested us to fashion federal common law, we use Massachusetts jurisprudence as the yardstick for measuring imputation across the board.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Because the adverse interest exception turns on how the alleged wrongdoing affected the immediate interests of the party who seeks its shelter, New Dictaphone's subsequent implosion is of no moment<i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 7; <i>accord Beck v.

That suggestion is faulty. When deciding whether to recognize an in pari delicto defense, an inquiring court must consider whether the party alleging injury (here, the trustee, who stands in the shoes of New Dictaphone) bears substantially equal (or greater) responsibility as the party or parties asserting the defense (here, the defendants)<i>See Bateman Eichler,</i> 472 U.S. at 306, 105 S.Ct. 2622 (emphasizing the relative culpability of the \"[defending] party\" as compared to the plaintiff (alteration in original)).

In the underlying series of events, a corporate shark, using fraudulent means, induced an allegedly innocent target corporation to enter into an ill-advised merger. After both the shark and the merged entity drowned in red ink, plaintiff-appellant Alan Nisselson (the trustee), appointed by the bankruptcy court to prosecute any causes of action that the merged entity might possess, attempted to mount various claims arising out of the innocent target's legal rights. Those rights, of course, were twice removed from the damages that formed the basis of the suit: they were passed along once to the surviving corporation (at the time of the merger) and again to the trustee (during the bankruptcy proceedings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emphasizing this genealogy, the district court dismissed the action on two grounds; it determined that the trustee lacked standing to pursue the claims and that, in all events, the rascality of the shark was as a matter of law imputed to the surviving entity in the merger (and that, therefore, the hoary in pari delicto doctrine barred the suit). <i>See Nisselson v. Lernout,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3953998</span></span>, at *3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

Lernout &amp; Hauspie, N.V. (L &amp; H), a Belgian corporation that ran its United States operations from headquarters in Massachusetts, was itself an international leader in various speech and language sectors. In hopes of swallowing up its competitor, L &amp; H began courting Old Dictaphone; it described in glowing terms its financial stability and the profitable synergies that a merger could generate. Negotiations ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Old Dictaphone conducted extensive due diligence investigations into L &amp; H's fiscal health. During the course of that review, L &amp; H's senior officers, investment bankers, attorneys, and auditors touted its financial prowess. Against this rose-colored backdrop, Old Dictaphone agreed to a stock-for-stock merger. The parties memorialized the terms in a merger agreement dated March 7, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merger took place less than two months thereafter: L &amp; H acquired all the outstanding stock of Old Dictaphone in exchange for approximately 9,400,000 shares of L &amp; H common stock. Based on the trading price of L &amp; H stock at the time of the closing, the exchange corresponded to a merger price of roughly $930,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part and parcel of the transaction, Old Dictaphone merged into Dark Acquisition Corp. (Dark), a wholly-owned subsidiary of L &amp; H created under Delaware law for the express purpose of effectuating the merger. L &amp; H's chief executive officer, defendant-appellee Gaston Bastiaens, doubled in brass as Dark's chief executive and lone director. He also signed the merger agreement on its behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the merger agreement, Dark inherited Old Dictaphone's assets (including any existing legal claims) and assumed Old Dictaphone's liabilities. This arrangement corresponded to the dictates of Delaware law. <i>See</i> Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 259(a). Dark survived the merger and Old Dictaphone ceased to exist. Dark then changed its name to Dictaphone Corporation (New Dictaphone).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The honeymoon was brief. Shortly after the merger had been consummated, L &amp; H announced that the financial picture it had painted and displayed was not an accurate portrayal. As matters turned out, nearly two-thirds of L &amp; H's reported revenue from 1998 through mid-2000 had been improperly recorded, so that an apparent $70,000,000 net profit for that period was in fact a net loss of a similar magnitude. The price of L &amp; H shares plummeted and, on November 29, 2000, L &amp; H and New Dictaphone filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fast-forward to New Dictaphone's approved plan of reorganization. As part of that plan, the corporation conveyed its interest in any claims arising out of the merger to the Dictaphone Litigation Trust (the Trust). That assignment galvanized this suit: acting on behalf of the Trust, the trustee filed a civil action in federal district court seeking damages to compensate for the \"loss or diminution of [Old Dictaphone's] value as a going concern.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee's amended complaint characterizes the gross misstatments of earnings as the mainspring of a fraudulent scheme designed to inflate the value of L &amp; H's stock. As the trustee envisions it, this scheme, which played out over a four-year period, was concocted and executed by the defendants in this case (who include the officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, and auditors of L &amp; H, and divers entities related to them). The fallout from it rendered worthless the consideration that Old Dictaphone and its shareholders received (assumption of Old Dictaphone's debt and shares of L &amp; H stock).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his amended complaint, the trustee asserts federal securities and racketeering claims, <i>see</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78t(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c); 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5, as well as supplemental state-law claims for fraud, unfair trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy. The theory underlying each and all of these initiatives is that L &amp; H, through its senior management, knowingly engaged in a scheme to classify research and development expenditures as fictional revenue in order to inflate the value of the company's stock. Then, knowing that they were selling a lie, L &amp; H's hierarchs flaunted the company's ever-increasing stock price and used its apocryphal earnings to persuade Old Dictaphone and its shareholders to enter into a stock-for-stock merger. L &amp; H relied on its investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, and related entities to substantiate its false claims; those parties, the trustee contends, knew that L &amp; H was spinning a yarn, yet assisted it in perpetrating the fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Various defendants, led by SG Cowen (an investment banking house), filed motions to dismiss. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). All of these motions argued, in relevant part, that the trustee lacked standing and that his claims were barred under the in pari delicto doctrine. Some of the motions advanced additional grounds for dismissing particular claims. The trustee vigorously opposed the motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court granted Cowen's motion and dismissed the trustee's federal claims against Cowen with prejudice. <i>See Nisselson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3953998</span></span>, at *3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">28655</span></span>, at *20-21. The court rested its decision on two alternative grounds. First, it concluded that the in pari delicto doctrine barred the claims because the trustee had inherited them from New Dictaphone, an entity itself implicated in the alleged fraud. <i>See id.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3953998</span></span>, at *3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">28655</span></span>, at *12-15. Second, interpreting and applying the Delaware standard for distinguishing direct and derivative claims, it concluded that the trustee lacked standing because the claims asserted belonged to Old Dictaphone's former shareholders, not to Old Dictaphone itself. <i>See id.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3953998</span></span>, at *3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

The determination of who may maintain an otherwise cognizable claim turns on a question of prudential standing, not one of Article III standing. <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 5; <i>see also Ram&#237;rez,</i> 438 F.3d at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That frees our hands: <i>Steel Co.'s</i> ban on hypothetical jurisdiction extends only to issues involving Article III jurisdiction and, hence, Article III standing.

It does not make a difference that some of the trustee's claims are premised on state law. Those claims invoke the law of Massachusetts&#8212;and the Massachusetts courts, like the federal courts, have warmly embraced the in pari delicto defense. <i>See, e.g., Council v.

Over time, however, courts expanded the doctrine's sweep, deploying it as a basis for dismissing suits whenever a plaintiff had played any role&#8212;no matter how modest&#8212;in the harm-producing activity. <i>See Bateman Eichler,</i> 472 U.S. at 307, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111470\"><a href=\"/opinion/111470/bateman-eichler-hill-richards-inc-v-berner/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Deploring this overly commodious construction, the Supreme Court later reined in the doctrine and returned it to its classic contours. <i>See Pinter v.

This retrenchment, which governs here, restricts the application of the in pari delicto doctrine to those situations in which (i) the plaintiff, as compared to the defendant, bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the wrong he seeks to redress and (ii) preclusion of the suit would not interfere with the purposes of the underlying law or otherwise contravene the public interest. <i>See Bateman Eichler,</i> 472 U.S. at 311, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111470\"><a href=\"/opinion/111470/bateman-eichler-hill-richards-inc-v-berner/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is because the analysis ordinarily will be the same across a spectrum of different causes of action. <i>See Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors v. R.F.

The trustee's answer to this query is straightforward. Because his claims originate with Old Dictaphone, he asseverates that this indisputably innocent party is the relevant entity for purposes of the comparison required by the binary in pari delicto test. Since Old Dictaphone was the victim rather than a perpetrator of the alleged fraud, the trustee's thesis runs, it bears less responsibility than any of the defendants and, therefore, the defendants fail to satisfy the first precondition for use of the in pari delicto defense. On that basis, the trustee claims an entitlement to recover for the injury that Old Dictaphone suffered when it was duped into proceeding with the merger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume, for argument's sake, that Old Dictaphone would have been a proper party to sue for the asserted injury. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Even so, the trustee's reasoning is flawed; his analysis entirely overlooks that, pursuant to both the merger agreement and the governing law, <i>see</i> Del.Code Ann. tit. 8, &#167; 259(a), upon the consummation of the merger Old Dictaphone vanished into thin air and New Dictaphone inherited all of Old Dictaphone's choses in action. Under the approved plan of reorganization incident to New Dictaphone's bankruptcy, those litigation rights were passed along once more&#8212;this time to the Trust (and, thus, to the trustee). <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1). Because the lineage of the trustee's claims passes directly through New Dictaphone, any right that the trustee may have to assert those claims derives directly from New Dictaphone. This chain of descent means that the trustee&#8212;despite his protestations to the contrary&#8212;is not acting in the place and stead of Old Dictaphone but, rather, in the place and stead of New Dictaphone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This genealogy is important. Giving effect to it, the trustee may assert only those claims that New Dictaphone could have asserted prior to seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court. <i>See Mediators, Inc. v. Manney (In re Mediators, Inc.),</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></span>, 826 (2d Cir. 1997); <i>see also</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541. After all, a trustee in bankruptcy cannot and does not acquire rights or interests superior to, or greater than, those possessed by the debtor. <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1150; 5 Collier on Bankruptcy &#167; 541.04 (15th ed. 2006) (noting that \"nothing in section 541 [of the Bankruptcy Code, defining property of the estate] can revest a debtor with property lost prepetition\" and describing property of the estate as including \"causes of action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the line of descent delineated by operation of the corporation and bankruptcy laws, we think that the in pari delicto defense must be available to a defendant in an action by a bankruptcy trustee whenever that defense would have been available in an action by the debtor. <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1152; <i>see also Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 7 (assessing the debtor's culpability to determine whether the in pari delicto doctrine barred a bankruptcy trustee's claims). As a necessary corollary of that proposition, there is no \"innocent successor\" exception available to a bankruptcy trustee in a case in which the defendant successfully could have mounted an in pari delicto defense against the debtor. <i>See R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 356-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The explication of these principles suffices to answer the threshold question here. Consistent with both precedent and analytic rigor, we hold that New Dictaphone is the relevant comparator vis-&#225;-vis the defendants for the purpose of determining the viability of the latter's in pari delicto defense. Old Dictaphone's innocence is irrelevant to that inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Applying the Paradigm.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that New Dictaphone is the entity of interest for purposes of the required comparison, we move to the question of what actions can, at this stage of the proceedings, be imputed to it (and, thus, to the trustee). <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 7. In an effort to mount a preemptive strike, the trustee posits that because all imputation inquiries entail fact-specific determinations, an in pari delicto defense that relies on imputed conduct cannot be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss.

The trustee himself has observed that in pari delicto cases often result in imputation of fraudulent conduct to a corporation when those responsible for the scheme are \"the sole decision-maker[s] for such entity, exercising complete control over its management.\" Appellant's Br. at 43 n. 21. This observation accurately reflects the case law. <i>See, e.g., Coopers &amp; Lybrand,</i> 322 F.3d at 164-65 (imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor when complaint established that its controlling shareholders \"dominat[ed] and controll[ed] the corporation\" and were responsible for \"orchestrat[ing] the fraudulent conduct\"); <i>R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 359-60 (imputing fraudulent conduct to debtor corporation and dismissing trustee's case on in pari delicto grounds where the individuals masterminding the fraud were the debtor's sole shareholders); <i>Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 14-16 (dismissing trustee's action on in pari delicto grounds when debtor corporation was formed by the defrauders for the express purpose of carrying out the fraudulent plan). Since New Dictaphone, not Old Dictaphone, is the proper focal point of our imputation inquiry, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), this case fits snugly within that integument. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the amended complaint leaves no doubt but that L &amp; H played the primary role in contriving the scheme to acquire Old Dictaphone under false pretenses. The amended complaint also establishes that L &amp; H created New Dictaphone (n&#233;e Dark) for the express purpose of furthering this artifice. L &amp; H's control over New Dictaphone during the course of the scheme is indisputable. In addition to owning all of New Dictaphone's stock, L &amp; H installed its president, Bastiaens, as New Dictaphone's chief executive officer and sole director. Bastiaens, in turn, ensured New Dictaphone's complicity in the fraud's climactic event when he executed the merger agreement on its behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These uncontroverted facts are telling. Because the amended complaint shows beyond hope of contradiction that L &amp; H created and controlled New Dictaphone in order to perpetrate the harm-producing fraud, we have no principled choice but to impute its conduct to New Dictaphone for the purpose of applying the in pari delicto paradigm. <i>See Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 15; <i>Demoulas,</i> 703 N.E.2d at 1172; <i>My Bread Baking,</i> 233 N.E.2d at 751.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee tries to find sanctuary by pointing out that, <i>after</i> the merger, the directors of Old Dictaphone (presumably innocent) became directors of New Dictaphone. This datum does not alter our conclusion. The first prong of the in pari delicto inquiry focuses on \"the unlawful activity that is the subject of the suit.\" <i>Pinter,</i> 486 U.S. at 636, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112098\"><a href=\"/opinion/112098/pinter-v-dahl/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2063</span></a></span>. Accordingly, a party's culpability vel non must be based on its status at the time the alleged illegality occurred. <i>See Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 10 (finding no Massachusetts case law supporting a theory that in pari delicto is in any way modified when \"prior management was at fault but the claim [is] asserted on behalf of creditors or shareholders\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, of course, the fraud that underpins the trustee's claims was complete at the moment the companies merged. Therefore, any post-merger changes in New Dictaphone's corporate governance or management are beside the point. Simply put, bankruptcy trustees do not have access to an \"innocent successor\" exception as a way of shielding themselves from the operation of an in pari delicto defense. <i>See R.F. Lafferty,</i> 267 F.3d at 356-57; <i>see also Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee's next attempt to elude the toils of the in pari delicto doctrine involves the well-recognized adverse interest exception. Generally, a wrongdoer's fraudulent acts will not be imputed to a corporation when the wrongdoer is acting contrary to the corporation's present interests. <i>See, e.g., Baena,</i> 453 F.3d at 8 (listing looting as a \"classic example\" of adverse conduct); <i>Sunrise Props., Inc. v. Bacon, Wilson, Ratner, Cohen, Salvage, Fialky &amp; Fitzgerald, P.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></span>, 543 (1997) (concluding that \"unauthorized acts [should] not [be] imputed to the principal when the agent has acted fraudulently toward the principal\"). Endeavoring to squeeze within these narrow confines, the trustee contends that L &amp; H's scurrilous conduct is tantamount to looting because L &amp; H convinced Old Dictaphone to surrender its assets for worthless paper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is ill-conceived, for the trustee's sights are trained on the wrong entity. Accepting the allegations of the amended complaint as true, L &amp; H's actions were adverse to Old Dictaphone and its shareholders&#8212;but they were not adverse to New Dictaphone (a corporate shell which, in effect, was in league with the defrauder and as a result received something for nothing). Since we already have determined that New Dictaphone, not Old Dictaphone, is the focal point of the imputation inquiry, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), the adverse interest exception does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee has yet another string to his bow. He argues that even if New Dictaphone is the proper focal point of an in pari delicto analysis, the adverse interest exception precludes us from imputing L &amp; H's fraud to its subsidiary because New Dictaphone was \"entirely indifferent\" about whether Old Dictaphone received fair value for its assets or whether L &amp; H used skulduggery to effect the acquisition. Appellant's Reply Br. at 19. We find this argument unpersuasive. In our view, mere indifference is insufficient to show adversity. The adverse interest exception applies only to those whom the fraud has disadvantaged. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 282(1) (explaining that the exception attaches only when an agent secretly acts <i>adversely</i> to his principal). In this instance, the allegations of the amended complaint make manifest that New Dictaphone <i>benefitted</i> from the fraud: it was the surviving entity in a merger that netted it over $900,000,000. New Dictaphone, as a beneficiary of L &amp; H's chicanery at the time the fraud was consummated,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> cannot rely on the adverse interest exception to avoid imputation. After all, a party cannot accept the avails of fraudulent conduct without also bearing responsibility for that conduct. <i>See Tremont Trust Co. v. Noyes,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span>, 98 (1923).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize succinctly, L &amp; H was the main player in the alleged fraud and its parlous behavior must be imputed lock, stock, and barrel to its offspring (New Dictaphone). It follows inexorably that New Dictaphone, in contemplation of law, bears at least as much responsibility for the asserted wrongdoing as any of the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Hence, the moving defendants have satisfied the first requirement for establishing an in pari delicto defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move next to the second requirement. As said, this prong implicates public policy concerns. The trustee contends that allowing the defendants to hide behind the in pari delicto doctrine would frustrate the purpose of the securities laws because it would allow participants in a fraudulent scheme to shield themselves from liability. This contention is wide of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have pointed out, the trustee is not bringing claims on behalf of an innocent target of the fraud but, rather, on behalf of a complicit party. Viewed in that light, the trustee's policy concerns ring hollow.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1155 (finding public policy exception inapplicable in analogous circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also asserts that withholding application of the in pari delicto doctrine would promote the goal of \"discourag[ing] wrongdoers from engaging in future fraudulent schemes and violations of the securities laws.\" Appellant's Br. at 38. That resupinate reasoning turns reality on its head. To permit the trustee to proceed in these circumstances would be equivalent to giving New Dictaphone a second bite at the cherry, allowing it first to reap the benefits of the fraud and then to attack the defrauders. The securities laws were enacted to protect investors from deceptive practices, <i>see Pinter,</i> 486 U.S. at 638, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112098\"><a href=\"/opinion/112098/pinter-v-dahl/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2063</span></a></span>, not to give the intended beneficiaries of deceptive practices a back-door means of ensuring a profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trustee strives to persuade us that we should repel the defendants' in pari delicto defense because, in the absence of that defense, the creditors of Old Dictaphone ultimately would receive the fruits of any recovery. We find this argument unconvincing; despite the interposition of the in pari delicto defense, the creditors remain free to proceed in their own right, untainted by New Dictaphone's role in the alleged wrongdoing. <i>See Edwards,</i> 437 F.3d at 1151; <i>Terlecky,</i> 133 F.3d at 380; <i>Merrill Lynch,</i> 324 B.R. at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This arrangement is especially preferable because the Trust beneficiaries may well include parties (most notably L &amp; H) who were themselves complicit in the underlying fraud. If we were to suspend the operation of the in pari delicto defense in this case, creditors with unclean hands would profit equally with innocents. If, however, each creditor must proceed by individual suit, the righteous may recover while the tainted, unable to circumvent the in pari delicto bar, will be hoist by their own petard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the trustee insisted that the alternative of direct suits by creditors is illusory because creditors lack contractual privity with the investment bankers, lawyers, and accountants who comprise the trustee's targets. Thus, the argument runs, if we afford these targets the safe haven of an in pari delicto doctrine, creditors will be completely foreclosed from accessing those pockets that are deep enough to compensate them at anything higher than pennies on the dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This jeremiad is unavailing. Even assuming that the trustee's premise is true&#8212; and we have some doubt about its validity&#8212;the equities are not nearly so clear-cut. First, the creditors (or the trustee, on their behalf) may well succeed in suits against Old Dictaphone's former directors, controlling shareholder, and outside accounting professionals. See <i>supra</i> note 1. Second&#8212;and more important&#8212;our holding today breaks no new ground. As such, the potential for default under these circumstances is something about which creditors had notice&#8212;something that should have been priced into their decisions to extend credit. Equity does not require courts to provide a belt when creditors had fair warning that they ought to have purchased suspenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we conclude that uncontroverted facts sufficient to establish the in pari delicto defense are definitively ascertainable from the amended complaint and other allowable sources of information. These include L &amp; H's creation of New Dictaphone for the express purpose of effectuating the fraud-inspired merger and its exercise of complete control over New Dictaphone until the fraud was consummated. In these circumstances, L &amp; H's conduct must be imputed to New Dictaphone. Consequently, New Dictaphone shares the culpability of the fraud's progenitor and, as such, bears as much or more responsibility for the wrongdoing as any of the named defendants. In the absence of any compelling public policy reason to allow New Dictaphone to seek damages from those that assisted in executing the fraudulent scheme&#8212;and the trustee has identified none&#8212;the in pari delicto doctrine precludes New Dictaphone (and, hence, the trustee) from advancing the type of claims that are at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
