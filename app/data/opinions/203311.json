Fernández González, Assistant United States\nAttorney, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States\nAttorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nThomas K.

In   United     States   v.\n\nAndújar-Arias, 507 F.3d 734 (1st Cir. 2007), a panel of this court\n\nheld   that    sentencing   disparity     attributable   to   the   selective\n\ninauguration of so-called \"fast-track\" programs for the processing\n\nof immigration crimes could not form the basis for a variant\n\nsentence.      Id. at 739.       This appeal requires us to gauge the\n\ncontinued validity of Andújar-Arias in light of the Supreme Court's\n\nsubsequent decisions in Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586\n\n(2007), and Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007).\n\n              After careful evaluation of the effect of those decisions\n\non a sentencing court's discretion, we conclude that they undermine\n\nthe interpretive approach followed in a number of earlier cases in\n\nthis and other circuits, including Andújar-Arias.             In fidelity to\n\nthe Supreme Court's new gloss, we abrogate Andújar-Arias to the\n\nextent that it is inconsistent with this opinion, vacate the\n\nsentence appealed from, and remand for resentencing.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n              We rehearse here only those facts that are necessary to\n\nplace this appeal in perspective.              On April 21, 2006, local\n\nauthorities arrested defendant-appellant Yonathan Rodríguez as he\n\ntried to enter the United States without inspection.                  Shortly\n\nthereafter, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto\n\nRico charged him with attempting illegally to reenter the country\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fafter having been removed following a felony conviction.               See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326(a), (b)(1).\n\n           In due course, the appellant pleaded guilty to the sole\n\ncount of the indictment. The presentence investigation report (PSI\n\nReport) recorded his base offense level at 8, applied a sixteen-\n\nlevel   enhancement      for   a   prior     \"crime   of   violence\"   felony\n\nconviction, USSG §2L1.2(b)(1)(A), and recommended a three-level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility, id. §3E1.1.                   The\n\nappellant had three prior convictions, placing him in criminal\n\nhistory category (CHC) IV.         Assuming an adjusted offense level of\n\n21 and a CHC of IV, the guideline sentencing range (GSR) would have\n\nspanned 57-71 months.\n\n           The appellant objected to the PSI Report, asserting that\n\nhis CHC overrepresented the gravity of his prior offenses. See id.\n\n§ 4A1.3(b)(1).     He also advanced two arguments in favor of a\n\nvariant (i.e., non-guideline) sentence: first, that the nature and\n\ncircumstances of his prior crime of violence conviction (for\n\nassaulting a federal officer some six years earlier) did not\n\nwarrant a sixteen-level enhancement; and second, that the absence\n\nof an early disposition program for immigration offenses in the\n\nDistrict   of   Puerto    Rico     created    an   unacceptable   disparity.\n\nImportantly, he premised this last request for a variant sentence\n\nnot only on 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), but also on section 3553(a)'s\n\noverarching provision and sentencing goals.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            This argument requires a few words of explanation. Early\n\ndisposition programs, also known as fast-track programs, date back\n\nto the mid-1990s. They popped up spontaneously in federal district\n\ncourts along the border between the United States and Mexico as\n\npart of an effort to manage burgeoning immigration caseloads. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Marcial-Santiago, 447 F.3d 715, 718 (9th\n\nCir. 2006).    Typically, prosecutors would use charge-bargaining or\n\nplea-bargaining techniques to hold out the prospect of shorter\n\nsentences    in     return   for   prompt    guilty    pleas   and   waivers    of\n\nappellate rights.       See id.\n\n            Congress placed its imprimatur on this paradigm in 2003,\n\nauthorizing    the    Attorney     General   to   create   early     disposition\n\nprograms on a district-by-district basis throughout the country and\n\ndirecting     the    Sentencing    Commission     to    promulgate     a   policy\n\nstatement allowing downward departures in affected cases.                      See\n\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools To End the Exploitation of\n\nChildren Today (PROTECT) Act, Pub. L. No. 108-21, § 401(m)(2)(B),\n\n117 Stat. 650, 675 (2003).\n\n            Following the passage of the PROTECT Act, the Attorney\n\nGeneral established fast-track programs in a handful of judicial\n\ndistricts.    The District of Puerto Rico was not among them.\n\n            Seizing upon this selectivity, the appellant argued below\n\nthat the absence of an early disposition program in the District of\n\nPuerto Rico resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity.                    He\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fembellished this argument with a claim that, in some districts that\n\nlacked formal fast-track programs, prosecutors engaged in rogue\n\ncharge-bargaining practices for immigration offenses, generating\n\nsimilar disparities.     Given this predicate, the appellant posited,\n\namong other things, that sentencing him within the GSR would be\n\ninconsistent with the overall thrust of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                  In\n\nparticular, he asserted that a guidelines sentence would corrode\n\n\"respect for the law\" and result in a sentence that is \"greater\n\nthan necessary to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing.                 Id. §\n\n3553(a)(2)(A).\n\n            The   district   court   agreed       that   the   appellant's   CHC\n\noverrepresented the seriousness of his past crimes and departed\n\ndownward to a reduced CHC of III.          United States v. Rodríguez, No.\n\n06-1057, 2006 WL 3020040, at *1 (D.P.R. Oct. 19, 2006).                 This, in\n\nturn, shrank the GSR to 46-57 months.             Id.    But the court refused\n\nto grant a sentence below the reconfigured GSR.\n\n            The court's reasons were twofold. First, it analyzed the\n\nrecord of the appellant's assault conviction and found that the\n\nassault    was    sufficiently   serious     to    justify     the   recommended\n\nsixteen-level enhancement.       Id.   Second, it anticipated Andújar-\n\nArias (not yet decided) and refused to inquire into the existence\n\nof a fast-track disparity.       It indicated that it had no authority\n\nto \"disregard the advisory guideline sentencing range on this\n\nground.\"    Id.    To that end, it referred to case law holding that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsuch a disparity was not \"unwarranted\" within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) and stated that, in any event, the absence of\n\na fast-track program in a particular district was \"a battle that\n\nmust be fought with the Attorney General, and not in the courts.\"\n\nId.\n\n           The court proceeded to impose a 46-month incarcerative\n\nsentence — a sentence at the bottom of the reconfigured GSR.   This\n\ntimely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Before us, the appellant mounts both procedural and\n\nsubstantive challenges to his sentence.    Procedurally, he alleges\n\nthat the district court erred in concluding that a sentencing\n\ndisparity attributable to the absence of a fast-track program in\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico could not constitute a permissible\n\nfactor in the complex of factors upon which a variant sentence\n\nmight be premised.   Substantively, he alleges that his sentence is\n\nunreasonable.\n\n           Given a properly calculated GSR,1 we review a sentence\n\nfor abuse of discretion.   Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 591; United States v.\n\nMartin, 520 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2008).      In this endeavor, we\n\nfirst probe for procedural error, including the sentencing court's\n\n\n\n      1\n      In this venue, the appellant does not press any challenge to\nthe construction of the GSR per se. His attack on the sixteen-\nlevel enhancement is limited to that enhancement's effect on the\nsubstantive reasonableness of his sentence.\n\n                                -6-\n\frefusal to consider factors falling within the purview of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a).      Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597; Martin, 520 F.3d at 92.                 If a\n\nsentence is procedurally sound, we then proceed to assess its\n\nsubstantive reasonableness.            Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597; Martin, 520\n\nF.3d at 92.\n\n             In reviewing the appellant's claim of procedural error,\n\nwe   do   not   write   on    a    pristine    page;   a    panel   of   this   court\n\nheretofore has held that disparity resulting from the selective\n\nplacement of fast-track programs is not \"unwarranted\" within the\n\nmeaning    of   section      3553(a)(6)       and   that,   therefore,    any    such\n\ndisparity \"may not be considered by a district judge in sentencing\n\nas a basis for a variance from a Guidelines sentence.\"                     Andújar-\n\nArias, 507 F.3d at 739.           The panel reasoned that by authorizing the\n\ninstitution of fast-track programs in the PROTECT Act, Congress\n\ngave implicit sanction to any disparity that might arise from the\n\ninstitution of such programs in some districts but not in others.\n\nId. at 741-42.\n\n             As a general rule, newly constituted panels in a multi-\n\npanel circuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.\n\nSee Eulitt ex rel. Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Rodríguez, 311 F.3d 435, 438-39\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).        This law of the circuit doctrine is a corollary\n\nof the principle of stare decisis.              It preserves and protects the\n\njudiciary's commitment to finality, stability, and certainty in the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\flaw.     But the law of the circuit doctrine has soft edges; it is\n\n\"neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule.\" Carpenters Local\n\nUnion No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n            In this spirit, courts have recognized that the doctrine\n\nadmits of exceptions.          The most obvious exception applies when the\n\nholding    of    a   previous    panel     is     contradicted      by    controlling\n\nauthority, subsequently announced (say, a decision of the authoring\n\ncourt en banc, a Supreme Court opinion directly on point, or a\n\nlegislative overruling).          See Eulitt, 386 F.3d at 349; Williams v.\n\nAshland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995).                       A second,\n\nless obvious exception, comes into play in \"those relatively rare\n\ninstances in which authority that postdates the original decision,\n\nalthough not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound\n\nreason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh\n\ndevelopments, would change its collective mind.\" Williams, 45 F.3d\n\nat 592.     The situation here possesses elements of both of these\n\nexceptions.\n\n            Shortly     after    this     court    decided       Andújar-Arias,   the\n\nSupreme    Court     decided    Gall    and     Kimbrough.        These    decisions,\n\nannounced on the same day, shed new light on the scope of a\n\nsentencing court's discretion under an advisory guidelines regime.\n\nCollectively, they called into question a number of our earlier\n\ndecisions       by   emphasizing    the    breadth     of    a    district   court's\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fdiscretion   to    deviate       from   a   defendant's      GSR   based   on    the\n\ncompendium of sentencing factors mentioned in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\nSee Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 596-97; Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 570, 575-\n\n76.   Concerned     that    this    new     jurisprudence     might   animate    an\n\nexception to the law of the circuit doctrine and undermine the\n\nrationale for excluding any consideration of fast-track disparity,\n\nwe asked the parties for supplemental briefs.                 After painstaking\n\nstudy, we are now persuaded that the gloss added by the Supreme\n\nCourt militates in favor of a new approach — an approach that\n\nrequires, inter alia, abrogating our holding in Andújar-Arias.                    We\n\nelaborate below.\n\n          In      Gall,    the    Court     affirmed   the    imposition    of    a\n\nprobationary sentence that represented a \"100% downward variance\"\n\nfrom the bottom of the applicable GSR.             128 S. Ct. at 594.       In so\n\nruling, the Justices expounded further on a district court's\n\nauthority to vary from the guidelines, emphasizing that district\n\ncourts have wide latitude in making individualized sentencing\n\ndeterminations.       Id. at 594-98.            Given Kimbrough's particular\n\npertinence to the inquiry at hand, we take some pains to delineate\n\nthe contours of the case.\n\n          In the mid-1980s, Congress enacted a statute that, for\n\ncertain sentencing purposes, \"treated every gram of crack cocaine\n\nas the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine.\"                 Id. at 567; see\n\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-2, -3 (codified\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fin   21     U.S.C.   §    841(b)(1)).      Following   Congress's     lead,   the\n\nSentencing Commission incorporated this 100-to-1 weight-driven\n\nratio into the sentencing guidelines.            See USSG §2D1.1(c) (2006);\n\nsee also Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 567.2          As a result, crack cocaine\n\noffenses yielded sentences \"three to six times longer than those\n\nfor powder [cocaine] offenses involving equal amount of drugs.\"\n\nKimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 566.\n\n              Virtually from the start, this sentencing scheme drew\n\nheavy       fire   for,    among   other    things,    resting   on   unfounded\n\nassumptions about the harmfulness of crack relative to powder\n\ncocaine.       The Sentencing Commission itself concluded that the\n\ndisparity created by the 100-to-1 ratio was unwarranted.                 United\n\nStates Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and\n\nFederal Sentencing Policy 91 (May 2002).                In 1995, it proposed\n\namendments to the sentencing guidelines to replace the 100-to-1\n\nratio with a 1-to-1 ratio.              Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 569.         But\n\nCongress rejected this proffer and has shown no enthusiasm for\n\nsubsequent ameliorative proposals.\n\n              Against this backdrop, a jury convicted Kimbrough on\n\nvarious counts related to the possession and distribution of crack\n\n\n\n        2\n      In 2007, the Sentencing Commission took a small step toward\nameliorating the crack/powder disparity, unilaterally reducing by\ntwo the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack\ncocaine.    See United States Sentencing Commission, Sentencing\nGuidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28558, 28571-72\n(2007); see also Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 569.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fcocaine.         At    sentencing,           the    judge        commented      upon    \"the\n\ndisproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines\n\nhave in sentencing\" and concluded that a sentence within the GSR\n\nwould be \"greater than necessary\" to accomplish the objectives set\n\nout in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).             Id. at 565.       The judge determined that\n\na below-the-range sentence was \"clearly long enough\" to achieve\n\nthose objectives.       Id.\n\n            The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence.                           It took the\n\nposition that a sentence outside the guideline range was per se\n\nunreasonable when premised on a disagreement with the stipulated\n\ncrack/powder ratio.          United States v. Kimbrough, 174 Fed. Appx.\n\n798, 799 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n            On    certiorari        review,         the   question       was    whether   a\n\nsentencing court could ground a variant sentence based on its\n\ndisagreement, as a matter of sentencing policy, with the 100-to-1\n\ncrack/powder      ratio.          The   Supreme       Court       answered     this    query\n\naffirmatively, holding that \"it would not be an abuse of discretion\n\nfor a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular\n\ndefendant   that      the    crack/powder           disparity       yields     a   sentence\n\n'greater    than      necessary'        to    achieve       §    3553(a)'s      purposes.\"\n\nKimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575.                 Speaking more broadly, the Court\n\nindicated   that,      \"as    a    general     matter,          courts   may   vary    [from\n\nGuidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including\n\ndisagreements with the Guidelines.\" Id. at 570 (internal quotation\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\fmarks omitted).    In making this pronouncement, the Court rejected\n\nthe government's contention that Congress had made the lopsided\n\nratio mandatory and \"decline[d] to read any implicit directive into\n\n. . . congressional silence.\"    Id. at 571.\n\n          Having in mind the Court's new approach, we turn to the\n\ncase at hand.     In the first instance, this requires that we mull\n\nthe continued vitality of Andújar-Arias.   Of course, that decision\n\nis, strictly speaking, limited to the question of whether fast-\n\ntrack disparity can be considered by a sentencing court under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).    See Andújar-Arias, 507 F.3d at 738-39.   But\n\nthe appellant in this case has cast a wider net; he argues not only\n\nfor consideration of that datum under section 3553(a)(6) but also\n\nfor its consideration as part of the broader constellation of\n\nfactors covered by section 3553(a).      Because Andújar-Arias can\n\nfairly be interpreted as establishing a bright-line rule, we\n\ndisregard semantics and treat the decision in Andújar-Arias as\n\nstanding in the way of the appellant's argument.\n\n          Several considerations lead us to conclude that, when\n\nviewed through the prism of Kimbrough, the appellant's argument has\n\nmerit.   Although Kimbrough involved the crack/powder ratio, its\n\napproach plainly has wider implications arguably affecting a number\n\nof our earlier cases, including but not limited to, how we have\n\ntreated disparities arising out of the selective institution of\n\nfast-track programs.    As to those programs — other cases not now\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fbefore us are better left for another day — the analogy is\n\ncompelling.3\n\n             Like     the     crack/powder      ratio,        fast-track    departure\n\nauthority has been both blessed by Congress and openly criticized\n\nby   the   Sentencing       Commission.         See   United     States     Sentencing\n\nCommission, Report to the Congress: Downward Departures from the\n\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines 66-67 (2003) (criticizing fast-track\n\nprograms for creating a \"type of geographical disparity\").                         Like\n\nthe crack/powder ratio, the fast-track departure scheme does not\n\n\"exemplify     the     [Sentencing]        Commission's          exercise     of     its\n\ncharacteristic institutional role.\"               Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575.\n\nIn   other   words,     the    Commission       has    \"not    take[n]     account    of\n\nempirical data and national experience\" in formulating them.                         Id.\n\n(citations     omitted).        Thus,    guidelines      and     policy     statements\n\nembodying     these     judgments       deserve       less    deference     than     the\n\nsentencing guidelines normally attract.                 See id.\n\n             Given this pedigree, a sentence that is partially the\n\nproduct of a fast-track departure might or might not \"reflect a\n\nrough approximation of sentences that might achieve § 3553(a)'s\n\nobjectives.\"     Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2465 (2007).\n\n\n\n      3\n      Even before the advent of Kimbrough, several courts\nrecognized a substantial degree of doctrinal affinity between\nvariant sentences involving the crack/powder ratio and those\ninvolving fast-track programs. See, e.g., United States v. Vargas,\n477 F.3d 94, 100 (3d Cir. 2007); United States v. Spears, 469 F.3d\n1166, 1181 (8th Cir. 2006).\n\n                                         -13-\n\fIf raised, the sentencing court will have to answer this question\n\nin a particular case.    And where that answer is favorable to the\n\ndefendant, a variant sentence premised on perceived inequities\n\nattributable to the availability elsewhere of fast-track departures\n\nwould, given the Supreme Court's new gloss, seem to be entitled to\n\ndeference \"even in a mine-run case.\"       Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575.\n\n            Beyond these parallels between the crack/powder ratio and\n\nthe authorization for the selective institution of fast-track\n\nprograms,   emergent   case   law   signals   that,   under   an   advisory\n\nguideline regime, sentencing has become a steadily more open-ended\n\nenterprise.    See, e.g., Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597 (discussing a\n\nsentencing court's superior coign of vantage \"to find facts and\n\njudge their import under § 3553(a)\").         Recent decisions of this\n\ncourt have noted this reality.      See, e.g., Martin, 520 F.3d at 92;\n\nUnited States v. Vega-Santiago, 519 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2008) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n            Building on the foundation laid in United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), Kimbrough lends a new flexibility to\n\nthe scope of the district courts' sentencing authority and, in the\n\nbargain, removes a formidable obstacle to the consideration of\n\nmatters such as fast-track disparity. We refer specifically to the\n\nKimbrough Court's enlargement of a sentencing court's capacity to\n\nfactor into the sentencing calculus its policy disagreements with\n\nthe guidelines.    Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 570.        This makes plain\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthat a sentencing court can deviate from the guidelines based on\n\ngeneral policy considerations.          Id.       In so ruling, the Court\n\neffectively displaced our holding in United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d\n\n53, 62 (1st Cir. 2006), in which we had held that district courts\n\ncould not base sentencing decisions \"on general, across-the-board\"\n\npolicy disagreements with a guideline provision or policy statement\n\n(there, the crack/powder ratio).\n\n           Importantly,    Kimbrough    counsels     a   new   and   different\n\napproach to section 3553(a). Andújar-Arias illustrates this point.\n\nThere, as in some other pre-Kimbrough cases, the court evaluated\n\nonly the isthmian question of whether a particular item (there,\n\nfast-track disparity) could be considered under the aegis of a\n\nspecific provision of section 3553(a) (there, section 3553(a)(6)).\n\nSee Andújar-Arias, 507 F.3d at 736.         But as we explain below, the\n\nKimbrough Court's organic reading of section 3553(a) suggests that\n\na sentencing judge should engage in a more holistic inquiry.\n\n           The Court emphasized that section 3553(a) is more than a\n\nlaundry list of discrete sentencing factors; it is, rather, a\n\ntapestry   of   factors,   through     which      runs   the   thread   of   an\n\noverarching principle.     See Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 570.             That\n\ntenet   (sometimes   referred   to     as   the    \"parsimony    principle\")\n\ninstructs \"district courts to 'impose a sentence sufficient, but\n\nnot greater than necessary' to accomplish the goals of sentencing.\"\n\nId. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)).             This overarching principle\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fnecessarily informs a sentencing court's consideration of the\n\nentire constellation of section 3553(a) factors, including the need\n\nto avoid unwarranted disparity. Similarly, judicial interpretation\n\nof section 3553(a) should be guided by the broadly worded \"goals of\n\nsentencing\" spelled out in section 3553(a)(2), to which Kimbrough\n\npays homage.   Id.\n\n          In the final analysis, then, the gloss supplied by\n\nKimbrough signifies that a district court should not evaluate a\n\nrequest for a variant sentence piecemeal, examining each section\n\n3553(a) factor in isolation, but should instead consider all the\n\nrelevant factors as a group and strive to construct a sentence that\n\nis minimally sufficient to achieve the broad goals of sentencing.\n\nThis inquiry should be guided by, but not made unflinchingly\n\nsubservient to, the concerns expressed in the statute's various\n\nsub-parts.\n\n          Seen in light of the Supreme Court's neoteric teachings,\n\na narrow focus on a particular factor in isolation, such as a\n\nsingle-minded fixation on whether fast-track disparity can fit\n\nwithin the confines of section 3553(a)(6), seems too cramped. After\n\nall, each sub-part enumerates \"only one of several factors that must\n\nbe weighed and balanced by the sentencing judge.\"   United States v.\n\nFernandez, 443 F.3d 19, 32 (2d Cir. 2006).   So, whether or not the\n\ndisparity of which the appellant complains is the type of disparity\n\nto which section 3553(a)(6) is addressed,      Kimbrough, properly\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fapplied, teaches that a sentencing court should not rebuff such a\n\ncomplaint out of hand.\n\n           That does not mean that the court should swallow such an\n\nallegation hook, line, and sinker, nor does it mean that it is\n\nforeclosed from determining that any disparity, when viewed through\n\nthe prism of section 3553(a), is insufficient to warrant a non-\n\nguideline sentence.      It does mean, however, that when confronted\n\nwith an allegation of fast-track disparity, the court should at that\n\npoint undertake a further inquiry.         For example, it should probe\n\nwhether and to what extent a relevant disparity exists at all and\n\nthen, if it finds one, engage in a comprehensive evaluation of\n\nwhether this and other items in the constellation of section 3553(a)\n\nfactors, viewed as a whole, cast doubt on the suitability of a\n\nwithin-the-range sentence.        In the course of this assessment, the\n\ncourt would have to ask whether such a sentence, if imposed, would\n\nencourage \"respect for the law,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A); \"provide\n\njust punishment for the offense,\" id.; and \"afford adequate,\" but\n\nnot excessive, deterrence, id. § 3553(a)(2)(B).          Ultimately, the\n\ncourt (depending on how it views the case) could ground a variant\n\nsentence   in   the   parsimony    principle   rather   than   in   section\n\n3553(a)(6) alone.     See Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575; see also Vega-\n\nSantiago, 519 F.3d at 4 (recognizing, post-Kimbrough, that a variant\n\nsentence may be constructed \"based on a complex of factors whose\n\ninterplay and precise weight cannot even be precisely described\");\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fUnited States v. Verkhoglyad, 516 F.3d 122, 131 (2d Cir. 2008)\n\n(stating, post-Kimbrough, that no particular 3553(a) sentencing\n\nfactor should be given \"determinative or dispositive weight\")\n\n(quoting Fernandez, 443 F.3d at 32).\n\n            This result is consistent with our post-Kimbrough case law\n\nsuggesting that even if a specific sentencing rationale cannot be\n\nconsidered under the aegis of a particular sub-part of section\n\n3553(a), such a proscription does not bar consideration of that\n\nfactor in the course of a more holistic review of the full panoply\n\nof section 3553(a) factors.         See, e.g., Martin, 520 F.3d at 94\n\n(indicating    that   section    3553(a)(6)'s     instruction    to   consider\n\n\"unwarranted sentencing disparities\" was not intended to encompass\n\ndisparate     coconspirator     sentences   but    that   such   disparities\n\nnonetheless could be considered under the totality of the section\n\n3553(a) sub-parts).\n\n            For these reasons, we conclude that consideration of fast-\n\ntrack disparity is not categorically barred as a sentence-evaluating\n\ndatum within the overall ambit of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                 To the\n\nextent necessary to effectuate this holding, we abrogate our earlier\n\nopinion in Andújar-Arias.\n\n            The government labors mightily to stave off this holding.\n\nIts most loudly bruited claim is that, in contradistinction to the\n\nlegislative actions at issue in Kimbrough, the PROTECT Act contains\n\nan unequivocal congressional mandate that bans consideration of any\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fdisparity arising from the selective implementation of fast-track\n\nprograms. This argument finds support in the Fifth Circuit's recent\n\nopinion in United States v. Gomez-Herrera, ___ F.3d ___ (5th Cir.\n\n2008) [2008 WL 886091], in which the court, on materially identical\n\nfacts, determined that Kimbrough did not alter prior case law\n\nrestricting a sentencing court's authority to include fast-track\n\ndisparity in the sentencing mix. Id. at ___ [2008 WL 886091, at *2-\n\n8].\n\n          We      reject    the    government's      importunings     and   in     the\n\nprocess, respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by the\n\nGomez-Herrera panel.         While the Kimbrough Court acknowledged that\n\na sentencing court can be constrained by express congressional\n\ndirectives, such as statutory mandatory maximum and minimum prison\n\nterms, 128 S. Ct. at 571-72, the PROTECT Act — as the Fifth Circuit\n\nwould have to concede — contains no such express imperative.                       The\n\nAct, by its terms, neither forbids nor discourages the use of a\n\nparticular   sentencing          rationale,    and   it   says   nothing    about    a\n\ndistrict court's discretion to deviate from the guidelines based on\n\nfast-track disparity.        The statute simply authorizes the Sentencing\n\nCommission   to    issue     a    policy   statement      and,   in   the   wake    of\n\nKimbrough, such a directive, whether or not suggestive, is \"not\n\ndecisive as to what may constitute a permissible ground for a\n\nvariant sentence.\"         Martin, 520 F.3d at 93.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f           By the same token, the PROTECT Act's authorization for the\n\nselective deployment of fast-track programs bears scant resemblance\n\nto a congressional directive instituting statutory minimum and\n\nmaximum sentences. Although the latter directive necessarily cabins\n\na sentencing court's discretion, the former authorization says\n\nnothing about the court's capacity to craft a variant sentence\n\nwithin the maximum and minimum limits.\n\n           Refined to bare essence, the government is urging us to\n\nread into the PROTECT Act an implicit restriction on a district\n\ncourt's sentencing discretion.         But that can be done, as Gomez-\n\nHerrera   illustrates,   only   by    heavy   reliance    on   inference   and\n\nimplication about congressional intent — a practice that runs\n\ndirectly contrary to the Court's newly glossed approach.                   See\n\nKimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 570-74 (declining, despite Congress's\n\nimplicit acquiescence in, or even its endorsement of, the 100-to-1\n\ncrack/powder ratio, to treat that ratio as beyond the reach of\n\nsection 3553(a)). In refusing to read a bar on policy disagreements\n\ninto   either   Congress's   original       formulation   of   the   100-to-1\n\ncrack/powder ratio in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act or its later rejection\n\nof the Sentencing Commission's attempted softening of the ratio, id.\n\nat 570-73, Kimbrough made pellucid that when Congress exercises its\n\npower to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing\n\nrationale, it does so by the use of unequivocal terminology.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f            Our decision in Martin hammers home this point.       There,\n\nthe district court deviated dramatically downward from the GSR\n\napplicable to a career criminal and sentenced him within the range\n\nthat would have obtained had he not been a recidivist.      Martin, 520\n\nF. 3d at 96. The government appealed, arguing that the variance was\n\ninsupportable because Congress had indicated its desire \"that the\n\nguidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near\n\nthe maximum term authorized\" for recidivist offenders.        28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 994(h).    We rejected the argument, concluding that Kimbrough had\n\nopened the door for sentencing courts to deviate from the guidelines\n\nin individual cases notwithstanding Congress's competing policy\n\npronouncements.     Martin, 520 F.3d at 96.\n\n            Another example of this phenomenon is our recent decision\n\nin United States v. Politano, 522 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2008).        In that\n\npost-Kimbrough case, we concluded that community characteristics\n\ncould be factored into the sentencing calculus, notwithstanding\n\nCongress's    and   the   Sentencing   Commission's   expressed   policy\n\npreferences to the contrary.       Id. at 73-74.      In so holding, we\n\njettisoned a pre-Kimbrough decision of this court.        See id. at 73\n\n(effectively overriding United States v. Aguilar-Pena, 887 F.2d 347,\n\n352 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n            If these holdings are to be given more than mere lip\n\nservice, they must mean that absent an unambiguous congressional\n\ndirective barring sentencing courts from considering disparity\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fcreated by the district-by-district implementation of fast-track\n\nprograms,   a   sentencing   court    can   include   that   datum   in   its\n\nsentencing calculus, as long as the court grounds its rationale in\n\nthe complex of factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n            In a last-ditch effort to persuade us to bar consideration\n\nof fast-track disparity, the government thunders that upholding\n\nvariant sentences premised in whole or in part on this ground will\n\nbe tantamount to \"a judicial attempt to exercise prosecutorial\n\ndiscretion\" — an action that supposedly would impinge upon Executive\n\nBranch authority and, thus, violate separation-of-powers principles.\n\nThis tirade elevates hope over reason.\n\n            While the decision to institute a fast-track program in\n\na particular judicial district is the Attorney General's, the\n\nultimate authority to grant a fast-track departure lies with the\n\nsentencing court. See USSG §5K3.1. The appellant is not requesting\n\nthat this court direct prosecutors to institute a fast-track program\n\nin the District of Puerto Rico or to offer him a fast-track plea.\n\nRather, the appellant asks that we gauge the impact of disparate\n\nsentencing practices in crafting his sentence.         Because this is an\n\nunquestionably judicial function, we discern no separation of powers\n\nconcerns here.\n\n            Finally, the government argues that even if fast-track\n\ndisparity ordinarily can be considered in sentencing, the appellant\n\nis outside the universe of defendants who might be advantaged by\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fsuch a proposition.         This is so, the government asseverates,\n\ninasmuch as the appellant is not similarly situated to other\n\ndefendants charged with immigration crimes; after all, he filed\n\npretrial motions and did not waive his right to appeal.       But the\n\ngovernment is trying to have it both ways.      Lacking the benefit of\n\nthe bargain inherent in fast-track programs, a defendant cannot be\n\nexpected to renounce his right to mount a defense.4        Cf. United\n\nStates v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"Having one's\n\ncake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We conclude that the district court, acting without the\n\nbenefit of the watershed decision in Kimbrough, committed procedural\n\nerror in refusing to consider the appellant's argument that he\n\nshould receive a variant sentence because of the disparity incident\n\nto the lack of a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico.\n\nKimbrough makes manifest that sentencing courts possess sufficient\n\ndiscretion under section 3553(a) to consider requests for variant\n\nsentences premised on disagreements with the manner in which the\n\nsentencing guidelines operate.\n\n\n       4\n      The government also claims that the appellant's prior felony\nconvictions might disqualify him from the fast-track program in\nsome districts. See, e.g., United States v. Duran, 399 F. Supp. 2d\n543, 547 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). But this goes to the substance of the\nappellant's argument — a matter that the district court did not\nreach. In all events, the criteria for fast-track programs vary\nfrom district to district, and the government has not suggested\nthat the appellant would be categorically foreclosed from receiving\nfast-track benefits.\n\n                                   -23-\n\f          We add a note of caution.        Our holding today is carefully\n\ncircumscribed; although sentencing courts can consider items such\n\nas fast-track disparity, they are not obligated to deviate from the\n\nguidelines based on those items.            Cf. Martin, 520 F.3d at 91\n\n(explaining that the mere \"fact that a sentencing court possesses\n\nthe raw power to deviate from the guidelines does not mean that it\n\ncan (or should) do so casually\").        By the same token, the district\n\ncourt can make its own independent determination as to whether or\n\nnot a sentence tainted by the alleged disparity is nonetheless\n\nconsistent   with   the   centrifugal    pull   of   the   constellation   of\n\n3553(a) factors.\n\n          We need go no further.        For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.5     In so doing, we take no view anent\n\nthe sentence that should be imposed here — which, conceivably, could\n\nbe higher, lower, or the same as the sentence appealed from. In the\n\nfirst instance, the length of the term is up to the district court,\n\nwhich must formulate a plausible sentencing rationale and reach a\n\ndefensible result.    See id.; United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n     5\n      Because we vacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing,\nwe need not reach any of the appellant's alternative arguments.\n\n                                  -24-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We rehearse here only those facts that are necessary to place this appeal in perspective. On April 21, 2006, local authorities arrested defendant-appellant Yonathan Rodríguez as he tried to enter the United States without inspection. Shortly thereafter, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico charged him with attempting illegally to reenter the country after having been removed following a felony conviction. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), (b)(1).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> In due course, the appellant pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment. The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) recorded his base offense level at 8, applied a sixteen-level enhancement for a prior \"crime of violence\" felony conviction, USSG § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), and recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>id.</i> § 3E1.1. The appellant had three prior convictions, placing him in criminal history category (CHC) IV. Assuming an adjusted offense level of 21 and a CHC of IV, the guideline sentencing range (GSR) would have spanned 57-71 months.</p>\n<p>The appellant objected to the PSI Report, asserting that his CHC overrepresented the gravity of his prior offenses. <i>See id.</i> § 4A1.3(b)(1). He also advanced two arguments in favor of a variant (i.e., non-guideline) sentence: first, that the nature and circumstances of his prior crime of violence conviction (for assaulting a federal officer some six years earlier) did not warrant a sixteen-level enhancement; and second, that the absence of an early disposition program for immigration offenses in the District of Puerto Rico created an unacceptable disparity. Importantly, he premised this last request for a variant sentence not only on 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), but also on section 3553(a)'s overarching provision and sentencing goals.</p>\n<p>This argument requires a few words of explanation. Early disposition programs, also known as fast-track programs, date back to the mid-1990s. They popped up spontaneously in federal district courts along the border between the United States and Mexico as part of an effort to manage burgeoning immigration caseloads. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Marcial-Santiago,</i> 447 F.3d 715, 718 (9th Cir.2006). Typically, prosecutors would use charge-bargaining or plea-bargaining techniques to hold out the prospect of shorter sentences in return for prompt guilty pleas and waivers of appellate rights. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Congress placed its imprimatur on this paradigm in 2003, authorizing the Attorney General to create early disposition programs on a district-by-district basis throughout the country and directing the Sentencing Commission to promulgate a policy statement allowing downward departures in affected cases. <i>See</i> Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools To End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, § 401(m)(2)(B), 117 Stat. 650, 675 (2003).</p>\n<p>Following the passage of the PROTECT Act, the Attorney General established fast-track programs in a handful of judicial districts. The District of Puerto Rico was not among them.</p>\n<p>Seizing upon this selectivity, the appellant argued below that the absence of an early disposition program in the District of Puerto Rico resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity. He embellished this argument with a claim that, in some districts that lacked formal fast-track programs, prosecutors engaged in rogue charge-bargaining practices for immigration offenses, generating similar disparities. Given this predicate, the appellant posited, among other things, that sentencing him within the GSR would be inconsistent with the overall thrust of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In particular, he asserted that a guidelines sentence would corrode \"respect for the law\" and result in a sentence that is \"greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing. <i>Id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>The district court agreed that the appellant's CHC overrepresented the seriousness of his past crimes and departed downward to a reduced CHC of III. <i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> No. 06-1057, 2006 WL 3020040, at *1 (D.P.R. Oct.19, 2006). This, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> in turn, shrank the GSR to 46-57 months. <i>Id.</i> But the court refused to grant a sentence below the reconfigured GSR.</p>\n<p>The court's reasons were twofold. First, it analyzed the record of the appellant's assault conviction and found that the assault was sufficiently serious to justify the recommended sixteen-level enhancement. <i>Id.</i> Second, it anticipated <i>Andújar-Arias</i> (not yet decided) and refused to inquire into the existence of a fast-track disparity. It indicated that it had no authority to \"disregard the advisory guideline sentencing range on this ground.\" <i>Id.</i> To that end, it referred to case law holding that such a disparity was not \"unwarranted\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) and stated that, in any event, the absence of a fast-track program in a particular district was \"a battle that must be fought with the Attorney General, and not in the courts.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court proceeded to impose a 46-month incarcerative sentence  a sentence at the bottom of the reconfigured GSR. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Before us, the appellant mounts both procedural and substantive challenges to his sentence. Procedurally, he alleges that the district court erred in concluding that a sentencing disparity attributable to the absence of a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico could not constitute a permissible factor in the complex of factors upon which a variant sentence might be premised. Substantively, he alleges that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Given a properly calculated GSR,<sup>[1]</sup> we review a sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 591; <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.2008). In this endeavor, we first probe for procedural error, including the sentencing court's refusal to consider factors falling within the purview of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597; <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92. If a sentence is procedurally sound, we then proceed to assess its substantive reasonableness. <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597; <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the appellant's claim of procedural error, we do not write on a pristine page; a panel of this court heretofore has held that disparity resulting from the selective placement of fast-track programs is not \"unwarranted\" within the meaning of section 3553(a)(6) and that, therefore, any such disparity \"may not be considered by a district judge in sentencing as a basis for a variance from a Guidelines sentence.\" <i>Andújar-Arias,</i> 507 F.3d at 739. The panel reasoned that by authorizing the institution of fast-track programs in the PROTECT Act, Congress gave implicit sanction to any disparity that might arise from the institution of such programs in some districts but not in others. <i>Id.</i> at 741-42.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point. <i>See </i><i>Eulitt ex rel. Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002). This law of the circuit doctrine is a corollary of the principle of stare decisis. It preserves and protects the judiciary's commitment to finality, stability, and certainty in the law. But the law of the circuit doctrine has soft edges; it is \"neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule.\" <i>Carpenters Local</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> <i>Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>In this spirit, courts have recognized that the doctrine admits of exceptions. The most obvious exception applies when the holding of a previous panel is contradicted by controlling authority, subsequently announced (say, a decision of the authoring court en banc, a Supreme Court opinion directly on point, or a legislative overruling). <i>See </i><i>Eulitt,</i> 386 F.3d at 349; <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995). A second, less obvious exception, comes into play in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Williams,</i> 45 F.3d at 592. The situation here possesses elements of both of these exceptions.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this court decided <i>Andújar-Arias,</i> the Supreme Court decided <i>Gall</i> and <i>Kimbrough.</i> These decisions, announced on the same day, shed new light on the scope of a sentencing court's discretion under an advisory guidelines regime. Collectively, they called into question a number of our earlier decisions by emphasizing the breadth of a district court's discretion to deviate from a defendant's GSR based on the compendium of sentencing factors mentioned in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596-97; <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570, 575-76. Concerned that this new jurisprudence might animate an exception to the law of the circuit doctrine and undermine the rationale for excluding any consideration of fast-track disparity, we asked the parties for supplemental briefs. After painstaking study, we are now persuaded that the gloss added by the Supreme Court militates in favor of a new approach  an approach that requires, inter alia, abrogating our holding in <i>Andújar-Arias.</i> We elaborate below.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gall,</i> the Court affirmed the imposition of a probationary sentence that represented a \"100% downward variance\" from the bottom of the applicable GSR. 128 S.Ct. at 594. In so ruling, the Justices expounded further on a district court's authority to vary from the guidelines, emphasizing that district courts have wide latitude in making individualized sentencing determinations. <i>Id.</i> at 594-98. Given <i>Kimbrough</i>'s particular pertinence to the inquiry at hand, we take some pains to delineate the contours of the case.</p>\n<p>In the mid-1980s, Congress enacted a statute that, for certain sentencing purposes, \"treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 567; <i>see</i> Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-2, -3 (codified in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)). Following Congress's lead, the Sentencing Commission incorporated this 100-to-1 weight-driven ratio into the sentencing guidelines. <i>See</i> USSG § 2D1.1(c) (2006); <i>see also </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 567.<sup>[2]</sup> As a result, crack cocaine offenses yielded sentences \"three to six times longer than those for powder [cocaine] offenses involving equal amount of drugs.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 566.</p>\n<p>Virtually from the start, this sentencing scheme drew heavy fire for, among other things, resting on unfounded assumptions about the harmfulness of crack relative to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> powder cocaine. The Sentencing Commission itself concluded that the disparity created by the 100-to-1 ratio was unwarranted. United States Sentencing Commission, <i>Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy</i> 91 (May 2002). In 1995, it proposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines to replace the 100-to-1 ratio with a 1-to-1 ratio. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 569. But Congress rejected this proffer and has shown no enthusiasm for subsequent ameliorative proposals.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, a jury convicted Kimbrough on various counts related to the possession and distribution of crack cocaine. At sentencing, the judge commented upon \"the disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing\" and concluded that a sentence within the GSR would be \"greater than necessary\" to accomplish the objectives set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). <i>Id.</i> at 565. The judge determined that a below-the-range sentence was \"clearly long enough\" to achieve those objectives. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence. It took the position that a sentence outside the guideline range was per se unreasonable when premised on a disagreement with the stipulated crack/powder ratio. <i>United States v. Kimbrough,</i> 174 Fed.Appx. 798, 799 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>On certiorari review, the question was whether a sentencing court could ground a variant sentence based on its disagreement, as a matter of sentencing policy, with the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio. The Supreme Court answered this query affirmatively, holding that \"it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence `greater than necessary' to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575. Speaking more broadly, the Court indicated that, \"as a general matter, courts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> at 570 (internal quotation marks omitted). In making this pronouncement, the Court rejected the government's contention that Congress had made the lopsided ratio mandatory and \"decline[d] to read any implicit directive into . . . congressional silence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 571.</p>\n<p>Having in mind the Court's new approach, we turn to the case at hand. In the first instance, this requires that we mull the continued vitality of <i>Andújar-Arias.</i> Of course, that decision is, strictly speaking, limited to the question of whether fast-track disparity can be considered by a sentencing court under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). <i>See </i><i>Andújar-Arias,</i> 507 F.3d at 738-39. But the appellant in this case has cast a wider net; he argues not only for consideration of that datum under section 3553(a)(6) but also for its consideration as part of the broader constellation of factors covered by section 3553(a). Because <i>Andújar-Arias</i> can fairly be interpreted as establishing a bright-line rule, we disregard semantics and treat the decision in <i>Andújar-Arias</i> as standing in the way of the appellant's argument.</p>\n<p>Several considerations lead us to conclude that, when viewed through the prism of <i>Kimbrough,</i> the appellant's argument has merit. Although <i>Kimbrough</i> involved the crack/powder ratio, its approach plainly has wider implications arguably affecting a number of our earlier cases, including but not limited to, how we have treated disparities arising out of the selective institution of fast-track programs. As to those programs  other cases not now before us are better left for another day  the analogy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> is compelling.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Like the crack/powder ratio, fast-track departure authority has been both blessed by Congress and openly criticized by the Sentencing Commission. <i>See</i> United States Sentencing Commission, <i>Report to the Congress: Downward Departures from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines</i> 66-67 (2003) (criticizing fast-track programs for creating a \"type of geographical disparity\"). Like the crack/powder ratio, the fast-track departure scheme does not \"exemplify the [Sentencing] Commission's exercise of its characteristic institutional role.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575. In other words, the Commission has \"not take[n] account of empirical data and national experience\" in formulating them. <i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Thus, guidelines and policy statements embodying these judgments deserve less deference than the sentencing guidelines normally attract. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Given this pedigree, a sentence that is partially the product of a fast-track departure might or might not \"reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve § 3553(a)'s objectives.\" <i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). If raised, the sentencing court will have to answer this question in a particular case. And where that answer is favorable to the defendant, a variant sentence premised on perceived inequities attributable to the availability elsewhere of fast-track departures would, given the Supreme Court's new gloss, seem to be entitled to deference \"even in a mine-run case.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p>Beyond these parallels between the crack/powder ratio and the authorization for the selective institution of fast-track programs, emergent case law signals that, under an advisory guideline regime, sentencing has become a steadily more open-ended enterprise. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597 (discussing a sentencing court's superior coign of vantage \"to find facts and judge their import under § 3553(a)\"). Recent decisions of this court have noted this reality. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92; <i>United States v. Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Building on the foundation laid in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <i>Kimbrough</i> lends a new flexibility to the scope of the district courts' sentencing authority and, in the bargain, removes a formidable obstacle to the consideration of matters such as fast-track disparity. We refer specifically to the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court's enlargement of a sentencing court's capacity to factor into the sentencing calculus its policy disagreements with the guidelines. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570. This makes plain that a sentencing court can deviate from the guidelines based on general policy considerations. <i>Id.</i> In so ruling, the Court effectively displaced our holding in <i>United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir.2006), in which we had held that district courts could not base sentencing decisions \"on general, across-the-board\" policy disagreements with a guideline provision or policy statement (there, the crack/powder ratio).</p>\n<p>Importantly, <i>Kimbrough</i> counsels a new and different approach to section 3553(a). <i>Andújar-Arias</i> illustrates this point. There, as in some other pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> cases, the court evaluated only the isthmian <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> question of whether a particular item (there, fast-track disparity) could be considered under the aegis of a specific provision of section 3553(a) (there, section 3553(a)(6)). <i>See </i><i>Andújar-Arias,</i> 507 F.3d at 736. But as we explain below, the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court's organic reading of section 3553(a) suggests that a sentencing judge should engage in a more holistic inquiry.</p>\n<p>The Court emphasized that section 3553(a) is more than a laundry list of discrete sentencing factors; it is, rather, a tapestry of factors, through which runs the thread of an overarching principle. <i>See </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570. That tenet (sometimes referred to as the \"parsimony principle\") instructs \"district courts to `impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary' to accomplish the goals of sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)). This overarching principle necessarily informs a sentencing court's consideration of the entire constellation of section 3553(a) factors, including the need to avoid unwarranted disparity. Similarly, judicial interpretation of section 3553(a) should be guided by the broadly worded \"goals of sentencing\" spelled out in section 3553(a)(2), to which <i>Kimbrough</i> pays homage. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In the final analysis, then, the gloss supplied by <i>Kimbrough</i> signifies that a district court should not evaluate a request for a variant sentence piecemeal, examining each section 3553(a) factor in isolation, but should instead consider all the relevant factors as a group and strive to construct a sentence that is minimally sufficient to achieve the broad goals of sentencing. This inquiry should be guided by, but not made unflinchingly subservient to, the concerns expressed in the statute's various sub-parts.</p>\n<p>Seen in light of the Supreme Court's neoteric teachings, a narrow focus on a particular factor in isolation, such as a single-minded fixation on whether fast-track disparity can fit within the confines of section 3553(a)(6), seems too cramped. After all, each sub-part enumerates \"only one of several factors that must be weighed and balanced by the sentencing judge.\" <i>United States v. Fernandez,</i> 443 F.3d 19, 32 (2d Cir.2006). So, whether or not the disparity of which the appellant complains is the type of disparity to which section 3553(a)(6) is addressed, <i>Kimbrough,</i> properly applied, teaches that a sentencing court should not rebuff such a complaint out of hand.</p>\n<p>That does not mean that the court should swallow such an allegation hook, line, and sinker, nor does it mean that it is foreclosed from determining that any disparity, when viewed through the prism of section 3553(a), is insufficient to warrant a non-guideline sentence. It does mean, however, that when confronted with an allegation of fast-track disparity, the court should at that point undertake a further inquiry. For example, it should probe whether and to what extent a relevant disparity exists at all and then, if it finds one, engage in a comprehensive evaluation of whether this and other items in the constellation of section 3553(a) factors, viewed as a whole, cast doubt on the suitability of a within-the-range sentence. In the course of this assessment, the court would have to ask whether such a sentence, if imposed, would encourage \"respect for the law,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A); \"provide just punishment for the offense,\" <i>id.;</i> and \"afford adequate,\" but not excessive, deterrence, <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(B). Ultimately, the court (depending on how it views the case) could ground a variant sentence in the parsimony principle rather than in section 3553(a)(6) alone. <i>See </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575; <i>see also </i><i>Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> F.3d at 4 (recognizing, post-<i>Kimbrough,</i> that a variant sentence may be constructed \"based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight cannot even be precisely described\"); <i>United States v. Verkhoglyad,</i> 516 F.3d 122, 131 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating, post-<i>Kimbrough,</i> that no particular 3553(a) sentencing factor should be given \"determinative or dispositive weight\") (quoting <i>Fernandez,</i> 443 F.3d at 32).</p>\n<p>This result is consistent with our post-<i>Kimbrough</i> case law suggesting that even if a specific sentencing rationale cannot be considered under the aegis of a particular sub-part of section 3553(a), such a proscription does not bar consideration of that factor in the course of a more holistic review of the full panoply of section 3553(a) factors. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 94 (indicating that section 3553(a)(6)'s instruction to consider \"unwarranted sentencing disparities\" was not intended to encompass disparate coconspirator sentences but that such disparities nonetheless could be considered under the totality of the section 3553(a) sub-parts).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that consideration of fast-track disparity is not categorically barred as a sentence-evaluating datum within the overall ambit of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). To the extent necessary to effectuate this holding, we abrogate our earlier opinion in <i>Andújar-Arias.</i></p>\n<p>The government labors mightily to stave off this holding. Its most loudly bruited claim is that, in contradistinction to the legislative actions at issue in <i>Kimbrough,</i> the PROTECT Act contains an unequivocal congressional mandate that bans consideration of any disparity arising from the selective implementation of fast-track programs. This argument finds support in the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in <i>United States v. Gomez-Herrera,</i> 523 F.3d 554 (5th Cir.2008), in which the court, on materially identical facts, determined that <i>Kimbrough</i> did not alter prior case law restricting a sentencing court's authority to include fast-track disparity in the sentencing mix. <i>Id.</i> at 557-564.</p>\n<p>We reject the government's importunings and in the process, respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by the <i>Gomez-Herrera</i> panel. While the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court acknowledged that a sentencing court can be constrained by express congressional directives, such as statutory mandatory maximum and minimum prison terms, 128 S.Ct. at 571-72, the PROTECT Act  as the Fifth Circuit would have to concede  contains no such express imperative. The Act, by its terms, neither forbids nor discourages the use of a particular sentencing rationale, and it says nothing about a district court's discretion to deviate from the guidelines based on fast-track disparity. The statute simply authorizes the Sentencing Commission to issue a policy statement and, in the wake of <i>Kimbrough,</i> such a directive, whether or not suggestive, is \"not decisive as to what may constitute a permissible ground for a variant sentence.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 93.</p>\n<p>By the same token, the PROTECT Act's authorization for the selective deployment of fast-track programs bears scant resemblance to a congressional directive instituting statutory minimum and maximum sentences. Although the latter directive necessarily cabins a sentencing court's discretion, the former authorization says nothing about the court's capacity to craft a variant sentence within the maximum and minimum limits.</p>\n<p>Refined to bare essence, the government is urging us to read into the PROTECT Act an implicit restriction on a district court's sentencing discretion. But that can be done, as <i>Gomez-Herrera</i> illustrates, only by heavy reliance on inference and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> implication about congressional intent  a practice that runs directly contrary to the Court's newly glossed approach. <i>See </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570-74 (declining, despite Congress's implicit acquiescence in, or even its endorsement of, the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio, to treat that ratio as beyond the reach of section 3553(a)). In refusing to read a bar on policy disagreements into either Congress's original formulation of the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act or its later rejection of the Sentencing Commission's attempted softening of the ratio, <i>id.</i> at 570-73, <i>Kimbrough</i> made pellucid that when Congress exercises its power to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing rationale, it does so by the use of unequivocal terminology.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Martin</i> hammers home this point. There, the district court deviated dramatically downward from the GSR applicable to a career criminal and sentenced him within the range that would have obtained had he not been a recidivist. <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96. The government appealed, arguing that the variance was insupportable because Congress had indicated its desire \"that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized\" for recidivist offenders. 28 U.S.C. § 994(h). We rejected the argument, concluding that <i>Kimbrough</i> had opened the door for sentencing courts to deviate from the guidelines in individual cases notwithstanding Congress's competing policy pronouncements. <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96.</p>\n<p>Another example of this phenomenon is our recent decision in <i>United States v. Politano,</i> 522 F.3d 69 (1st Cir.2008). In that post-<i>Kimbrough</i> case, we concluded that community characteristics could be factored into the sentencing calculus, notwithstanding Congress's and the Sentencing Commission's expressed policy preferences to the contrary. <i>Id.</i> at 73-74. In so holding, we jettisoned a pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> decision of this court. <i>See id.</i> at 73 (effectively overriding <i>United States v. Aguilar-Pena,</i> 887 F.2d 347, 352 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>If these holdings are to be given more than mere lip service, they must mean that absent an unambiguous congressional directive barring sentencing courts from considering disparity created by the district-by-district implementation of fast-track programs, a sentencing court can include that datum in its sentencing calculus, as long as the court grounds its rationale in the complex of factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to persuade us to bar consideration of fast-track disparity, the government thunders that upholding variant sentences premised in whole or in part on this ground will be tantamount to \"a judicial attempt to exercise prosecutorial discretion\"  an action that supposedly would impinge upon Executive Branch authority and, thus, violate separation-of-powers principles. This tirade elevates hope over reason.</p>\n<p>While the decision to institute a fast-track program in a particular judicial district is the Attorney General's, the ultimate authority to grant a fast-track departure lies with the sentencing court. <i>See</i> USSG § 5K3.1. The appellant is not requesting that this court direct prosecutors to institute a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico or to offer him a fast-track plea. Rather, the appellant asks that we gauge the impact of disparate sentencing practices in crafting his sentence. Because this is an unquestionably judicial function, we discern no separation of powers concerns here.</p>\n<p>Finally, the government argues that even if fast-track disparity ordinarily can be considered in sentencing, the appellant is outside the universe of defendants who might be advantaged by such a proposition. This is so, the government asseverates, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> inasmuch as the appellant is not similarly situated to other defendants charged with immigration crimes; after all, he filed pretrial motions and did not waive his right to appeal. But the government is trying to have it both ways. Lacking the benefit of the bargain inherent in fast-track programs, a defendant cannot be expected to renounce his right to mount a defense.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Tierney,</i> 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Having one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We conclude that the district court, acting without the benefit of the watershed decision in <i>Kimbrough,</i> committed procedural error in refusing to consider the appellant's argument that he should receive a variant sentence because of the disparity incident to the lack of a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico. <i>Kimbrough</i> makes manifest that sentencing courts possess sufficient discretion under section 3553(a) to consider requests for variant sentences premised on disagreements with the manner in which the sentencing guidelines operate.</p>\n<p>We add a note of caution. Our holding today is carefully circumscribed; although sentencing courts can consider items such as fast-track disparity, they are not obligated to deviate from the guidelines based on those items. <i>Cf. </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 91 (explaining that the mere \"fact that a sentencing court possesses the raw power to deviate from the guidelines does not mean that it can (or should) do so casually\"). By the same token, the district court can make its own independent determination as to whether or not a sentence tainted by the alleged disparity is nonetheless consistent with the centrifugal pull of the constellation of 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<sup>[5]</sup> In so doing, we take no view anent the sentence that should be imposed here-which, conceivably, could be higher, lower, or the same as the sentence appealed from. In the first instance, the length of the term is up to the district court, which must formulate a plausible sentencing rationale and reach a defensible result. <i>See id.; </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In this venue, the appellant does not press any challenge to the construction of the GSR per se. His attack on the sixteen-level enhancement is limited to that enhancement's effect on the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p>[2]  In 2007, the Sentencing Commission took a small step toward ameliorating the crack/powder disparity, unilaterally reducing by two the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine. <i>See</i> United States Sentencing Commission, <i>Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts,</i> 72 Fed. Reg. 28558, 28571-72 (2007); <i>see also </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 569.</p>\n<p>[3]  Even before the advent of <i>Kimbrough,</i> several courts recognized a substantial degree of doctrinal affinity between variant sentences involving the crack/powder ratio and those involving fast-track programs. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vargas,</i> 477 F.3d 94, 100 (3d Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Spears,</i> 469 F.3d 1166, 1181 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[4]  The government also claims that the appellant's prior felony convictions might disqualify him from the fast-track program in some districts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Duran,</i> 399 F.Supp.2d 543, 547 (S.D.N.Y.2005). But this goes to the substance of the appellant's argument  a matter that the district court did not reach. In all events, the criteria for fast-track programs vary from district to district, and the government has not suggested that the appellant would be categorically foreclosed from receiving fast-track benefits.</p>\n<p>[5]  Because we vacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing, we need not reach any of the appellant's alternative arguments.</p>\n\n</div>",

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We rehearse here only those facts that are necessary to place this appeal in perspective. On April 21, 2006, local authorities arrested defendant-appellant Yonathan Rodríguez as he tried to enter the United States without inspection. Shortly thereafter, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico charged him with attempting illegally to reenter the country after having been removed following a felony conviction. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), (b)(1).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> In due course, the appellant pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment. The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) recorded his base offense level at 8, applied a sixteen-level enhancement for a prior \"crime of violence\" felony conviction, USSG § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), and recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>id.</i> § 3E1.1. The appellant had three prior convictions, placing him in criminal history category (CHC) IV. Assuming an adjusted offense level of 21 and a CHC of IV, the guideline sentencing range (GSR) would have spanned 57-71 months.</p>\n<p>The appellant objected to the PSI Report, asserting that his CHC overrepresented the gravity of his prior offenses. <i>See id.</i> § 4A1.3(b)(1). He also advanced two arguments in favor of a variant (i.e., non-guideline) sentence: first, that the nature and circumstances of his prior crime of violence conviction (for assaulting a federal officer some six years earlier) did not warrant a sixteen-level enhancement; and second, that the absence of an early disposition program for immigration offenses in the District of Puerto Rico created an unacceptable disparity. Importantly, he premised this last request for a variant sentence not only on 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), but also on section 3553(a)'s overarching provision and sentencing goals.</p>\n<p>This argument requires a few words of explanation. Early disposition programs, also known as fast-track programs, date back to the mid-1990s. They popped up spontaneously in federal district courts along the border between the United States and Mexico as part of an effort to manage burgeoning immigration caseloads. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Marcial-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794292\"><a href=\"/opinion/794292/united-states-v-jose-merced-marcial-santiago-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 718 (9th Cir.2006). Typically, prosecutors would use charge-bargaining or plea-bargaining techniques to hold out the prospect of shorter sentences in return for prompt guilty pleas and waivers of appellate rights. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Congress placed its imprimatur on this paradigm in 2003, authorizing the Attorney General to create early disposition programs on a district-by-district basis throughout the country and directing the Sentencing Commission to promulgate a policy statement allowing downward departures in affected cases. <i>See</i> Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools To End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, § 401(m)(2)(B), 117 Stat. 650, 675 (2003).</p>\n<p>Following the passage of the PROTECT Act, the Attorney General established fast-track programs in a handful of judicial districts. The District of Puerto Rico was not among them.</p>\n<p>Seizing upon this selectivity, the appellant argued below that the absence of an early disposition program in the District of Puerto Rico resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity. He embellished this argument with a claim that, in some districts that lacked formal fast-track programs, prosecutors engaged in rogue charge-bargaining practices for immigration offenses, generating similar disparities. Given this predicate, the appellant posited, among other things, that sentencing him within the GSR would be inconsistent with the overall thrust of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In particular, he asserted that a guidelines sentence would corrode \"respect for the law\" and result in a sentence that is \"greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\" of sentencing. <i>Id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>The district court agreed that the appellant's CHC overrepresented the seriousness of his past crimes and departed downward to a reduced CHC of III. <i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> No. 06-1057, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3020040</span></span>, at *1 (D.P.R. Oct.19, 2006). This, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> in turn, shrank the GSR to 46-57 months. <i>Id.</i> But the court refused to grant a sentence below the reconfigured GSR.</p>\n<p>The court's reasons were twofold. First, it analyzed the record of the appellant's assault conviction and found that the assault was sufficiently serious to justify the recommended sixteen-level enhancement. <i>Id.</i> Second, it anticipated <i>Andújar-Arias</i> (not yet decided) and refused to inquire into the existence of a fast-track disparity. It indicated that it had no authority to \"disregard the advisory guideline sentencing range on this ground.\" <i>Id.</i> To that end, it referred to case law holding that such a disparity was not \"unwarranted\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) and stated that, in any event, the absence of a fast-track program in a particular district was \"a battle that must be fought with the Attorney General, and not in the courts.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court proceeded to impose a 46-month incarcerative sentence  a sentence at the bottom of the reconfigured GSR. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Before us, the appellant mounts both procedural and substantive challenges to his sentence. Procedurally, he alleges that the district court erred in concluding that a sentencing disparity attributable to the absence of a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico could not constitute a permissible factor in the complex of factors upon which a variant sentence might be premised. Substantively, he alleges that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Given a properly calculated GSR,<sup>[1]</sup> we review a sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 591; <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2008). In this endeavor, we first probe for procedural error, including the sentencing court's refusal to consider factors falling within the purview of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597; <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92. If a sentence is procedurally sound, we then proceed to assess its substantive reasonableness. <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597; <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the appellant's claim of procedural error, we do not write on a pristine page; a panel of this court heretofore has held that disparity resulting from the selective placement of fast-track programs is not \"unwarranted\" within the meaning of section 3553(a)(6) and that, therefore, any such disparity \"may not be considered by a district judge in sentencing as a basis for a variance from a Guidelines sentence.\" <i>Andújar-Arias,</i> 507 F.3d at 739. The panel reasoned that by authorizing the institution of fast-track programs in the PROTECT Act, Congress gave implicit sanction to any disparity that might arise from the institution of such programs in some districts but not in others. <i>Id.</i> at 741-42.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point. <i>See </i><i>Eulitt ex rel. Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201301\"><a href=\"/opinion/201301/eulitt-v-me-dept-of-edu/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002). This law of the circuit doctrine is a corollary of the principle of stare decisis. It preserves and protects the judiciary's commitment to finality, stability, and certainty in the law. But the law of the circuit doctrine has soft edges; it is \"neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule.\" <i>Carpenters Local</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*225</span> <i>Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198969\"><a href=\"/opinion/198969/ma-carpenters-coll-v-us-fidelity-guar/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>In this spirit, courts have recognized that the doctrine admits of exceptions. The most obvious exception applies when the holding of a previous panel is contradicted by controlling authority, subsequently announced (say, a decision of the authoring court en banc, a Supreme Court opinion directly on point, or a legislative overruling). <i>See </i><i>Eulitt,</i> 386 F.3d at 349; <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir.1995). A second, less obvious exception, comes into play in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Williams,</i> 45 F.3d at 592. The situation here possesses elements of both of these exceptions.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this court decided <i>Andújar-Arias,</i> the Supreme Court decided <i>Gall</i> and <i>Kimbrough.</i> These decisions, announced on the same day, shed new light on the scope of a sentencing court's discretion under an advisory guidelines regime. Collectively, they called into question a number of our earlier decisions by emphasizing the breadth of a district court's discretion to deviate from a defendant's GSR based on the compendium of sentencing factors mentioned in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596-97; <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570, 575-76. Concerned that this new jurisprudence might animate an exception to the law of the circuit doctrine and undermine the rationale for excluding any consideration of fast-track disparity, we asked the parties for supplemental briefs. After painstaking study, we are now persuaded that the gloss added by the Supreme Court militates in favor of a new approach  an approach that requires, inter alia, abrogating our holding in <i>Andújar-Arias.</i> We elaborate below.</p>\n<p>In <i>Gall,</i> the Court affirmed the imposition of a probationary sentence that represented a \"100% downward variance\" from the bottom of the applicable GSR. 128 S.Ct. at 594. In so ruling, the Justices expounded further on a district court's authority to vary from the guidelines, emphasizing that district courts have wide latitude in making individualized sentencing determinations. <i>Id.</i> at 594-98. Given <i>Kimbrough</i>'s particular pertinence to the inquiry at hand, we take some pains to delineate the contours of the case.</p>\n<p>In the mid-1980s, Congress enacted a statute that, for certain sentencing purposes, \"treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 567; <i>see</i> Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-2, -3 (codified in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)). Following Congress's lead, the Sentencing Commission incorporated this 100-to-1 weight-driven ratio into the sentencing guidelines. <i>See</i> USSG § 2D1.1(c) (2006); <i>see also </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 567.<sup>[2]</sup> As a result, crack cocaine offenses yielded sentences \"three to six times longer than those for powder [cocaine] offenses involving equal amount of drugs.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 566.</p>\n<p>Virtually from the start, this sentencing scheme drew heavy fire for, among other things, resting on unfounded assumptions about the harmfulness of crack relative to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*226</span> powder cocaine. The Sentencing Commission itself concluded that the disparity created by the 100-to-1 ratio was unwarranted. United States Sentencing Commission, <i>Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy</i> 91 (May 2002). In 1995, it proposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines to replace the 100-to-1 ratio with a 1-to-1 ratio. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 569. But Congress rejected this proffer and has shown no enthusiasm for subsequent ameliorative proposals.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, a jury convicted Kimbrough on various counts related to the possession and distribution of crack cocaine. At sentencing, the judge commented upon \"the disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing\" and concluded that a sentence within the GSR would be \"greater than necessary\" to accomplish the objectives set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). <i>Id.</i> at 565. The judge determined that a below-the-range sentence was \"clearly long enough\" to achieve those objectives. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence. It took the position that a sentence outside the guideline range was per se unreasonable when premised on a disagreement with the stipulated crack/powder ratio. <i>United States v. Kimbrough,</i> 174 Fed.Appx. 798, 799 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>On certiorari review, the question was whether a sentencing court could ground a variant sentence based on its disagreement, as a matter of sentencing policy, with the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio. The Supreme Court answered this query affirmatively, holding that \"it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence `greater than necessary' to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575. Speaking more broadly, the Court indicated that, \"as a general matter, courts may vary [from Guidelines ranges] based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> at 570 (internal quotation marks omitted). In making this pronouncement, the Court rejected the government's contention that Congress had made the lopsided ratio mandatory and \"decline[d] to read any implicit directive into . . . congressional silence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 571.</p>\n<p>Having in mind the Court's new approach, we turn to the case at hand. In the first instance, this requires that we mull the continued vitality of <i>Andújar-Arias.</i> Of course, that decision is, strictly speaking, limited to the question of whether fast-track disparity can be considered by a sentencing court under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). <i>See </i><i>Andújar-Arias,</i> 507 F.3d at 738-39. But the appellant in this case has cast a wider net; he argues not only for consideration of that datum under section 3553(a)(6) but also for its consideration as part of the broader constellation of factors covered by section 3553(a). Because <i>Andújar-Arias</i> can fairly be interpreted as establishing a bright-line rule, we disregard semantics and treat the decision in <i>Andújar-Arias</i> as standing in the way of the appellant's argument.</p>\n<p>Several considerations lead us to conclude that, when viewed through the prism of <i>Kimbrough,</i> the appellant's argument has merit. Although <i>Kimbrough</i> involved the crack/powder ratio, its approach plainly has wider implications arguably affecting a number of our earlier cases, including but not limited to, how we have treated disparities arising out of the selective institution of fast-track programs. As to those programs  other cases not now before us are better left for another day  the analogy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*227</span> is compelling.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Like the crack/powder ratio, fast-track departure authority has been both blessed by Congress and openly criticized by the Sentencing Commission. <i>See</i> United States Sentencing Commission, <i>Report to the Congress: Downward Departures from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines</i> 66-67 (2003) (criticizing fast-track programs for creating a \"type of geographical disparity\"). Like the crack/powder ratio, the fast-track departure scheme does not \"exemplify the [Sentencing] Commission's exercise of its characteristic institutional role.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575. In other words, the Commission has \"not take[n] account of empirical data and national experience\" in formulating them. <i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Thus, guidelines and policy statements embodying these judgments deserve less deference than the sentencing guidelines normally attract. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Given this pedigree, a sentence that is partially the product of a fast-track departure might or might not \"reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve § 3553(a)'s objectives.\" <i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2456</span></a></span>, 2465, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (2007). If raised, the sentencing court will have to answer this question in a particular case. And where that answer is favorable to the defendant, a variant sentence premised on perceived inequities attributable to the availability elsewhere of fast-track departures would, given the Supreme Court's new gloss, seem to be entitled to deference \"even in a mine-run case.\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575.</p>\n<p>Beyond these parallels between the crack/powder ratio and the authorization for the selective institution of fast-track programs, emergent case law signals that, under an advisory guideline regime, sentencing has become a steadily more open-ended enterprise. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597 (discussing a sentencing court's superior coign of vantage \"to find facts and judge their import under § 3553(a)\"). Recent decisions of this court have noted this reality. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 92; <i>United States v. Vega-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Building on the foundation laid in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), <i>Kimbrough</i> lends a new flexibility to the scope of the district courts' sentencing authority and, in the bargain, removes a formidable obstacle to the consideration of matters such as fast-track disparity. We refer specifically to the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court's enlargement of a sentencing court's capacity to factor into the sentencing calculus its policy disagreements with the guidelines. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570. This makes plain that a sentencing court can deviate from the guidelines based on general policy considerations. <i>Id.</i> In so ruling, the Court effectively displaced our holding in <i>United States v. Pho,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202000\"><a href=\"/opinion/202000/united-states-v-pho/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2006), in which we had held that district courts could not base sentencing decisions \"on general, across-the-board\" policy disagreements with a guideline provision or policy statement (there, the crack/powder ratio).</p>\n<p>Importantly, <i>Kimbrough</i> counsels a new and different approach to section 3553(a). <i>Andújar-Arias</i> illustrates this point. There, as in some other pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> cases, the court evaluated only the isthmian <span class=\"star-pagination\">*228</span> question of whether a particular item (there, fast-track disparity) could be considered under the aegis of a specific provision of section 3553(a) (there, section 3553(a)(6)). <i>See </i><i>Andújar-Arias,</i> 507 F.3d at 736. But as we explain below, the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court's organic reading of section 3553(a) suggests that a sentencing judge should engage in a more holistic inquiry.</p>\n<p>The Court emphasized that section 3553(a) is more than a laundry list of discrete sentencing factors; it is, rather, a tapestry of factors, through which runs the thread of an overarching principle. <i>See </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570. That tenet (sometimes referred to as the \"parsimony principle\") instructs \"district courts to `impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary' to accomplish the goals of sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)). This overarching principle necessarily informs a sentencing court's consideration of the entire constellation of section 3553(a) factors, including the need to avoid unwarranted disparity. Similarly, judicial interpretation of section 3553(a) should be guided by the broadly worded \"goals of sentencing\" spelled out in section 3553(a)(2), to which <i>Kimbrough</i> pays homage. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In the final analysis, then, the gloss supplied by <i>Kimbrough</i> signifies that a district court should not evaluate a request for a variant sentence piecemeal, examining each section 3553(a) factor in isolation, but should instead consider all the relevant factors as a group and strive to construct a sentence that is minimally sufficient to achieve the broad goals of sentencing. This inquiry should be guided by, but not made unflinchingly subservient to, the concerns expressed in the statute's various sub-parts.</p>\n<p>Seen in light of the Supreme Court's neoteric teachings, a narrow focus on a particular factor in isolation, such as a single-minded fixation on whether fast-track disparity can fit within the confines of section 3553(a)(6), seems too cramped. After all, each sub-part enumerates \"only one of several factors that must be weighed and balanced by the sentencing judge.\" <i>United States v. Fernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2871\"><a href=\"/opinion/2871/united-states-v-fernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 32 (2d Cir.2006). So, whether or not the disparity of which the appellant complains is the type of disparity to which section 3553(a)(6) is addressed, <i>Kimbrough,</i> properly applied, teaches that a sentencing court should not rebuff such a complaint out of hand.</p>\n<p>That does not mean that the court should swallow such an allegation hook, line, and sinker, nor does it mean that it is foreclosed from determining that any disparity, when viewed through the prism of section 3553(a), is insufficient to warrant a non-guideline sentence. It does mean, however, that when confronted with an allegation of fast-track disparity, the court should at that point undertake a further inquiry. For example, it should probe whether and to what extent a relevant disparity exists at all and then, if it finds one, engage in a comprehensive evaluation of whether this and other items in the constellation of section 3553(a) factors, viewed as a whole, cast doubt on the suitability of a within-the-range sentence. In the course of this assessment, the court would have to ask whether such a sentence, if imposed, would encourage \"respect for the law,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A); \"provide just punishment for the offense,\" <i>id.;</i> and \"afford adequate,\" but not excessive, deterrence, <i>id.</i> § 3553(a)(2)(B). Ultimately, the court (depending on how it views the case) could ground a variant sentence in the parsimony principle rather than in section 3553(a)(6) alone. <i>See </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 575; <i>see also </i><i>Vega-Santiago,</i> 519 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> F.3d at 4 (recognizing, post-<i>Kimbrough,</i> that a variant sentence may be constructed \"based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight cannot even be precisely described\"); <i>United States v. Verkhoglyad,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2649\"><a href=\"/opinion/2649/united-states-v-verkhoglyad/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 131 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating, post-<i>Kimbrough,</i> that no particular 3553(a) sentencing factor should be given \"determinative or dispositive weight\") (quoting <i>Fernandez,</i> 443 F.3d at 32).</p>\n<p>This result is consistent with our post-<i>Kimbrough</i> case law suggesting that even if a specific sentencing rationale cannot be considered under the aegis of a particular sub-part of section 3553(a), such a proscription does not bar consideration of that factor in the course of a more holistic review of the full panoply of section 3553(a) factors. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 94 (indicating that section 3553(a)(6)'s instruction to consider \"unwarranted sentencing disparities\" was not intended to encompass disparate coconspirator sentences but that such disparities nonetheless could be considered under the totality of the section 3553(a) sub-parts).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we conclude that consideration of fast-track disparity is not categorically barred as a sentence-evaluating datum within the overall ambit of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). To the extent necessary to effectuate this holding, we abrogate our earlier opinion in <i>Andújar-Arias.</i></p>\n<p>The government labors mightily to stave off this holding. Its most loudly bruited claim is that, in contradistinction to the legislative actions at issue in <i>Kimbrough,</i> the PROTECT Act contains an unequivocal congressional mandate that bans consideration of any disparity arising from the selective implementation of fast-track programs. This argument finds support in the Fifth Circuit's recent opinion in <i>United States v. Gomez-Herrera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"60314\"><a href=\"/opinion/60314/united-states-v-gomez-herrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (5th Cir.2008), in which the court, on materially identical facts, determined that <i>Kimbrough</i> did not alter prior case law restricting a sentencing court's authority to include fast-track disparity in the sentencing mix. <i>Id.</i> at 557-564.</p>\n<p>We reject the government's importunings and in the process, respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by the <i>Gomez-Herrera</i> panel. While the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court acknowledged that a sentencing court can be constrained by express congressional directives, such as statutory mandatory maximum and minimum prison terms, 128 S.Ct. at 571-72, the PROTECT Act  as the Fifth Circuit would have to concede  contains no such express imperative. The Act, by its terms, neither forbids nor discourages the use of a particular sentencing rationale, and it says nothing about a district court's discretion to deviate from the guidelines based on fast-track disparity. The statute simply authorizes the Sentencing Commission to issue a policy statement and, in the wake of <i>Kimbrough,</i> such a directive, whether or not suggestive, is \"not decisive as to what may constitute a permissible ground for a variant sentence.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 93.</p>\n<p>By the same token, the PROTECT Act's authorization for the selective deployment of fast-track programs bears scant resemblance to a congressional directive instituting statutory minimum and maximum sentences. Although the latter directive necessarily cabins a sentencing court's discretion, the former authorization says nothing about the court's capacity to craft a variant sentence within the maximum and minimum limits.</p>\n<p>Refined to bare essence, the government is urging us to read into the PROTECT Act an implicit restriction on a district court's sentencing discretion. But that can be done, as <i>Gomez-Herrera</i> illustrates, only by heavy reliance on inference and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> implication about congressional intent  a practice that runs directly contrary to the Court's newly glossed approach. <i>See </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 570-74 (declining, despite Congress's implicit acquiescence in, or even its endorsement of, the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio, to treat that ratio as beyond the reach of section 3553(a)). In refusing to read a bar on policy disagreements into either Congress's original formulation of the 100-to-1 crack/powder ratio in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act or its later rejection of the Sentencing Commission's attempted softening of the ratio, <i>id.</i> at 570-73, <i>Kimbrough</i> made pellucid that when Congress exercises its power to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing rationale, it does so by the use of unequivocal terminology.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Martin</i> hammers home this point. There, the district court deviated dramatically downward from the GSR applicable to a career criminal and sentenced him within the range that would have obtained had he not been a recidivist. <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96. The government appealed, arguing that the variance was insupportable because Congress had indicated its desire \"that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized\" for recidivist offenders. 28 U.S.C. § 994(h). We rejected the argument, concluding that <i>Kimbrough</i> had opened the door for sentencing courts to deviate from the guidelines in individual cases notwithstanding Congress's competing policy pronouncements. <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96.</p>\n<p>Another example of this phenomenon is our recent decision in <i>United States v. Politano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203223\"><a href=\"/opinion/203223/united-states-v-politano/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2008). In that post-<i>Kimbrough</i> case, we concluded that community characteristics could be factored into the sentencing calculus, notwithstanding Congress's and the Sentencing Commission's expressed policy preferences to the contrary. <i>Id.</i> at 73-74. In so holding, we jettisoned a pre-<i>Kimbrough</i> decision of this court. <i>See id.</i> at 73 (effectively overriding <i>United States v. Aguilar-Pena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530534\"><a href=\"/opinion/530534/united-states-v-jorge-armando-aguilar-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 352 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p>If these holdings are to be given more than mere lip service, they must mean that absent an unambiguous congressional directive barring sentencing courts from considering disparity created by the district-by-district implementation of fast-track programs, a sentencing court can include that datum in its sentencing calculus, as long as the court grounds its rationale in the complex of factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to persuade us to bar consideration of fast-track disparity, the government thunders that upholding variant sentences premised in whole or in part on this ground will be tantamount to \"a judicial attempt to exercise prosecutorial discretion\"  an action that supposedly would impinge upon Executive Branch authority and, thus, violate separation-of-powers principles. This tirade elevates hope over reason.</p>\n<p>While the decision to institute a fast-track program in a particular judicial district is the Attorney General's, the ultimate authority to grant a fast-track departure lies with the sentencing court. <i>See</i> USSG § 5K3.1. The appellant is not requesting that this court direct prosecutors to institute a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico or to offer him a fast-track plea. Rather, the appellant asks that we gauge the impact of disparate sentencing practices in crafting his sentence. Because this is an unquestionably judicial function, we discern no separation of powers concerns here.</p>\n<p>Finally, the government argues that even if fast-track disparity ordinarily can be considered in sentencing, the appellant is outside the universe of defendants who might be advantaged by such a proposition. This is so, the government asseverates, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> inasmuch as the appellant is not similarly situated to other defendants charged with immigration crimes; after all, he filed pretrial motions and did not waive his right to appeal. But the government is trying to have it both ways. Lacking the benefit of the bargain inherent in fast-track programs, a defendant cannot be expected to renounce his right to mount a defense.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Tierney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451517\"><a href=\"/opinion/451517/united-states-v-robert-f-tierney/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Having one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We conclude that the district court, acting without the benefit of the watershed decision in <i>Kimbrough,</i> committed procedural error in refusing to consider the appellant's argument that he should receive a variant sentence because of the disparity incident to the lack of a fast-track program in the District of Puerto Rico. <i>Kimbrough</i> makes manifest that sentencing courts possess sufficient discretion under section 3553(a) to consider requests for variant sentences premised on disagreements with the manner in which the sentencing guidelines operate.</p>\n<p>We add a note of caution. Our holding today is carefully circumscribed; although sentencing courts can consider items such as fast-track disparity, they are not obligated to deviate from the guidelines based on those items. <i>Cf. </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 91 (explaining that the mere \"fact that a sentencing court possesses the raw power to deviate from the guidelines does not mean that it can (or should) do so casually\"). By the same token, the district court can make its own independent determination as to whether or not a sentence tainted by the alleged disparity is nonetheless consistent with the centrifugal pull of the constellation of 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<sup>[5]</sup> In so doing, we take no view anent the sentence that should be imposed here-which, conceivably, could be higher, lower, or the same as the sentence appealed from. In the first instance, the length of the term is up to the district court, which must formulate a plausible sentencing rationale and reach a defensible result. <i>See id.; </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p><i>Vacated and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In this venue, the appellant does not press any challenge to the construction of the GSR per se. His attack on the sixteen-level enhancement is limited to that enhancement's effect on the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p>[2]  In 2007, the Sentencing Commission took a small step toward ameliorating the crack/powder disparity, unilaterally reducing by two the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine. <i>See</i> United States Sentencing Commission, <i>Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts,</i> 72 Fed. Reg. 28558, 28571-72 (2007); <i>see also </i><i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 569.</p>\n<p>[3]  Even before the advent of <i>Kimbrough,</i> several courts recognized a substantial degree of doctrinal affinity between variant sentences involving the crack/powder ratio and those involving fast-track programs. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vargas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796838\"><a href=\"/opinion/796838/united-states-v-sandro-antonio-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 100 (3d Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Spears,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796107\"><a href=\"/opinion/796107/united-states-of-america-appelleecross-appellant-v-steven-spears/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span>, 1181 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[4]  The government also claims that the appellant's prior felony convictions might disqualify him from the fast-track program in some districts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Duran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2475663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2475663/united-states-v-duran/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 547 (S.D.N.Y.2005). But this goes to the substance of the appellant's argument  a matter that the district court did not reach. In all events, the criteria for fast-track programs vary from district to district, and the government has not suggested that the appellant would be categorically foreclosed from receiving fast-track benefits.</p>\n<p>[5]  Because we vacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing, we need not reach any of the appellant's alternative arguments.</p>\n\n</div>",
