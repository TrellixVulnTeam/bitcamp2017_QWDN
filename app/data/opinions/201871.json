Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jeffrey L. Baler on brief for appellant.\n     Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Donald C.\nLockhart and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorneys,\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n                         October 21, 2005\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.     Defendant-appellant Kenny Mateo-\n\nEspejo pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to distribute more\n\nthan fifty grams of crack cocaine, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846,\n\nand distribution of that amount of crack cocaine, see id. §\n\n841(a)(1).    He now appeals his sentence.      Concluding, as we do,\n\nthat the district court committed no reversible error in the course\n\nof sentencing, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the\n\nrelevant facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the unchallenged\n\nportions of the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and\n\nthe transcript of the disposition hearing.          United States v.\n\nBrewster, 127 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Dietz,\n\n950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            On March 14, 2002, Leopold Weeks, alleged to be the\n\nappellant's coconspirator, accepted $3,000 as a down payment for\n\nthe sale of 250 grams of cocaine base (colloquially known as crack\n\ncocaine).    At the appointed time, Weeks and the appellant went to\n\nmeet the prospective purchaser. The appellant removed 247.04 grams\n\nof crack cocaine from his pocket and delivered it to the buyer.\n\nFive days later, the appellant met with the buyer and collected the\n\nbalance of the purchase price ($3,600).      The buyer proved to be an\n\nundercover police officer, so arrests and an indictment soon\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            After twice switching counsel, the appellant entered a\n\nguilty plea on August 13, 2002 (the day that jury empanelment was\n\nto occur).      The PSI Report, which the appellant received on\n\nNovember 5, 2002, recommended a base offense level of 34, see USSG\n\n§2D1.1(a)(3), and a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, see id. §3E1.1(a).1 The appellant's only objection\n\nto the PSI Report was to the absence of an additional level in the\n\ncredit for acceptance of responsibility.               See id. §3E1.1(b).\n\nBecause the appellant had not yet met with the authorities — he did\n\nnot participate in a debriefing until the day before sentencing —\n\nthe   PSI   Report   did   not   recommend   a   so-called   \"safety   valve\"\n\nreduction.    See id. §2D1.1(b)(6).\n\n            At the disposition hearing, the district court, with\n\nobvious reluctance, granted the two-level safety valve adjustment.\n\nThe court also bestowed a two-level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, but declined to award an additional one-level\n\nreduction. Midway through the hearing, the appellant for the first\n\ntime asserted an entitlement to a minor role adjustment, see id.\n\n§3B1.2(b), but the court rebuffed that initiative.            These rulings\n\nyielded a total offense level of 30 which, combined with a criminal\n\n\n      1\n      We refer throughout this opinion to the November 2002 edition\nof the sentencing guidelines. See United States v. Harotunian, 920\nF.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that, absent ex post\nfacto concerns, the version of the sentencing guidelines in effect\non the date of sentencing controls). That point is of more than\nacademic interest, as the contours of USSG §3E1.1(b) have changed\nmaterially.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhistory category of I (the appellant had no prior criminal record),\n\nproduced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 97-121 months.                 The\n\ncourt,     albeit   grudgingly,       acquiesced     in     the    government's\n\nrecommendation      and    sentenced     the    appellant    to     a   97-month\n\nincarcerative term.       This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            In this venue, the appellant advances three claims of\n\nerror.      He maintains that the sentencing court erred (i) in\n\nrefusing    to   grant    him   an   additional    one-level      reduction   for\n\nacceptance of responsibility; (ii) in failing to find that he\n\nplayed only a minor role in the offenses of conviction; and (iii)\n\nin sentencing him contrary to the mandate of United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).                 We discuss these claims in\n\nsequence.\n\n                    A.    Acceptance of Responsibility.\n\n            We begin with the sentencing court's refusal to grant an\n\nadditional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\n\n\"A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to decreases\n\nin the offense level, including downward adjustments for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.\" United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). Where, as here, the district court has ruled adversely\n\non such an issue, the ruling will be set aside only if it is shown\n\nto be clearly erroneous.        United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).     The appellant has not made such a showing.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f          A defendant who accepts responsibility for his criminal\n\nconduct normally receives a two-level discount in his offense\n\nlevel. See USSG §3E1.1(a). To qualify for an additional one-level\n\nreduction, the defendant must either:                   timely provide complete\n\ninformation to the government anent his own involvement in the\n\noffense(s)    of    conviction     or,    at   least,       timely    notify     the\n\nauthorities of his intention to plead guilty.                  Id. §3E1.1(b).    The\n\nguidelines offer this second avenue as a means of \"permitting the\n\ngovernment to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to\n\nallocate its resources efficiently.\"              Id.\n\n          The      first   of   these    routes    is    not    available   to   the\n\nappellant.    He did not discuss the details of the offenses of\n\nconviction with the government until the day before his scheduled\n\nsentencing.     That hardly can be considered a timely provision of\n\ncomplete information to the government.              See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Brack, 188 F.3d 748, 765 (7th Cir. 1999) (finding no timely\n\nprovision of complete information when defendant was not debriefed\n\nuntil four days before trial).\n\n          The second avenue also proves to be a dead end.                        The\n\ndistrict court regarded the appellant's eleventh-hour decision to\n\nplead guilty, made on the day of jury empanelment, as failing to\n\nsatisfy the applicable criterion.              That determination was not\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           Although   this   case   was   not   a   complicated     one,    the\n\ngovernment needed some time to prepare for trial — and the timing\n\nof the appellant's change of plea meant that the government's\n\npreparation had largely been done.          Equally as important, the\n\nappellant's belated decision wasted judicial resources; jurors had\n\nbeen summoned unnecessarily and the court's calendar had been\n\ncleared to accommodate a trial that never took place.               A timely\n\ndecision on the appellant's part would have ameliorated these\n\nproblems, saving the government a significant portion of its trial\n\npreparation expenses and allowing the court to husband judicial\n\nresources.   Under these circumstances, denying the additional one-\n\nlevel discount was not clearly erroneous.           See, e.g., Morillo, 8\n\nF.3d at 872 (finding no clear error in denial of additional one-\n\nlevel   reduction   when   defendant   waited   until   the   day    of    jury\n\nselection to enter a guilty plea); United States v. Donovan, 996\n\nF.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (finding no clear\n\nerror in denial of additional one-level reduction when defendant\n\nwaited until the eve of trial to plead guilty).\n\n           The appellant makes a last-ditch effort to salvage his\n\nacceptance of responsibility argument: he asserts that his change\n\nof counsel caused the delay in notifying the government of his\n\nintent to change his plea and that withholding the extra level of\n\ncredit infringes upon the exercise of his constitutionally assured\n\nright, under the Sixth Amendment, to counsel of his choosing.               We\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fagree with a portion of the appellant's underlying premise, but in\n\nthe end, we find his argument unpersuasive.\n\n          The point of agreement is that a district court may\n\nproperly consider the right to effective assistance of counsel in\n\ndetermining if a defendant qualifies for the additional one-level\n\nreduction under section 3E1.1(b).          See, e.g., United States v.\n\nAltier, 91 F.3d 953, 958 (7th Cir. 1996).         On the facts of this\n\ncase, however, the conclusion that the appellant would have us draw\n\ndoes not follow from this premise. Nothing in the record indicates\n\nthat the timing of the appellant's decision to plead guilty had\n\nanything to do with switching from one lawyer to another.          Indeed,\n\nthe appellant does not even attempt to explain how changing counsel\n\nimpacted his decision to abjure a trial.\n\n          In all events, the district court gave careful attention\n\nto this plaint.     The court found it meritless, noting that the\n\nappellant may have had a more plausible argument if, shortly before\n\nhe changed his plea, he had switched from appointed counsel to\n\nretained counsel.        Yet, that was not the scenario here; the\n\nappellant's   original    attorney   was   court-appointed   but   rapidly\n\nreplaced by a privately retained attorney, and the shuffling to\n\nwhich the appellant points is the replacement of that attorney with\n\nyet another privately retained attorney.       The district court found\n\nthat the appellant's decision to jettison one retained lawyer in\n\nfavor of another, without more, did not create a Sixth Amendment\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fimpediment    to   the   withholding      of   the   additional   one-level\n\nreduction.    On the record before us, that finding was not clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n                         B.   Role in the Offense.\n\n          We turn next to the appellant's claim that he should have\n\nreceived a two-level reduction for his minor role in the offenses\n\nof conviction.     The government argues plausibly that the appellant\n\neither waived or forfeited this claim of error because he failed to\n\nobject to the PSI Report within the prescribed period.            See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 32(f); D.R.I. R. 40.2(a).           Giving the appellant the\n\nbenefit of every doubt, we assume, for argument's sake, that the\n\nclaim was properly preserved.       On that basis, appellate review is\n\nfor clear error.     United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n          A defendant who seeks a downward adjustment stemming from\n\nhis supposedly peripheral role in the offense bears the burden of\n\nproof on that issue.     United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).     To qualify for a minor role reduction under USSG\n\n§3B1.2(b), the defendant must satisfy a two-pronged test.           First,\n\nhe must demonstrate that he is less culpable than most of those\n\ninvolved in the offenses of conviction.              See United States v.\n\nSantos, 357 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2004); Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.\n\nSecond, he must establish that he is less culpable than most of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthose who have perpetrated similar crimes. See Santos, 357 F.3d at\n\n142; Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.\n\n            In an effort to satisfy the first prong, the appellant\n\nasserts that Weeks was the ringleader — the person who arranged the\n\ntransaction — while he (Mateo-Espejo) was merely a courier.           This\n\nassertion   lacks   force.   Although   the   appellant   may   not   have\n\narranged the initial meeting, he transported a large amount of\n\ncrack to the delivery site, played a significant role in the\n\nculmination of the sale, and met again with the buyer (this time,\n\nwithout Weeks) to collect the unpaid balance of the purchase price.\n\nBased on these facts, the district court found that the appellant\n\nwas not substantially less culpable than his coconspirator (and,\n\nthus, not a minor participant).\n\n            That finding demands our fealty.    After all, this court\n\nrepeatedly has upheld the denial of downward role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustments for defendants who have been no more involved in drug\n\ntransactions than the appellant.    For example, in United States v.\n\nOrtiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146 (1st Cir. 2000), we descried no clear\n\nerror in the sentencing court's denial of a minor role adjustment\n\nwhere the defendant had performed only \"menial tasks\" such as\n\nunloading the drugs and conducting surveillance.      Id. at 149.      So\n\ntoo in United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), we discerned no clear error in the sentencing court's denial\n\nof a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment on the assumption that\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthe defendant had been no more than a courier.              Id. at 73-74.      And\n\nin United States v. Cepeda, 907 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1990), we found\n\nno clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a minor role\n\nadjustment where, as here, the defendant delivered drugs and\n\ncollected money. Id. at 12. Silhouetted against this precedential\n\nbackdrop, the decision of the court below denying the appellant's\n\nrequest that he be classified as a minor participant cannot be\n\ncharacterized as clearly erroneous. Cf. United States v. González,\n\n363   F.3d    15,   18   (1st    Cir.     2004)   (per     curiam)   (\"Even    if\n\n[defendant's] role were limited to that of driver, that would not\n\nnecessarily,     without   more,    prove      that   he    deserved   a      role\n\nadjustment.\").\n\n                            C.    Booker Error.\n\n             In Booker, the Supreme Court held that a defendant's\n\nSixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated when his\n\nsentence is imposed under a mandatory guidelines system that gives\n\ndecretory significance to judge-found facts.               125 S. Ct. at 756.\n\nThe appellant notes that he was sentenced prior to the Booker\n\ndecision and under the mandatory guidelines system then in effect.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, he maintains that his sentence is\n\ntainted by Booker error.\n\n             The appellant did not make a Sixth Amendment objection at\n\nthe time of sentencing, so this claim of error is unpreserved.\n\nConsequently, our review is for plain error.                 United States v.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fGuzmán,   419    F.3d    27,     30   (1st    Cir.    2005);    United         States   v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).                       To cross that\n\nthreshold, the appellant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2)\n\nwhich was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his]\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                         United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           In    this    instance,       the     lower     court,      operating        in\n\naccordance with the pre-Booker norm, treated the guidelines as\n\nmandatory.       Thus,   the     first   two     elements      of   the       plain-error\n\nformulation are present here.            See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.\n\n           To    satisfy       the    third     element,      the   appellant       must\n\ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have received a\n\nlesser sentence under an advisory guidelines regime.                      See Guzmán,\n\n419 F.3d at 30; Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.                     Although we are\n\nnot overly demanding in our assessment of a defendant's attempt to\n\nmake this showing, see United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), we do require \"something concrete, whether or not\n\nin the sentencing record itself, that provides a plausible basis\n\nfor such a finding,\" Guzmán, 419 F.3d at 32.\n\n           The appellant first suggests that there are factors\n\npresent   here    that     the    sentencing         court,    under      a    mandatory\n\nguidelines system, was unable to consider when passing sentence and\n\nthat, under an advisory guidelines system, these factors would have\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fled to a milder sentence.       In this regard, the appellant, who was\n\ntwenty-three years of age at the time of sentencing, mentions his\n\nyouth and his significant familial responsibilities.             While the\n\ndistrict court did not allude to either of these factors at\n\nsentencing, the appellant attributes the court's silence to the\n\nprohibitory language of the now-discredited mandatory guidelines\n\nsystem.   See USSG §5H1.1 (directing that age ordinarily should not\n\nbe deemed relevant in determining whether a sentence should be\n\nimposed outside the applicable GSR); id. §5H1.6 (same, with respect\n\nto family circumstances).\n\n           It is, of course, possible that a judge might reserve\n\ncomment on a matter because he thought that the mandatory nature of\n\nthe sentencing guidelines rendered comment futile.         Here, however,\n\nthe district court, fully apprised by the PSI Report of the\n\nappellant's age and family responsibilities, went out of its way to\n\nindicate its reluctance to impose the low-end sentence that the\n\ngovernment strongly recommended. The court stated, in no uncertain\n\nterms, that it did not see \"any reason\" for a sentence at the\n\nbottom of the GSR, \"except for the government's recommendation.\"\n\nThese statements are a powerful indication that the court was\n\nunpersuaded that the factors limned in the PSI Report counseled in\n\nfavor of leniency.         In the last analysis, the colloquy in the\n\nrecord,   taken   as   a    whole,   neither   suggests   nor   supports   a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\freasonable probability that the court would have imposed a sentence\n\noutside the GSR under an advisory guidelines regime.\n\n             The    appellant   has   another   string   to   his    bow.   He\n\nasseverates that there were other circumstances, not mentioned in\n\nthe PSI Report, that would have led the court to impose a more\n\nlenient sentence.       We reject this asseveration.\n\n             The first circumstance to which the appellant alludes is\n\nthe disparity between his 97-month sentence and Weeks's 70-month\n\nsentence. A well-founded claim of disparity, however, assumes that\n\napples are being compared to apples.              Here, there is no true\n\ndisparity; differences between the appellant's belated and grudging\n\ncooperation    and    Weeks's   prompt   and    full   cooperation    sensibly\n\naccount for the differing sentences. On a practical level, it would\n\nseem patently unreasonable to endorse a regime in which a defendant\n\ncould steadfastly withhold cooperation from the authorities and\n\nthen   cry   foul    when   a   coconspirator    benefits     from   rendering\n\nsubstantial assistance to the government.\n\n             The only other \"new\" circumstance to which the appellant\n\nadverts is his claim that he committed the crimes because he needed\n\nmoney to provide for an ailing grandmother and parents who were\n\nbeing evicted from their home.         This line of defense did not work\n\nfor Jean Valjean, cf. Victor Hugo, Les Misérables (Norman Denny\n\ntrans., Penguin Books 1982) (1862), and we see no basis for a\n\nreasonable expectation that it would have worked here.               After all,\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthe    sentencing     court   was    aware    of    the    appellant's     familial\n\nobligations and it said nothing that might lead to a well-founded\n\nbelief that those obligations ought to impact the length of the\n\nsentence.      That     silence,     combined       with    the     court's   avowed\n\nreluctance even to give the appellant a sentence at the bottom of\n\nthe GSR, leads to the conclusion that the appellant has failed to\n\ndemonstrate a reasonable probability that the Booker error had a\n\nprejudicial effect in this case.               See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMartins, 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d 511, 534 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Because     the   appellant       has    not    shown    a   reasonable\n\nprobability that the lower court would have imposed a more lenient\n\nsentence under an advisory guidelines system, we reject his Booker\n\nchallenge.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.           The court below did not err in\n\ncalculating the applicable GSR.          It did, of course, commit Booker\n\nerror,   but   that    unpreserved     error       was    not   prejudicial    (and,\n\ntherefore, was not plain).          Accordingly, there is no justification\n\nfor disturbing the appellant's sentence.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f",

He now appeals his sentence. Concluding, as we do, that the district court committed no reversible error in the course of sentencing, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the relevant facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the disposition hearing. <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> 127 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 2002, Leopold Weeks, alleged to be the appellant's coconspirator, accepted $3,000 as a down payment for the sale of 250 grams of cocaine base (colloquially known as crack cocaine). At the appointed time, Weeks and the appellant went to meet the prospective purchaser. The appellant removed 247.04 grams of crack cocaine from his pocket and delivered it to the buyer. Five days later, the appellant met with the buyer and collected the balance of the purchase price ($3,600). The buyer proved to be an undercover police officer, so arrests and an indictment soon followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After twice switching counsel, the appellant entered a guilty plea on August 13, 2002 (the day that jury empanelment was to occur). The PSI Report, which the appellant received on November 5, 2002, recommended a base offense level of 34, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3), and a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The appellant's only objection to the PSI Report was to the absence of an additional level in the credit for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(b). Because the appellant had not yet met with the authorities &#8212; he did not participate in a debriefing until the day before sentencing &#8212; the PSI Report did not recommend a so-called \"safety valve\" reduction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court, with obvious reluctance, granted the two-level safety valve adjustment. The court also bestowed a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but declined to award an additional one-level reduction. Midway through the hearing, the appellant for the first time asserted an entitlement to a minor role adjustment, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2(b), but the court rebuffed that initiative. These rulings yielded a total offense level of 30 which, combined with a criminal history category of I (the appellant had no prior criminal record), produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 97-121 months. The court, albeit grudgingly, acquiesced in the government's recommendation and sentenced the appellant to a 97-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant advances three claims of error. He maintains that the sentencing court erred (i) in refusing to grant him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; (ii) in failing to find that he played only a minor role in the offenses of conviction; and (iii) in sentencing him contrary to the mandate of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We discuss these claims in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Acceptance of Responsibility.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the sentencing court's refusal to grant an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. \"A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to decreases in the offense level, including downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility.\" <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st Cir.1993). Where, as here, the district court has ruled adversely on such an issue, the ruling will be set aside only if it is shown to be clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Royer,</i> 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990). The appellant has not made such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant who accepts responsibility for his criminal conduct normally receives a two-level discount in his offense level. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a). To qualify for an additional one-level reduction, the defendant must either: timely provide complete information to the government anent his own involvement in the offense(s) of conviction or, at least, timely notify the authorities of his intention to plead guilty. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(b). The guidelines offer this second avenue as a means of \"permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these routes is not available to the appellant. He did not discuss the details of the offenses of conviction with the government until the day before his scheduled sentencing. That hardly can be considered a timely provision of complete information to the government. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Brack,</i> 188 F.3d 748, 765 (7th Cir.1999) (finding no timely provision of complete information when defendant was not debriefed until four days before trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second avenue also proves to be a dead end. The district court regarded the appellant's eleventh-hour decision to plead guilty, made on the day of jury empanelment, as failing to satisfy the applicable criterion. That determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this case was not a complicated one, the government needed some time to prepare for trial &#8212; and the timing of the appellant's change of plea meant that the government's preparation had largely been done. Equally as important, the appellant's belated decision wasted judicial resources; jurors had been summoned unnecessarily and the court's calendar had been cleared to accommodate a trial that never took place. A timely decision on the appellant's part would have ameliorated these problems, saving the government a significant portion of its trial preparation expenses and allowing the court to husband judicial resources. Under these circumstances, denying the additional one-level discount was not clearly erroneous. <i>See, e.g., Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d at 872 (finding no clear error in denial of additional one-level reduction when defendant waited until the day of jury selection to enter a guilty plea); <i>United States v. Donovan,</i> 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (finding no clear error in denial of additional one-level reduction when defendant waited until the eve of trial to plead guilty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes a last-ditch effort to salvage his acceptance of responsibility argument: he asserts that his change of counsel caused the delay in notifying the government of his intent to change his plea and that withholding the extra level of credit infringes upon the exercise of his constitutionally assured right, under the Sixth Amendment, to counsel of his choosing. We agree with a portion of the appellant's underlying premise, but in the end, we find his argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point of agreement is that a district court may properly consider the right to effective assistance of counsel in determining if a defendant qualifies for the additional one-level reduction under section 3E1.1(b). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Altier,</i> 91 F.3d 953, 958 (7th Cir.1996). On the facts of this case, however, the conclusion that the appellant would have us draw does not follow from this premise. Nothing in the record indicates that the timing of the appellant's decision to plead guilty had anything to do with switching from one lawyer to another. Indeed, the appellant does not even attempt to explain how changing counsel impacted his decision to abjure a trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the district court gave careful attention to this plaint. The court found it meritless, noting that the appellant may have had a more plausible argument if, shortly before he changed his plea, he had switched from appointed counsel to retained counsel. Yet, that was not the scenario here; the appellant's original attorney was court-appointed but rapidly replaced by a privately retained attorney, and the shuffling to which the appellant points is the replacement of that attorney with yet another privately retained attorney. The district court found that the appellant's decision to jettison one retained lawyer in favor of another, without more, did not create a Sixth Amendment impediment to the withholding of the additional one-level reduction. On the record before us, that finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Role in the Offense.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the appellant's claim that he should have received a two-level reduction for his minor role in the offenses of conviction. The government argues plausibly that the appellant either waived or forfeited this claim of error because he failed to object to the PSI Report within the prescribed period. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f); D.R.I. R. 40.2(a). Giving the appellant the benefit of every doubt, we assume, for argument's sake, that the claim was properly preserved. On that basis, appellate review is for clear error. <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant who seeks a downward adjustment stemming from his supposedly peripheral role in the offense bears the burden of proof on that issue. <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir.1990). To qualify for a minor role reduction under USSG &#167; 3B1.2(b), the defendant must satisfy a two-pronged test. First, he must demonstrate that he is less culpable than most of those involved in the offenses of conviction. <i>See United States v. Santos,</i> 357 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333. Second, he must establish that he is less culpable than most of those who have perpetrated similar crimes. <i>See Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 142; <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to satisfy the first prong, the appellant asserts that Weeks was the ringleader &#8212; the person who arranged the transaction &#8212; while he (Mateo-Espejo) was merely a courier. This assertion lacks force. Although the appellant may not have arranged the initial meeting, he transported a large amount of crack to the delivery site, played a significant role in the culmination of the sale, and met again with the buyer (this time, without Weeks) to collect the unpaid balance of the purchase price. Based on these facts, the district court found that the appellant was not substantially less culpable than his coconspirator (and, thus, not a minor participant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That finding demands our fealty. After all, this court repeatedly has upheld the denial of downward role-in-the-offense adjustments for defendants who have been no more involved in drug transactions than the appellant. For example, in <i>United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146 (1st Cir.2000), we descried no clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a minor role adjustment where the defendant had performed only \"menial tasks\" such as unloading the drugs and conducting surveillance. <i>Id.</i> at 149. So too in <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal,</i> 109 F.3d 64 (1st Cir.1997), we discerned no clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment on the assumption that the defendant had been no more than a courier. <i>Id.</i> at 73-74. And in <i>United States v. Cepeda,</i> 907 F.2d 11 (1st Cir.1990), we found no clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a minor role adjustment where, as here, the defendant delivered drugs and collected money. <i>Id.</i> at 12. Silhouetted against this precedential backdrop, the decision of the court below denying the appellant's request that he be classified as a minor participant cannot be characterized as clearly erroneous. <i>Cf. United States v. Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 363 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam) (\"Even if [defendant's] role were limited to that of driver, that would not necessarily, without more, prove that he deserved a role adjustment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Booker Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Booker,</i> the Supreme Court held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated when his sentence is imposed under a mandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to judge-found facts. 125 S.Ct. at 756. The appellant notes that he was sentenced prior to the <i>Booker</i> decision and under the mandatory guidelines system then in effect. Building on this foundation, he maintains that his sentence is tainted by <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant did not make a Sixth Amendment objection at the time of sentencing, so this claim of error is unpreserved. Consequently, our review is for plain error. <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005). To cross that threshold, the appellant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the lower court, operating in accordance with the pre-<i>Booker</i> norm, treated the guidelines as mandatory. Thus, the first two elements of the plain-error formulation are present here. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the third element, the appellant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <i>See Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at 30; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Although we are not overly demanding in our assessment of a defendant's attempt to make this showing, <i>see United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005), we do require \"something concrete, whether or not in the sentencing record itself, that provides a plausible basis for such a finding,\" <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant first suggests that there are factors present here that the sentencing court, under a mandatory guidelines system, was unable to consider when passing sentence and that, under an advisory guidelines system, these factors would have led to a milder sentence. In this regard, the appellant, who was twenty-three years of age at the time of sentencing, mentions his youth and his significant familial responsibilities. While the district court did not allude to either of these factors at sentencing, the appellant attributes the court's silence to the prohibitory language of the now-discredited mandatory guidelines system. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5H1.1 (directing that age ordinarily should not be deemed relevant in determining whether a sentence should be imposed outside the applicable GSR); <i>id.</i> &#167; 5H1.6 (same, with respect to family circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, possible that a judge might reserve comment on a matter because he thought that the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines rendered comment futile. Here, however, the district court, fully apprised by the PSI Report of the appellant's age and family responsibilities, went out of its way to indicate its reluctance to impose the low-end sentence that the government strongly recommended. The court stated, in no uncertain terms, that it did not see \"any reason\" for a sentence at the bottom of the GSR, \"except for the government's recommendation.\" These statements are a powerful indication that the court was unpersuaded that the factors limned in the PSI Report counseled in favor of leniency. In the last analysis, the colloquy in the record, taken as a whole, neither suggests nor supports a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a sentence outside the GSR under an advisory guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has another string to his bow. He asseverates that there were other circumstances, not mentioned in the PSI Report, that would have led the court to impose a more lenient sentence. We reject this asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first circumstance to which the appellant alludes is the disparity between his 97-month sentence and Weeks's 70-month sentence. A well-founded claim of disparity, however, assumes that apples are being compared to apples. Here, there is no true disparity; differences between the appellant's belated and grudging cooperation and Weeks's prompt and full cooperation sensibly account for the differing sentences. On a practical level, it would seem patently unreasonable to endorse a regime in which a defendant could steadfastly withhold cooperation from the authorities and then cry foul when a coconspirator benefits from rendering substantial assistance to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other \"new\" circumstance to which the appellant adverts is his claim that he committed the crimes because he needed money to provide for an ailing grandmother and parents who were being evicted from their home. This line of defense did not work for Jean Valjean, <i>cf.</i> Victor Hugo, Les Mis&#233;rables (Norman Denny trans., Penguin Books 1982) (1862), and we see no basis for a reasonable expectation that it would have worked here. After all, the sentencing court was aware of the appellant's familial obligations and it said nothing that might lead to a well-founded belief that those obligations ought to impact the length of the sentence. That silence, combined with the court's avowed reluctance even to give the appellant a sentence at the bottom of the GSR, leads to the conclusion that the appellant has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the <i>Booker</i> error had a prejudicial effect in this case. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 534 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant has not shown a reasonable probability that the lower court would have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory guidelines system, we reject his <i>Booker</i> challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The court below did not err in calculating the applicable GSR. It did, of course, commit <i>Booker</i> error, but that unpreserved error was not prejudicial (and, therefore, was not plain). Accordingly, there is no justification for disturbing the appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer throughout this opinion to the November 2002 edition of the sentencing guidelines<i>See United States v.

He now appeals his sentence. Concluding, as we do, that the district court committed no reversible error in the course of sentencing, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal follows a guilty plea, we draw the relevant facts from the change-of-plea colloquy, the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the disposition hearing. <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 14, 2002, Leopold Weeks, alleged to be the appellant's coconspirator, accepted $3,000 as a down payment for the sale of 250 grams of cocaine base (colloquially known as crack cocaine). At the appointed time, Weeks and the appellant went to meet the prospective purchaser. The appellant removed 247.04 grams of crack cocaine from his pocket and delivered it to the buyer. Five days later, the appellant met with the buyer and collected the balance of the purchase price ($3,600). The buyer proved to be an undercover police officer, so arrests and an indictment soon followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After twice switching counsel, the appellant entered a guilty plea on August 13, 2002 (the day that jury empanelment was to occur). The PSI Report, which the appellant received on November 5, 2002, recommended a base offense level of 34, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3), and a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The appellant's only objection to the PSI Report was to the absence of an additional level in the credit for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(b). Because the appellant had not yet met with the authorities &#8212; he did not participate in a debriefing until the day before sentencing &#8212; the PSI Report did not recommend a so-called \"safety valve\" reduction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court, with obvious reluctance, granted the two-level safety valve adjustment. The court also bestowed a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but declined to award an additional one-level reduction. Midway through the hearing, the appellant for the first time asserted an entitlement to a minor role adjustment, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2(b), but the court rebuffed that initiative. These rulings yielded a total offense level of 30 which, combined with a criminal history category of I (the appellant had no prior criminal record), produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 97-121 months. The court, albeit grudgingly, acquiesced in the government's recommendation and sentenced the appellant to a 97-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant advances three claims of error. He maintains that the sentencing court erred (i) in refusing to grant him an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; (ii) in failing to find that he played only a minor role in the offenses of conviction; and (iii) in sentencing him contrary to the mandate of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). We discuss these claims in sequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Acceptance of Responsibility.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the sentencing court's refusal to grant an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. \"A defendant bears the burden of proving entitlement to decreases in the offense level, including downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility.\" <i>United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 871 (1st Cir.1993). Where, as here, the district court has ruled adversely on such an issue, the ruling will be set aside only if it is shown to be clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Royer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536029\"><a href=\"/opinion/536029/united-states-v-marc-a-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1990). The appellant has not made such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant who accepts responsibility for his criminal conduct normally receives a two-level discount in his offense level. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a). To qualify for an additional one-level reduction, the defendant must either: timely provide complete information to the government anent his own involvement in the offense(s) of conviction or, at least, timely notify the authorities of his intention to plead guilty. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1(b). The guidelines offer this second avenue as a means of \"permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these routes is not available to the appellant. He did not discuss the details of the offenses of conviction with the government until the day before his scheduled sentencing. That hardly can be considered a timely provision of complete information to the government. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Brack,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765784\"><a href=\"/opinion/765784/united-states-v-kenyatta-brack-patrick-henderson-willie-tyler-nicholas/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span>, 765 (7th Cir.1999) (finding no timely provision of complete information when defendant was not debriefed until four days before trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second avenue also proves to be a dead end. The district court regarded the appellant's eleventh-hour decision to plead guilty, made on the day of jury empanelment, as failing to satisfy the applicable criterion. That determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this case was not a complicated one, the government needed some time to prepare for trial &#8212; and the timing of the appellant's change of plea meant that the government's preparation had largely been done. Equally as important, the appellant's belated decision wasted judicial resources; jurors had been summoned unnecessarily and the court's calendar had been cleared to accommodate a trial that never took place. A timely decision on the appellant's part would have ameliorated these problems, saving the government a significant portion of its trial preparation expenses and allowing the court to husband judicial resources. Under these circumstances, denying the additional one-level discount was not clearly erroneous. <i>See, e.g., Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d at 872 (finding no clear error in denial of additional one-level reduction when defendant waited until the day of jury selection to enter a guilty plea); <i>United States v. Donovan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610557\"><a href=\"/opinion/610557/united-states-v-richard-j-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1345 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (finding no clear error in denial of additional one-level reduction when defendant waited until the eve of trial to plead guilty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant makes a last-ditch effort to salvage his acceptance of responsibility argument: he asserts that his change of counsel caused the delay in notifying the government of his intent to change his plea and that withholding the extra level of credit infringes upon the exercise of his constitutionally assured right, under the Sixth Amendment, to counsel of his choosing. We agree with a portion of the appellant's underlying premise, but in the end, we find his argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point of agreement is that a district court may properly consider the right to effective assistance of counsel in determining if a defendant qualifies for the additional one-level reduction under section 3E1.1(b). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Altier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723810\"><a href=\"/opinion/723810/united-states-v-gerald-altier/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 958 (7th Cir.1996). On the facts of this case, however, the conclusion that the appellant would have us draw does not follow from this premise. Nothing in the record indicates that the timing of the appellant's decision to plead guilty had anything to do with switching from one lawyer to another. Indeed, the appellant does not even attempt to explain how changing counsel impacted his decision to abjure a trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the district court gave careful attention to this plaint. The court found it meritless, noting that the appellant may have had a more plausible argument if, shortly before he changed his plea, he had switched from appointed counsel to retained counsel. Yet, that was not the scenario here; the appellant's original attorney was court-appointed but rapidly replaced by a privately retained attorney, and the shuffling to which the appellant points is the replacement of that attorney with yet another privately retained attorney. The district court found that the appellant's decision to jettison one retained lawyer in favor of another, without more, did not create a Sixth Amendment impediment to the withholding of the additional one-level reduction. On the record before us, that finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Role in the Offense.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the appellant's claim that he should have received a two-level reduction for his minor role in the offenses of conviction. The government argues plausibly that the appellant either waived or forfeited this claim of error because he failed to object to the PSI Report within the prescribed period. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f); D.R.I. R. 40.2(a). Giving the appellant the benefit of every doubt, we assume, for argument's sake, that the claim was properly preserved. On that basis, appellate review is for clear error. <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant who seeks a downward adjustment stemming from his supposedly peripheral role in the offense bears the burden of proof on that issue. <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 332-33 (1st Cir.1990). To qualify for a minor role reduction under USSG &#167; 3B1.2(b), the defendant must satisfy a two-pronged test. First, he must demonstrate that he is less culpable than most of those involved in the offenses of conviction. <i>See United States v. Santos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200851\"><a href=\"/opinion/200851/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333. Second, he must establish that he is less culpable than most of those who have perpetrated similar crimes. <i>See Santos,</i> 357 F.3d at 142; <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to satisfy the first prong, the appellant asserts that Weeks was the ringleader &#8212; the person who arranged the transaction &#8212; while he (Mateo-Espejo) was merely a courier. This assertion lacks force. Although the appellant may not have arranged the initial meeting, he transported a large amount of crack to the delivery site, played a significant role in the culmination of the sale, and met again with the buyer (this time, without Weeks) to collect the unpaid balance of the purchase price. Based on these facts, the district court found that the appellant was not substantially less culpable than his coconspirator (and, thus, not a minor participant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That finding demands our fealty. After all, this court repeatedly has upheld the denial of downward role-in-the-offense adjustments for defendants who have been no more involved in drug transactions than the appellant. For example, in <i>United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198902\"><a href=\"/opinion/198902/united-states-v-ortiz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000), we descried no clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a minor role adjustment where the defendant had performed only \"menial tasks\" such as unloading the drugs and conducting surveillance. <i>Id.</i> at 149. So too in <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997), we discerned no clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment on the assumption that the defendant had been no more than a courier. <i>Id.</i> at 73-74. And in <i>United States v. Cepeda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543833\"><a href=\"/opinion/543833/united-states-v-luis-cepeda/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990), we found no clear error in the sentencing court's denial of a minor role adjustment where, as here, the defendant delivered drugs and collected money. <i>Id.</i> at 12. Silhouetted against this precedential backdrop, the decision of the court below denying the appellant's request that he be classified as a minor participant cannot be characterized as clearly erroneous. <i>Cf. United States v. Gonz&#225;lez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200943\"><a href=\"/opinion/200943/united-states-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam) (\"Even if [defendant's] role were limited to that of driver, that would not necessarily, without more, prove that he deserved a role adjustment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Booker Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Booker,</i> the Supreme Court held that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated when his sentence is imposed under a mandatory guidelines system that gives decretory significance to judge-found facts. 125 S.Ct. at 756. The appellant notes that he was sentenced prior to the <i>Booker</i> decision and under the mandatory guidelines system then in effect. Building on this foundation, he maintains that his sentence is tainted by <i>Booker</i> error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant did not make a Sixth Amendment objection at the time of sentencing, so this claim of error is unpreserved. Consequently, our review is for plain error. <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201772\"><a href=\"/opinion/201772/united-states-v-guzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2005). To cross that threshold, the appellant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the lower court, operating in accordance with the pre-<i>Booker</i> norm, treated the guidelines as mandatory. Thus, the first two elements of the plain-error formulation are present here. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the third element, the appellant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <i>See Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at 30; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Although we are not overly demanding in our assessment of a defendant's attempt to make this showing, <i>see United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005), we do require \"something concrete, whether or not in the sentencing record itself, that provides a plausible basis for such a finding,\" <i>Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant first suggests that there are factors present here that the sentencing court, under a mandatory guidelines system, was unable to consider when passing sentence and that, under an advisory guidelines system, these factors would have led to a milder sentence. In this regard, the appellant, who was twenty-three years of age at the time of sentencing, mentions his youth and his significant familial responsibilities. While the district court did not allude to either of these factors at sentencing, the appellant attributes the court's silence to the prohibitory language of the now-discredited mandatory guidelines system. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5H1.1 (directing that age ordinarily should not be deemed relevant in determining whether a sentence should be imposed outside the applicable GSR); <i>id.</i> &#167; 5H1.6 (same, with respect to family circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, possible that a judge might reserve comment on a matter because he thought that the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines rendered comment futile. Here, however, the district court, fully apprised by the PSI Report of the appellant's age and family responsibilities, went out of its way to indicate its reluctance to impose the low-end sentence that the government strongly recommended. The court stated, in no uncertain terms, that it did not see \"any reason\" for a sentence at the bottom of the GSR, \"except for the government's recommendation.\" These statements are a powerful indication that the court was unpersuaded that the factors limned in the PSI Report counseled in favor of leniency. In the last analysis, the colloquy in the record, taken as a whole, neither suggests nor supports a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a sentence outside the GSR under an advisory guidelines regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has another string to his bow. He asseverates that there were other circumstances, not mentioned in the PSI Report, that would have led the court to impose a more lenient sentence. We reject this asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first circumstance to which the appellant alludes is the disparity between his 97-month sentence and Weeks's 70-month sentence. A well-founded claim of disparity, however, assumes that apples are being compared to apples. Here, there is no true disparity; differences between the appellant's belated and grudging cooperation and Weeks's prompt and full cooperation sensibly account for the differing sentences. On a practical level, it would seem patently unreasonable to endorse a regime in which a defendant could steadfastly withhold cooperation from the authorities and then cry foul when a coconspirator benefits from rendering substantial assistance to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other \"new\" circumstance to which the appellant adverts is his claim that he committed the crimes because he needed money to provide for an ailing grandmother and parents who were being evicted from their home. This line of defense did not work for Jean Valjean, <i>cf.</i> Victor Hugo, Les Mis&#233;rables (Norman Denny trans., Penguin Books 1982) (1862), and we see no basis for a reasonable expectation that it would have worked here. After all, the sentencing court was aware of the appellant's familial obligations and it said nothing that might lead to a well-founded belief that those obligations ought to impact the length of the sentence. That silence, combined with the court's avowed reluctance even to give the appellant a sentence at the bottom of the GSR, leads to the conclusion that the appellant has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the <i>Booker</i> error had a prejudicial effect in this case. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201656\"><a href=\"/opinion/201656/united-states-v-martins/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 534 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant has not shown a reasonable probability that the lower court would have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory guidelines system, we reject his <i>Booker</i> challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The court below did not err in calculating the applicable GSR. It did, of course, commit <i>Booker</i> error, but that unpreserved error was not prejudicial (and, therefore, was not plain). Accordingly, there is no justification for disturbing the appellant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer throughout this opinion to the November 2002 edition of the sentencing guidelines<i>See United States v.

That point is of more than academic interest, as the contours of USSG &#167; 3E1.1(b) have changed materially.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
