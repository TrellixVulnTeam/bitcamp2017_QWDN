The mission of the Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) is \"to assure so far as\n\npossible . . . safe and healthful working conditions.\"                  29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 651(b).      Despite the salutary nature of that mission, there are\n\nlimits to what OSHA can demand of employers.                  This petition for\n\njudicial    review   entreats    us   to    draw   such   a   line:     to   excuse\n\ncompliance with an OSHA standard on grounds of infeasibility lest\n\nliteral enforcement of the standard cripple an entire segment of\n\nthe construction industry.        Discerning serious evidentiary gaps in\n\nthe petitioner's thesis, we deny the petition.\n\n              The facts are straightforward.        The petitioner, Harry C.\n\nCrooker & Sons, Inc. (Crooker), is a general contractor.                     On May\n\n16,   2006,    Crooker   was    performing    construction       work    for    the\n\nmunicipality of Brunswick, Maine. During the phase of the contract\n\nat issue here, Crooker was progressing down the length of Jordan\n\nAvenue, alternately digging up the earth on either side of the\n\nroad, and replacing underground storm drains, water pipes, and\n\nsewer pipes.      To facilitate the work, it used a virtual armada of\n\nheavy   equipment    including     bulldozers,      front-end     loaders,      and\n\nbackhoes.      The individual pieces of equipment were tall, and low-\n\nhanging power lines ran up and down the street.\n\n              On the date in question, OSHA compliance officer Steve\n\nWarner observed one particular backhoe, a CAT 330 excavator,\n\noperating in the vicinity of a 240-volt power line suspended\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\ffourteen feet from the ground.             By the driver's estimate, the\n\ndistance between the power line and the top of the machine was six\n\nto seven feet.      That was several feet fewer than the ten-foot\n\nclearance prescribed by an OSHA regulation governing the operation\n\nof mechanized equipment in the vicinity of energized, non-insulated\n\npower lines.    See 29 C.F.R. § 1926.600(a)(6).1       Warner wrote up the\n\nviolation and demanded immediate abatement of the hazard.\n\n           Several months later, OSHA issued a formal citation and\n\nimposed a $2,800 penalty.        Crooker contested the citation and\n\npenalty,   asserting    that   compliance      with   the   regulation    was\n\ninfeasible given the on-the-ground realities of carrying out this\n\ntype of work in a community like Brunswick.\n\n           In   April   of   2007,   the    parties   appeared   before    an\n\nadministrative law judge (ALJ).       See 29 U.S.C. § 659(c); see also\n\nP. Gioioso & Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC, 115 F.3d 100, 102-03 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (outlining administrative structure for OSHA enforcement).\n\nThrough briefing and evidence, Crooker advanced three grounds for\n\n\n\n     1\n      This    regulation     cross-references     29    C.F.R.              §\n1926.550(a)(15)(i), which provides that:\n     Except where electrical distribution and transmission\n     lines have been deenergized and visibly grounded at point\n     of work or where insulating barriers, not a part of or an\n     attachment to the equipment or machinery, have been\n     erected to prevent physical contact with the lines,\n     equipment or machines shall be operated proximate to\n     power lines only in accordance with the following . . .\n     [f]or lines rated 50 kV. or below, minimum clearance\n     between the lines and any part of the crane or load shall\n     be 10 feet.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdefenestrating    the   citation:   first,    that   compliance    with   the\n\nregulation was infeasible; second, that on these facts a general\n\nindustry standard, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.333, should be read to supplant\n\nthe regulation on which the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary)\n\nrelied; and third, that the power lines along Jordan Avenue were\n\nfully insulated, thus obviating the ten-foot clearance requirement.\n\nThe ALJ rejected this asseverational array, determined that the\n\nSecretary had made out a prima facie case of the violation of an\n\napplicable OSHA standard, found that prima facie case unrebutted,\n\nand upheld the citation and the associated penalty.             See Harry C.\n\nCrooker & Sons, Inc., 22 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1135 (2007).\n\n            Crooker petitioned for discretionary review before the\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission).\n\nIn that petition, it renewed the main arguments that it had\n\nadvanced before the ALJ and added a claim that the Secretary had\n\nnot established a prima facie case.          The Commission declined to\n\ngrant   review.    Consequently,     the     ALJ's   decision    became   the\n\nCommission's final order.     See 29 C.F.R. § 2200.90(d); see also P.\n\nGioioso, 115 F.3d at 103. This timely petition for judicial review\n\nfollowed.   See 29 U.S.C. § 660(a).\n\n            Judicial review of federal administrative decisions is\n\ndeferential, reflecting the respect owed to specialized bodies\n\ntasked with the orderly administration of national standards and\n\npolicies.   The Commission's adjudications, however, do not command\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fChevron deference.          See Martin v. OSHRC, 499 U.S. 144, 151-57\n\n(1991); A.J. McNulty & Co. v. Sec'y of Labor, 283 F.3d 328, 332\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2002); see generally Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nRes.    Def.     Council,     Inc.,     467    U.S.   837,     843-44     (1984).\n\nNevertheless, in the absence of a conflict with the Secretary's\n\ninterpretation of a regulation — and there is none here — a\n\nreviewing court will uphold the Commission's determinations as long\n\nas those determinations are not arbitrary, capricious, abusive of\n\nthe Commission's discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.                 See 5\n\nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see also Capeway Roofing Sys., Inc. v. Chao,\n\n391 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 2004).               As a subsidiary matter, the\n\nCommission's      factual    findings    will     stand    whenever     they    are\n\n\"supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"      29 U.S.C. § 660(a); see P. Gioioso, 115 F.3d at 108.\n\n              Crooker's most developed claim of error focuses on the\n\npurported infeasibility of complying with section 1926.600(a)(6).\n\nFor purposes of judicial review, the Commission's determination of\n\nfeasibility vel non qualifies as a factual finding.                   See, e.g.,\n\nA.J. McNulty, 283 F.3d at 334; S. Colo. Prestress v. OSHRC, 586\n\nF.2d 1342, 1351 (10th Cir. 1978).             We review it accordingly.\n\n              The premise on which Crooker's infeasibility argument\n\nrests   is     sound:   federal   law    recognizes       infeasibility    as    an\n\naffirmative defense in an enforcement action that charges an OSHA\n\nviolation.      See, e.g., E & R Erectors, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor, 107\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fF.3d 157, 163 (3d Cir. 1997).             To prevail on an infeasibility\n\ndefense,    the   employer    must    prove       (i)     that   compliance     with   a\n\nparticular standard either is impossible or will render performance\n\nof the work impossible; and (ii) that it (the employer) undertook\n\nalternative steps to protect its workers (or that no such steps\n\nwere available).     See Bancker Constr. Corp. v. Reich, 31 F.3d 32,\n\n34 (2d Cir. 1994).       And because infeasibility is an affirmative\n\ndefense, the employer must shoulder the burden of proving each of\n\nthese elements. See A.J. McNulty, 283 F.3d at 334; Bancker Constr.\n\n31 F.3d at 34; Brock v. Dun-Par Eng'd Form Co., 843 F.2d 1135,\n\n1138-40 (8th Cir. 1988).\n\n            In mounting an infeasibility defense here, Crooker paints\n\na bleak picture of awkward working conditions and on-the-job\n\nexigencies, including a jungle of low-hanging power lines and an\n\nurgent need to use bulky pieces of equipment to perform the\n\nessential    work.      Crooker      argues       that,    in    combination,    these\n\ncircumstances left it no practical choice but to operate within the\n\nten-foot radius surrounding the energized wires.\n\n            According    to   Crooker,        a    distinct      set   of   trenching\n\nregulations required it to use a backhoe on the scale of the\n\neleven-foot-tall CAT 330 Excavator.                 See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1926.650-\n\n.652.   As Crooker tells it, the use of that massive equipment\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\frendered it impossible to work underneath 14-foot-high power lines\n\nwhile maintaining anything close to a ten-foot clearance.2\n\n               Crooker    grants    that,    according    to   the    text     of   the\n\nregulation at issue, deenergizing the power lines would have solved\n\nthe    problem     by     mooting    the    ten-foot    clearance      requirement.\n\nAnticipating this riposte, it offered testimony and affidavits\n\nbefore the ALJ in an effort to show that deenergizing the power\n\nlines would have been a practical impossibility.                     The lines were\n\nservice drop lines (that is, lines carrying electricity from the\n\nmain       transmission    line     into   individual    residences      and    other\n\nstructures).      As such, they were to be found up and down the length\n\nof residential streets like Jordan Avenue and decommissioning them\n\nwould have required a stream of deenergization requests to the\n\npublic utility, Central Maine Power Company (CMP).\n\n               In an affidavit, an employee of CMP, Carol Purinton,\n\nstated that deenergization was the utility's \"least preferred\n\noption\" and in her experience would be unprecedented.                     Moreover,\n\ndeenergization of specific lines would require at least twenty-four\n\nhours notice to the affected customers.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      The ALJ gave some weight to Warner's testimony suggesting one\nway that Crooker could have maneuvered its backhoe in order to\nmaintain a ten-foot clearance at all times.        Although we may\nconsider Warner's testimony in this regard despite Crooker's\nobjection to his expertise, we find it unnecessary to do so in\norder to resolve this petition.\n\n                                           -7-\n\f            Although not insignificant, such problems fall short of\n\nsatisfying either of the elements of the infeasibility defense. As\n\nto the first element — impossibility — Crooker made only a showing\n\nof difficulty, not a showing of infeasibility.                Nothing in the\n\nrecord indicates that normal foresight, planning, and patience\n\nwould not have sufficed to handle the various notice requirements\n\noutlined by CMP's representative (and, thus, have paved the way for\n\ndeenergization).3       The fact that no prior pipe-laying operation\n\ninvolved    the     deenergization    of     service   drop    lines    is    not\n\ndispositive; the infrequent use of prophylactic measures is not a\n\nproxy for impossibility.        See Brock v. Williams Enter. of Ga.,\n\nInc., 832 F.2d 567, 573 (11th Cir. 1987).          Moreover, the fact that\n\ndeenergization had not occurred on other projects might well be\n\nexplained     by    factors   other   than     impossibility     —     say,   lax\n\nenforcement or a better layout of power lines.\n\n            Crooker places great emphasis on Purinton's statement\n\nthat deenergization was \"the least preferred option\" from CMP's\n\nstandpoint.        According to Crooker, this testimony indicates that\n\nany attempt at deenergization would have been an exercise in\n\nfutility.   We disagree.      At most, Purinton's words imply that CMP\n\n\n\n     3\n      Crooker's general superintendent, John Bishop, testified that\nshortly before the hearing he contacted CMP about deenergizing\npower lines and that his request was denied. This testimony does\nnot benefit Crooker's case: the record reveals that CMP refused to\ndeenergize the lines solely because Crooker failed to comply with\nCMP's stated notice requirements.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fwould first have explored and exhausted other possible means of\n\naccommodating a contractor's request.\n\n                Of course, the economics of the situation are relevant;\n\nit may be infeasible to require a company to purchase a bazooka to\n\nkill       an   ant.       Here,    however,       the     economics   do   not    make   a\n\ndispositive difference.\n\n                To     begin,   nothing       in   the     record   indicates     why    any\n\nadditional operating costs incident to deenergization could not be\n\npassed along to the municipality. Beyond that, there is nothing in\n\nthe record to indicate that compliance with this standard would\n\nrender the work so expensive as to become economically infeasible.\n\nConstruction standards may be economically feasible even though\n\nthey are financially burdensome.                   See S. Colo. Prestress, 586 F.2d\n\nat 1351.\n\n                It is even more clear that Crooker failed to present\n\nsufficient           evidence      to   satisfy      the    second     element    of     the\n\ninfeasibility           test:   that     it    had    sought    out    other     means    of\n\nprotecting           its   workforce      from       the    targeted    hazard     (here,\n\nelectrocution) or, in the alternative, that no such alternatives\n\nwere feasible. Crooker neither explored alternative means nor took\n\nalternative          precautions.4        Thus,      its    argument    reduces     to    an\n\n\n       4\n      Crooker does say that it took one precaution: employing\nspotters. But Crooker was independently required to use spotters\nwhen working in the vicinity of live power lines. See 29 C.F.R. §\n1926. 550(a)(15)(iv). Thus, the use of spotters cannot plausibly\nbe considered an alternative precaution.\n\n                                              -9-\n\finsistence that no alternative ways of safeguarding its personnel\n\nwere available.\n\n             Purinton's testimony sinks this ship.                   She outlined\n\nseveral specific alternatives, short of deenergization, that could\n\nhave   served   to     protect    Crooker's       employees.     These   included\n\n\"cover[ing] up\" or \"relocating\" power lines while work was ongoing.\n\nPerhaps these alternatives were themselves infeasible — but Crooker\n\nhad the burden of proof, and it offered no testimony on this score.\n\nIndeed, Crooker never contacted CMP prior to commencing work.\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.              As said, Crooker\n\nhad    the   burden     of     proof      on   its   affirmative      defense    of\n\ninfeasibility.       Given the paucity of evidence that it submitted\n\nwith respect to the elements of this defense, we cannot say that\n\nthe Commission erred in concluding that the burden of proving\n\ninfeasibility had not been carried.\n\n             Crooker    next     posits    that    the   Secretary   should     have\n\napplied a general industry standard, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.333, to this\n\nwork site instead of the standard specific to the use of mechanized\n\nequipment in the vicinity of live power lines.                 It contends that,\n\nunder certain circumstances, a general standard may be significantly\n\nmore appropriate than a more specific standard and, thus, may\n\npreempt the application of the latter.\n\n             In framing this contention, Crooker seeks to carve an\n\nexception into adamantine bedrock.                It is apodictic that if a\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fparticular workplace hazard is within the compass of both a general\n\nindustry standard and a specific standard, the latter standard\n\ncontrols    in   the   event   of   any    conflict.      See     29   C.F.R.   §\n\n1910.5(c)(1)-(2); see also Williams Enter., 832 F.2d at 570; cf.\n\nDravo Corp. v. OSHRC, 613 F.2d 1227, 1234 (3d Cir. 1980) (explaining\n\nthat \"the Secretary may hold an employer to the general industry\n\nstandards   in   those   situations       where   no   specific    standard     is\n\napplicable\").\n\n            This principle should come as no surprise.                  It is a\n\nconventional canon of legal interpretation that specific provisions\n\ntrump more general ones.       See, e.g., Edmonds v. United States, 520\n\nU.S. 651, 657 (1997) (\"Ordinarily, where a specific provision\n\nconflicts with a general one, the specific governs.\"); Gómez v.\n\nRivera Rodríguez, 344 F.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir. 2003) (similar); Paul\n\nRevere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Kirshhofer, 226 F.3d 15, 21 n.8\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (similar).       Crooker has directed us to no contrary\n\nauthority, whether in federal statutes, regulations, or case law.\n\n            Crooker's contention perhaps can be narrowly construed as\n\nadvocating the application of a more general standard exactly\n\nbecause compliance with a more specific standard is infeasible. But\n\nwe already have disposed of the infeasibility defense on other,\n\nindependent grounds, see supra, thereby rendering this more narrowly\n\ntargeted claim inapposite, too.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f          This brings us to Crooker's third assignment of error.\n\nThe Commission's ground rules require the Secretary to present a\n\nprima facie case of the violation of an OSHA standard.     See D.A.\n\nCollins Constr. Co. v. Sec'y of Labor, 117 F.3d 691, 694 (2d Cir.\n\n1997); N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor, 88 F.3d 98,\n\n105 (2d Cir. 1996); Ormet Corp., 14 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 2134, 2135\n\n(1991).   Crooker maintains that the Secretary defaulted on this\n\nobligation in two distinct respects: by failing to present evidence\n\nproving either that a hazard existed or that the power lines lacked\n\neffective insulation.    Both branches of this assertion evince\n\nmisconceptions about the allocation of burdens of proof.\n\n          The claim that the Secretary did not adduce evidence\n\nregarding the existence of a hazard is doubly flawed.      For one\n\nthing, it was waived.   Crooker omitted any mention of the claim in\n\nhis petition to the Commission for discretionary review.       That\n\nbrings into play the settled rule that objections not presented to\n\nthe Commission cannot be advanced in a subsequent petition for\n\njudicial review.   See 29 U.S.C. § 660(a); see also P. Gioioso, 115\n\nF.3d at 104-06.\n\n          To be sure, there is an exception to the exhaustion rule\n\nfor situations in which the failure to pursue an objection before\n\nthe Commission results from extraordinary circumstances.    See 29\n\nU.S.C. § 660(a). But nothing resembling extraordinary circumstances\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fis evident here. The exception is, therefore, inaccessible to Crooker.\n\n           We add that, even if not waived, the claim would founder\n\nbecause a standard that proscribes certain conditions presumes the\n\nexistence of a safety hazard.         Thus, \"the Secretary need not prove\n\nthat the violative conditions are actually hazardous.\"          Modern Drop\n\nForge Co. v.

Despite the salutary nature of that mission, there are limits to what OSHA can demand of employers. This petition for judicial review entreats us to draw such a line: to excuse compliance with an OSHA standard on grounds of infeasibility lest literal enforcement of the standard cripple an entire segment of the construction industry. Discerning serious evidentiary gaps in the petitioner's thesis, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The petitioner, Harry C. Crooker &amp; Sons, Inc. (Crooker), is a general contractor. On May 16, 2006, Crooker was performing construction work for the municipality of Brunswick, Maine. During the phase of the contract at issue here, Crooker was progressing down the length of Jordan Avenue, alternately digging up the earth on either side of the road, and replacing underground storm drains, water pipes, and sewer pipes. To facilitate the work, it used a virtual armada of heavy equipment including bulldozers, front-end loaders, and backhoes. The individual pieces of equipment were tall, and low-hanging power lines ran up and down the street.</p>\n<p>On the date in question, OSHA compliance officer Steve Warner observed one particular backhoe, a CAT 330 excavator, operating in the vicinity of a 240-volt power line suspended fourteen feet from the ground. By the driver's estimate, the distance between the power line and the top of the machine was six to seven feet. That was several feet fewer than the ten-foot clearance prescribed by an OSHA regulation governing the operation of mechanized equipment in the vicinity of energized, non-insulated power lines. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1926.600(a)(6).<sup>[1]</sup> Warner wrote up the violation and demanded immediate abatement of the hazard.</p>\n<p>Several months later, OSHA issued a formal citation and imposed a $2,800 penalty. Crooker contested the citation and penalty, asserting that compliance with the regulation was infeasible given the on-the-ground realities of carrying out this type of work in a community like Brunswick.</p>\n<p>In April of 2007, the parties appeared before an administrative law judge (ALJ). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 659(c); <i>see also </i><i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC,</i> 115 F.3d 100, 102-03 (1st Cir.1997) (outlining administrative structure for OSHA enforcement). Through briefing and evidence, Crooker advanced three grounds for defenestrating the citation: first, that compliance with the regulation was infeasible; second, that on these facts a general industry standard, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.333, should be read to supplant the regulation on which the Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> of Labor (the Secretary) relied; and third, that the power lines along Jordan Avenue were fully insulated, thus obviating the ten-foot clearance requirement. The ALJ rejected this asseverational array, determined that the Secretary had made out a prima facie case of the violation of an applicable OSHA standard, found that prima facie case unrebutted, and upheld the citation and the associated penalty. <i>See Harry C. Crooker &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 22 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1135 (2007).</p>\n<p>Crooker petitioned for discretionary review before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission). In that petition, it renewed the main arguments that it had advanced before the ALJ and added a claim that the Secretary had not established a prima facie case. The Commission declined to grant review. Consequently, the ALJ's decision became the Commission's final order. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 2200.90(d); <i>see also </i><i>P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 103. This timely petition for judicial review followed. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 660(a).</p>\n<p>Judicial review of federal administrative decisions is deferential, reflecting the respect owed to specialized bodies tasked with the orderly administration of national standards and policies. The Commission's adjudications, however, do not command <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Martin v. OSHRC,</i> 499 U.S. 144, 151-57, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991); <i>A.J. McNulty &amp; Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 283 F.3d 328, 332 (D.C.Cir.2002); <i>see generally </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Nevertheless, in the absence of a conflict with the Secretary's interpretation of a regulation  and there is none here  a reviewing court will uphold the Commission's determinations as long as those determinations are not arbitrary, capricious, abusive of the Commission's discretion, or otherwise contrary to law. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Capeway Roofing Sys., Inc. v. Chao,</i> 391 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.2004). As a subsidiary matter, the Commission's factual findings will stand whenever they are \"supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" 29 U.S.C. § 660(a); <i>see </i><i>P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 108.</p>\n<p>Crooker's most developed claim of error focuses on the purported infeasibility of complying with section 1926.600(a)(6). For purposes of judicial review, the Commission's determination of feasibility vel non qualifies as a factual finding. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>A.J. McNulty,</i> 283 F.3d at 334; <i>S. Colo. Prestress v. OSHRC,</i> 586 F.2d 1342, 1351 (10th Cir.1978). We review it accordingly.</p>\n<p>The premise on which Crooker's infeasibility argument rests is sound: federal law recognizes infeasibility as an affirmative defense in an enforcement action that charges an OSHA violation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>E &amp; R Erectors, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 107 F.3d 157, 163 (3d Cir.1997). To prevail on an infeasibility defense, the employer must prove (i) that compliance with a particular standard either is impossible or will render performance of the work impossible; and (ii) that it (the employer) undertook alternative steps to protect its workers (or that no such steps were available). <i>See </i><i>Bancker Constr. Corp. v. Reich,</i> 31 F.3d 32, 34 (2d Cir.1994). And because infeasibility is an affirmative defense, the employer must shoulder the burden of proving each of these elements. <i>See </i><i>A.J. McNulty,</i> 283 F.3d at 334; <i>Bancker Constr.,</i> 31 F.3d at 34; <i>Brock v. Dun-Par Eng'd Form Co.,</i> 843 F.2d 1135, 1138-40 (8th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>In mounting an infeasibility defense here, Crooker paints a bleak picture of awkward working conditions and on-the-job exigencies, including a jungle of low-hanging power lines and an urgent need to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> use bulky pieces of equipment to perform the essential work. Crooker argues that, in combination, these circumstances left it no practical choice but to operate within the ten-foot radius surrounding the energized wires.</p>\n<p>According to Crooker, a distinct set of trenching regulations required it to use a backhoe on the scale of the eleven-foot-tall CAT 330 Excavator. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. §§ 1926.650-.652. As Crooker tells it, the use of that massive equipment rendered it impossible to work underneath 14-foot-high power lines while maintaining anything close to a ten-foot clearance.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Crooker grants that, according to the text of the regulation at issue, deenergizing the power lines would have solved the problem by mooting the ten-foot clearance requirement. Anticipating this riposte, it offered testimony and affidavits before the ALJ in an effort to show that deenergizing the power lines would have been a practical impossibility. The lines were service drop lines (that is, lines carrying electricity from the main transmission line into individual residences and other structures). As such, they were to be found up and down the length of residential streets like Jordan Avenue and decommissioning them would have required a stream of deenergization requests to the public utility, Central Maine Power Company (CMP).</p>\n<p>In an affidavit, an employee of CMP, Carol Purinton, stated that deenergization was the utility's \"least preferred option\" and in her experience would be unprecedented. Moreover, deenergization of specific lines would require at least twenty-four hours notice to the affected customers.</p>\n<p>Although not insignificant, such problems fall short of satisfying either of the elements of the infeasibility defense. As to the first element  impossibility  Crooker made only a showing of difficulty, not a showing of infeasibility. Nothing in the record indicates that normal foresight, planning, and patience would not have sufficed to handle the various notice requirements outlined by CMP's representative (and, thus, have paved the way for deenergization).<sup>[3]</sup> The fact that no prior pipe-laying operation involved the deenergization of service drop lines is not dispositive; the infrequent use of prophylactic measures is not a proxy for impossibility. <i>See </i><i>Brock v. Williams Enter. of Ga., Inc.,</i> 832 F.2d 567, 573 (11th Cir.1987). Moreover, the fact that deenergization had not occurred on other projects might well be explained by factors other than impossibility  say, lax enforcement or a better layout of power lines.</p>\n<p>Crooker places great emphasis on Purinton's statement that deenergization was \"the least preferred option\" from CMP's standpoint. According to Crooker, this testimony indicates that any attempt at deenergization would have been an exercise in futility. We disagree. At most, Purinton's words imply that CMP would first have explored and exhausted other possible means of accommodating a contractor's request.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> Of course, the economics of the situation are relevant; it may be infeasible to require a company to purchase a bazooka to kill an ant. Here, however, the economics do not make a dispositive difference.</p>\n<p>To begin, nothing in the record indicates why any additional operating costs incident to deenergization could not be passed along to the municipality. Beyond that, there is nothing in the record to indicate that compliance with this standard would render the work so expensive as to become economically infeasible. Construction standards may be economically feasible even though they are financially burdensome. <i>See </i><i>S. Colo. Prestress,</i> 586 F.2d at 1351.</p>\n<p>It is even more clear that Crooker failed to present sufficient evidence to satisfy the second element of the infeasibility test: that it had sought out other means of protecting its workforce from the targeted hazard (here, electrocution) or, in the alternative, that no such alternatives were feasible. Crooker neither explored alternative means nor took alternative precautions.<sup>[4]</sup> Thus, its argument reduces to an insistence that no alternative ways of safeguarding its personnel were available.</p>\n<p>Purinton's testimony sinks this ship. She outlined several specific alternatives, short of deenergization, that could have served to protect Crooker's employees. These included \"cover[ing] up\" or \"relocating\" power lines while work was ongoing. Perhaps these alternatives were themselves infeasible  but Crooker had the burden of proof, and it offered no testimony on this score. Indeed, Crooker never contacted CMP prior to commencing work.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. As said, Crooker had the burden of proof on its affirmative defense of infeasibility. Given the paucity of evidence that it submitted with respect to the elements of this defense, we cannot say that the Commission erred in concluding that the burden of proving infeasibility had not been carried.</p>\n<p>Crooker next posits that the Secretary should have applied a general industry standard, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.333, to this work site instead of the standard specific to the use of mechanized equipment in the vicinity of live power lines. It contends that, under certain circumstances, a general standard may be significantly more appropriate than a more specific standard and, thus, may preempt the application of the latter.</p>\n<p>In framing this contention, Crooker seeks to carve an exception into adamantine bedrock. It is apodictic that if a particular workplace hazard is within the compass of both a general industry standard and a specific standard, the latter standard controls in the event of any conflict. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1910.5(c)(1)-(2); <i>see also </i><i>Williams Enter.,</i> 832 F.2d at 570; <i>cf. </i><i>Dravo Corp. v. OSHRC,</i> 613 F.2d 1227, 1234 (3d Cir.1980) (explaining that \"the Secretary may hold an employer to the general industry standards in those situations where no specific standard is applicable\").</p>\n<p>This principle should come as no surprise. It is a conventional canon of legal interpretation that specific provisions trump more general ones. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Edmond v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 651, 657, 117 S.Ct. 1573, 137 L.Ed.2d 917 (1997) (\"Ordinarily, where a specific provision conflicts with a general one, the specific <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> governs.\"); <i>Gómez v. Rivera Rodríguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir.2003) (similar); <i>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Ins. Co. v. Kirschhofer,</i> 226 F.3d 15, 21 n. 8 (1st Cir. 2000) (similar). Crooker has directed us to no contrary authority, whether in federal statutes, regulations, or case law.</p>\n<p>Crooker's contention perhaps can be narrowly construed as advocating the application of a more general standard exactly because compliance with a more specific standard is infeasible. But we already have disposed of the infeasibility defense on other, independent grounds, <i>see supra,</i> thereby rendering this more narrowly targeted claim inapposite, too.</p>\n<p>This brings us to Crooker's third assignment of error. The Commission's ground rules require the Secretary to present a prima facie case of the violation of an OSHA standard. <i>See </i><i>D.A. Collins Constr. Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 117 F.3d 691, 694 (2d Cir.1997); <i>N.Y. State Elec. &amp; Gas Corp. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 88 F.3d 98, 105 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Ormet Corp.,</i> 14 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 2134, 2135 (1991). Crooker maintains that the Secretary defaulted on this obligation in two distinct respects: by failing to present evidence proving either that a hazard existed or that the power lines lacked effective insulation. Both branches of this assertion evince misconceptions about the allocation of burdens of proof.</p>\n<p>The claim that the Secretary did not adduce evidence regarding the existence of a hazard is doubly flawed. For one thing, it was waived. Crooker omitted any mention of the claim in his petition to the Commission for discretionary review. That brings into play the settled rule that objections not presented to the Commission cannot be advanced in a subsequent petition for judicial review. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 660(a); <i>see also </i><i>P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 104-06.</p>\n<p>To be sure, there is an exception to the exhaustion rule for situations in which the failure to pursue an objection before the Commission results from extraordinary circumstances. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 660(a). But nothing resembling extraordinary circumstances is evident here. The exception is, therefore, inaccessible to Crooker.</p>\n<p>We add that, even if not waived, the claim would founder because a standard that proscribes certain conditions <i>presumes</i> the existence of a safety hazard. Thus, \"the Secretary need not prove that the violative conditions are actually hazardous.\" <i>Modern Drop Forge Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 683 F.2d 1105, 1114 (7th Cir. 1982); <i>see </i><i>Simplex Time Recorder Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 766 F.2d 575, 589 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1985) (explaining that proof of a violation of the specific standards directed to worker safety suffices to demonstrate the existence of a hazard). Where, as here, the Secretary promulgates a regulation prohibiting construction equipment from operating within ten feet of power lines carrying up to 50 kV, 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(15)(i), that regulation speaks for itself, <i>periculum ipsa loquitur.</i></p>\n<p>A similar misprision of the Secretary's burden undermines Crooker's assertion that the Secretary's prima facie case failed for lack of evidence that the power lines were uninsulated. The text of the applicable regulation identifies the existence of insulation as an exception to the standard. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(15) (\"Except ... where insulating barriers ... have been erected to prevent physical contact with the lines....\"). As such, an unbroken line of Commission precedent correctly places the burden of both production and persuasion on the party seeking to find shelter under that exception. <i>See, e.g., Kaspar Electroplating Corp.,</i> 16 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1517, 1522 (1993) (\"[T]he party claiming the benefit of an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*86</span> exception to the requirements of a standard has the burden of proof of its claim.\"); <i>Sec'y of Labor v. Stanbest, Inc.,</i> 11 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1222 (1983) (citing <i>United States v. First City Nat'l Bank of Houston,</i> 386 U.S. 361, 366, 87 S.Ct. 1088, 18 L.Ed.2d 151 (1967)) (same). This reasonable approach to interpretation is in harmony with the baseline rule for statutes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2395, 2400, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2008) (\"[T]he burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits.\") (quoting <i>FTC v. Morton Salt Co.,</i> 334 U.S. 37, 44-45, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (1948) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We therefore conclude that the Commission permissibly placed on Crooker the burden of proving the presence of effective insulation.</p>\n<p>To say more on these points would be supererogatory. The upshot is that the Secretary's prima facie case was not vitiated by the absence of proof that the power lines were uninsulated.</p>\n<p>As a parting shot, Crooker warns that, should we uphold the citation and concomitant penalty, we will be rendering the commonplace activity of laying sewer pipe much more burdensome, with dire consequences for infrastructure construction nationwide. Common sense, it says, is reason enough to forgo enforcement of the regulation. This argument lacks force.</p>\n<p>In the first place, the evidence in this case does not come close to justifying Crooker's perfervid rhetoric. The lack of proof regarding its claim of infeasibility is conspicuous.</p>\n<p>Equally as important, Crooker's warning misperceives our role. The courts of appeals are empowered to assure the reasonable application of OSHA regulations, not to recast those regulations in accordance with judicial intuitions about the proper balance between worker safety and the needs of business. <i>See </i><i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843-44 &amp; n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <i>Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co.,</i> 63 F.3d 1129, 1135 (1st Cir.1995). If the regulation here at issue unfairly disadvantages contractors a matter on which we do not pass-that is for the political branches,<sup>[5]</sup> not for the courts.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the petition for judicial review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This regulation cross-references 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(15)(i), which provides that:\n</p>\n<p>Except where electrical distribution and transmission lines have been deenergized and visibly grounded at point of work or where insulating barriers, not a part of or an attachment to the equipment or machinery, have been erected to prevent physical contact with the lines, equipment or machines shall be operated proximate to power lines only in accordance with the following... [f]or lines rated 50 kV. or below, minimum clearance between the lines and any part of the crane or load shall be 10 feet.</p>\n<p>[2]  The ALJ gave some weight to Warner's testimony suggesting one way that Crooker could have maneuvered its backhoe in order to maintain a ten-foot clearance at all times. Although we may consider Warner's testimony in this regard despite Crooker's objection to his expertise, we find it unnecessary to do so in order to resolve this petition.</p>\n<p>[3]  Crooker's general superintendent, John Bishop, testified that shortly before the hearing he contacted CMP about deenergizing power lines and that his request was denied. This testimony does not benefit Crooker's case: the record reveals that CMP refused to deenergize the lines solely because Crooker failed to comply with CMP's stated notice requirements.</p>\n<p>[4]  Crooker does say that it took one precaution: employing spotters. But Crooker was independently required to use spotters when working in the vicinity of live power lines. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1926. 550(a)(15)(iv). Thus, the use of spotters cannot plausibly be considered an alternative precaution.</p>\n<p>[5]  Among other options, OSHA has established a specific procedure for modifying or revoking standards when it is desirable to do so. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. §§ 1911.3-.18.</p>\n\n</div>",

Despite the salutary nature of that mission, there are limits to what OSHA can demand of employers. This petition for judicial review entreats us to draw such a line: to excuse compliance with an OSHA standard on grounds of infeasibility lest literal enforcement of the standard cripple an entire segment of the construction industry. Discerning serious evidentiary gaps in the petitioner's thesis, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The petitioner, Harry C. Crooker &amp; Sons, Inc. (Crooker), is a general contractor. On May 16, 2006, Crooker was performing construction work for the municipality of Brunswick, Maine. During the phase of the contract at issue here, Crooker was progressing down the length of Jordan Avenue, alternately digging up the earth on either side of the road, and replacing underground storm drains, water pipes, and sewer pipes. To facilitate the work, it used a virtual armada of heavy equipment including bulldozers, front-end loaders, and backhoes. The individual pieces of equipment were tall, and low-hanging power lines ran up and down the street.</p>\n<p>On the date in question, OSHA compliance officer Steve Warner observed one particular backhoe, a CAT 330 excavator, operating in the vicinity of a 240-volt power line suspended fourteen feet from the ground. By the driver's estimate, the distance between the power line and the top of the machine was six to seven feet. That was several feet fewer than the ten-foot clearance prescribed by an OSHA regulation governing the operation of mechanized equipment in the vicinity of energized, non-insulated power lines. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1926.600(a)(6).<sup>[1]</sup> Warner wrote up the violation and demanded immediate abatement of the hazard.</p>\n<p>Several months later, OSHA issued a formal citation and imposed a $2,800 penalty. Crooker contested the citation and penalty, asserting that compliance with the regulation was infeasible given the on-the-ground realities of carrying out this type of work in a community like Brunswick.</p>\n<p>In April of 2007, the parties appeared before an administrative law judge (ALJ). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 659(c); <i>see also </i><i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197419\"><a href=\"/opinion/197419/gioioso-v-oshrc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 102-03 (1st Cir.1997) (outlining administrative structure for OSHA enforcement). Through briefing and evidence, Crooker advanced three grounds for defenestrating the citation: first, that compliance with the regulation was infeasible; second, that on these facts a general industry standard, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.333, should be read to supplant the regulation on which the Secretary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> of Labor (the Secretary) relied; and third, that the power lines along Jordan Avenue were fully insulated, thus obviating the ten-foot clearance requirement. The ALJ rejected this asseverational array, determined that the Secretary had made out a prima facie case of the violation of an applicable OSHA standard, found that prima facie case unrebutted, and upheld the citation and the associated penalty. <i>See Harry C. Crooker &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 22 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1135 (2007).</p>\n<p>Crooker petitioned for discretionary review before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission). In that petition, it renewed the main arguments that it had advanced before the ALJ and added a claim that the Secretary had not established a prima facie case. The Commission declined to grant review. Consequently, the ALJ's decision became the Commission's final order. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 2200.90(d); <i>see also </i><i>P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 103. This timely petition for judicial review followed. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 660(a).</p>\n<p>Judicial review of federal administrative decisions is deferential, reflecting the respect owed to specialized bodies tasked with the orderly administration of national standards and policies. The Commission's adjudications, however, do not command <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See </i><i>Martin v.

Nevertheless, in the absence of a conflict with the Secretary's interpretation of a regulation  and there is none here  a reviewing court will uphold the Commission's determinations as long as those determinations are not arbitrary, capricious, abusive of the Commission's discretion, or otherwise contrary to law. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); <i>see also </i><i>Capeway Roofing Sys., Inc. v.

As a subsidiary matter, the Commission's factual findings will stand whenever they are \"supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" 29 U.S.C. § 660(a); <i>see </i><i>P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 108.</p>\n<p>Crooker's most developed claim of error focuses on the purported infeasibility of complying with section 1926.600(a)(6). For purposes of judicial review, the Commission's determination of feasibility vel non qualifies as a factual finding. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>A.J. McNulty,</i> 283 F.3d at 334; <i>S. Colo. Prestress v. OSHRC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360923\"><a href=\"/opinion/360923/6-osh-casbna-2032-1979-oshd-cch-p-23247-southern-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span>, 1351 (10th Cir.1978). We review it accordingly.</p>\n<p>The premise on which Crooker's infeasibility argument rests is sound: federal law recognizes infeasibility as an affirmative defense in an enforcement action that charges an OSHA violation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>E &amp; R Erectors, Inc. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736209\"><a href=\"/opinion/736209/e-r-erectors-inc-v-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 163 (3d Cir.1997). To prevail on an infeasibility defense, the employer must prove (i) that compliance with a particular standard either is impossible or will render performance of the work impossible; and (ii) that it (the employer) undertook alternative steps to protect its workers (or that no such steps were available). <i>See </i><i>Bancker Constr. Corp. v. Reich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675691\"><a href=\"/opinion/675691/bancker-construction-corp-v-robert-reich-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 34 (2d Cir.1994). And because infeasibility is an affirmative defense, the employer must shoulder the burden of proving each of these elements. <i>See </i><i>A.J. McNulty,</i> 283 F.3d at 334; <i>Bancker Constr.,</i> 31 F.3d at 34; <i>Brock v. Dun-Par Eng'd Form Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504067\"><a href=\"/opinion/504067/william-e-brock-secretary-of-labor-v-dun-par-engineered-form-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1135</span></a></span>, 1138-40 (8th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>In mounting an infeasibility defense here, Crooker paints a bleak picture of awkward working conditions and on-the-job exigencies, including a jungle of low-hanging power lines and an urgent need to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> use bulky pieces of equipment to perform the essential work. Crooker argues that, in combination, these circumstances left it no practical choice but to operate within the ten-foot radius surrounding the energized wires.</p>\n<p>According to Crooker, a distinct set of trenching regulations required it to use a backhoe on the scale of the eleven-foot-tall CAT 330 Excavator. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. §§ 1926.650-.652. As Crooker tells it, the use of that massive equipment rendered it impossible to work underneath 14-foot-high power lines while maintaining anything close to a ten-foot clearance.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Crooker grants that, according to the text of the regulation at issue, deenergizing the power lines would have solved the problem by mooting the ten-foot clearance requirement. Anticipating this riposte, it offered testimony and affidavits before the ALJ in an effort to show that deenergizing the power lines would have been a practical impossibility. The lines were service drop lines (that is, lines carrying electricity from the main transmission line into individual residences and other structures). As such, they were to be found up and down the length of residential streets like Jordan Avenue and decommissioning them would have required a stream of deenergization requests to the public utility, Central Maine Power Company (CMP).</p>\n<p>In an affidavit, an employee of CMP, Carol Purinton, stated that deenergization was the utility's \"least preferred option\" and in her experience would be unprecedented. Moreover, deenergization of specific lines would require at least twenty-four hours notice to the affected customers.</p>\n<p>Although not insignificant, such problems fall short of satisfying either of the elements of the infeasibility defense. As to the first element  impossibility  Crooker made only a showing of difficulty, not a showing of infeasibility. Nothing in the record indicates that normal foresight, planning, and patience would not have sufficed to handle the various notice requirements outlined by CMP's representative (and, thus, have paved the way for deenergization).<sup>[3]</sup> The fact that no prior pipe-laying operation involved the deenergization of service drop lines is not dispositive; the infrequent use of prophylactic measures is not a proxy for impossibility. <i>See </i><i>Brock v. Williams Enter. of Ga., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496762\"><a href=\"/opinion/496762/william-e-brock-secretary-of-labor-v-williams-enterprises-of-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 573 (11th Cir.1987). Moreover, the fact that deenergization had not occurred on other projects might well be explained by factors other than impossibility  say, lax enforcement or a better layout of power lines.</p>\n<p>Crooker places great emphasis on Purinton's statement that deenergization was \"the least preferred option\" from CMP's standpoint. According to Crooker, this testimony indicates that any attempt at deenergization would have been an exercise in futility. We disagree. At most, Purinton's words imply that CMP would first have explored and exhausted other possible means of accommodating a contractor's request.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> Of course, the economics of the situation are relevant; it may be infeasible to require a company to purchase a bazooka to kill an ant. Here, however, the economics do not make a dispositive difference.</p>\n<p>To begin, nothing in the record indicates why any additional operating costs incident to deenergization could not be passed along to the municipality. Beyond that, there is nothing in the record to indicate that compliance with this standard would render the work so expensive as to become economically infeasible. Construction standards may be economically feasible even though they are financially burdensome. <i>See </i><i>S. Colo. Prestress,</i> 586 F.2d at 1351.</p>\n<p>It is even more clear that Crooker failed to present sufficient evidence to satisfy the second element of the infeasibility test: that it had sought out other means of protecting its workforce from the targeted hazard (here, electrocution) or, in the alternative, that no such alternatives were feasible. Crooker neither explored alternative means nor took alternative precautions.<sup>[4]</sup> Thus, its argument reduces to an insistence that no alternative ways of safeguarding its personnel were available.</p>\n<p>Purinton's testimony sinks this ship. She outlined several specific alternatives, short of deenergization, that could have served to protect Crooker's employees. These included \"cover[ing] up\" or \"relocating\" power lines while work was ongoing. Perhaps these alternatives were themselves infeasible  but Crooker had the burden of proof, and it offered no testimony on this score. Indeed, Crooker never contacted CMP prior to commencing work.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. As said, Crooker had the burden of proof on its affirmative defense of infeasibility. Given the paucity of evidence that it submitted with respect to the elements of this defense, we cannot say that the Commission erred in concluding that the burden of proving infeasibility had not been carried.</p>\n<p>Crooker next posits that the Secretary should have applied a general industry standard, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.333, to this work site instead of the standard specific to the use of mechanized equipment in the vicinity of live power lines. It contends that, under certain circumstances, a general standard may be significantly more appropriate than a more specific standard and, thus, may preempt the application of the latter.</p>\n<p>In framing this contention, Crooker seeks to carve an exception into adamantine bedrock. It is apodictic that if a particular workplace hazard is within the compass of both a general industry standard and a specific standard, the latter standard controls in the event of any conflict. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1910.5(c)(1)-(2); <i>see also </i><i>Williams Enter.,</i> 832 F.2d at 570; <i>cf. </i><i>Dravo Corp. v. OSHRC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373886\"><a href=\"/opinion/373886/7-osh-casbna-2089-1980-oshd-cch-p-24154-dravo-corporation-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1234 (3d Cir.1980) (explaining that \"the Secretary may hold an employer to the general industry standards in those situations where no specific standard is applicable\").</p>\n<p>This principle should come as no surprise. It is a conventional canon of legal interpretation that specific provisions trump more general ones. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Edmond v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118113\"><a href=\"/opinion/118113/edmond-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 657, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118113\"><a href=\"/opinion/118113/edmond-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Crooker has directed us to no contrary authority, whether in federal statutes, regulations, or case law.</p>\n<p>Crooker's contention perhaps can be narrowly construed as advocating the application of a more general standard exactly because compliance with a more specific standard is infeasible. But we already have disposed of the infeasibility defense on other, independent grounds, <i>see supra,</i> thereby rendering this more narrowly targeted claim inapposite, too.</p>\n<p>This brings us to Crooker's third assignment of error. The Commission's ground rules require the Secretary to present a prima facie case of the violation of an OSHA standard. <i>See </i><i>D.A. Collins Constr. Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743073\"><a href=\"/opinion/743073/da-collins-construction-co-inc-v-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span>, 694 (2d Cir.1997); <i>N.Y.

Cas. (BNA) 2134, 2135 (1991). Crooker maintains that the Secretary defaulted on this obligation in two distinct respects: by failing to present evidence proving either that a hazard existed or that the power lines lacked effective insulation. Both branches of this assertion evince misconceptions about the allocation of burdens of proof.</p>\n<p>The claim that the Secretary did not adduce evidence regarding the existence of a hazard is doubly flawed. For one thing, it was waived. Crooker omitted any mention of the claim in his petition to the Commission for discretionary review. That brings into play the settled rule that objections not presented to the Commission cannot be advanced in a subsequent petition for judicial review. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 660(a); <i>see also </i><i>P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 104-06.</p>\n<p>To be sure, there is an exception to the exhaustion rule for situations in which the failure to pursue an objection before the Commission results from extraordinary circumstances. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 660(a). But nothing resembling extraordinary circumstances is evident here. The exception is, therefore, inaccessible to Crooker.</p>\n<p>We add that, even if not waived, the claim would founder because a standard that proscribes certain conditions <i>presumes</i> the existence of a safety hazard. Thus, \"the Secretary need not prove that the violative conditions are actually hazardous.\" <i>Modern Drop Forge Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406482\"><a href=\"/opinion/406482/modern-drop-forge-company-v-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span>, 1114 (7th Cir. 1982); <i>see </i><i>Simplex Time Recorder Co. v.

Where, as here, the Secretary promulgates a regulation prohibiting construction equipment from operating within ten feet of power lines carrying up to 50 kV, 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(15)(i), that regulation speaks for itself, <i>periculum ipsa loquitur.</i></p>\n<p>A similar misprision of the Secretary's burden undermines Crooker's assertion that the Secretary's prima facie case failed for lack of evidence that the power lines were uninsulated. The text of the applicable regulation identifies the existence of insulation as an exception to the standard. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(15) (\"Except ... where insulating barriers ... have been erected to prevent physical contact with the lines....\"). As such, an unbroken line of Commission precedent correctly places the burden of both production and persuasion on the party seeking to find shelter under that exception. <i>See, e.g., Kaspar Electroplating Corp.,</i> 16 O.S.H.

The upshot is that the Secretary's prima facie case was not vitiated by the absence of proof that the power lines were uninsulated.</p>\n<p>As a parting shot, Crooker warns that, should we uphold the citation and concomitant penalty, we will be rendering the commonplace activity of laying sewer pipe much more burdensome, with dire consequences for infrastructure construction nationwide. Common sense, it says, is reason enough to forgo enforcement of the regulation. This argument lacks force.</p>\n<p>In the first place, the evidence in this case does not come close to justifying Crooker's perfervid rhetoric. The lack of proof regarding its claim of infeasibility is conspicuous.</p>\n<p>Equally as important, Crooker's warning misperceives our role. The courts of appeals are empowered to assure the reasonable application of OSHA regulations, not to recast those regulations in accordance with judicial intuitions about the proper balance between worker safety and the needs of business. <i>See </i><i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843-44 &amp; n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the regulation here at issue unfairly disadvantages contractors a matter on which we do not pass-that is for the political branches,<sup>[5]</sup> not for the courts.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the petition for judicial review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This regulation cross-references 29 C.F.R. § 1926.550(a)(15)(i), which provides that:\n</p>\n<p>Except where electrical distribution and transmission lines have been deenergized and visibly grounded at point of work or where insulating barriers, not a part of or an attachment to the equipment or machinery, have been erected to prevent physical contact with the lines, equipment or machines shall be operated proximate to power lines only in accordance with the following... [f]or lines rated 50 kV. or below, minimum clearance between the lines and any part of the crane or load shall be 10 feet.</p>\n<p>[2]  The ALJ gave some weight to Warner's testimony suggesting one way that Crooker could have maneuvered its backhoe in order to maintain a ten-foot clearance at all times. Although we may consider Warner's testimony in this regard despite Crooker's objection to his expertise, we find it unnecessary to do so in order to resolve this petition.</p>\n<p>[3]  Crooker's general superintendent, John Bishop, testified that shortly before the hearing he contacted CMP about deenergizing power lines and that his request was denied. This testimony does not benefit Crooker's case: the record reveals that CMP refused to deenergize the lines solely because Crooker failed to comply with CMP's stated notice requirements.</p>\n<p>[4]  Crooker does say that it took one precaution: employing spotters. But Crooker was independently required to use spotters when working in the vicinity of live power lines. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. § 1926. 550(a)(15)(iv). Thus, the use of spotters cannot plausibly be considered an alternative precaution.</p>\n<p>[5]  Among other options, OSHA has established a specific procedure for modifying or revoking standards when it is desirable to do so. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. §§ 1911.3-.18.</p>\n\n</div>",
