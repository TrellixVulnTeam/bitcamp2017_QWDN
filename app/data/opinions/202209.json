After   a     jury   trial,    Chase   Martin   was\n\nconvicted on three counts--two of drug dealing and one of being a\n\nfelon in possession.      21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1)\n\n(2000).   He had a prior state-court conviction for armed robbery\n\nand assault and battery growing out of a dispute about a bicycle,\n\nbut because the present offense occurred while Martin was on\n\nprobation,   he    fell     within   criminal       history   category   II.    At\n\nsentencing, Martin was sentenced to 135 months, the bottom of the\n\nguideline range.\n\n           The appeal period being still open when Booker was\n\ndecided, Martin now asks for a remand on the ground that he might\n\nexpect a lower sentence under the current advisory guideline\n\nregime.   See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).               As the\n\nissue was not preserved, the burden is on Martin to show a\n\nreasonable likelihood of such an outcome.               See United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 223-24 (1st Cir. 2005).                 In the peculiar\n\ncircumstances of Booker, we have not been overly demanding.\n\n           In Martin's favor is his youth, sparse criminal history,\n\nand the psychological impact of severe injuries he suffered at age\n\n16 as the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting.                     Martin has\n\nproffered a psychological report, providing more detail about this\n\nincident than what was offered at sentencing; and although the\n\ngovernment objects, we have been willing in the context of Booker\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fremand requests to consider a reasonable proffer.           Heldeman, 402\n\nF.3d at 224.\n\n           The district court's remarks at sentencing are ambiguous.\n\nThe judge properly emphasized the seriousness of Martin's present\n\ncrimes but he seemed sympathetic to the argument that Martin was at\n\nbest a borderline candidate for criminal history category II; and\n\nthe   psychological   information    now   available   is   perhaps      more\n\ncompelling than what was available at the time of the sentencing.\n\nWe note also that Martin was sentenced at the bottom of the\n\nguideline range.\n\n           Under   the   circumstances,     we    think     a   remand    is\n\nappropriate, but it should not be taken as predicting that Martin\n\nwill get a significantly lower sentence.         The sentence is vacated\n\nand the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f",
