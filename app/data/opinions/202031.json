Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n                          _______________\n\n\n\n                           January 24, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern    District   of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.    Victor Garza appeals\n\nhis conviction on two counts of distribution of crack cocaine.   At\n\ntrial, he claimed to have been a victim of mistaken identity,\n\ncontending that it was his uncle Alejandro who participated in the\n\ndrug deals for which he was convicted, not Garza.          The jury\n\nrejected the claim and convicted Garza.     On appeal Garza raises\n\nthree contentions: that he was denied due process by reason of the\n\nstate’s destruction of the drugs and tape recordings which were\n\nevidence of the drug deals; that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting a transcript of the lost tapes; and that the statute of\n\nlimitations had run before Garza was brought to trial.      Finding\n\nnone of the contentions to have merit, we affirm the conviction.\n\nI.   DUE PROCESS VIOLATION\n\n          The drug transactions underlying Garza’s convictions were\n\n\"controlled buys\" organized and arranged by Sergeant Robert Quinn,\n\na narcotics officer with the New Hampshire State Police, with the\n\nhelp of an informant.   These buys took place in 1996.    Garza was\n\nnot apprehended until 2004.\n\n          The evidence collected from these buys consisted of the\n\ndrugs purchased, as well as a tape recording of a telephone\n\nconversation between the informant and the drug seller, and a\n\nsecond tape recording of a brief conversation during the exchange\n\nof drugs for money in the informant’s apartment while Sergeant\n\nQuinn was in the apartment.   The drugs and the tapes were stored in\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthe State Police Forensic Laboratory.               Pursuant to its regular\n\npractice, the laboratory from time to time sent out a list of\n\nevidence items in its possession that might be disposed of, either\n\nbecause a case has been closed, or is stale, or has been abandoned.\n\nSergeant Quinn regularly received this list from the laboratory and\n\nuntil 2002 directed the lab to retain the evidence from Garza’s\n\ncase.   In 2002, when the case was again listed, Sergeant Quinn\n\nauthorized destruction of the drugs.          The laboratory then applied\n\nfor a court order authorizing destruction.             The order was issued\n\nand the drugs were destroyed. Unbeknownst to Quinn, the laboratory\n\nalso destroyed the tape recordings.            Two years later Garza was\n\napprehended and the government proceeded to trial on the charges.\n\n           Garza moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that the\n\ndestruction of the evidence violated his due process rights. After\n\nan evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion. It\n\nfound that the evidence was only potentially useful, not materially\n\nexculpatory,    to    Garza   and,   that    while    the    destruction   was\n\nnegligent, there was “little suggestion of bad faith.”\n\n           On appeal, Garza contends that the district court erred\n\nin   finding   no    bad   faith.    He    argues    that   Sergeant   Quinn’s\n\ndeliberate destruction of evidence he knew to be relevant to a\n\nstill open case, contrary to the usual procedure, compels a finding\n\nof bad faith.       We review the district court’s fact findings for\n\nclear error and its legal conclusions de novo.              See United States\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fv. Gallant, 25 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying clearly\n\nerroneous standard to district court's conclusions regarding bad\n\nfaith).\n\n            In California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479 (1984), the\n\nSupreme Court held that for destruction or loss of evidence to\n\nconstitute a constitutional violation, \"the evidence must both\n\npossess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence\n\nwas destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be\n\nunable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available\n\nmeans.\"    Id. at 489.   In Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51 (1988),\n\nthe Court further held that where lost or destroyed evidence is\n\ndeemed to be only potentially exculpatory, as opposed to apparently\n\nexculpatory,    the    defendant   must   show    that     the   evidence   was\n\ndestroyed in bad faith.      Id. at 58.\n\n            Garza     does   not    challenge     the      district   court’s\n\ndetermination that the drugs and tapes were only potentially\n\nexculpatory, not apparently exculpatory.            But he maintains that\n\nunder     the   circumstances      of   this     case,     Sergeant   Quinn's\n\nauthorization of destruction of the evidence amounts to bad faith.\n\n           While the evidence was destroyed as a result of Quinn’s\n\nconscious and deliberate decision, intentionality is not enough to\n\nshow bad faith.     Gallant, 25 F.3d at 39 n.2.          Even if, as found by\n\nthe district court, Sergeant Quinn’s actions were “short-sighted and\n\neven negligent,” this does not satisfy the requirement of bad faith.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fSee United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990, 995 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding\n\nthat the \"district court clearly erred in finding a due process\n\nviolation     because   [the   evidence]   was    destroyed   due   to   the\n\ngovernment’s gross negligence, not bad faith\").           Garza must show\n\n“independent evidence that the [government] was somehow improperly\n\nmotivated.”    Gallant, 25 F.3d at 39 n.2.       Sergeant Quinn's apparent\n\ndesire to free up space in the laboratory was not an improper\n\nmotivation. Moreover, that the evidence was destroyed in the course\n\nof implementing routine procedures militates against a finding of\n\nbad faith. See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1340 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (finding no bad faith in routine destruction of surveillance\n\ntapes); United States v. Arra, 630 F.2d 836, 849 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(holding that erasure of Coast Guard tapes was done in good faith\n\nas part of a routine that was not related to the case).        Here, Quinn\n\ndid not single out the evidence in Garza’s case, but authorized its\n\ndestruction only after the laboratory had repeatedly placed the case\n\non a list of old cases for the purpose of purging the storage\n\nfacility.   While Garza argues that it was not “normal” procedure to\n\ndestroy evidence in cases that were still open, there is no evidence\n\nthat Quinn was motivated by malice or bad faith in authorizing the\n\ndestruction.     Nor does the fact that the evidence was destroyed\n\nbefore trial support a finding of bad faith.              See Illinois v.\n\nFisher, 540 U.S. 544, 548 (2004) (finding no due process violation\n\nin destruction of evidence even though defendant had requested the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fevidence prior to becoming a fugitive); Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 482-\n\n83, 488 (finding no bad faith where evidence was destroyed before\n\ndefendants were charged); Femia, 9 F.3d at 991-92, 994 (finding no\n\nbad faith where evidence was destroyed even though defendant had\n\nbeen charged and remained a fugitive); Picariello, 568 F.2d 222,\n\n227-28 (finding no bad faith where evidence was destroyed four\n\nmonths prior to trial).\n\n          Garza seeks to avoid a bad faith hurdle by arguing that\n\nthe destruction of the evidence constitutes a violation of Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S.\n\n97 (1976).    His premise is that Youngblood and Trombetta apply to\n\nsituations where the police authorize destruction of evidence, as\n\nopposed to authorization by a prosecutor.           Whenever the prosecutor\n\nauthorizes destruction of evidence, he contends, Brady applies,\n\nrequiring no showing of bad faith.             Here, Garza argues, because\n\nSergeant Quinn may have spoken to              a   prosecutor who may have\n\nauthorized destruction of the evidence, due process was violated\n\nregardless of whether there was bad faith.\n\n          Garza misapprehends the distinction between the Brady and\n\nYoungblood lines of cases.       That distinction rests on the nature of\n\nthe evidence and whether or not the evidence is still in existence,\n\nnot who authorized destruction of the evidence.                 \"Brady and its\n\nprogeny address exculpatory evidence still in the government's\n\npossession.     Youngblood   .    .   .     govern[s]   cases   in   which   the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fgovernment no longer possesses the disputed evidence.\"            Femia,\n\n9 F.3d at 993.\n\n           For a Brady violation to occur, the evidence must be not\n\nonly in existence but also materially exculpatory.       Agurs, 427 U.S.\n\nat 105-06.      Here, the district court found that the evidence was,\n\nat best, only potentially exculpatory, and Garza has not challenged\n\nthat determination.\n\n           We conclude that the district court did not err in denying\n\nGarza’s motion to dismiss.\n\nII.   READING OF THE TRANSCRIPTS\n\n           At trial the government offered the transcripts of the\n\ntape recordings.      Garza objected for lack of authentication. The\n\ndistrict court did not receive the transcripts into evidence but\n\npermitted the government to read them to the jury, holding that they\n\nconstituted past recollection recorded admissible under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 803(5).      While Garza argues that the district court\n\nerred, we need not address this issue for the government defends\n\nthe ruling on a different ground.\n\n           The government argues that the transcripts were admissible\n\nas party admissions under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), exempting from the\n\nhearsay rule a party’s own statement when offered against that\n\nparty.     The government argues here that there was sufficient\n\nevidence   to    establish,   for   admissibility   purposes,   that   the\n\ntranscript included Garza's admissions.       While this rationale was\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnot addressed by the district court, this court may affirm the\n\nadmission of evidence on a ground that the district court did not\n\nconsider. See United States v. Cabrera-Polo, 376 F.3d 29, 31 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n           Admitting the transcripts on the ground that they contain\n\nstatements by Garza is not inconsistent with trying Garza's defense\n\nthat he was not involved in the drug deals.          That is because the\n\nevidentiary requirement for testing the admissibility of evidence\n\ndiffers from that governing criminal liability.          \"The inquiry made\n\nby a court concerned with these matters is not whether the proponent\n\nof the evidence wins or loses his case on the merits, but whether\n\nthe evidentiary Rules have been satisfied. Thus, the evidentiary\n\nstandard is unrelated to the burden of proof on the substantive\n\nissues.\"     Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 175 (1987).\n\nQuestions of admissibility are decided by the court, Fed. R. Evid.\n\n104(a),    using   the   preponderance    of   the   evidence   standard.\n\nBourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175-76.    So long as there is a preponderance\n\nof evidence indicating that it was Garza’s voice on the tapes, the\n\ntranscripts could be treated as containing his admission.              See\n\nUnited States v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir. 1989) (finding\n\nsufficient    circumstantial   evidence   to   support    admission   of   a\n\ndocument as a party admission where the defendant denied being the\n\nauthor of the document); see also United States v. Lang, 364 F.3d\n\n1210, 1222-23 (10th Cir. 2004) (\"the government need only prove by\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fa preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] made the\n\nstatements in question\"), vacated, 125 S. Ct. 986, reinstated\n\n405 F.3d 1060, 1061 (10th Cir. 2005).       Here, both the informant and\n\nSergeant Quinn identified Garza as the individual who sold the\n\ndrugs.   Both testified to the phone call to Garza and the placement\n\nof a recording device in the bedroom where the drug transaction took\n\nplace. These facts sufficed to support a finding by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that Garza made the transcribed statements.\n\n           Even   if   the   district    court   erred   in    allowing   the\n\ntranscripts to be read to the jury, the error was harmless.               \"A\n\nnon-constitutional evidentiary error is harmless (and, therefore,\n\ndoes not require a new trial) so long as it is highly probable that\n\nthe error did not influence the verdict.\"        United States v. Piper,\n\n298 F.3d 47, 56 (1st Cir. 2002).         It is highly unlikely that the\n\nreading of the transcripts influenced the verdict.            The transcripts\n\nmerely described the setup and execution of a drug deal between a\n\nconfidential informant and a drug seller.        Garza’s defense was not\n\nthat the call and drug deal did not occur but that they involved\n\nsomeone else.     The court instructed the jury that the transcripts\n\nwere not evidence to be considered in deciding that issue.             Garza\n\nwas not prejudiced by the reading of the transcript to the jury.\n\nIII. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n\n           In an additional pro se brief, Garza contends that because\n\nthe drug sales occurred in 1996, more than five years before his\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\ftrial, the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nTitle 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a) divests a federal court of jurisdiction\n\nover a non-capital offense committed more than five years before an\n\nindictment is found or an information instituted.                 Garza was\n\nindicted on July 10, 1996, less than one month after the drug\n\ntransactions.    At all times prior to Garza’s arrest and trial, the\n\nindictment remained pending.1\n\n           Garza’s contention that there was no sufficient indictment\n\nis belied by the record, which includes the indictment.            If there\n\nwere any defects in the indictment, the failure                to raise an\n\nobjection before trial constitutes a waiver.             Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n12(b)(2); United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n     For   the   reasons   stated,    the   conviction   and   judgment   are\n\n\n\n     1\n      As Garza's pro se brief broadly characterizes this delay as\na violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, we consider\nwhether this delay violated Garza's Sixth Amendment right to a\nspeedy trial. From statements made at the sentencing hearing, it\nappears that Garza was in Mexico for seven and a half of the eight\nyears between his indictment and arrest. The government contacted\nGarza's family in New Hampshire over the years, unsuccessfully\ntrying to find Garza. Garza was arrested at the first practical\nopportunity, when he illegally re-entered the country in February\n2004.    After his arrest, the government acted promptly in\ntransferring Garza to New Hampshire and bringing this case to\ntrial. Under these facts, there is no showing that the government\nfailed to exercise diligence, and therefore no violation of Garza's\nright to a speedy trial. See United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104,\n113 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\faffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                        -11-\n\f",

Youngblood,</i> 488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988), the Court further held that where lost or destroyed evidence is deemed to be only potentially exculpatory, as opposed to apparently exculpatory, the defendant must show that the evidence was destroyed in bad faith. <i>Id.</i> at 58, 109 S.Ct. 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza does not challenge the district court's determination that the drugs and tapes were only potentially exculpatory, not apparently exculpatory. But he maintains that under the circumstances of this case, Sergeant Quinn's authorization of destruction of the evidence amounts to bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the evidence was destroyed as a result of Quinn's conscious and deliberate decision, intentionality is not enough to show bad faith. <i>Gallant,</i> 25 F.3d at 39 n. 2. Even if, as found by the district court, Sergeant Quinn's actions were \"short-sighted and even negligent,\" this does not satisfy the requirement of bad faith. <i>See United States v. Femia,</i> 9 F.3d 990, 995 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that the \"district court clearly erred in finding a due process violation because [the evidence] was destroyed due to the government's gross negligence, not bad faith\"). Garza must show \"independent evidence that the [government] was somehow improperly motivated.\" <i>Gallant,</i> 25 F.3d at 39 n. 2. Sergeant Quinn's apparent desire to free up space in the laboratory was not an improper motivation. Moreover, that the evidence was destroyed in the course of implementing routine procedures militates against a finding of bad faith. <i>See United States v. Lewis,</i> 40 F.3d 1325, 1340 (1st Cir.1994) (finding no bad faith in routine destruction of surveillance tapes); <i>United States v. Arra,</i> 630 F.2d 836, 849 (1st Cir.1980) (holding that erasure of Coast Guard tapes was done in good faith as part of a routine that was not related to the case). Here, Quinn did not single out the evidence in Garza's case, but authorized its destruction only after the laboratory had repeatedly placed the case on a list of old cases for the purpose of purging the storage facility. While Garza argues that it was not \"normal\" procedure to destroy evidence in cases that were still open, there is no evidence that Quinn was motivated by malice or bad faith in authorizing the destruction. Nor does the fact that the evidence was destroyed before trial support a finding of bad faith. <i>See Illinois v. Fisher,</i> 540 U.S. 544, 548, 124 S.Ct. 1200, 157 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2004) (finding no due process violation in destruction of evidence even though defendant had requested the evidence prior to becoming a fugitive); <i>Trombetta,</i> 467 U.S. at 482-83, 488, 104 S.Ct. 2528 (finding no bad faith where evidence was destroyed before defendants were charged); <i>Femia,</i> 9 F.3d at 991-92, 994 (finding no bad faith where evidence was destroyed even though defendant had been charged and remained a fugitive); <i>Picariello,</i> 568 F.2d 222, 227-28 (finding no bad faith where evidence was destroyed four months prior to trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza seeks to avoid a bad faith hurdle by arguing that the destruction of the evidence constitutes a violation of <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). His premise is that <i>Youngblood</i> and <i>Trombetta</i> apply to situations where the <i>police</i> authorize destruction of evidence, as opposed to authorization by a <i>prosecutor.</i> Whenever the prosecutor authorizes destruction of evidence, he contends, <i>Brady</i> applies, requiring no showing of bad faith. Here, Garza argues, because Sergeant Quinn may have spoken to a prosecutor who may have authorized destruction of the evidence, due process was violated regardless of whether there was bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza misapprehends the distinction between the <i>Brady</i> and <i>Youngblood</i> lines of cases. That distinction rests on the nature of the evidence and whether or not the evidence is still in existence, not who authorized destruction of the evidence. \"<i>Brady</i> and its progeny address exculpatory evidence still in the government's possession. <i>Youngblood</i>... govern[s] cases in which the government no longer possesses the disputed evidence.\" <i>Femia,</i> 9 F.3d at 993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a <i>Brady</i> violation to occur, the evidence must be not only in existence but also materially exculpatory. <i>Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. at 105-06, 96 S.Ct. 2392. Here, the district court found that the evidence was, at best, only potentially exculpatory, and Garza has not challenged that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Garza's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. READING OF THE TRANSCRIPTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the government offered the transcripts of the tape recordings. Garza objected for lack of authentication. The district court did not receive the transcripts into evidence but permitted the government to read them to the jury, holding that they constituted past recollection recorded admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(5). While Garza argues that the district court erred, we need not address this issue for the government defends the ruling on a different ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the transcripts were admissible as party admissions under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), exempting from the hearsay rule a party's own statement when offered against that party. The government argues here that there was sufficient evidence to establish, for admissibility purposes, that the transcript included Garza's admissions. While this rationale was not addressed by the district court, this court may affirm the admission of evidence on a ground that the district court did not consider. <i>See United States v. Cabrera-Polo,</i> 376 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admitting the transcripts on the ground that they contain statements by Garza is not inconsistent with trying Garza's defense that he was not involved in the drug deals. That is because the evidentiary requirement for testing the admissibility of evidence differs from that governing criminal liability. \"The inquiry made by a court concerned with these matters is not whether the proponent of the evidence wins or loses his case on the merits, but whether the evidentiary Rules have been satisfied. Thus, the evidentiary standard is unrelated to the burden of proof on the substantive issues.\" <i>Bourjaily v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 171, 175, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987). Questions of admissibility are decided by the court, Fed.R.Evid. 104(a), using the preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>Bourjaily,</i> 483 U.S. at 175-76, 107 S.Ct. 2775. So long as there is a preponderance of evidence indicating that it was Garza's voice on the tapes, the transcripts could be treated as containing his admission. <i>See United States v. Newton,</i> 891 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir.1989) (finding sufficient circumstantial evidence to support admission of a document as a party admission where the defendant denied being the author of the document); <i>see also United States v. Lang,</i> 364 F.3d 1210, 1222-23 (10th Cir.2004) (\"the government need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] made the statements in question\"), <i>vacated,</i> 543 U.S. 1108, 125 S.Ct. 986, 160 L.Ed.2d 1034, <i>reinstated</i> 405 F.3d 1060, 1061 (10th Cir.2005). Here, both the informant and Sergeant Quinn identified Garza as the individual who sold the drugs. Both testified to the phone call to Garza and the placement of a recording device in the bedroom where the drug transaction took place. These facts sufficed to support a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Garza made the transcribed statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the district court erred in allowing the transcripts to be read to the jury, the error was harmless. \"A non-constitutional evidentiary error is harmless (and, therefore, does not require a new trial) so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 56 (1st Cir.2002). It is highly unlikely that the reading of the transcripts influenced the verdict. The transcripts merely described the setup and execution of a drug deal between a confidential informant and a drug seller. Garza's defense was not that the call and drug deal did not occur but that they involved someone else. The court instructed the jury that the transcripts were not evidence to be considered in deciding that issue. Garza was not prejudiced by the reading of the transcript to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an additional pro se brief, Garza contends that because the drug sales occurred in 1996, more than five years before his trial, the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. Title 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3282(a) divests a federal court of jurisdiction over a non-capital offense committed more than five years <i>before an indictment is found</i> or an information instituted. Garza was indicted on July 10, 1996, less than one month after the drug transactions. At all times prior to Garza's arrest and trial, the indictment remained pending.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza's contention that there was no sufficient indictment is belied by the record, which includes the indictment. If there were any defects in the indictment, the failure to raise an objection before trial constitutes a waiver. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2); <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the conviction and judgment are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As Garza's pro se brief broadly characterizes this delay as a violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, we consider whether this delay violated Garza's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. From statements made at the sentencing hearing, it appears that Garza was in Mexico for seven and a half of the eight years between his indictment and arrest. The government contacted Garza's family in New Hampshire over the years, unsuccessfully trying to find Garza. Garza was arrested at the first practical opportunity, when he illegally re-entered the country in February 2004. After his arrest, the government acted promptly in transferring Garza to New Hampshire and bringing this case to trial. Under these facts, there is no showing that the government failed to exercise diligence, and therefore no violation of Garza's right to a speedy trial<i>See United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

At trial, he claimed to have been a victim of mistaken identity, contending that it was his uncle Alejandro who participated in the drug deals for which he was convicted, not Garza. The jury rejected the claim and convicted Garza. On appeal Garza raises three contentions: that he was denied due process by reason of the state's destruction of the drugs and tape recordings which were evidence of the drug deals; that the district court erred in admitting a transcript of the lost tapes; and that the statute of limitations had run before Garza was brought to trial. Finding none of the contentions to have merit, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. DUE PROCESS VIOLATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug transactions underlying Garza's convictions were \"controlled buys\" organized and arranged by Sergeant Robert Quinn, a narcotics officer with the New Hampshire State Police, with the help of an informant. These buys took place in 1996. Garza was not apprehended until 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence collected from these buys consisted of the drugs purchased, as well as a tape recording of a telephone conversation between the informant and the drug seller, and a second tape recording of a brief conversation during the exchange of drugs for money in the informant's apartment while Sergeant Quinn was in the apartment. The drugs and the tapes were stored in the State Police Forensic Laboratory. Pursuant to its regular practice, the laboratory from time to time sent out a list of evidence items in its possession that might be disposed of, either because a case has been closed, or is stale, or has been abandoned. Sergeant Quinn regularly received this list from the laboratory and until 2002 directed the lab to retain the evidence from Garza's case. In 2002, when the case was again listed, Sergeant Quinn authorized destruction of the drugs. The laboratory then applied for a court order authorizing destruction. The order was issued and the drugs were destroyed. Unbeknownst to Quinn, the laboratory also destroyed the tape recordings. Two years later Garza was apprehended and the government proceeded to trial on the charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that the destruction of the evidence violated his due process rights. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion. It found that the evidence was only potentially useful, not materially exculpatory, to Garza and, that while the destruction was negligent, there was \"little suggestion of bad faith.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Garza contends that the district court erred in finding no bad faith. He argues that Sergeant Quinn's deliberate destruction of evidence he knew to be relevant to a still open case, contrary to the usual procedure, compels a finding of bad faith. We review the district court's fact findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <i>See United States v.

His premise is that <i>Youngblood</i> and <i>Trombetta</i> apply to situations where the <i>police</i> authorize destruction of evidence, as opposed to authorization by a <i>prosecutor.</i> Whenever the prosecutor authorizes destruction of evidence, he contends, <i>Brady</i> applies, requiring no showing of bad faith. Here, Garza argues, because Sergeant Quinn may have spoken to a prosecutor who may have authorized destruction of the evidence, due process was violated regardless of whether there was bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza misapprehends the distinction between the <i>Brady</i> and <i>Youngblood</i> lines of cases. That distinction rests on the nature of the evidence and whether or not the evidence is still in existence, not who authorized destruction of the evidence. \"<i>Brady</i> and its progeny address exculpatory evidence still in the government's possession. <i>Youngblood</i>... govern[s] cases in which the government no longer possesses the disputed evidence.\" <i>Femia,</i> 9 F.3d at 993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a <i>Brady</i> violation to occur, the evidence must be not only in existence but also materially exculpatory. <i>Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. at 105-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109506\"><a href=\"/opinion/109506/united-states-v-agurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2392</span></a></span>. Here, the district court found that the evidence was, at best, only potentially exculpatory, and Garza has not challenged that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Garza's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. READING OF THE TRANSCRIPTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the government offered the transcripts of the tape recordings. Garza objected for lack of authentication. The district court did not receive the transcripts into evidence but permitted the government to read them to the jury, holding that they constituted past recollection recorded admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(5). While Garza argues that the district court erred, we need not address this issue for the government defends the ruling on a different ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the transcripts were admissible as party admissions under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), exempting from the hearsay rule a party's own statement when offered against that party. The government argues here that there was sufficient evidence to establish, for admissibility purposes, that the transcript included Garza's admissions. While this rationale was not addressed by the district court, this court may affirm the admission of evidence on a ground that the district court did not consider. <i>See United States v. Cabrera-Polo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201164\"><a href=\"/opinion/201164/united-states-v-cabrera-polo/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admitting the transcripts on the ground that they contain statements by Garza is not inconsistent with trying Garza's defense that he was not involved in the drug deals. That is because the evidentiary requirement for testing the admissibility of evidence differs from that governing criminal liability. \"The inquiry made by a court concerned with these matters is not whether the proponent of the evidence wins or loses his case on the merits, but whether the evidentiary Rules have been satisfied. Thus, the evidentiary standard is unrelated to the burden of proof on the substantive issues.\" <i>Bourjaily v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 175, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span> (1987). Questions of admissibility are decided by the court, Fed.R.Evid. 104(a), using the preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>Bourjaily,</i> 483 U.S. at 175-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2775</span></a></span>. So long as there is a preponderance of evidence indicating that it was Garza's voice on the tapes, the transcripts could be treated as containing his admission. <i>See United States v. Newton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533777\"><a href=\"/opinion/533777/united-states-v-stuart-h-newton-united-states-of-america-v-thomas-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 947 (1st Cir.1989) (finding sufficient circumstantial evidence to support admission of a document as a party admission where the defendant denied being the author of the document); <i>see also United States v. Lang,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"164559\"><a href=\"/opinion/164559/united-states-v-lang/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span>, 1222-23 (10th Cir.2004) (\"the government need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant] made the statements in question\"), <i>vacated,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></span>, <i>reinstated</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790045\"><a href=\"/opinion/790045/united-states-v-johnny-lang-also-known-as-melvin-pitchford-and-shari/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>, 1061 (10th Cir.2005). Here, both the informant and Sergeant Quinn identified Garza as the individual who sold the drugs. Both testified to the phone call to Garza and the placement of a recording device in the bedroom where the drug transaction took place. These facts sufficed to support a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Garza made the transcribed statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the district court erred in allowing the transcripts to be read to the jury, the error was harmless. \"A non-constitutional evidentiary error is harmless (and, therefore, does not require a new trial) so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200046\"><a href=\"/opinion/200046/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2002). It is highly unlikely that the reading of the transcripts influenced the verdict. The transcripts merely described the setup and execution of a drug deal between a confidential informant and a drug seller. Garza's defense was not that the call and drug deal did not occur but that they involved someone else. The court instructed the jury that the transcripts were not evidence to be considered in deciding that issue. Garza was not prejudiced by the reading of the transcript to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an additional pro se brief, Garza contends that because the drug sales occurred in 1996, more than five years before his trial, the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. Title 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3282(a) divests a federal court of jurisdiction over a non-capital offense committed more than five years <i>before an indictment is found</i> or an information instituted. Garza was indicted on July 10, 1996, less than one month after the drug transactions. At all times prior to Garza's arrest and trial, the indictment remained pending.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garza's contention that there was no sufficient indictment is belied by the record, which includes the indictment. If there were any defects in the indictment, the failure to raise an objection before trial constitutes a waiver. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2); <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788441\"><a href=\"/opinion/788441/united-states-v-jose-rodriguez-marrero-united-states-of-america-v-omar/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11-12 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the conviction and judgment are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As Garza's pro se brief broadly characterizes this delay as a violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, we consider whether this delay violated Garza's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. From statements made at the sentencing hearing, it appears that Garza was in Mexico for seven and a half of the eight years between his indictment and arrest. The government contacted Garza's family in New Hampshire over the years, unsuccessfully trying to find Garza. Garza was arrested at the first practical opportunity, when he illegally re-entered the country in February 2004. After his arrest, the government acted promptly in transferring Garza to New Hampshire and bringing this case to trial. Under these facts, there is no showing that the government failed to exercise diligence, and therefore no violation of Garza's right to a speedy trial<i>See United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200815\"><a href=\"/opinion/200815/united-states-v-casas/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 113 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
