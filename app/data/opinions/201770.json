Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David J. Wenc, with whom Wenc Law Offices was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Thomas J. O'Connor, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 17, 2005\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Appellant Frank J. Jiménez was\n\ncharged in a multiple count indictment with possession of a firearm\n\non July 22, 23, and 24, 2002 (Counts Three, Six, and Eight) in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and possession of a firearm in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime on July 22, 2002 (Count\n\nFive) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).          After a jury trial in\n\nthe U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, a jury returned guilty\n\nverdicts on all of these charges.\n\n           Jiménez appeals on various grounds: (1) he claims error\n\nin the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized during a\n\nwarrantless search of the residence where he was staying; (2) he\n\nalleges that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing his\n\nrequest   for   an   evidentiary   hearing   for   his   second   motion   to\n\nsuppress; (3) he claims that the trial court erred by failing to\n\nadmit into evidence the written statement of Rafael Pérez, an\n\nunavailable witness; (4) he objects to the admission of that same\n\nwitness's statements contained in a written confession; (5) he\n\nclaims that the trial court should have given a proffered \"missing\n\nwitness\" instruction to the jury; (6) he challenges the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence in support of his conviction, and (7) in the event\n\nall else fails, he claims that United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct.\n\n738 (2005), requires remand of this case for resentencing. For the\n\nreasons stated herein, we reject appellant's contentions and affirm\n\nhis conviction.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                                   I.\n\n            Essentially, the dispute concerns not the facts heard by\n\nthe jury, but rather the application of the law to them.\n\n            Sometime in May 2002, ATF Special Agent Patrick Burns\n\nlearned from David Steward, the owner of Triple A Guns, a gun store\n\nin   West   Springfield,   Massachusetts,   that    a   Rafael   Pérez   had\n\npurchased an unusually large number of firearms during the Spring\n\nof 2002. Burns reviewed Steward's records and confirmed this fact.\n\nThereafter, Burns met with Michael Veilleux, the owner of another\n\ngun dealership called Guns & Gun Parts, and learned that Pérez had\n\nalso purchased an unusually large number of firearms from Veilleux\n\nduring that same period.     Burns concluded that Pérez was possibly\n\nengaged in some kind of illegal activity and asked Vellieux to\n\ncontact him if Pérez returned.\n\n            On July 22, 2002, Burns received a call from Veilleux,\n\nalerting him to the presence of Pérez at his store.          Pérez was in\n\nthe process of purchasing another firearm.         Burns proceeded to the\n\nstore and set up surveillance, whereupon he observed Pérez coming\n\nout of the store carrying a bag and accompanied by a child and a\n\nman, whom Burns was later able to identify as appellant Jiménez.\n\nPérez had just purchased a Model P-85 Ruger pistol.              Pérez, the\n\nchild, and Jiménez got into a car that was registered to Pérez's\n\nwife at an address in Springfield, and drove away, with agent Burns\n\nattempting to follow them.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            Burns lost Pérez in traffic and decided to proceed to the\n\nSpringfield address to set up surveillance there.         At some point\n\nPérez drove up, got out with the child and went into the house at\n\nthat address.    Pérez was empty-handed.\n\n            Burns returned to Veilleux's store and learned that the\n\nman who had accompanied Pérez had two tattoos on his arm: one said\n\n\"Freaky\" and the other \"La Familia.\"       Burns then checked with the\n\nSpringfield    Police   Department,   where   he   received   information\n\nconnecting    appellant   Jiménez   with   those   tattoos,   obtained   a\n\nphotograph of Jiménez, and learned that his street alias was\n\n\"Freaky\" or \"Freaky-tie.\"\n\n            On July 23, 2002, Veilleux called Burns again to indicate\n\nthat Pérez was back at his store with the same man as before, to\n\npurchase another firearm.      Burns proceeded to the store and was\n\nable to observe the Pérez/Jiménez duo coming out of the store\n\ntogether.     They got into a different car than the day before and\n\ndrove away, again with Burns tailing them, but with no better\n\nresults, losing them in traffic.\n\n            On July 25, 2002, Burns and Springfield Police Detective\n\nRicardo Ortiz interviewed Pérez regarding his numerous firearms\n\npurchases.     Pérez told the agents that a friend of his named\n\n\"Frank\" was holding some of the firearms he recently had purchased.\n\nPérez stated that he did not know Frank's full name, but would show\n\nthem where Frank lived.    He then took Burns and Ortiz to the place\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwhere Frank was staying in Springfield, located at 105 Jefferson\n\nStreet.\n\n          Upon arrival, the lessee of the premises, Elsa Rodríguez,\n\nauthorized the agents to search the residence.     When they reached\n\nthe second floor they were able to detect the odor of burning\n\nmarihuana emanating from the front bedroom, the door to which was\n\nclosed and locked, and which Rodríguez indicated was being used by\n\nappellant Jiménez. Rodríguez used a butter knife to force the lock\n\nopen, and the agents proceeded to enter Jiménez's room.       Inside\n\nthey found a hand gun case, ammunition, cash, marihuana, and a\n\ndigital scale.   Jiménez was not in the room.    Next, they proceeded\n\nto the rear bedroom, which belonged to Rodríguez, where they found\n\nJiménez hiding on the floor next to a bed.      Ortiz drew his weapon\n\nand called for Jiménez to show himself.    When he stood up, Ortiz\n\nrecognized him as being \"Freaky,\" put him under arrest and placed\n\nhandcuffs on him.    At this point, another man emerged from the\n\ncloset where he had been hiding and indicated that Jiménez had put\n\na gun inside a pillowcase that was on the bed.    Ortiz looked inside\n\nthe pillowcase and found a 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-89, pistol,\n\nbearing serial number 310-76049.\n\n          Jiménez was transported to the Springfield police station\n\nwhereupon the agents returned to the bedroom that Jiménez had been\n\nusing and seized the evidence they had found previously.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f           Burns and Ortiz returned to the police station to talk to\n\nJiménez, whom they advised of his Miranda rights.    Jiménez agreed\n\nto waive these and provided the agents with a written statement.\n\nIn his statement, Jiménez told the agents that Pérez came to him\n\nlooking for heroin \"[t]his past Monday,\" meaning July 22, 2002, but\n\nthat Pérez did not have any money with which to pay for the drugs.\n\nPérez offered to \"give [Jiménez] one gun instead of cash and when\n\nhe got cash he would pay with cash and get the gun back.\"   Jiménez\n\nthen went with Pérez to Guns & Gun Parts, where Pérez purchased a\n\ngun, and Jiménez then gave Pérez some heroin. Pérez gave him \"a 9\n\nmm.   I think it was a Ruger.\"   Jiménez further stated that Pérez\n\n\"returned with cash, which he said he earned by finding a buyer for\n\nthe gun.   I gave him the gun and he said he sold it.\"   The records\n\nat Guns & Gun Parts showed that Pérez purchased a 9 millimeter\n\nRuger, Model P-85, pistol, with serial number 301-09664.    This gun\n\nwas not recovered.\n\n           Jiménez further stated that he and Pérez went again to\n\nthe same gun store the following day, July 23, 2002, where Pérez\n\npurchased another firearm.    The store records show that Pérez's\n\npurchase on that day was a 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-89, pistol,\n\nwith serial number 310-76049.    This was the same firearm seized\n\nfrom the pillowcase at the time of Jiménez's arrest, and Jiménez\n\nadmitted to hiding the gun there.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            Jiménez also stated that Pérez gave him two more guns on\n\nor about July 24, 2002, one of which was a .380 caliber firearm,\n\nwhich he in turn gave to an individual called \"Jinxx.\"   Jiménez did\n\nnot know \"Jinxx's\" real name or exact address, but was able to\n\nprovide his physical description, and agreed to take the agents to\n\nwhere he lived.     On July 26, 2002, Jiménez showed Springfield\n\nPolice Detective Misael Rodríguez where \"Jinxx\" resided at 2718\n\nMain Street in Springfield.    Later that day, Detective Rodríguez\n\nreturned to that address and knocked on the door of the apartment\n\ndescribed by Jiménez as belonging to \"Jinxx,\" whereupon a man\n\nfitting the physical description of \"Jinxx\" supplied by Jiménez\n\nopen the door. \"Jinxx\" consented to a search of his apartment,\n\nduring the course of which Detective Rodríguez found and seized a\n\n.380 caliber Bersa, Model 85, pistol, bearing serial number 295197,\n\nwhich had been hidden above the tiles of a drop ceiling in the\n\nbathroom.    The records of Triple A Guns showed that Pérez had\n\npurchased this gun on July 23, 2004.\n\n            At trial, it was stipulated that the two firearms seized\n\n-- the 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-89, pistol and the .380 caliber\n\nBersa pistol -- were manufactured outside of the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts, and that on July 6, 2001, prior to the commission of\n\nthe charged offenses in this case, Jiménez had been convicted of\n\nassault in the Springfield District Court, an offense punishable by\n\na term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f                                        II.\n\nA.   The evidence seized from Jiménez's room\n\n            We    review     a    district     court's      decision    regarding\n\nsuppression of evidence under a bifurcated standard of review,\n\nUnited States v. Charles, 312 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 2000), whereby\n\nfactual findings are examined for clear error, United States v.\n\nLee, 317 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1048,\n\nwhile questions of law receive de novo scrutiny, id.\n\n            Jiménez challenges the seizure of the evidence found in\n\nhis bedroom at 105 Jefferson Street on the basis that Rodríguez did\n\nnot have the authority to consent to the warrantless search of his\n\nbedroom.    The government contends that the evidence seized from\n\nJiménez's room was properly admissible as evidence discovered\n\npursuant to (1) a consent search, or (2) a protective sweep.                Upon\n\ncareful examination of the record, we agree that Rodríguez did not\n\nhave authority to consent to the search of that particular room,\n\nand we question whether the agents were permitted to conduct a\n\nprotective sweep of the room under the circumstances of this case.\n\nRegardless, we cannot but conclude that any error which might exist\n\nin   admitting    evidence       from   the   search   of   Jiménez's    room   is\n\nharmless.\n\n            The Fourth Amendment's right to be free from unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures is grounded on the individual's expectation\n\nof privacy.      See United States v. Thornley, 707 F.2d 622, 624 (1st\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fCir. 1984) (\"Whether the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures has been violated depends on\n\nwhether the person asserting a Fourth Amendment violation had a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or the\n\nthing seized.\").   Jiménez was entitled to some expectation of\n\nprivacy as to the bedroom he was using in Rodríguez's home.     See\n\nMinnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 96-97 (1990) (holding that an\n\novernight guest has an expectation of privacy in the home in which\n\nhe is staying).\n\n          Rodríguez had the authority to consent to the search of\n\nthe common spaces of the house.    See United States v. Matlock, 415\n\nU.S. 164, 171 (1974) (Permission to search may be obtained from a\n\nthird party who possesses common authority over the premises.).\n\nShe clearly had common authority to consent to the search of her\n\nown bedroom, where Jiménez was found and arrested.    Rodríguez did\n\nnot, however, have the common authority over Jiménez's bedroom in\n\norder to give the police consent to search it.   The authority which\n\njustifies third-party consent to search rests upon\n\n          mutual use of the property by persons\n          generally having joint access or control for\n          most purposes, so that it is reasonable to\n          recognize that any of the co-habitants has the\n          right to permit the inspection in his own\n          right and that the others    have assumed the\n          risk that one of their number might permit the\n          common area to be searched.\n\nUnited States v. Hyson, 721 F.2d 856, 859 (1st Cir. 1983) (quoting\n\nMatlock, 415 U.S. at 171 n.7).          In her testimony, Rodríguez\n\n                                  -9-\n\fcharacterized Jiménez's bedroom as \"his space.\"          She did not enter\n\nthe room as a regular matter, and she told police before they\n\nentered that she was not supposed to enter the room.          Rodríguez did\n\nnot even have a key to go into the room and instead had to use a\n\nbutter knife to pry the door open.              We find, therefore, that\n\nRodríguez's consent to the search of the house could not extend to\n\nthe search of the room Jiménez was using.\n\n           The fact that the agents smelled the scent of burning\n\nmarihuana emanating from the room when they reached the second\n\nfloor does not cure the problem.      \"'[O]dors alone do not authorize\n\na search without a warrant.'\"       United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S.\n\n675, 699 n.12 (1985) (quoting Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S.\n\n10, 13 (1948)).       Where the odor of a forbidden substance is\n\nidentified by someone found qualified to know the odor, there may\n\nwell be probable cause to justify issuance of a search warrant,\n\nJohnson, 333 U.S. at 13, but it is not sufficient to justify a\n\nwarrantless search.     Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 137 n.7\n\n(1990) (collecting cases on the rule that \"no amount of probable\n\ncause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent 'exigent\n\ncircumstances'\").     The government does not argue otherwise.\n\n           The government also contends that Jiménez's room was\n\nproperly   searched   by    the   agents   as   they   were   conducting   a\n\n\"protective sweep.\"        The government argues that the search of\n\nJiménez's bedroom was justified because the agents had a reasonable\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fbasis for believing that Jiménez was present in the home, was using\n\nmarihuana, was likely armed with a gun he received from Pérez, and\n\ntherefore posed a potential danger to them as they conducted their\n\nsearch.\n\n           The Supreme Court has defined a \"protective sweep\" as \"a\n\nquick and limited search of premises, incident to an arrest and\n\nconducted to protect the safety of police officers or others.\"\n\nMaryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 327 (1990).        This is set within the\n\ncontext of the longstanding view that \"[t]he touchstone of the\n\nFourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a\n\nsearch is determined 'by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to\n\nwhich it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other,\n\nthe degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate\n\ngovernmental interests.'\" United States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112,\n\n118-19 (2001) (quoting Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 300\n\n(1999)).     Hence,   \"the   searching   officer    [must]   possess[]   a\n\nreasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which,\n\ntaken together with the rational inferences from those facts,\n\nreasonably   warrant[] the officer in believing . . . that the area\n\nswept harbored an individual posing a danger to the officer or\n\nothers.\"     Buie, 494 U.S. at 327 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f             This case presents the difficult issue of determining\n\nwhether or not a protective sweep was objectively reasonable under\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n             Although Buie concerns protective sweeps incident to\n\narrest, this court has extended this doctrine to include protective\n\nsweeps in conjunction with the execution of search warrants, Drohan\n\nv. Vaughn, 176 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Doust,\n\n916   F.2d   757,   759   (1st   Cir.    1990),   and   recently   to   include\n\nprotective sweeps where the existence of exigent circumstances\n\nprompts the entry of police, United States v. Martins, -- F.3d --,\n\nNo. 04-1474, 2005 WL 1502939 (1st Cir. June 27, 2005).\n\n             In this case, Rodríguez denied that Jiménez was home, but\n\ngave the agents permission to enter the house and search for\n\nJiménez and firearms.        The agents did not have a warrant for\n\nJiménez's arrest or a search warrant.             No one was under arrest at\n\nthe time the agents searched the room Jiménez was using, and no\n\nexigent circumstances allowed for their entry into the home.               The\n\ngovernment contends that the smell of smoke emanating from the\n\nfront room escalated the threat the agents were facing during their\n\nsearch because it was reasonable for them to suspect that Jiménez\n\nwas in the house, smoking marihuana, likely in possession of a\n\nfirearm, and possibly lying in wait for them.\n\n             Given that the agents were in the home for the purpose of\n\nsearching for Jiménez, they must have already had some suspicion\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fthat he was there.   The fact that Rodríguez opened the room for\n\nthem with a butter knife suggests that she was not afraid of what\n\nmight have been on the other side of the door and the agents were\n\nnot   particularly   concerned   for    her   safety.   Under    the\n\ncircumstances, and based on the limited recitation of the facts we\n\nare presented with and the lack of reasonableness determination\n\nmade by the district court below, we are not at all certain whether\n\na protective sweep, to include Jiménez's locked bedroom, was\n\nappropriate under these circumstances.\n\n          In the instant case, however, the question of whether the\n\nprotective sweep justifies the warrantless search of Jiménez's\n\nbedroom is of no moment, because the error of admitting the\n\nevidence seized from the room, if any, is harmless.      Where, as\n\nhere, the objection is preserved, erroneous admission of improperly\n\nseized evidence at trial is reviewed for harmless error.    United\n\nStates v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1293 (1st Cir. 1997).          Under\n\nharmless error review, the burden is on the government to show that\n\nthe supposed error did not affect the outcome of trial.     United\n\nStates v. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 52 (1st Cir. 2004) (considering\n\nfactors such as \"considering, among other things, the centrality of\n\nthe tainted material, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the\n\nuses to which it was put during the trial, the relative strengths\n\nof the parties' cases\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          The physical evidence seized from Jiménez's bedroom pales\n\nin light of the other evidence introduced at trial, including\n\nJiménez's undoubtedly voluntary and fully corroborated confession,\n\nin which he admitted that (1) he and Pérez entered into a guns-for-\n\nheroin agreement, (2) they consumated that agreement on July 22,\n\n2002, when Pérez purchased what was later determined to be a 9\n\nmillimeter Ruger Model P-85 pistol, which he used as a deposit with\n\nJiménez in exchange for heroin, pending later substitution for\n\ncash, (3) Pérez later returned to pay cash in exchange for the\n\nRuger, and (4) he possessed other firearms obtained from Pérez,\n\nincluding the Ruger Model P-89 pistol that was seized from the\n\npillowcase and the Bersa pistol that was later recovered from\n\n\"Jinxx\" at his home.       Further evidence against Jiménez, both\n\ntestimonial   and   documentary,   corroborated   Jiménez   and   Pérez's\n\npresence at Guns & Gun Parts on July 22 and 23, 2004, and the\n\npurchase of the guns which he confessed to possessing.             This,\n\ntogether with copious other documentary, physical and testimonial\n\nevidence, was more than sufficient to convict Jiménez, irrespective\n\nof the evidence seized from his bedroom.\n\nB.   The district court's refusal to hold a second suppression\nhearing regarding Jiménez's inculpatory statements to Detective\nRodríguez\n\n          On June 3, 2003, Jiménez filed a motion to suppress his\n\npost-arrest statements, challenging his waiver of his Miranda\n\nrights and the voluntariness of the written confession he made\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fshortly after his arrest.     On July 11, 2003, the district court\n\nheld an evidentiary hearing and denied Jiménez's motion, ruling\n\nthat Jiménez's waiver and subsequent confession were voluntary. We\n\nsee no valid reason for disagreeing with these rulings.\n\n          Shortly before trial, Jiménez sought to suppress an\n\nadditional statement he made to Detective Rodríguez regarding his\n\nheroin sources and his cooperation with the police in the recovery\n\nof the Bersa pistol, which were not part of his earlier confession.\n\nHe   sought   suppression    again     on   the   basis   of   alleged\n\ninvoluntariness, as well as the alleged failure to waive Miranda\n\nrights.   On January 9, 2003, the district court held a non-\n\nevidentiary hearing, and relying in part on the evidence heard at\n\nthe original suppression hearing, concluded that the brief lapse of\n\ntime -- five to six   hours -- between the original Miranda warnings\n\nand confession, and the later statements to Detective Rodríguez,\n\ndid not vitiate the voluntariness of the statements.\n\n          We review the district court's decision not to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.        United States v.\n\nCalderón, 77 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996).       \"A hearing is required\n\nonly if the movant makes a sufficient threshold showing that\n\nmaterial facts are in doubt or dispute, and that such facts cannot\n\nreliably be resolved on a paper record.\"     United States v. Staula,\n\n80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir. 1996).      The purpose of a voluntariness\n\nhearing is to ensure that unreliable, coerced confessions are not\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fused to secure a defendant's conviction.           Jackson v. Denno, 378\n\nU.S. 368, 376-77 (1964).      Nothing in Jackson, or Sims v. Georgia,\n\n385 U.S. 538 (1967), another case Jiménez relies on, makes the\n\nholding of a voluntariness hearing mandatory where the facts are\n\nnot   disputed   and   the   district   court    can    therefore    reach    a\n\ndetermination about voluntariness without the need for additional\n\nevidence.    Such are the present circumstances.\n\n            The district court had already heard evidence at the\n\nprevious evidentiary hearing about the circumstances surrounding\n\nJiménez's written confession and his waiver of his Miranda rights.\n\nThe court was also on notice about Jiménez's use of alcohol and\n\nliquor, and of the lapse of time between his written confession and\n\nhis oral statements to Detective Rodríguez.            In denying Jiménez's\n\nrequest, the district judge made specific reference to these\n\nmatters.    The court then concluded that the lapse of time between\n\nthe Miranda waiver and the written confession, and the statements\n\nto Detective Rodríguez, was insufficient to nullify the Miranda\n\nwarning or render the later statements involuntary.\n\n            Given   these    circumstances,     there    was   no   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion in the court's refusal to hold a second evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\nC.    The refusal to admit Pérez's confession\n\n            On July 26, 2002, Pérez made a written confession to law\n\nenforcement officials in which he spelled out his relationship to\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fJiménez, and in which he stated that he did not provide guns to\n\nJiménez in exchange for heroin.       At trial, Jiménez attempted to\n\nintroduce into evidence this part of Pérez's statement, alleging\n\nthat the statement was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n804(b)(3), as a statement against penal interest.1          The court\n\ndenied admission, ruling that said portion of Pérez's statement was\n\nnot against penal interest, and that in any event, corroboration\n\nwas lacking.\n\n             The standard of review for an evidentiary ruling is abuse\n\nof discretion. United States v. Otero-Méndez, 273 F.3d 46, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).     Abuse of discretion occurs \"when a relevant factor\n\ndeserving of significant weight is overlooked, or when an improper\n\nfactor is accorded significant weight, or when the court considers\n\nthe appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable error of\n\njudgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\"      United States v.\n\nGilbert, 229 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v.\n\nRoberts, 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n             For a statement to be against penal interest it must tend\n\nto subject the declarant to criminal liability to such an extent\n\nthat a reasonable person would not make the statement unless it\n\nwere true.    Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 599 (1994).\n\n\n1\n    Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) reads in its pertinent part: \"A\nstatement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and\noffered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless\ncorroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of\nthe statement.\"\n\n                                  -17-\n\f          There was clearly no abuse of discretion in the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary ruling.           Pérez's statement that he never\n\nexchanged guns for heroin with Jiménez did not inculpate Pérez of\n\nany crime, but rather exculpated him of criminal liability under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c).    The fact that it also exculpated Jiménez of that\n\ncrime is immaterial to its admission under Rule 804(b)(3).                   If\n\nPérez wanted to exculpate Jiménez on the information contained in\n\nhis extra-judicial statement, he had to testify in court, under\n\noath, and subject to cross-examination.          This he refused to do, as\n\nwas within his rights.\n\n          Having so decided, we need not discuss the issue of\n\nwhether   the    statement     was    also   inadmissible     for    lack    of\n\ncorroboration.\n\nD. The admission of Jiménez's confession on the basis of alleged\nviolations to the Confrontation Clause\n\n          The confession of Jiménez that was admitted into evidence\n\nrecounts conversations that he had with Pérez about the sale of\n\nheroin, the use of firearms as collateral for these transactions,\n\nand the various specific firearms that Pérez provided.               Although\n\nJiménez sought suppression of these statements as part of his\n\nallegation of involuntariness of the confession, a matter we have\n\npreviously   discussed,   he    now    raises,   for   the   first   time,   an\n\nobjection to the statements made by Pérez that are repeated by\n\nJiménez in that confession, claiming that by admitting the same,\n\nthe district court deprived him of his right to confront that\n\n                                      -18-\n\fwitness.   Jiménez also objects to the testimony of Detective Ortiz\n\nand Agent Burns, previously detailed, in which they testified to\n\nstatements by Pérez during the course of their investigation of\n\nJiménez's activities.   Since no objection was made to any of this\n\nevidence during trial, we review this matter for plain error.\n\nBarone, 114 F.3d at 1293.\n\n           Jiménez's reliance on Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S.\n\n36 (2004), is misguided.    \"The [Confrontation] Clause [] does not\n\nbar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than\n\nestablishing the truth of the matter asserted.\"      Id. at 59 n.9.\n\nThe challenged statements were properly admissible, not for their\n\ntruth, but to provide context to (1) Jiménez's admissions in his\n\nwritten confession, and (2) the investigatory steps pursued by\n\nBurns and Ortiz.   United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1007\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] defendant, having made admissions, [cannot]\n\nkeep from the jury other segments of the discussion reasonably\n\nrequired to place those admissions into context.\").\n\n           Such is the present situation.      Not only is there no\n\nplain error, there is no error at all.\n\n           Furthermore, it can be fairly said that Jiménez adopted\n\nall of Pérez's statements in his confession.    Therefore, even were\n\nPérez's statements therein admitted for the truth of what Pérez\n\nsaid, the Confrontation Clause is not implicated when there is\n\nadoption of such statements by the defendant, who thus becomes the\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fdeclarant or \"witness\" himself.            United States v. Allen, 10 F.3d\n\n405, 413 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\nE.   The \"missing witness\" instruction\n\n              Jiménez sought to call Pérez as a witness at trial, but\n\nPérez invoked his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify.                 At\n\nthe conclusion of the trial, Jiménez asked that the jury be given\n\na \"missing witness\" instruction under the theory that Pérez was\n\n\"peculiarly available\" to the government since it could have\n\nimmunized Pérez.         The district judge rejected the request, a\n\ndecision which we review under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nUnited States v. Otero-Méndez, 273 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              Again, there has been no abuse of discretion but rather,\n\nthe district court followed the circuit precedent established in\n\nUnited States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 597 (1st\n\nCir. 1989), in which the identical issue raised by Jiménez was\n\ndecided in the identical manner as was decided by the district\n\ncourt   in    this    case.     In   St.      Michael's,   we   held   that   the\n\ngovernment's power to grant immunity from prosecution to a witness\n\ndoes    not    make   that    witness    more    available,     or   \"peculiarly\n\navailable\" to the government.           Id.\n\nF.   The sufficiency of the evidence\n\n              In a nutshell, Jiménez challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug\n\ntrafficking crime. His contention is predicated on two points: (1)\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fthat   his    confession     as   to   that   charge   was    not       adequately\n\ncorroborated, and (2) that the government did not prove that he\n\npossessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\n\n             We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\nacquittal for insufficiency of evidence de novo.             Staula, 80 F.3d\n\nat 604.      \"If the evidence presented, taken in the light most\n\nagreeable to the government, is adequate to permit a rational jury\n\nto find each essential element of the offense of conviction beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, then the defendant's claim fails.\"                      United\n\nStates v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir. 1995).                The court must\n\n\"choose from among competing inferences the one best fitting the\n\nprosecution's theory of guilt.\" United States v. Licausi, 167 F.3d\n\n36,    45    (1st    Cir.   1999).     \"The    evidence    may     be     entirely\n\ncircumstantial,       and   the   government    need   not    disprove      every\n\nhypothesis of innocence.\"         United States v. Escobar De-Jesús, 187\n\nF.3d 148, 172 (1st Cir. 1999).          We need \"only satisfy [ourselves]\n\nthat the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of\n\nthe record.\"        Licausi, 167 F.3d at 45 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     See also United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (same).\n\n             Pérez's use of firearms as collateral to purchase heroin\n\nfrom   Jiménez      is   corroborated    beyond   doubt,     by    testimonial,\n\ndocumentary, and physical evidence, and is detailed earlier in this\n\nopinion at pages five and six.          We need not repeat ourselves.\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f           The corroborated evidence establishes that firearms were\n\nused in furtherance of a drug crime, because the use of the\n\nfirearms as collateral facilitated the sale of heroin by Jiménez to\n\nPérez.\n\nG.   Booker Sentencing Issue\n\n           Jiménez appeals from a sentence imposed prior to the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. ---,\n\n125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).          In his supplemental Booker brief, Jiménez\n\nargues that the district court erred in sentencing him under a\n\nmandatory Guidelines system and that he is entitled to resentencing\n\nin conformance with Booker.2         The government opposes a remand.\n\n           Jiménez acknowledges that his claim of Booker error is\n\nunpreserved.   See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (A Booker error is preserved \"if the defendant\n\nbelow argued Apprendi or Blakeley error or that the Guidelines were\n\nunconstitutional\").\n\n           Following      his    conviction,   Jiménez   was     sentenced   in\n\naccordance   with   the    then-mandatory      Guidelines   to    110   months'\n\nimprisonment for his conviction as a felon in possession of a\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Appellant's original brief was filed in January 2005, before\nBooker was decided, and was thus based mostly on Apprendi v. New\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. --\n-, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), although it does not appear that these\nissues were preserved. After Booker was decided, we afforded the\nappellant an opportunity to file a supplemental brief.\n\n                                      -22-\n\ffirearm, to be followed by an additional 60 months' imprisonment\n\nmandated by his 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction.\n\n           Both    the    government       and    Jiménez    objected      to   the\n\npresentence report, with Jiménez seeking a downward departure, and\n\nthe government wanting an upward adjustment based on allegations of\n\nobstruction of justice.3         The district judge denied both motions.\n\n           In deciding the sentence to be imposed, the court added\n\nthree additional criminal history points for a subtotal of 9.                   To\n\nthat were added two points pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\n(U.S.S.G.) § 4A1.1(d), on the basis that Jiménez was under the\n\ncriminal justice sentences imposed on June 7, 1999 and July 6, 2001\n\nin the Springfield District Court.               An additional point was then\n\nadded   pursuant   to    U.S.S.G.    §   4A1.1     (c),   because    the   present\n\noffenses were committed less than two years following appellant's\n\nrelease from custody on December 21, 2001 (for the June 7, 1999 and\n\nJuly 6, 2001 sentences).\n\n           Although appellant recognizes that our Antonakopoulos\n\ndecision   concluded      that    Booker     error     is   not     \"structural,\"\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 80, and thus does not automatically\n\nrequire resentencing, he asks us to reconsider that conclusion. We\n\ncannot, however, oblige. \"Absent unusual circumstances not present\n\nhere, panels of this court are bound by prior circuit decisions.\"\n\n\n\n3\n   While in pretrial detention Jiménez was recorded trying to\npersuade Rodríguez to testify falsely at the suppression hearing.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fUnited States v. Villafañe-Jiménez, 410 F.3d 74, 85 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n              In    Antonakopoulos,     we      determined     that      we    review\n\nunpreserved Booker claims for plain error.                   Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 75.        For Jiménez's claim to survive plain error review,\n\nthis court must find a reasonable probability that the district\n\ncourt would impose a more favorable sentence on Jiménez under the\n\nnew advisory Guidelines.           Id. at 75.\n\n              Jiménez argues that the district court would likely have\n\nimposed   a    different    sentence     were    it   not    for   the    mandatory\n\nGuidelines regime, because the Guidelines circumscribed the court's\n\nability to consider many factors Jiménez presented in support of\n\nmotions for downward departure, including substituting community\n\nconfinement        for   prison,    cooperation       with    state      and    local\n\nauthorities, over-representation of the seriousness of criminal\n\nhistory, extraordinary family circumstances, diminished capacity,\n\nemotional and mental health problems, substance abuse problems, the\n\ndisparity in how Jiménez was charged compared to Rodríguez and\n\nPérez, and credit for state time served.              It is apparent from the\n\nrecord that the district court felt restricted by the Guidelines in\n\nits consideration of at least some of these arguments.                           For\n\nexample, at the sentencing hearing, the court stated that:\n\n                     Family    circumstances   are    just\n              heartbreaking. The notion that there will be\n              three [] children who now will be growing up\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f          without their father there for them is just\n          terrible to even contemplate.\n                  But this is not the kind of situation\n          that –- the courts have made clear this is not\n          the kind of situation where I can downward\n          depart.\n\nThe district court went on to state:\n\n                 I will tell you . . . that I am not\n          going to impose a sentence higher than the 170\n          months which is the very bottom end of the\n          Guideline range, and which under federal law I\n          believe is the lowest sentence that I am\n          entitled to impose.\n                 I believe any sentence below 170 months\n          would be an error that would be corrected by\n          the Court of Appeals and would be a sentence\n          that I'm simply not permitted to impose as a\n          matter of law.\n\n          While these statements clearly suggest that the district\n\ncourt might have imposed a more lenient sentence if the Guidelines\n\nhad been advisory at that time, his next statement tears this\n\nlikelihood asunder:\n\n          Even if I had the discretion, which I do not\n          believe I have, but I will say even if I had\n          the discretion to depart downward under these\n          circumstances, I'm afraid I would not exercise\n          it.    I believe 170 months is the lowest\n          possible sentence under these circumstances.\n\n          Thus, Booker is of no avail to Jiménez in opening the\n\npossibility of altering his sentence.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For   the   reasons   stated   herein,   the   conviction   of\n\nappellant is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f",

Burns reviewed Steward's records and confirmed this fact. Thereafter, Burns met with Michael Veilleux, the owner of another gun dealership called Guns &amp; Gun Parts, and learned that P&#233;rez had also purchased an unusually large number of firearms from Veilleux during that same period. Burns concluded that P&#233;rez was possibly engaged in some kind of illegal activity and asked Veilleux to contact him if P&#233;rez returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 22, 2002, Burns received a call from Veilleux, alerting him to the presence of P&#233;rez at his store. P&#233;rez was in the process of purchasing another firearm. Burns proceeded to the store and set up surveillance, whereupon he observed P&#233;rez coming out of the store carrying a bag and accompanied by a child and a man, whom Burns was later able to identify as appellant Jim&#233;nez. P&#233;rez had just purchased a Model P-85 Ruger pistol. P&#233;rez, the child, and Jim&#233;nez got into a car that was registered to P&#233;rez's wife at an address in Springfield, and drove away, with agent Burns attempting to follow them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns lost P&#233;rez in traffic and decided to proceed to the Springfield address to set up surveillance there. At some point P&#233;rez drove up, got out with the child and went into the house at that address. P&#233;rez was empty-handed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns returned to Veilleux's store and learned that the man who had accompanied P&#233;rez had two tattoos on his arm: one said \"Freaky\" and the other \"La Familia.\" Burns then checked with the Springfield Police Department, where he received information connecting appellant Jim&#233;nez with those tattoos, obtained a photograph of Jim&#233;nez, and learned that his street alias was \"Freaky\" or \"Freaky-tie.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 2002, Veilleux called Burns again to indicate that P&#233;rez was back at his store with the same man as before, to purchase another firearm. Burns proceeded to the store and was able to observe the P&#233;rez/Jim&#233;nez duo coming out of the store together. They got into a different car than the day before and drove away, again with Burns tailing them, but with no better results, losing them in traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 2002, Burns and Springfield Police Detective Ricardo Ortiz interviewed P&#233;rez regarding his numerous firearms purchases. P&#233;rez told the agents that a friend of his named \"Frank\" was holding some of the firearms he recently had purchased. P&#233;rez stated that he did not know Frank's full name, but would show them where Frank lived. He then took Burns and Ortiz to the place where Frank was staying in Springfield, located at 105 Jefferson Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arrival, the lessee of the premises, Elsa Rodr&#237;guez, authorized the agents to search the residence. When they reached the second floor they were able to detect the odor of burning marihuana emanating from the front bedroom, the door to which was closed and locked, and which Rodr&#237;guez indicated was being used by appellant Jim&#233;nez. Rodr&#237;guez used a butter knife to force the lock open, and the agents proceeded to enter Jim&#233;nez's room. Inside they found a hand gun case, ammunition, cash, marihuana, and a digital scale. Jim&#233;nez was not in the room. Next, they proceeded to the rear bedroom, which belonged to Rodr&#237;guez, where they found Jim&#233;nez hiding on the floor next to a bed. Ortiz drew his weapon and called for Jim&#233;nez to show himself. When he stood up, Ortiz recognized him as being \"Freaky,\" put him under arrest and placed handcuffs on him. At this point, another man emerged from the closet where he had been hiding and indicated that Jim&#233;nez had put a gun inside a pillowcase that was on the bed. Ortiz looked inside the pillowcase and found a 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-89, pistol, bearing serial number 310-76049.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez was transported to the Springfield police station whereupon the agents returned to the bedroom that Jim&#233;nez had been using and seized the evidence they had found previously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns and Ortiz returned to the police station to talk to Jim&#233;nez, whom they advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. Jim&#233;nez agreed to waive these and provided the agents with a written statement. In his statement, Jim&#233;nez told the agents that P&#233;rez came to him looking for heroin \"[t]his past Monday,\" meaning July 22, 2002, but that P&#233;rez did not have any money with which to pay for the drugs. P&#233;rez offered to \"give [Jim&#233;nez] one gun instead of cash and when he got cash he would pay with cash and get the gun back.\" Jim&#233;nez then went with P&#233;rez to Guns &amp; Gun Parts, where P&#233;rez purchased a gun, and Jim&#233;nez then gave P&#233;rez some heroin. P&#233;rez gave him \"a 9 mm. I think it was a Ruger.\" Jim&#233;nez further stated that P&#233;rez \"returned with cash, which he said he earned by finding a buyer for the gun. I gave him the gun and he said he sold it.\" The records at Guns &amp; Gun Parts showed that P&#233;rez purchased a 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-85, pistol, with serial number 301-09664. This gun was not recovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez further stated that he and P&#233;rez went again to the same gun store the following day, July 23, 2002, where P&#233;rez purchased another firearm. The store records show that P&#233;rez's purchase on that day was a 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-89, pistol, with serial number 310-76049. This was the same firearm seized from the pillowcase at the time of Jim&#233;nez's arrest, and Jim&#233;nez admitted to hiding the gun there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez also stated that P&#233;rez gave him two more guns on or about July 24, 2002, one of which was a .380 caliber firearm, which he in turn gave to an individual called \"Jinxx.\" Jim&#233;nez did not know \"Jinxx's\" real name or exact address, but was able to provide his physical description, and agreed to take the agents to where he lived. On July 26, 2002, Jim&#233;nez showed Springfield Police Detective Misael Rodr&#237;guez where \"Jinxx\" resided at 2718 Main Street in Springfield. Later that day, Detective Rodr&#237;guez returned to that address and knocked on the door of the apartment described by Jim&#233;nez as belonging to \"Jinxx,\" whereupon a man fitting the physical description of \"Jinxx\" supplied by Jim&#233;nez open the door. \"Jinxx\" consented to a search of his apartment, during the course of which Detective Rodr&#237;guez found and seized a .380 caliber Bersa, Model 85, pistol, bearing serial number 295197, which had been hidden above the tiles of a drop ceiling in the bathroom. The records of Triple A Guns showed that P&#233;rez had purchased this gun on July 23, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, it was stipulated that the two firearms seized &#8212; the 9 millimeter Ruger, Model P-89, pistol and the .380 caliber Bersa pistol &#8212; were manufactured outside of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that on July 6, 2001, prior to the commission of the charged offenses in this case, Jim&#233;nez had been convicted of assault in the Springfield District Court, an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The evidence seized from Jim&#233;nez's room</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's decision regarding suppression of evidence under a bifurcated standard of review, <i>United States v. Charles,</i> 213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir.2000), whereby factual findings are examined for clear error, <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 538 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 2112, 155 L.Ed.2d 1089, while questions of law receive <i>de novo</i> scrutiny, <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez challenges the seizure of the evidence found in his bedroom at 105 Jefferson Street on the basis that Rodr&#237;guez did not have the authority to consent to the warrantless search of his bedroom. The government contends that the evidence seized from Jim&#233;nez's room was properly admissible as evidence discovered pursuant to (1) a consent search, or (2) a protective sweep. Upon careful examination of the record, we agree that Rodr&#237;guez did not have authority to consent to the search of that particular room, and we question whether the agents were permitted to conduct a protective sweep of the room under the circumstances of this case. Regardless, we cannot but conclude that any error which might exist in admitting evidence from the search of Jim&#233;nez's room is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is grounded on the individual's expectation of privacy. <i>See United States v. Thornley,</i> 707 F.2d 622, 624 (1st Cir.1983) (\"Whether the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures has been violated depends on whether the person asserting a Fourth Amendment violation had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized.\"). Jim&#233;nez was entitled to some expectation of privacy as to the bedroom he was using in Rodr&#237;guez's home. <i>See Minnesota v. Olson,</i> 495 U.S. 91, 96-97, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990) (holding that an overnight guest has an expectation of privacy in the home in which he is staying).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez had the authority to consent to the search of the common spaces of the house. <i>See United States v. Matlock,</i> 415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974) (Permission to search may be obtained from a third party who possesses common authority over the premises.). She clearly had common authority to consent to the search of her own bedroom, where Jim&#233;nez was found and arrested. Rodr&#237;guez did not, however, have the common authority over Jim&#233;nez's bedroom in order to give the police consent to search it. The authority which justifies third-party consent to search rests upon</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-habitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Hyson,</i> 721 F.2d 856, 859 (1st Cir.1983) (quoting <i>Matlock,</i> 415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 988). In her testimony, Rodr&#237;guez characterized Jim&#233;nez's bedroom as \"his space.\" She did not enter the room as a regular matter, and she told police before they entered that she was not supposed to enter the room. Rodr&#237;guez did not even have a key to go into the room and instead had to use a butter knife to pry the door open. We find, therefore, that Rodr&#237;guez's consent to the search of the house could not extend to the search of the room Jim&#233;nez was using.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the agents smelled the scent of burning marihuana emanating from the room when they reached the second floor does not cure the problem. \"`[O]dors alone do not authorize a search without a warrant.'\" <i>United States v. Sharpe,</i> 470 U.S. 675, 699 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (quoting <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 333 U.S. 10, 13, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948)). Where the odor of a forbidden substance is identified by someone found qualified to know the odor, there may well be probable cause to justify issuance of a search warrant, <i>Johnson,</i> 333 U.S. at 13, 68 S.Ct. 367, but it is not sufficient to justify a warrantless search. <i>Horton v. California,</i> 496 U.S. 128, 137 n. 7, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990) (collecting cases on the rule that \"no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent `exigent circumstances'\"). The government does not argue otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also contends that Jim&#233;nez's room was properly searched by the agents as they were conducting a \"protective sweep.\" The government argues that the search of Jim&#233;nez's bedroom was justified because the agents had a reasonable basis for believing that Jim&#233;nez was present in the home, was using marihuana, was likely armed with a gun he received from P&#233;rez, and therefore posed a potential danger to them as they conducted their search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has defined a \"protective sweep\" as \"a quick and limited search of premises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety of police officers or others.\" <i>Maryland v. Buie,</i> 494 U.S. 325, 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). This is set within the context of the longstanding view that \"[t]he touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined `by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.'\" <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 534 U.S. 112, 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) (quoting <i>Wyoming v. Houghton,</i> 526 U.S. 295, 300, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999)). Hence, \"the searching officer [must] possess[ ] a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant[ ] the officer in believing . . . that the area swept harbored an individual posing a danger to the officer or others.\" <i>Buie,</i> 494 U.S. at 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents the difficult issue of determining whether or not a protective sweep was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Buie</i> concerns protective sweeps incident to arrest, this court has extended this doctrine to include protective sweeps in conjunction with the execution of search warrants, <i>Drohan v. Vaughn,</i> 176 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Daoust,</i> 916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir.1990), and recently to include protective sweeps where the existence of exigent circumstances prompts the entry of police, <i>United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Rodr&#237;guez denied that Jim&#233;nez was home, but gave the agents permission to enter the house and search for Jim&#233;nez and firearms. The agents did not have a warrant for Jim&#233;nez's arrest or a search warrant. No one was under arrest at the time the agents searched the room Jim&#233;nez was using, and no exigent circumstances allowed for their entry into the home. The government contends that the smell of smoke emanating from the front room escalated the threat the agents were facing during their search because it was reasonable for them to suspect that Jim&#233;nez was in the house, smoking marihuana, likely in possession of a firearm, and possibly lying in wait for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the agents were in the home for the purpose of searching for Jim&#233;nez, they must have already had some suspicion that he was there. The fact that Rodr&#237;guez opened the room for them with a butter knife suggests that she was not afraid of what might have been on the other side of the door and the agents were not particularly concerned for her safety. Under the circumstances, and based on the limited recitation of the facts we are presented with and the lack of reasonableness determination made by the district court below, we are not at all certain whether a protective sweep, to include Jim&#233;nez's locked bedroom, was appropriate under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, however, the question of whether the protective sweep justifies the warrantless search of Jim&#233;nez's bedroom is of no moment, because the error of admitting the evidence seized from the room, if any, is harmless. Where, as here, the objection is preserved, erroneous admission of improperly seized evidence at trial is reviewed for harmless error. <i>United States v. Barone,</i> 114 F.3d 1284, 1293 (1st Cir.1997). Under harmless error review, the burden is on the government to show that the supposed error did not affect the outcome of trial. <i>United States v. Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d 35, 52 (1st Cir.2004) (considering factors such as \"considering, among other things, the centrality of the tainted material, its uniqueness, its prejudicial impact, the uses to which it was put during the trial, the relative strengths of the parties' cases\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The physical evidence seized from Jim&#233;nez's bedroom pales in light of the other evidence introduced at trial, including Jim&#233;nez's undoubtedly voluntary and fully corroborated confession, in which he admitted that (1) he and P&#233;rez entered into a guns-for-heroin agreement, (2) they consummated that agreement on July 22, 2002, when P&#233;rez purchased what was later determined to be a 9 millimeter Ruger Model P-85 pistol, which he used as a deposit with Jim&#233;nez in exchange for heroin, pending later substitution for cash, (3) P&#233;rez later returned to pay cash in exchange for the Ruger, and (4) he possessed other firearms obtained from P&#233;rez, including the Ruger Model P-89 pistol that was seized from the pillowcase and the Bersa pistol that was later recovered from \"Jinxx\" at his home. Further evidence against Jim&#233;nez, both testimonial and documentary, corroborated Jim&#233;nez and P&#233;rez's presence at Guns &amp; Gun Parts on July 22 and 23, 2004, and the purchase of the guns which he confessed to possessing. This, together with copious other documentary, physical and testimonial evidence, was more than sufficient to convict Jim&#233;nez, irrespective of the evidence seized from his bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The district court's refusal to hold a second suppression hearing regarding Jim&#233;nez's inculpatory statements to Detective Rodr&#237;guez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 3, 2003, Jim&#233;nez filed a motion to suppress his post-arrest statements, challenging his waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights and the voluntariness of the written confession he made shortly after his arrest. On July 11, 2003, the district court held an evidentiary hearing and denied Jim&#233;nez's motion, ruling that Jim&#233;nez's waiver and subsequent confession were voluntary. We see no valid reason for disagreeing with these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before trial, Jim&#233;nez sought to suppress an additional statement he made to Detective Rodr&#237;guez regarding his heroin sources and his cooperation with the police in the recovery of the Bersa pistol, which were not part of his earlier confession. He sought suppression again on the basis of alleged involuntariness, as well as the alleged failure to waive <i>Miranda</i> rights. On January 9, 2003, the district court held a non-evidentiary hearing, and relying in part on the evidence heard at the original suppression hearing, concluded that the brief lapse of time &#8212; five to six hours &#8212; between the original <i>Miranda</i> warnings and confession, and the later statements to Detective Rodr&#237;guez, did not vitiate the voluntariness of the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Calder&#243;n,</i> 77 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1996). \"A hearing is required only if the movant makes a sufficient threshold showing that material facts are in doubt or dispute, and that such facts cannot reliably be resolved on a paper record.\" <i>United States v. Staula,</i> 80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir.1996). The purpose of a voluntariness hearing is to ensure that unreliable, coerced confessions are not used to secure a defendant's conviction. <i>Jackson v. Denno,</i> 378 U.S. 368, 376-77, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). Nothing in <i>Jackson,</i> or <i>Sims v. Georgia,</i> 385 U.S. 538, 87 S.Ct. 639, 17 L.Ed.2d 593 (1967), another case Jim&#233;nez relies on, makes the holding of a voluntariness hearing mandatory where the facts are not disputed and the district court can therefore reach a determination about voluntariness without the need for additional evidence. Such are the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had already heard evidence at the previous evidentiary hearing about the circumstances surrounding Jim&#233;nez's written confession and his waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. The court was also on notice about Jim&#233;nez's use of alcohol and liquor, and of the lapse of time between his written confession and his oral statements to Detective Rodr&#237;guez. In denying Jim&#233;nez's request, the district judge made specific reference to these matters. The court then concluded that the lapse of time between the <i>Miranda</i> waiver and the written confession, and the statements to Detective Rodr&#237;guez, was insufficient to nullify the <i>Miranda</i> warning or render the later statements involuntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these circumstances, there was no abuse of discretion in the court's refusal to hold a second evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The refusal to admit P&#233;rez's confession</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 2002, P&#233;rez made a written confession to law enforcement officials in which he spelled out his relationship to Jim&#233;nez, and in which he stated that he did not provide guns to Jim&#233;nez in exchange for heroin. At trial, Jim&#233;nez attempted to introduce into evidence this part of P&#233;rez's statement, alleging that the statement was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), as a statement against penal interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court denied admission, ruling that said portion of P&#233;rez's statement was not against penal interest, and that in any event, corroboration was lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review for an evidentiary ruling is abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Otero-M&#233;ndez,</i> 273 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.2001). Abuse of discretion occurs \"when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked, or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight, or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors, but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\" <i>United States v. Gilbert,</i> 229 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 978 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a statement to be against penal interest it must tend to subject the declarant to criminal liability to such an extent that a reasonable person would not make the statement unless it were true. <i>Williamson v. United States,</i> 512 U.S. 594, 599, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was clearly no abuse of discretion in the district court's evidentiary ruling. P&#233;rez's statement that he never exchanged guns for heroin with Jim&#233;nez did not inculpate P&#233;rez of any crime, but rather exculpated him of criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c). The fact that it also exculpated Jim&#233;nez of that crime is immaterial to its admission under Rule 804(b)(3). If P&#233;rez wanted to exculpate Jim&#233;nez on the information contained in his extra-judicial statement, he had to testify in court, under oath, and subject to cross-examination. This he refused to do, as was within his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having so decided, we need not discuss the issue of whether the statement was also inadmissible for lack of corroboration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The admission of Jim&#233;nez's confession on the basis of alleged violations to the Confrontation Clause</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The confession of Jim&#233;nez that was admitted into evidence recounts conversations that he had with P&#233;rez about the sale of heroin, the use of firearms as collateral for these transactions, and the various specific firearms that P&#233;rez provided. Although Jim&#233;nez sought suppression of these statements as part of his allegation of involuntariness of the confession, a matter we have previously discussed, he now raises, for the first time, an objection to the statements made by P&#233;rez that are repeated by Jim&#233;nez in that confession, claiming that by admitting the same, the district court deprived him of his right to confront that witness. Jim&#233;nez also objects to the testimony of Detective Ortiz and Agent Burns, previously detailed, in which they testified to statements by P&#233;rez during the course of their investigation of Jim&#233;nez's activities. Since no objection was made to any of this evidence during trial, we review this matter for plain error. <i>Barone,</i> 114 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez's reliance on <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), is misguided. \"The [Confrontation] Clause [ ] does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The challenged statements were properly admissible, not for their truth, but to provide context to (1) Jim&#233;nez's admissions in his written confession, and (2) the investigatory steps pursued by Burns and Ortiz. <i>United States v. McDowell,</i> 918 F.2d 1004, 1007 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] defendant, having made admissions, [cannot] keep from the jury other segments of the discussion reasonably required to place those admissions into context.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such is the present situation. Not only is there no plain error, there is no error at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it can be fairly said that Jim&#233;nez adopted all of P&#233;rez's statements in his confession. Therefore, even were P&#233;rez's statements therein admitted for the truth of what P&#233;rez said, the Confrontation Clause is not implicated when there is adoption of such statements by the defendant, who thus becomes the declarant or \"witness\" himself. <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 10 F.3d 405, 413 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The \"missing witness\" instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez sought to call P&#233;rez as a witness at trial, but P&#233;rez invoked his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify. At the conclusion of the trial, Jim&#233;nez asked that the jury be given a \"missing witness\" instruction under the theory that P&#233;rez was \"peculiarly available\" to the government since it could have immunized P&#233;rez. The district judge rejected the request, a decision which we review under an abuse of discretion standard. <i>United States v. Otero-M&#233;ndez,</i> 273 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, there has been no abuse of discretion but rather, the district court followed the circuit precedent established in <i>United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union,</i> 880 F.2d 579, 597 (1st Cir.1989), in which the identical issue raised by Jim&#233;nez was decided in the identical manner as was decided by the district court in this case. In <i>St. Michael's,</i> we held that the government's power to grant immunity from prosecution to a witness does not make that witness more available, or \"peculiarly available\" to the government. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. The sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, Jim&#233;nez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. His contention is predicated on two points: (1) that his confession as to that charge was not adequately corroborated, and (2) that the government did not prove that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of a motion for acquittal for insufficiency of evidence <i>de novo. Staula,</i> 80 F.3d at 604. \"If the evidence presented, taken in the light most agreeable to the government, is adequate to permit a rational jury to find each essential element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant's claim fails.\" <i>United States v. Valle,</i> 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.1995). The court must \"choose from among competing inferences the one best fitting the prosecution's theory of guilt.\" <i>United States v.

Booker Sentencing Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez appeals from a sentence imposed prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his supplemental <i>Booker</i> brief, Jim&#233;nez argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory Guidelines system and that he is entitled to resentencing in conformance with <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The government opposes a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez acknowledges that his claim of <i>Booker</i> error is unpreserved. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005) (A <i>Booker</i> error is preserved \"if the defendant below argued <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely</i> error or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his conviction, Jim&#233;nez was sentenced in accordance with the then-mandatory Guidelines to 110 months' imprisonment for his conviction as a felon in possession of a firearm, to be followed by an additional 60 months' imprisonment mandated by his 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the government and Jim&#233;nez objected to the presentence report, with Jim&#233;nez seeking a downward departure, and the government wanting an upward adjustment based on allegations of obstruction of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The district judge denied both motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding the sentence to be imposed, the court added three additional criminal history points for a subtotal of 9. To that were added two points pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) &#167; 4A1.1(d), on the basis that Jim&#233;nez was under the criminal justice sentences imposed on June 7, 1999 and July 6, 2001 in the Springfield District Court. An additional point was then added pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1 (c), because the present offenses were committed less than two years following appellant's release from custody on December 21, 2001 (for the June 7, 1999 and July 6, 2001 sentences).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant recognizes that our <i>Antonakopoulos</i> decision concluded that <i>Booker</i> error is not \"structural,\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 80, and thus does not automatically require resentencing, he asks us to reconsider that conclusion. We cannot, however, oblige. \"Absent unusual circumstances not present here, panels of this court are bound by prior circuit decisions.\" <i>United States v. Villafa&#241;e-Jim&#233;nez,</i> 410 F.3d 74, 85 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> we determined that we review unpreserved <i>Booker</i> claims for plain error. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. For Jim&#233;nez's claim to survive plain error review, this court must find a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence on Jim&#233;nez under the new advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez argues that the district court would likely have imposed a different sentence were it not for the mandatory Guidelines regime, because the Guidelines circumscribed the court's ability to consider many factors Jim&#233;nez presented in support of motions for downward departure, including substituting community confinement for prison, cooperation with state and local authorities, over-representation of the seriousness of criminal history, extraordinary family circumstances, diminished capacity, emotional and mental health problems, substance abuse problems, the disparity in how Jim&#233;nez was charged compared to Rodr&#237;guez and P&#233;rez, and credit for state time served. It is apparent from the record that the district court felt restricted by the Guidelines in its consideration of at least some of these arguments. For example, at the sentencing hearing, the court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Family circumstances are just heartbreaking. The notion that there will be three [ ] children who now will be growing up without their father there for them is just terrible to even contemplate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not the kind of situation that &#8212; the courts have made clear this is not the kind of situation where I can downward depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to state:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will tell you . . . that I am not going to impose a sentence higher than the 170 months which is the very bottom end of the Guideline range, and which under federal law I believe is the lowest sentence that I am entitled to impose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe any sentence below 170 months would be an error that would be corrected by the Court of Appeals and would be a sentence that I'm simply not permitted to impose as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these statements clearly suggest that the district court might have imposed a more lenient sentence if the Guidelines had been advisory at that time, his next statement tears this likelihood asunder:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if I had the discretion, which I do not believe I have, but I will say even if I had the discretion to depart downward under these circumstances, I'm afraid I would not exercise it.

Burns reviewed Steward's records and confirmed this fact. Thereafter, Burns met with Michael Veilleux, the owner of another gun dealership called Guns &amp; Gun Parts, and learned that P&#233;rez had also purchased an unusually large number of firearms from Veilleux during that same period. Burns concluded that P&#233;rez was possibly engaged in some kind of illegal activity and asked Veilleux to contact him if P&#233;rez returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 22, 2002, Burns received a call from Veilleux, alerting him to the presence of P&#233;rez at his store. P&#233;rez was in the process of purchasing another firearm. Burns proceeded to the store and set up surveillance, whereupon he observed P&#233;rez coming out of the store carrying a bag and accompanied by a child and a man, whom Burns was later able to identify as appellant Jim&#233;nez. P&#233;rez had just purchased a Model P-85 Ruger pistol. P&#233;rez, the child, and Jim&#233;nez got into a car that was registered to P&#233;rez's wife at an address in Springfield, and drove away, with agent Burns attempting to follow them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns lost P&#233;rez in traffic and decided to proceed to the Springfield address to set up surveillance there. At some point P&#233;rez drove up, got out with the child and went into the house at that address. P&#233;rez was empty-handed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burns returned to Veilleux's store and learned that the man who had accompanied P&#233;rez had two tattoos on his arm: one said \"Freaky\" and the other \"La Familia.\" Burns then checked with the Springfield Police Department, where he received information connecting appellant Jim&#233;nez with those tattoos, obtained a photograph of Jim&#233;nez, and learned that his street alias was \"Freaky\" or \"Freaky-tie.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 23, 2002, Veilleux called Burns again to indicate that P&#233;rez was back at his store with the same man as before, to purchase another firearm. Burns proceeded to the store and was able to observe the P&#233;rez/Jim&#233;nez duo coming out of the store together. They got into a different car than the day before and drove away, again with Burns tailing them, but with no better results, losing them in traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 2002, Burns and Springfield Police Detective Ricardo Ortiz interviewed P&#233;rez regarding his numerous firearms purchases. P&#233;rez told the agents that a friend of his named \"Frank\" was holding some of the firearms he recently had purchased. P&#233;rez stated that he did not know Frank's full name, but would show them where Frank lived. He then took Burns and Ortiz to the place where Frank was staying in Springfield, located at 105 Jefferson Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arrival, the lessee of the premises, Elsa Rodr&#237;guez, authorized the agents to search the residence. When they reached the second floor they were able to detect the odor of burning marihuana emanating from the front bedroom, the door to which was closed and locked, and which Rodr&#237;guez indicated was being used by appellant Jim&#233;nez. Rodr&#237;guez used a butter knife to force the lock open, and the agents proceeded to enter Jim&#233;nez's room. Inside they found a hand gun case, ammunition, cash, marihuana, and a digital scale. Jim&#233;nez was not in the room. Next, they proceeded to the rear bedroom, which belonged to Rodr&#237;guez, where they found Jim&#233;nez hiding on the floor next to a bed.

At this point, another man emerged from the closet where he had been hiding and indicated that Jim&#233;nez had put a gun inside a pillowcase that was on the bed.

No one was under arrest at the time the agents searched the room Jim&#233;nez was using, and no exigent circumstances allowed for their entry into the home.

The fact that it also exculpated Jim&#233;nez of that crime is immaterial to its admission under Rule 804(b)(3). If P&#233;rez wanted to exculpate Jim&#233;nez on the information contained in his extra-judicial statement, he had to testify in court, under oath, and subject to cross-examination.

Although Jim&#233;nez sought suppression of these statements as part of his allegation of involuntariness of the confession, a matter we have previously discussed, he now raises, for the first time, an objection to the statements made by P&#233;rez that are repeated by Jim&#233;nez in that confession, claiming that by admitting the same, the district court deprived him of his right to confront that witness. Jim&#233;nez also objects to the testimony of Detective Ortiz and Agent Burns, previously detailed, in which they testified to statements by P&#233;rez during the course of their investigation of Jim&#233;nez's activities. Since no objection was made to any of this evidence during trial, we review this matter for plain error. <i>Barone,</i> 114 F.3d at 1293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez's reliance on <i>Crawford v.

The notion that there will be three [ ] children who now will be growing up without their father there for them is just terrible to even contemplate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this is not the kind of situation that &#8212; the courts have made clear this is not the kind of situation where I can downward depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to state:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will tell you . . . that I am not going to impose a sentence higher than the 170 months which is the very bottom end of the Guideline range, and which under federal law I believe is the lowest sentence that I am entitled to impose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe any sentence below 170 months would be an error that would be corrected by the Court of Appeals and would be a sentence that I'm simply not permitted to impose as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these statements clearly suggest that the district court might have imposed a more lenient sentence if the Guidelines had been advisory at that time, his next statement tears this likelihood asunder:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if I had the discretion, which I do not believe I have, but I will say even if I had the discretion to depart downward under these circumstances, I'm afraid I would not exercise it. I believe 170 months is the lowest possible sentence under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, <i>Booker</i> is of no avail to Jim&#233;nez in opening the possibility of altering his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, the conviction of appellant is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3) reads in its pertinent part: \"A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellant's original brief was filed in January 2005, before<i>Booker</i> was decided, and was thus based mostly on <i>Apprendi v.
