Joseph L.

Two courts – one state and\n\none federal – have concluded that the 1994 state trial that\n\nresulted in petitioner Joseph DeCicco's conviction for second-\n\ndegree felony murder was significantly flawed.      Neither court,\n\nhowever, felt that the errors warranted reversal of his conviction.\n\nIn this appeal from the district court's rejection of his petition\n\nfor habeas corpus relief, DeCicco again asserts that the jury's\n\nfinding of guilt may not stand.      We have carefully reviewed the\n\nrecord and caselaw, but find no basis for changing the outcome.\n\nBecause petitioner's claims have been fully addressed in the prior\n\ndecisions, we confine our discussion to the most salient points.\n\n     The facts underlying this case are described in detail in the\n\nopinion issued by the Massachusetts Appeals Court on direct appeal,\n\nsee Commonwealth v. DeCicco, 688 N.E.2d 1010, 1012-14 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1998),1 and the procedural history is fully recited in the\n\nopinion of the magistrate judge from which this appeal arises.   It\n\nthus suffices to provide only brief context. Petitioner and George\n\nMadden, a neighbor and frequent companion, were both charged in\n\nconnection with the arson of a home adjacent to the apartment\n\nbuilding where they lived.    Both men had strained relationships\n\nwith the home owner, whose son died in the blaze from smoke\n\n\n\n     1\n       An abbreviated version of the facts was given in the\nappellate court's decision affirming denial of petitioner's motion\nfor new trial.    See Commonwealth v. DeCicco,744 N.E.2d 95, 97\n(Mass. App. Ct. 2001).\n\n                               -2-\n\finhalation; the father had recently stopped providing them with\n\ncocaine, and they had been trying to persuade him to resume.\n\nPetitioner and Madden each contended the other had thrown the fire\n\nbomb that triggered the blaze. The jury found petitioner guilty of\n\nsecond-degree murder and several other crimes.\n\n     Two issues are before us.       First, petitioner claims that the\n\nprosecutor improperly bolstered the credibility of Madden, the\n\ngovernment's key witness, by telling the jury that he would be\n\ntried later for first-degree murder and was not receiving any plea\n\nbenefits for his testimony.         As it turned out, Madden pleaded\n\nguilty eleven months later to a reduced charge of manslaughter.\n\nPetitioner argues that the jurors would have viewed Madden's\n\ndamaging testimony less favorably, and would not have convicted\n\npetitioner, had the prosecutor not misled them.\n\n     Second,    petitioner    asserts     that   his    trial   counsel   was\n\nineffective because he told the jury that petitioner would testify\n\nbut then did not call him to the stand.          Petitioner contends that\n\nthis failure to follow through on a promise damaged counsel's\n\ncredibility with the jury and strengthened the government's version\n\nof the facts by allowing Madden's testimony to remain unopposed.\n\n     The courts that previously have ruled on these two issues\n\nconfronted two limitations on the scope of their review: the\n\njurisprudence   of   waiver   and   the    highly      deferential   standard\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fapplicable to habeas claims.      As we shall explain, those factors\n\nlikewise constrain our assessment.         We take each issue in turn.\n\n     Bolstering Claim.        Petitioner first raised the issue of\n\nMadden's plea agreement in a motion for new trial that he submitted\n\nafter the Massachusetts Appeals Court ruled against him on direct\n\nappeal.    The trial court denied the motion.         In its subsequent\n\nruling, the Appeals Court indicated that the bolstering claim was\n\nwaived because it was not raised on direct appeal.        See 744 N.E.2d\n\nat 97.    It applied the standard applicable to waived claims, see\n\nid. (citing Commonwealth v. Amirault, 677 N.E.2d 652 (Mass. 1997)),\n\nand found that there was no substantial risk that the result would\n\nhave been different without the asserted error,2 id. at 100.          On\n\nhabeas review, the district court applied long established case law\n\non procedural default and concluded that petitioner failed to show\n\ncause for omitting the bolstering claim from earlier proceedings.\n\nSee Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87 (1977); Burks v. Dubois,\n\n55 F.3d 712, 716 (lst Cir. 1995). Consequently, the district court\n\nconsidered   only   whether    his     conviction   was   a   fundamental\n\nmiscarriage of justice, and found that it was not.3\n\n\n     2\n       One judge on the panel dissented, stating: \"In view of the\nweakness of the government's case apart from Madden's testimony, I\nbelieve that the misleading evidence concerning Madden's potential\nmotives for bias likely 'affected the judgment of the jury,'\nrequiring reversal.\" 744 N.E.2d at 101.\n     3\n       To demonstrate a fundamental miscarriage of justice, the\npetitioner must establish that \"'a constitutional violation has\nprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually\n\n                                     -4-\n\f     We agree with the district court's reasoning. Petitioner knew\n\nbefore his direct appeal was argued about the change in Madden's\n\nstatus,4 and it appears that Mass. R. App. P. 8(e) would have\n\nallowed the    Commonwealth    Appeals   Court     to    admit   the    fact   of\n\nMadden's plea agreement into evidence even though it was not in the\n\ntrial court record.5        See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Harrison, 712\n\nN.E.2d 74, 75 n.1 (Mass. 1999) (the fact of defendant's guilty plea\n\nto a federal charge was not part of the original record, but was\n\nadmitted by the Appeals Court on motion by the Commonwealth).\n\nAlthough petitioner disputes the efficacy of the rule for this\n\npurpose, we do not see why Madden's late-arising deal would not\n\nqualify as a \"material\" fact that had been either omitted from, or\n\nmisstated in, the record.      Petitioner made no attempt to test the\n\nrule. See Commonwealth v. Randolph, 780 N.E.2d 58, 64 (Mass. 2002)\n\n(\"At its core, the waiver doctrine states that a defendant must\n\nraise a claim of error at the first available opportunity.\").                  We\n\nacknowledge that the state appeals panel that did consider the\n\nissue    refrained   from   explicitly   terming    it    waived,      observing\n\n\ninnocent.'\" Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1992) (quoting\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986)).\n     4\n       Madden's disposition was disclosed in the Commonwealth's\nbrief on appeal.\n     5\n       The rule allows admission of new evidence into the record\neither through stipulation by the parties or on motion \"[i]f\nanything material to either party is omitted from the record by\nerror or accident or is misstated therein . . . .\" Mass. R. App.\nP. 8(e).\n\n                                   -5-\n\finstead that petitioner's failure to raise it at trial or on direct\n\nappeal \"implicates the possibility of waiver,\" 744 N.E.2d at 97\n\n(emphasis added).         But the court then went on to utilize the\n\nstandard of review applicable to waived claims.           In our view, the\n\ncourt thus treated the bolstering issue as waived, limiting its own\n\nreview with the consequence of limiting ours as well. We therefore\n\nhold that the district court properly disposed of this issue.6\n\n       Ineffective Assistance of Counsel/Unfulfilled Promise.            The\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court concluded that defense counsel \"failed\n\nto meet a minimum standard of performance by announcing to the jury\n\nthat the defendant might testify without first having met with him\n\nto discuss that possibility and to prepare him for it,\" 688 N.E.2d\n\nat 1088.        Pursuant to the two-part test applicable under both\n\nfederal and state law for ineffective assistance claims, the court\n\nthen       explored   whether   counsel's   deficient   representation   was\n\nprejudicial, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 694\n\n(1984); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 754 N.E.2d 685, 694 (Mass. 2001),\n\nand found that it was not.         See 688 N.E.2d at 122-24.\n\n       The district court, in turn, considered the issue with the\n\nsubstantial deference required by the Antiterrorism and Effective\n\nDeath Penalty Act (AEDPA).         See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,\n\n\n       6\n       We note that, even if we did not view the claim as waived,\nthe outcome would be the same; on this record, we could not say\nthat the Massachusetts court's decision either was contrary to or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal\nlaw. See infra at 7.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f412-13 (2000); McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 23, 35-37 (lst Cir.\n\n2002) (en banc).     In relevant part, that statute bars a federal\n\ncourt    from   granting   habeas   relief    unless    the     state   court\n\nadjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an   unreasonable   application     of,    clearly    established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).          The district court agreed that\n\n\"trial counsel undoubtedly made a serious error,\" but disagreed\n\nwith the finding of no prejudice: \"If viewed de novo, this court\n\nwould conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that, but for\n\ncounsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.\"     The court recognized that the question was close,\n\nhowever, and, in light of the constraints imposed by AEDPA, could\n\nnot say that the Appeals Court's decision was an unreasonable\n\napplication of the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\n\n     Both the Massachusetts Appeals Court and the district court\n\nassessed prejudice by reviewing the relevant distinctions between\n\nthis case and other cases in which habeas relief was granted based\n\non counsel's failure to call a defendant or expert whose testimony\n\nhad been promised in an opening statement.           As the district court\n\nobserved, the differences add up to a very close case.7            Given the\n\n\n     7\n       The distinctions noted by the district court included: (1)\nprior cases involved more dramatic, unequivocal and repeated\npromises that the defendant or an expert would testify; (2)\npetitioner's version of events did reach the jury through the\ncross-examination testimony of State Trooper Cox, albeit in a less\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnarrow sphere in which we may act, we are compelled to affirm\n\ndismissal of the habeas petition. Regardless whether we would make\n\nthe same judgment, we cannot say the conclusion reached by the\n\nstate appeals court was objectively unreasonable.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\npowerful form than live testimony from petitioner himself; (3) the\ncumulative nature of his testimony diminished the likelihood that\nthe jury would draw a negative inference from his non-appearance.\nSee Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2002); Anderson v.\nButler, 858 F.2d 16 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

But the court then went on to utilize the\n\nstandard of review applicable to waived claims.           In our view, the\n\ncourt thus treated the bolstering issue as waived, limiting its own\n\nreview with the consequence of limiting ours as well. We therefore\n\nhold that the district court properly disposed of this issue.6\n\n       Ineffective Assistance of Counsel/Unfulfilled Promise.            The\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court concluded that defense counsel \"failed\n\nto meet a minimum standard of performance by announcing to the jury\n\nthat the defendant might testify without first having met with him\n\nto discuss that possibility and to prepare him for it,\" 688 N.E.2d\n\nat 1088.        Pursuant to the two-part test applicable under both\n\nfederal and state law for ineffective assistance claims, the court\n\nthen       explored   whether   counsel's   deficient   representation   was\n\nprejudicial, see Strickland v.

See 688 N.E.2d at 122-24.\n\n       The district court, in turn, considered the issue with the\n\nsubstantial deference required by the Antiterrorism and Effective\n\nDeath Penalty Act (AEDPA).         See Williams v.

In relevant part, that statute bars a federal\n\ncourt    from   granting   habeas   relief    unless    the     state   court\n\nadjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an   unreasonable   application     of,    clearly    established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).          The district court agreed that\n\n\"trial counsel undoubtedly made a serious error,\" but disagreed\n\nwith the finding of no prejudice: \"If viewed de novo, this court\n\nwould conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that, but for\n\ncounsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.\"     The court recognized that the question was close,\n\nhowever, and, in light of the constraints imposed by AEDPA, could\n\nnot say that the Appeals Court's decision was an unreasonable\n\napplication of the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.\n\n     Both the Massachusetts Appeals Court and the district court\n\nassessed prejudice by reviewing the relevant distinctions between\n\nthis case and other cases in which habeas relief was granted based\n\non counsel's failure to call a defendant or expert whose testimony\n\nhad been promised in an opening statement.           As the district court\n\nobserved, the differences add up to a very close case.7            Given the\n\n\n     7\n       The distinctions noted by the district court included: (1)\nprior cases involved more dramatic, unequivocal and repeated\npromises that the defendant or an expert would testify; (2)\npetitioner's version of events did reach the jury through the\ncross-examination testimony of State Trooper Cox, albeit in a less\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnarrow sphere in which we may act, we are compelled to affirm\n\ndismissal of the habeas petition.
