Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n         Antonio Bauza Torres for appellants.\n\n          Lionel E. Santa-Crispín,    Puerto   Rico   Electric   Power\nAuthority, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        August 20, 2002\n\f          PER CURIAM.    Plaintiff-appellant Ricardo Ramos Falcón\n\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico alleging violations of the Americans With\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.       Ramos Falcón\n\ncontends that defendant-appellee Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica\n\n(PREPA) deprived him of a reasonable accommodation when it forcibly\n\nexpelled him from its parking lot.      The district court entered a\n\ndefault judgment against PREPA.     Following a post-default hearing\n\non damages, however, the court dismissed Ramos Falcón's ADA claim.\n\nWe vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings on the\n\nground that the court failed to provide notice to Ramos Falcón that\n\nit was taking evidence concerning the merits of his case at the\n\ndamages hearing.\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiff-appellants are Ricardo Ramos Falcón and his\n\nfather, Ricardo Ramos Hernandez, and mother, Irma Falcón.       Ramos\n\nFalcón depends on a wheelchair to get around.\n\n          In   his   complaint,   Ramos   Falcón   alleges   that   on\n\nFebruary 23, 1999, he entered a parking lot maintained by PREPA for\n\nits customers in order to pay his monthly electric bill.            The\n\nautomobile in which he was riding carried his wheelchair and was\n\ndriven by his father, Ricardo Ramos Hernández. In the parking lot,\n\nRamos Hernández stopped the car in order to unload his son's\n\nwheelchair. A parking lot employee ordered Ramos Hernández to move\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe car.    Father and son tried to explain to the employee why it\n\nwas necessary to park the automobile where it was.                   They asked the\n\nemployee for permission to unload the wheelchair so Ramos Falcón\n\ncould proceed to PREPA's office.\n\n           The   employee,    in    a    violent       and   aggressive    manner,\n\ninsisted on the removal of the wheelchair and the car and pushed\n\nthe wheelchair with Ramos Falcón still seated in it.                  Ramos Falcón\n\nwas thrown to the pavement and his wheelchair landed on top of him.\n\nAs a result, he experienced severe pain and suffering, underwent\n\nmedical    treatment   and   therapy          for   two    years,    and   suffered\n\nadditional physical limitations.              Ramos Hernández alleges severe\n\nemotional harm as a result of witnessing the events.\n\n           The complaint alleged, inter alia, \"No other reasonable\n\naccommodations were available to Plaintiffs in order to unload\n\nRamos Falcón and his wheelchair from the car.\"\n\n           PREPA   failed    to    answer      Ramos      Falcón's    complaint   or\n\notherwise appear.      Accordingly, the court entered a default on\n\nSeptember 7, 2000.     On January 11, 2001, the court held a hearing\n\non default and damages, at which it heard evidence concerning,\n\ninter alia, two handicap parking spaces available at the PREPA\n\nparking lot.     PREPA failed to appear for the trial.\n\n           On January 24, 2001, PREPA filed a motion to set aside\n\nthe entry of default, which the court denied.                  On June 20, 2001,\n\nthe court dismissed Ramos Falcón's complaint on the merits.                       In\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fsupport of this holding, it held that the existence of the two\n\nhandicap parking spaces provided \"equal opportunity of enjoying the\n\npremises or services.\"\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n             After    entry   of     a   default       judgment,    Fed.   R.     Civ.\n\nP. 55(b)(2) provides as follows:\n\n           If, in order to enable the court to enter\n           judgment or to carry it into effect, it is\n           necessary to take an account or to determine\n           the amount of damages or to establish the\n           truth of any averment by evidence or to make\n           an investigation of any other matter, the\n           court may conduct such hearings or order such\n           references as it deems necessary and proper\n           and shall accord a right of trial by jury to\n           the parties . . ..\n\nThe court also may examine a plaintiff's complaint, taking all\n\nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true, to determine whether it\n\nalleges a cause of action.          Quirindongo Pacheco v. Rolón Morales,\n\n953 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           Additionally,      the    court       may     conduct   a   hearing      to\n\n\"establish the truth of any averment\" in the complaint.                            Id.\n\nHowever,   \"[i]n     this   circuit,      we     have    stated    that    this    is\n\nappropriate only if the court has made 'its requirements known in\n\nadvance to   the     plaintiff,     so    that    [he]    could    understand     the\n\ndirection of the proceeding and marshall such evidence as might be\n\navailable to [him].'\" Id. (quoting McGinty v. Berenger Volkswagen,\n\nInc., 633 F.2d 226, 229 (1st Cir. 1980)).\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f            In this case, the post-default hearing involved evidence\n\nconcerning, inter alia, the complaint's allegation that PREPA\n\nprovided no reasonable accommodations to unload Ramos Falcón and\n\nhis wheelchair from the car.        Central to the court's dismissal of\n\nthe ADA claim was its determination that PREPA had satisfied its\n\nobligation to provide \"equal opportunity\" by making available\n\nhandicap parking spaces.         The record does not show, however, that\n\nthe district court provided adequate notice to Ramos Falcón that it\n\nintended to address this issue at the post-default damages hearing.\n\nIn   the   absence   of   such   notice,   the   district   court   erred   in\n\ndismissing the ADA claim. See Quirindongo Pacheco, 953 F.2d at 16.\n\n            Accordingly, we VACATE the entry of judgment in favor of\n\nPREPA and REMAND this matter to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
