In   this     direct       criminal     appeal,\n\nappellant Ranlec Vladimir Javier, who pled guilty to an illegal\n\nreentry offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and (b)(2), challenges\n\nthe district court's imposition of a sentence at the low end of\n\nthe applicable Sentencing Guideline range.               We affirm.\n\n          Javier objects primarily to the district court's\n\ndetermination that his downward departure motion lacked merit.\n\nHe fails to show that the court misapprehended either the law\n\nor its authority to depart, and so we cannot review its\n\ndecision. United States v. Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50-51\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (confirming that the court of appeals \"lacks\n\njurisdiction to review a sentencing court's refusal to depart\n\ndownward based on its belief that the defendant's circumstances\n\nfail to warrant such departure\").\n\n          Javier   suggests    further      that     the   district     court\n\nfailed to make an individualized sentencing determination.\n\nHowever, the sentencing transcript confirms that the opposite\n\nis true. The district court imposed a Guideline sentence after\n\ntaking   account   of   Javier's         personal       circumstances     and\n\nconsidering the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n          Finally,   Javier    argues      that     a   \"more   reasonable\"\n\nsentence would have resulted if his departure motion had been\n\ngranted, but that argument is unavailing.                   On appeal, we\n\ndetermine only whether the sentence imposed is reasonable, not\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwhether some other sentence would have been more reasonable.\n\nSee United States v.
