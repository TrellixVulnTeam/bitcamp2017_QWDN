ELLIS,\n\n                      Petitioner, Appellee,\n\n                                v.\n\n                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                      Respondent, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n      [Hon. Frank H.

Goodman, Appellate Section, Criminal Division,\nUnited States Department of Justice, with whom Michael J. Sullivan,\nUnited States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.\n     John G.S. Flym, by appointment of the court, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 20, 2002\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.                 These appeals, which have their\n\ngenesis in an effort by the petitioner, Edward B. Ellis, to mount\n\na   collateral        attack        on      his     convictions          for       interstate\n\ntransportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual\n\nactivity, present challenging legal questions complicated by a\n\nstrange procedural twist.                 That complication arose after the\n\noriginal trial judge denied Ellis's section 2255 petition in part\n\nand then recused himself as to the unadjudicated portion of the\n\npetition.        A    limited       order    of     reassignment         followed.          The\n\ntransferee judge, acting partly on the basis of a previously\n\nunadjudicated        claim    and    partly       on   the    basis      of    a   previously\n\nadjudicated claim, proceeded to grant the petition.\n\n            The hybrid nature of this decision requires that we\n\nreview its       component      parts       separately.            The   first     ground   of\n\ndecision involves the trial judge's handling of a jury note.                                 We\n\nagree with the transferee judge's finding of error — the original\n\ntrial judge used an incorrect procedure in dealing with the jury\n\nnote   —   but   we    hold    that      this      error     was    harmless       under    the\n\ncircumstances.        The second ground of decision involves whether the\n\nspecial seating arrangement afforded to the victim during her trial\n\ntestimony offended the Confrontation Clause.                         We hold that under\n\nthe law of the case doctrine the transferee judge should not have\n\nrevisited the issue, but, rather, should have left intact the\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\foriginal judge's finding that no constitutional violation had\n\noccurred.\n\n             In light of these holdings, we discern no principled\n\nbasis for habeas relief.           Consequently, we reverse the order\n\ngranting the petitioner a new trial and remand the case with\n\ndirections to enter judgment for the United States.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             In 1990, a jury convicted the petitioner on three counts\n\nof interstate transportation of a minor with intent to engage in\n\ncriminal sexual activity.         See 18 U.S.C. § 2423.             The district\n\ncourt imposed a twenty-five year incarcerative term.                     On direct\n\nappeal, we affirmed the convictions and sentence. United States v.\n\nEllis, 935 F.2d 385 (1st Cir. 1991).               We suggest that those who\n\nhunger for a more exegetic account of the crimes of conviction\n\nconsult that opinion.\n\n             For    present   purposes,      it   suffices    to   say    that   the\n\npetitioner    was    found    guilty   of    repeatedly      abusing     (in   three\n\ndifferent states) the youthful daughter of his live-in girlfriend.\n\nId. at 388-89.        The evidence adduced against him included the\n\ntestimony of his victim, E.D. (who was nine years old at the time\n\nof trial).    In a preliminary discussion, it was suggested, without\n\nobjection from the petitioner's counsel (Attorney Goldings), that\n\nE.D. testify while seated \"in such a way that she does not look at\n\n[the petitioner].\"\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            Notwithstanding          his    initial     acquiescence,       Goldings\n\nobjected to the special seating arrangement when E.D. was called as\n\na witness.        Judge Freedman overruled the objection.               During her\n\ntestimony, E.D. sat in a chair facing the jurors but facing away\n\nfrom the petitioner.          The parties disagree both as to the exact\n\nangle between E.D. and the petitioner and as to how much of E.D.'s\n\nface the petitioner could see during her testimony.                   It is clear,\n\nhowever, that E.D., while testifying, could only have made eye\n\ncontact with the petitioner by looking over her right shoulder. It\n\nis     equally    clear    that   she      did    not   avail   herself     of   this\n\nopportunity.\n\n             On     direct    appeal,       the     petitioner     unsuccessfully\n\nchallenged the sufficiency of the evidence, various evidentiary\n\nrulings, the jury instructions, and the length of the sentence.\n\nId. at 389-97.       He did not advance any claim related either to the\n\nhandling of the jury note (discussed infra) or to the special\n\nseating arrangement.\n\n             In 1997, the petitioner moved pro se to vacate his\n\nsentence.        See 28 U.S.C. § 2255.       In that petition, he maintained\n\nthat    Goldings     had   rendered     ineffective      assistance    of   counsel\n\n(including a failure to present certain exculpatory evidence and\n\nimpedance of his right to testify); charged Goldings with having\n\nconcealed a conflict of interest; lodged a Confrontation Clause\n\nchallenge    to     the    special    seating      arrangement;    complained      of\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fprosecutorial misbehavior; and accused Judge Freedman of judicial\n\nbias and misconduct.     He also filed two motions:           one seeking the\n\nappointment of counsel and the other asking Judge Freedman to step\n\naside.\n\n          Judge Freedman denied the motion for appointment of\n\ncounsel out of hand.        As for the recusal motion, he did not\n\ndisqualify himself generally, but, rather, proceeded to resolve\n\nfour of the petitioner's five claims.             Specifically, he denied the\n\ncognate ineffective assistance of counsel claims insofar as those\n\nclaims touched    upon   the    failure      to   present   evidence   and   the\n\nsupposed interference with the petitioner's right to testify; found\n\nno cognizable conflict of interest; and ruled that the assertions\n\nof prosecutorial misconduct were overblown.                 Given the present\n\nposture of the case, we need not discuss any of these rulings.\n\n          Judge Freedman's disposition of the Confrontation Clause\n\nclaim requires some elaboration.             For purposes of that analysis,\n\nJudge Freedman accepted, without deciding, that Goldings's failure\n\nto pursue the claim on direct appeal established ineffective\n\nassistance   of   counsel      (and,    therefore,      established    \"cause\"\n\nnecessary to overcome the applicable procedural bar).                    Judge\n\nFreedman then discussed the relevant Supreme Court precedents and\n\nexplained that, as the trial judge, he had made an individualized\n\ndetermination that a special accommodation was needed because E.D.\n\nwould have to testify regarding the \"heinous acts\" of sexual abuse\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthat she had endured at the hands of someone who lived with her and\n\nwho had threatened to kill her and her family members.   Since these\n\nfacts supported the use of the special seating arrangement, Judge\n\nFreedman concluded that an appeal from the court's decision to\n\nemploy the special seating arrangement would have been futile, and,\n\ntherefore, that Goldings's failure to challenge the arrangement on\n\nappeal was harmless. Accordingly, he denied both the Confrontation\n\nClause claim and the related ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim.   See Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 369-70 (1993)\n\n(outlining   applicable   prejudice   requirement);   Strickland   v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984) (same).\n\n          Having adjudicated these four sets of claims, Judge\n\nFreedman stopped short of resolving the whole of the petition.\n\nInstead, he recused himself as to the fifth claim (the accusation\n\nof judicial bias and misconduct). See Murchu v. United States, 926\n\nF.2d 50, 53 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991) (suggesting \"that the district\n\njudge should have recused himself as to those portions of [a]\n\nsection 2255 motion which alleged judicial misconduct\").    Instead,\n\nhe asked the chief judge to reassign the case to a new judge to\n\n\"consider and render a decision on the balance of the petitioner's\n\nclaims and enter judgment accordingly on those claims as well as\n\nthose addressed by this court in its Memorandum and Order entered\n\non March 2, 1998.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          The chief judge subsequently assigned the case to Judge\n\nKeeton. Judge Keeton appointed counsel to represent the petitioner\n\nand gave both parties leave to file supplementary memoranda on the\n\nallegations of judicial bias and misconduct concerning (1) the\n\ncourt's decision to allow a special seating arrangement; (2)\n\ncertain comments and gestures supposedly made by Judge Freedman\n\nduring E.D.'s testimony; and (3) Judge Freedman's handling of a\n\nnote from the deliberating jury.\n\n          Following a hearing, Judge Keeton unequivocally rejected\n\nthe petitioner's claims of judicial bias (finding, inter alia, that\n\nbias played no role in the establishment of the special seating\n\narrangement, and that Judge Freedman had made no untoward comments\n\nor gestures during the trial).     He concluded, however, that Judge\n\nFreedman's exchange of notes with the jury deprived the petitioner\n\nof the assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the case (and,\n\nthus, violated the Sixth Amendment).1    Judge Keeton then opted to\n\nrevisit the petitioner's already adjudicated Confrontation Clause\n\nclaim.   Deeming his predecessor's findings inadequate and the\n\npetitioner's view of E.D. during trial too constrained, Judge\n\nKeeton reversed the earlier ruling and declared unconstitutional\n\nthe use of the special seating arrangement.    Based on this pair of\n\n\n     1\n      Although the handling of the jury note reflects error, not\nmisconduct, this is an essentially semantic difference for purposes\nof the case at bar. What matters is that, under the limited order\nof reassignment, the jury note claim was properly within Judge\nKeeton's adjudicatory purview.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fconclusions, Judge Keeton granted the section 2255 petition, set\n\naside the convictions, and ordered a new trial.\n\n           The government thereupon filed these appeals.         We treat\n\nthem as one:     they have been consolidated, and it would serve no\n\nuseful purpose to dwell upon the technical considerations that\n\nprompted the government to file two appeals instead of one.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n           Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, a convict in federal custody may\n\nask the sentencing court to vacate, set aside, or correct his\n\nsentence on the ground that the court had imposed the sentence in\n\nviolation of federal law (including, of course, the Constitution).\n\nBrackett v. United States, 270 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2001).            In\n\nessence, then, section 2255 is a surrogate for the historic writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.     See Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 344\n\n(1974).\n\n           When an appeal is taken from an order under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255, we examine the district court's legal conclusions de novo and\n\nscrutinize its findings of fact for clear error.         Familia-Consoro\n\nv. United States, 160 F.3d 761, 764-65 (1st Cir. 1998).          When the\n\ndistrict court dismisses claims without holding an evidentiary\n\nhearing, we take as true the sworn allegations of fact set forth in\n\nthe   petition   unless   those   allegations   are   merely   conclusory,\n\ncontradicted by the record, or inherently incredible.             Mack v.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fUnited States, 635 F.2d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1980); see also United\n\nStates v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Only the jury note and seating arrangement claims are in\n\nissue here.   The petitioner has neither prosecuted a cross-appeal\n\nnor otherwise challenged Judge Freedman's disposition of his other\n\nsection 2255 claims.   This narrowed scope of review, together with\n\nthe absence of a cross-appeal, dictates that we focus on the\n\nrulings of the successor judge.   We proceed in two steps.    First,\n\nwe discuss Judge Keeton's assessment of the jury note claim.      We\n\nthen consider his assessment of the Confrontation Clause claim\n\n(concentrating, for reasons that will soon become apparent, on his\n\nauthority to revisit Judge Freedman's earlier adjudication of that\n\nclaim).\n\n           We preface our analysis with an acknowledgment that one\n\ncourt has flatly rejected the concept of partial recusal.        See\n\nUnited States v. Feldman, 983 F.2d 144, 145 (9th Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"[W]hen a judge determines that recusal is appropriate it is not\n\nwithin his discretion to recuse by subject matter or only as to\n\ncertain issues and not others.\").     The majority view, however,\n\nsupports the availability of such a case-management device.    See,\n\ne.g., Pashaian v. Eccelston Prop., Ltd., 88 F.3d 77, 84-85 (2d Cir.\n\n1996); United States v. Kimberlin, 781 F.2d 1247, 1258-59 (7th Cir.\n\n1985).    While we have not spoken directly to the subject, we\n\nindicated our approval of the praxis in Murchu, 926 F.2d at 53 n.3,\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f56-57.     See also Warner v. Rossignol, 538 F.2d 910, 914 n.6 (1st\n\nCir. 1976) (finding no loss of capacity to rule on retained issues\n\neven after recusal from other issues).             Today, we make that\n\napproval explicit:       we hold that a judge may, in an appropriate\n\ncase, decide certain issues and recuse himself or herself as to\n\nothers.    This was an appropriate case, and we therefore hold that\n\nJudge Freedman's partial recusal was a valid exercise of judicial\n\nauthority.    Under the circumstances, it constituted a sound method\n\nof dealing with the prickly problem of balancing the demands of\n\nsection 2255 — a statute that evinces a strong preference for post-\n\nconviction review by the judge who presided at the defendant's\n\ntrial — with the demands of the recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n455(a).      We   add,   moreover,   that   the   chief   judge   responded\n\nappropriately to this partial recusal by entering a limited order\n\nof reassignment.\n\n             Although limited orders of reassignment may — as in this\n\ncase — be necessary and proper, they place unaccustomed restraints\n\non the transferee judge.      When a court assumes jurisdiction for a\n\nlimited purpose, it ordinarily should confine itself to that\n\npurpose.     Cf. United States v. Erwin, 155 F.3d 818, 825 (6th Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that a magistrate judge may not overstep the bounds\n\nof an order of reference); King v. Ionization Int'l, Inc., 825 F.2d\n\n1180, 1185-86 (7th Cir. 1987) (same).        Observing the restrictions\n\nimplied in such an order promotes the efficient operation of the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcourts     and   facilitates        the    winnowing     of   issues    throughout\n\nsuccessive stages of litigation.             See Erwin, 155 F.3d at 825.          By\n\nthe same token, courts that carefully observe the boundaries of\n\ntheir assignments help stabilize the decisionmaking process, assure\n\nthe   predictability      of    results,         and   nourish   proper       working\n\nrelationships between judicial units.                  United States v. Rivera-\n\nMartinez, 931 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir. 1991). This case illustrates\n\nthe wisdom of adherence to these prudential policies.\n\n                               A.    The Jury Note.\n\n            Judge Keeton's first ground of decision arises out of the\n\npetitioner's allegation that, three and one-half hours after jury\n\ndeliberations had begun, the jurors sent Judge Freedman a note\n\nasking:    \"Does it have to be unanimous to be not guilty on a [sic]\n\nindictment if the vote come [sic] out uneven?\"                Without consulting\n\neither side, the judge sent back a written response stating:                    \"The\n\nverdict on all counts must be unanimous.                  All 12 jur[ors] must\n\nagree.\"     Approximately thirty minutes later, the jury found the\n\npetitioner guilty on all charges.\n\n            Although Judge Keeton discerned no evidence of judicial\n\nbias or partiality in Judge Freedman's conduct, he concluded that\n\nhis predecessor had erred in handling the jury note and that the ex\n\nparte exchange between judge and jury had deprived the petitioner\n\nof his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel at a\n\ncritical     stage   in   the       proceedings.         He   found    this     error\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fprejudicial, stating:        \"Given the timing and substance of the ex\n\nparte communication, I conclude that it is likely that the trial\n\njudge's response had substantial and injurious effect or influence\n\nin determining the jury's verdict.\"             In this regard, he theorized\n\nthat the jury could have misunderstood the comment that \"[t]he\n\nverdict on all counts must be unanimous\" to preclude a partial\n\nverdict, an ambiguity that consultation with counsel could have\n\nprevented.\n\n              We agree with Judge Keeton that Judge Freedman erred by\n\nfailing to consult the parties before responding substantively to\n\nthe deliberating jury's request for a supplementary instruction.\n\nSee Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 38-39 (1975); United\n\nStates v. Parent, 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1992).                  The incidence\n\nof   error,    however,    does    not    end   our   inquiry.       Because   the\n\npetitioner     did   not   raise    any    challenge    to   this    supplemental\n\ninstruction     in   his   direct    appeal,    the    claim   is    procedurally\n\ndefaulted.      It is, therefore, unreviewable on collateral attack\n\nunless the petitioner can show (1) cause sufficient to excuse his\n\nfailure to raise it on direct appeal, and (2) actual prejudice.\n\nSee Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622 (1998); Derman v.\n\nUnited States, 298 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 2002).2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      There is arguably a further exception for evidence showing\nactual innocence, see Bousley, 523 U.S. at 622, but the petitioner\ndoes not invoke that exception here.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f             Judge    Keeton      found    cause    sufficient   to     excuse    the\n\nprocedural     default.         We    assume,      for   argument's     sake,     the\n\nsupportability of that finding.                  After all, the notes were not\n\nindexed on the district court's docket sheet, and the petitioner\n\nsays that he did not learn of them until 1995 (when a friend\n\ndiscovered them in the case file).                 Thus, this ground of appeal\n\narguably was unavailable to the petitioner at the time of his\n\ndirect appeal.       Cf. Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249, 255 (1988)\n\n(finding that mere placement of ex parte orders in court file does\n\nnot yield constructive notice satisfying the Sixth Amendment).\n\n            The      question     reduces,        therefore,   to     whether     any\n\ncognizable prejudice resulted from the error.                  Quoting Brecht v.\n\nAbrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637-38 (1993), Judge Keeton described the\n\ntest as whether the error exerted a \"substantial and injurious\n\neffect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"                           The\n\npetitioner    resists     this     description;       citing   United    States       v.\n\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984), he argues that such errors can\n\nnever be harmless because they necessarily involve the denial of\n\ncounsel at a critical stage of a criminal trial.                    This argument\n\nlacks force.\n\n             The Supreme Court recently has emphasized how seldom\n\ncircumstances arise that justify a court in presuming prejudice\n\n(and,   concomitantly,       in      forgoing     particularized    inquiry      into\n\nwhether a     denial    of   counsel      undermined     the   reliability       of    a\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fjudgment).      See Mickens v. Taylor, 122 S. Ct. 1237, 1241 (2002);\n\nBell v. Cone, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 1850-51 (2002).               We, too, have\n\nstressed this point.        See, e.g., Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 12,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 1994).     The only Sixth Amendment violations that fit\n\nwithin   this    narrowly    circumscribed    class   are   those    that   are\n\npervasive in nature, permeating the entire proceeding.              See Roe v.\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 483 (2000) (collecting cases).                 In\n\nother words, the doctrine of per se prejudice applies to \"a\n\nwholesale denial of counsel,\" whereas conventional harmless error\n\nanalysis applies to a \"short-term, localized denial of counsel.\"\n\nCurtis v. Duval, 124 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Here, the petitioner does not posit that he lacked the\n\neffective assistance of counsel throughout the proceedings but only\n\nat a specific point in the trial (when the jury sent the note in\n\nquestion and the judge responded).           This is a difference \"not of\n\ndegree but of kind\" in terms of whether the court's error can be\n\ndeemed per se prejudicial.       Cone, 122 S. Ct. at 1851.     We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that prejudice cannot be presumed on the basis of the\n\nmomentary lapse that occurred in this case.3          Cf. Rushen v. Spain,\n\n\n     3\n      The petitioner's argument is not bolstered by his reliance on\nFrench v. Jones, 282 F.3d 893, 901 (6th Cir. 2002) (affirming the\ngrant of a state prisoner's habeas petition on the ground that the\nstate courts \"unreasonably applied harmless error analysis to\nFrench's   deprivation   of   counsel   during   the   supplemental\ninstruction\").    The Supreme Court recently vacated the Sixth\nCircuit's decision in French and remanded the case \"for further\nconsideration in light of Bell v. Cone[].\" Jones v. French, 122 S.\nCt. 2324 (2002).\n\n                                    -14-\n\f464 U.S. 114, 117-19 & n.2 (1983) (per curiam) (holding that an ex\n\nparte discussion between judge and juror can be harmless error);\n\nColeman v.       Alabama,   399   U.S.   1,    10-11   (1970)   (remanding   for\n\nharmlessness      determination     when      court    had   improperly   denied\n\ndefendant counsel at preliminary hearing).\n\n              Clarifying that there is no presumption of prejudice does\n\nnot doom the petitioner's quest.              It simply means that the trial\n\ncourt's mishandling of the jury note does not lead automatically to\n\nthe vacation of his convictions.           We still must decide whether the\n\nerror affected his substantial rights.\n\n              Although we have left open the proper standard for\n\ngauging harmlessness when such a claim of error is raised on direct\n\nappeal, see, e.g., Parent, 954 F.2d at 25 n.5, the instant claim\n\nnot only arises on collateral attack but also is procedurally\n\ndefaulted.       In such circumstances, it is settled in this circuit\n\nthat a reviewing court must apply the \"actual prejudice\" standard\n\ndelineated in Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637-38.              See Sustache-Rivera v.\n\nUnited States, 221 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 2000); Curtis, 124 F.3d at\n\n6-7.4       This standard requires us to ask whether the error had a\n\n\n        4\n      To be sure, one court has used the more rigorous \"harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\" standard in circumstances similar to\nthose presented in this case. See Starr v. Lockhart, 23 F.3d 1280,\n1291-92 (8th Cir. 1994). We reject that view as contrary both to\ncircuit precedent and to the overwhelming weight of authority\nelsewhere. See, e.g., Bains v. Cambra, 204 F.3d 964, 976-77 (9th\nCir. 2000) (collecting cases); Lyons v. Stovall, 188 F.3d 327, 335\n(6th Cir. 1999); Hogue v. Johnson, 131 F.3d 466, 498-99 (5th Cir.\n1997) (collecting cases).\n\n                                     -15-\n\fsubstantial and injurious effect or influence on the outcome of the\n\nproceedings. Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637-38. In answering that query,\n\nthe burden of proof as to harmlessness falls on the government.\n\nO'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 438-44 (1995).\n\n          Having established the ground rules, we return to the\n\nparticulars of the case at hand.       Judge Keeton identified the\n\ncorrect test for gauging prejudice in this type of situation.    In\n\nour view, however, he misapplied the test in hypothesizing that the\n\nphrase, \"The verdict on all counts must be unanimous,\" was \"subject\n\nto interpretation\" in an incorrect way (i.e., that the jurors must\n\nreach unanimous agreement on all counts combined, rather than on\n\neach count separately) and that it was \"likely\" to have influenced\n\nthe verdict.    When the Brecht standard is properly applied in the\n\ncontext of this case, the record reflects that the government has\n\ncarried the devoir of persuasion.\n\n          The impetus for the standard articulated in Brecht is\n\nthat the bar should be held fairly high on post-conviction review.\n\nSuch proceedings are meant to afford relief only to those who have\n\nbeen grievously wronged, not to those who show merely a possibility\n\n— even a reasonable possibility — of harm.   See Brecht, 507 U.S. at\n\n637; see also Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d 233, 237 n.9 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).    This applies with even greater force to procedurally\n\ndefaulted claims raised for the first time on collateral review.\n\nSee United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 166 (1982) (requiring\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fsuch claims to clear a significantly higher hurdle on collateral\n\nattack than on direct review); Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d\n\n769, 772-73 (1st Cir. 1994) (same).\n\n          The bottom line is that a court cannot grant collateral\n\nrelief on \"mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by\n\ntrial error; the court must find that the defendant was actually\n\nprejudiced by the error.\"    Calderon v. Coleman, 525 U.S. 141, 146\n\n(1998). The error identified by Judge Keeton does not pass through\n\nthis screen; our review of the instant record convinces us that it\n\nis highly improbable that the ex parte supplemental instruction had\n\nany effect on the verdict.\n\n          A jury instruction cannot be read in a vacuum, but,\n\nrather, must be taken in light of the charge as a whole. See Cupp\n\nv. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47 (1973); United States v. Cintolo,\n\n818 F.2d 980, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987).    In this instance, the jurors\n\npreviously had received explicit instruction that \"[i]t's possible\n\nthat you could find the government has proved its case as to all\n\nthree counts, failed to prove it as to all three counts, or proved\n\nit as to one or more counts and not on the others.\"   In framing the\n\nquestion to which Judge Freedman responded, the jurors asked, \"Does\n\nit have to be unanimous to be not guilty on a indictment . . . ?\"\n\nThis use of the article \"a\" indicates that they understood the\n\ncourt's earlier instruction.     Because the context in which the\n\njurors asked for supplemental instructions strongly suggests that\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fthey understood the independence of each count, we deem it highly\n\nprobable that the jury interpreted the trial judge's relatively\n\nsimple reply in the manner in which it was intended:                 as an\n\nadmonition that, to render a verdict on any count, the jury must be\n\nunanimous as to that count.     See Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370,\n\n381-82    (1990)   (employing   similar   analysis   on   direct   review);\n\nCurtis, 124 F.3d at 8 (using comparable inquiry to assess allegedly\n\nimproper jury instruction).\n\n            Nor does the timing of the verdict counsel persuasively\n\nin favor of a different conclusion.         In some cases, a time line\n\npermits a reasonable inference that the error \"had a causal effect\n\non a verdict returned within minutes of the court's action.\"\n\nCurtis, 124 F.3d at 7 n.2.       Here, however, we do not think that\n\nmuch weight can be placed on the fact that the jury returned its\n\nverdict some thirty-five minutes after Judge Freedman's response.\n\nWe must consider the timing in the gross and scope of the entire\n\nrecord.    See Derman, 298 F.3d at 46.      The record reveals that the\n\njury deliberated for only four hours in total.        In that relatively\n\nshort period, this was the deliberating jury's third note; in other\n\nwords, it asked for, and received, two other responses during that\n\ninterval.    When put in this context, a third question more than\n\nhalf an hour before reaching a verdict does not strike us as\n\nsignificant.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f            We are fortified in our conclusion that the error was\n\nbenign by the strength of the prosecution's case.             The government\n\nadduced more than adequate evidence to support the jury's verdict\n\non all three counts.      As we stated on direct review, the evidence\n\nof the petitioner's guilt \"was overwhelming.\"           Ellis, 935 F.2d at\n\n390.     Any suspicion that the supplemental instruction improperly\n\ndrove the verdict is therefore highly implausible.                See United\n\nStates v. Bullard, 37 F.3d 765, 768 (1st Cir. 1994); Rogers v.\n\nCarver, 833 F.2d 379, 385 n.1 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            To   sum   up,    the    petitioner's      argument    that    the\n\nsupplemental instruction tipped the scales is woven from gossamer\n\nstrands of speculation and surmise.         Notwithstanding the error, we\n\nremain confident of the integrity of the verdict — especially in\n\nview of the apparent clarity of the charge as a whole and the\n\nrobust evidence of the petitioner's guilt.            Consequently, we find\n\nno actual prejudice.      See Calderon, 525 U.S. at 146; Brecht, 507\n\nU.S. at 637.      It follows that Judge Keeton's first ground of\n\ndecision does not justify habeas relief.\n\n                 B.    The Confrontation Clause Claim.\n\n            While the resolution of the jury note claim was plainly\n\nwithin     the   transferee     judge's     adjudicatory      purview,     the\n\nConfrontation    Clause      claim   arguably   was    not.       We   briefly\n\nrecapitulate the relevant facts (which are uncontradicted).               After\n\nresolving the majority of the petitioner's section 2255 claims\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f(including the Confrontation Clause claim), Judge Freedman granted\n\nin part the petitioner's motion to recuse and transferred the case\n\nso that another judge could hear and determine the fifth claim for\n\nrelief (alleging judicial bias and misconduct).                  The successor\n\njudge resolved all the transferred claims against the petitioner\n\n(save only for the jury note claim, discussed supra).                         Yet,\n\nnotwithstanding      the   limited    scope    of    the   transfer    order,   he\n\nventured into other areas.             Once there, he reconsidered, and\n\noverruled,     his    predecessor's          prior    adjudication       of     the\n\nConfrontation Clause claim.          The government says that Judge Keeton\n\nexceeded his authority in revisiting that claim.                The petitioner\n\ndemurs.\n\n             This conundrum implicates the law of the case doctrine.\n\nThis doctrine has two branches.         One branch involves the so-called\n\nmandate rule (which, with only a few exceptions, forbids a lower\n\ncourt from relitigating issues that previously were decided — or\n\ncould have been decided — by a higher court at an earlier stage of\n\nthe same case).      See, e.g., United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247,\n\n250 (1st Cir. 1993); Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 150.                  The other\n\nbranch, applicable here, is somewhat more flexible.                   It provides\n\nthat \"unless corrected by an appellate tribunal, a legal decision\n\nmade at one stage of a civil or criminal case constitutes the law\n\nof the case throughout the pendency of the litigation.\"                  Flibotte\n\nv. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc., 131 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1997).                    This\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fmeans that a court ordinarily ought to respect and follow its own\n\nrulings, made earlier in the same case. See Arizona v. California,\n\n460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983) (explaining that \"when a court decides\n\nupon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the\n\nsame issues in subsequent stages in the same case\").                 This branch\n\nof the doctrine frowns upon, but does not altogether prohibit,\n\nreconsideration of orders within a single proceeding by a successor\n\njudge.    E.g., Flibotte, 131 F.3d at 25.         This appeal requires us to\n\ntrace the contours of the exceptions that apply to this second\n\nbranch of the law of the case doctrine.\n\n            The presumption, of course, is that a successor judge\n\nshould respect the law of the case.          The orderly functioning of the\n\njudicial process requires that judges of coordinate jurisdiction\n\nhonor one    another's     orders    and   revisit     them   only   in   special\n\ncircumstances.     See Stevenson v. Four Winds Travel, Inc., 462 F.2d\n\n899, 904-05 (5th Cir. 1972) (collecting cases); TCF Film Corp. v.\n\nGourley, 240 F.2d 711, 713-14 & n.2 (3d Cir. 1957) (collecting\n\ncases);    18B   Charles   A.   Wright     et   al.,   Federal   Practice    and\n\nProcedure § 4478, at 670 (2d ed. 2002).                  This limitation is\n\nanchored in a sea of salutary policies.                  See generally Joan\n\nSteinman, Law of the Case:       A Judicial Puzzle in Consolidated and\n\nTransferred Cases and in Multidistrict Litigation, 135 U. Pa. L.\n\nRev. 595, 602-05 (1987).            For one thing, the law of the case\n\ndoctrine affords litigants a high degree of certainty as to what\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fclaims are — and are not — still open for adjudication.                 See Best\n\nv. Shell Oil Co., 107 F.3d 544, 546 (7th Cir. 1997); see also\n\nChristianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816-17\n\n(1988). For another thing, it furthers the abiding interest shared\n\nby both litigants and the public in finality and repose.                      See\n\nWyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 446 (1992).              Third, it promotes\n\nefficiency; a party should be allowed his day in court, but going\n\nbeyond that point deprives others of their days in court, squanders\n\njudicial resources, and breeds undue delay.              See Christianson, 486\n\nU.S. at 819; Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 151.                      Fourth, the\n\ndoctrine   increases        confidence     in    the    adjudicatory    process:\n\nreconsideration      of   previously     litigated      issues,   absent   strong\n\njustification, spawns inconsistency and threatens the reputation of\n\nthe judicial system. See Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., Preclusion as to\n\nIssues of Law:      The Legal System's Interest, 70 Iowa L. Rev. 81, 88\n\n(1984) (collecting cases).              Finally, judges who too liberally\n\nsecond-guess     their      co-equals    effectively     usurp    the   appellate\n\nfunction and embolden litigants to engage in judge-shopping and\n\nsimilar forms of arbitrage.           See Erwin, 155 F.3d at 825; see also\n\nWhite v. Higgins, 116 F.2d 312, 317-18 (1st Cir. 1940); 18B Wright\n\net al., supra § 4478.1, at 695.\n\n           These concerns are heightened in the federal habeas\n\ncontext.       In     the     first     place,    the    presumption       against\n\nreconsideration is even stronger when the challenge arises on\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fcollateral    attack   of   a   criminal   conviction   (and,   therefore,\n\nimplicates society's reasonable reliance on the finality of a\n\ncriminal conviction).       See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697 (observing\n\nthat \"the presumption that a criminal judgment is final is at its\n\nstrongest in collateral attacks\").         In the second place, a section\n\n2255 petition ordinarily must be brought before the trial judge.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2255; see also Gregory v. United States, 585 F.2d\n\n548, 550 (1st Cir. 1978).        This is not an idle gesture, for that\n\njudge has a unique knowledge of what transpired at trial and of\n\nwhat effect errors may have had.           See McGill, 11 F.3d at 225;\n\nPanico v. United States, 412 F.2d 1151, 1155-56 (2d Cir. 1969); see\n\nalso Rule 4(a), Rules Governing Sec. 2255, advisory committee's\n\nnote.   For these reasons, a successor judge should be particularly\n\nhesitant to revisit portions of a section 2255 petition already\n\nadjudicated before the original trial judge. This is especially so\n\nin a case — like this one — in which the successor judge is\n\noperating under a limited transfer order.\n\n             Even so, there are times when the law of the case may\n\ngive way.    The question of what circumstances justify revisiting a\n\nruling previously made in the same proceeding by a judge of\n\ncoordinate jurisdiction is case-specific.         Christianson, 486 U.S.\n\nat 817; TCF Film Corp., 240 F.2d at 714.          The resolution of that\n\nquestion is guided, however, by certain general principles.             We\n\nenumerate those principles.\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f           First, reconsideration is proper if the initial ruling\n\nwas made on an inadequate record or was designed to be preliminary\n\nor tentative.      E.g., Peterson v. Lindner, 765 F.2d 698, 704 (7th\n\nCir. 1985); cf. Times Mirror Magazines, Inc. v. Las Vegas Sports\n\nNews, L.L.C.,      212    F.3d    157,      160   (3d    Cir.   2000)   (emphasizing\n\ndistrict court’s authority to reconsider matters previously decided\n\non   preliminary    injunction).             Second,      reconsideration      may   be\n\nwarranted if there has been a material change in controlling law.\n\nE.g., Tracey v. United States, 739 F.2d 679, 682 (1st Cir. 1984);\n\nCrane Co. v. Am. Standard, Inc., 603 F.2d 244, 248 (2d Cir. 1979).\n\nThird,   reconsideration         may   be    undertaken      if   newly    discovered\n\nevidence bears on the question.              E.g., Fisher v. Trainor, 242 F.3d\n\n24, 29 n.5 (1st Cir. 2001); Pit River Home & Agric. Coop. Ass'n v.\n\nUnited States, 30 F.3d 1088, 1096 (9th Cir. 1994).                             Lastly,\n\nreconsideration may be appropriate to avoid manifest injustice.\n\nChristianson, 486 U.S. at 817.               In that regard, however, neither\n\ndoubt about the correctness of a predecessor judge's rulings nor a\n\nbelief that the litigant may be able to make a more convincing\n\nargument   the     second     time       around     will     suffice      to   justify\n\nreconsideration.         See Fogel v. Chestnutt, 668 F.2d 100, 109 (2d\n\nCir. 1981); White, 116 F.2d at 317-18.                  For this purpose, there is\n\na meaningful difference between an arguably erroneous ruling (which\n\ndoes not justify revisitation by a co-equal successor judge) and an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\funreasonable ruling that paves the way for a manifestly unjust\n\nresult.\n\n            We employ this framework in assessing Judge Keeton's\n\ndecision     to    revisit      Judge    Freedman's      adjudication       of     the\n\npetitioner's Confrontation Clause claim. In so doing, we recognize\n\nthe desirability of according the successor judge a modicum of\n\nflexibility.        Thus, we review a successor judge's decision to\n\nreconsider    a    coordinate     judge's      earlier   ruling     for    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.       Delta Sav. Bank v. United States, 265 F.3d 1017, 1027\n\n(9th Cir. 2001); Loumar, Inc. v. Smith, 698 F.2d 759, 763 (5th Cir.\n\n1983).\n\n            Judge Keeton did not say why he opted to reopen the\n\nConfrontation Clause issue.             It is apparent, however, that the\n\nfirst three conditions that might justify reconsideration are\n\nplainly absent here.          Judge Freedman made his Confrontation Clause\n\nruling based on full briefing, oral argument, and an examination of\n\nthe record as a whole (the same record that was before Judge\n\nKeeton). In addition, he had the advantage of having presided over\n\nthe trial and having witnessed the child's testimony at first hand.\n\nHis rescript, filed on March 2, 1998, gives no indication that his\n\nConfrontation       Clause     ruling    was    meant    to    be   tentative       or\n\npreliminary.       To the contrary, he instructed Judge Keeton to enter\n\nit   as    part    of   the    final    judgment    upon      completion    of     the\n\nproceedings, thereby signaling that he intended his ruling to be\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\fdefinitive.        Finally, the petitioner neither presented new facts\n\nbefore Judge Keeton nor identified any intervening change in the\n\nlaw.\n\n            In short, the record fails to suggest any reason why\n\nJudge Keeton should have revisited Judge Freedman's Confrontation\n\nClause ruling unless he discerned a manifest injustice.               That\n\nstandard is difficult to achieve:        a finding of manifest injustice\n\nrequires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a\n\nmaterial matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong.5           See Arizona,\n\n460 U.S. at 618 n.8; see also Dobbs v. Zant, 506 U.S. 357, 358-59\n\n(1993) (indicating that the previous ruling must be called into\n\n\"serious question\"); Reed v. Rhodes, 179 F.3d 453, 473 (6th Cir.\n\n1999) (finding that reconsideration did not constitute abuse of\n\ndiscretion when original judge's ruling was ill-explained and based\n\non     obviously    unsound   legal    analysis).   A   mere    \"doctrinal\n\ndisposition\" to decide the issue differently will not suffice.\n\nAgostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 236 (1997).\n\n            We have examined the record with great care.            Fairly\n\nviewed, the special seating arrangement devised by Judge Freedman\n\nfor the victim's testimony was not obviously outside the compass of\n\n\n       5\n      A finding of manifest injustice also requires a finding of\nprejudice. Dobbs v. Zant, 506 U.S. 357, 359 (1993); United States\nv. Crooker, 729 F.2d 889, 890 (1st Cir. 1984). Because we conclude\nthat Judge Freedman's refusal to grant habeas relief premised on\nthe use of the special seating arrangement was neither unreasonable\nnor obviously wrong, see text infra, we do not reach the question\nof what (if any) prejudice inured.\n\n                                      -26-\n\fSupreme Court precedent.   Because the record does not support a\n\nfinding of manifest injustice, Judge Keeton was bound to defer to\n\nJudge Freedman's ruling on that issue.       His failure to do so\n\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.\n\n          To begin, it is important to set the stage (and, thus,\n\nestablish the appropriate frame of reference).       The petitioner\n\nconcedes that he failed to advance, on direct appeal, his claim\n\nthat the special seating arrangement violated the Confrontation\n\nClause.   Accordingly, the claim is procedurally defaulted.      In\n\norder to have succeeded on a collateral attack, therefore, he had\n\nto have shown both cause and prejudice.   See McCleskey v. Zant, 499\n\nU.S. 467, 493 (1991); Derman, 298 F.3d at 45.     Assuming, without\n\ndeciding, that the petitioner had demonstrated cause sufficient to\n\nexcuse his procedural default — a debatable proposition on this\n\nrecord — he still had to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for his counsel's failure to raise the Confrontation Clause\n\nissue on direct appeal, the outcome of that appeal would have been\n\ndifferent.   See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 289 (1999).\n\nPhrased another way, he had to show that his attorney's alleged\n\nblunder worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, thereby\n\nundermining confidence in the fairness of the proceedings that\n\n\n\n\n                               -27-\n\fculminated in his conviction.6        Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434\n\n(1995); Frady, 456 U.S. at 170.\n\n              Next, we knit the cause and prejudice standard and the\n\nmanifest injustice standard together.              Judge Freedman found no\n\nerror in the use of the special seating arrangement (and, thus, no\n\nprejudice).       In order to revisit and reverse that ruling, Judge\n\nKeeton      had   to   determine    that   Judge   Freedman's       finding     was\n\nmanifestly unjust (that is, that the finding was unreasonable or\n\nobviously wrong).        It is that determination, necessarily implicit\n\nin Judge Keeton's actions, that we must review.\n\n               Our inquiry is channeled by a pair of Supreme Court\n\nopinions.      Two years before the petitioner's conviction, the Court\n\nheld       unconstitutional,   as    violative     of   a    defendant's      Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confrontation, an Iowa statute that allowed the\n\nplacement of an opaque screen between a defendant charged with\n\nsexual assault and his minor victims (there, two thirteen-year-old\n\ngirls).      Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012, 1020-21 (1988).            Although the\n\nCourt described        face-to-face   confrontation         as   instrumental   in\n\ntesting the veracity of a witness and integral to a fair trial, id.\n\n\n       6\n      Because the quantum and kind of prejudice that must be shown\nin connection with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is\nidentical to that necessary to relieve a habeas petitioner from the\neffects of a procedural default, see Prou v. United States, 199\nF.3d 37, 49 (1st Cir. 1999), we have no need to undertake a\nseparate analysis of the petitioner's ineffective assistance of\nappellate counsel claim. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694 (holding\nthat prejudice is an essential element of an ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim); Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 14-15 (same).\n\n                                      -28-\n\fat 1016-20, it specifically reserved the question of whether\n\nexceptions to the right of face-to-face confrontation might be\n\nrecognized when \"necessary to further an important public policy,\"\n\nid. at 1021.    To the extent that such exceptions might exist, the\n\nCourt cautioned, they could not rest on generalized theses (such as\n\nthose contained in the Iowa statute); rather, exceptions would\n\nrequire \"individualized findings\" as to particular witnesses and\n\ncircumstances.    Id.\n\n          Six weeks after the jury convicted the petitioner, the\n\nSupreme Court decided Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990).             The\n\nCraig Court upheld a Maryland statute that allowed child abuse\n\nvictims to testify via one-way closed circuit television upon the\n\ntrial court's determination that face-to-face confrontation with\n\nthe alleged abuser was likely to cause serious emotional distress.\n\nId. at 855. Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, emphasized\n\nthat the right to face-to-face confrontation is not an absolute\n\nrequirement of the Confrontation Clause.             Id. at 847-50.        An\n\nalternative arrangement is permissible as long as the arrangement\n\nis in furtherance of an important public policy — such as the\n\nprotection of minors who have been victimized by sexual predators\n\n— and the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.              Id.\n\nat 854-55.     Even so, the trial court must make individualized,\n\ncase-specific    findings,   and,    in    doing   so,   must   address   the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fparticular child's susceptibility to the particular defendant. Id.\n\nat 855-60.\n\n          In addressing the section 2255 petition, Judge Freedman\n\nreviewed these precedents.     He concluded that the special seating\n\narrangement used in the petitioner's trial passed constitutional\n\nmuster.   Based on his supportable findings anent the need for\n\nspecial treatment of the child witness, this conclusion is neither\n\nunreasonable nor obviously wrong.\n\n             In his post-conviction rescript, Judge Freedman carefully\n\ndocumented the considerations that had prompted him to resort to a\n\nmodified seating arrangement.7     He found that, given the nature of\n\nE.D.'s testimony, the child — who was nine years old at the time of\n\ntrial — likely would have difficulty testifying in a public forum,\n\nand that she might reasonably fear testifying in front of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n             The petitioner asserts that Judge Freedman's findings are\n\ninadequate to meet the Craig criteria.        While this is a close\n\nquestion, we think that the findings suffice to withstand a claim\n\n\n     7\n      Although Judge Freedman and the parties discussed E.D.'s\nseating arrangement at a conference in advance of the criminal\ntrial, the judge neither conducted a hearing on the matter nor made\ncontemporaneous findings as to the effect of the petitioner's\npresence on E.D. Since the petitioner did not request a hearing\nand did not object to the lack of contemporaneous findings, we\naccept Judge Freedman's later statement of his reasons in lieu of\ncontemporaneous findings. Cf. California v. Sharp, 36 Cal. Rptr.\n2d 117, 124 & n.4 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994) (extrapolating findings from\nthe record where defendant failed to ask the trial court for\nfindings).\n\n                                  -30-\n\fof manifest injustice.          In the first place, the less the intrusion\n\non Sixth Amendment rights, the less detail is required in a trial\n\ncourt's findings.        See California v. Lord, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 453,\n\n455 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994); Brandon v. Alaska, 839 P.2d 400, 409-10\n\n(Alaska Ct. App. 1992).          In all events, Judge Freedman's rescript\n\nmentions specifically that the petitioner had threatened E.D. with\n\nharm if she told what he had done.                This finding, in conjunction\n\nwith other facts of record (such as the fact that the petitioner\n\narguably     had   made    menacing         gestures      during     the   pretrial\n\nproceedings, that he had struck E.D. before, and that he repeatedly\n\nhad violated a \"no contact\" order after his arrest), leads us to\n\nconclude   that    the    use    of   a    special    seating      arrangement   was\n\njustified.    See Vigil v. Tansy, 917 F.2d 1277, 1279-80 (10th Cir.\n\n1990)    (allowing   pre-Craig        trial       court   to    justify    moderate\n\nrestriction on right to confront child witness on less rigorous\n\nindividualized findings).8\n\n           In our view, the adequacy of Judge Freedman's findings is\n\nbuttressed    by   the    hallmarks       of     testimonial    reliability      made\n\n\n\n     8\n      To be sure, Judge Freedman's findings fell short of an\nexpress determination that E.D. ran a serious risk of trauma from\ntestifying in front of the defendant — a type of determination\nsuggested by Craig, 497 U.S. at 856. Given that the petitioner's\nconviction pre-dated Craig, however, we think that the findings\nwere adequate to justify the modest measures instituted in this\ncase.   See Hardy v. Wigginton, 922 F.2d 294, 299-300 (6th Cir.\n1990) (explaining that, in the interim between Coy and Craig, trial\ncourts could not be expected to make Craig-type findings that were\ncomplete in every detail); Vigil, 917 F.2d at 1279-80 (similar).\n\n                                          -31-\n\fmanifest by the record.        See Craig, 497 U.S. at 851 (listing\n\ncompetence, administration of an oath, full opportunity for cross-\n\nexamination, and full visibility of the child witness's body\n\nlanguage and demeanor before judge, jury, and defendant as \"other\n\nelements of the confrontation right\").       These include the absence\n\nof any opaque physical barrier and the fact that the witness was\n\nrequired to give live testimony, under oath, in the presence of\n\nboth the defendant and the jury.         See id.    To the extent that\n\nnervousness, body language, demeanor, and the like are important\n\nindicia of credibility, the jurors' entirely unimpaired view of the\n\nwitness is persuasive. See Morales v. Artuz, 281 F.3d 55, 62 (2d\n\nCir. 2002); Stanger v. Indiana, 545 N.E.2d 1105, 1113 (Ind. Ct.\n\nApp. 1989).   In addition, the petitioner had ample opportunity to\n\ncross-examine E.D. and to offer any evidence and arguments that\n\nmight impugn her credibility.         These are weighty factors.      See\n\nLouisiana v. Brockel, 733 So. 2d 640, 646 (La. Ct. App. 1999);\n\nBoatright v. Georgia, 385 S.E.2d 298, 302-03 (Ga. Ct. App. 1989).\n\n           Despite these circumstances, the petitioner argues that\n\nCoy demands a different result.        We do not agree.      The seating\n\narrangement there was statutorily driven, not custom-tailored to\n\nfit the exigencies of a particular case.      Moreover, it involved an\n\nopaque   physical   barrier.     In   contrast,    no   physical   barrier\n\nseparated E.D. from the petitioner during the instant trial.         Many\n\ncourts have found the absence of such a barrier to be of decretory\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fsignificance in rejecting Confrontation Clause challenges.                    See,\n\ne.g., N. Dakota v. Miller, 631 N.W.2d 587, 594 (N.D. 2001); Smith\n\nv. Arkansas, 8 S.W.3d 534, 537 (Ark. 2000); Utah v. Hoyt, 806 P.2d\n\n204, 209 (Utah Ct. App. 1991); Ortiz v. Georgia, 374 S.E.2d 92, 95-\n\n96 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988); see also Morales, 281 F.3d at 58-59\n\n(pointing out that neither Craig nor Coy expatiate on unobstructed,\n\nin-court testimony); Cumbie v. Singletary, 991 F.2d 715, 721 (11th\n\nCir.    1993)   (suggesting    that   Coy    is    inapplicable       when   child\n\ntestifies    in    presence   of   defendant);      see    generally    Bruce      E.\n\nBohlman, The High Cost of Constitutional Rights in Child Abuse\n\nCases — Is the Price Worth Paying?, 66 N.D. L. Rev. 579, 589 (1990)\n\n(stating    that    seating   arrangements        not     involving    artificial\n\nbarriers \"are apparently permissible under Coy\").                     Given these\n\nmarked differences, Coy is readily distinguishable.\n\n            Nor are these the only bases for distinction.               Unlike in\n\nCoy, the record here contains no evidence suggesting that what the\n\npetitioner actually saw of E.D.'s face at trial was substantially\n\nless than what he would have seen had she testified from the\n\nwitness stand (and, indeed, Judge Freedman's description of the\n\ncourtroom layout makes clear that E.D. would not have had to face\n\nthe petitioner directly even if she had testified from the witness\n\nstand).     The significance of this circumstance is reinforced by\n\nJudge   Freedman's     specific    finding   that       the   petitioner     had    a\n\nsufficient view of E.D.'s \"demeanor.\"             This finding is not clearly\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\ferroneous, and, thus, deserves our respect.    See Familia-Consoro,\n\n160 F.3d at 764-65; McGill, 11 F.3d at 225.   Both of these factors\n\ntend to support the constitutionality of the special seating\n\narrangement.   See Smith, 8 S.W.3d at 537-38 (collecting cases);\n\nBrockel, 733 So. 2d at 646.\n\n           In a further effort to denigrate the use of the special\n\nseating arrangement, the petitioner notes the lack of eye contact\n\nbetween him and E.D.      We agree that the opportunity for eye\n\ncontact, whether or not the witness chooses to act on it, is an\n\nimportant integer in the Sixth Amendment calculus.    Coy, 487 U.S.\n\nat 1019.   But a defendant does not have a constitutional right to\n\nforce eye contact with his accuser, id., and we refuse to fashion\n\na bright-line rule that the lack of such an opportunity, in and of\n\nitself, automatically translates into a constitutional violation.\n\nMost other courts that have considered the question have reached a\n\nsimilar conclusion.9    E.g., Hoyt, 806 P.2d at 210; Ortiz, 374\n\nS.E.2d at 95-96.   Moreover, some courts have found that the lack of\n\nan easy opportunity for eye contact is palliated to a sufficient\n\n\n\n     9\n      We are aware that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\nhas found the lack of eye contact fatal under an analogous — but\ndifferently worded — provision of the Massachusetts Declaration of\nRights. See Massachusetts v. Amirault, 677 N.E.2d 652, 662 (Mass.\n1997) (terming it \"a non sequitur to argue from the proposition\nthat, because the witness cannot be forced to look at the accused\nduring his face-to-face testimony, that therefore this aspect of\nthe art. 12 confrontation right is dispensable\"). We decline to\nimport so rigid a requirement into the jurisprudence of the Sixth\nAmendment.\n\n                                -34-\n\fdegree by a seating arrangement such as the one employed in this\n\ncase (which preserves the line of sight and allows a witness to\n\nturn to make eye contact with the defendant).                     See California v.\n\nSharp, 36 Cal. Rptr. 2d 117, 125 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994); Boatright,\n\n385 S.E.2d at 301.\n\n            We summarize succinctly.                 Although the lack of eye\n\ncontact     weighs      in    the    petitioner's        favor,     all    the    other\n\nConfrontation Clause safeguards were present here.                   Mindful, as we\n\nare, that trial judges have some leeway to move a witness around a\n\ncourtroom as long as those shifts retain an unobstructed line of\n\nsight between the defendant and the witness, cf. Coy, 487 U.S. at\n\n1023   (O'Connor,       J.,    concurring)       (suggesting      that    \"many    such\n\nprocedures may raise no substantial Confrontation Clause problem\n\nsince they involve testimony in the presence of the defendant\"), we\n\ncannot    say    that   Judge       Freedman's    core    conclusion       —   that   no\n\nConfrontation Clause violation occurred — was either unreasonable\n\nor obviously wrong.\n\n            In a further attempt to justify reconsideration, the\n\npetitioner submits that Judge Freedman erroneously denied him the\n\nassistance of counsel for his section 2255 petition. He argues, in\n\neffect, that his \"inartful\" pro se presentation before Judge\n\nFreedman may have influenced the court's rulings, freeing the\n\nsuccessor       judge   to    review    them    de   novo.        That    argument    is\n\nunavailing.       A convicted criminal has no constitutional right to\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fcounsel with respect to habeas proceedings.                   Pennsylvania v.\n\nFinley, 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987).              It is true that the petitioner\n\ncould not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim until\n\ncollateral review, see Knight, 37 F.3d at 774; United States v.\n\nMala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993), but this                     makes no\n\ndifference.      We   fail   to   see    how    an   adscititious   ineffective\n\nassistance claim entitles a criminal defendant to the assistance of\n\ncounsel on subsequent collateral review. See Moran v. McDaniel, 80\n\nF.3d 1261, 1271 (9th Cir. 1996); see also Lattimore v. Dubois, 311\n\nF.3d 46, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2002).           Although we have indicated that,\n\nin certain circumstances, the appointment of counsel for a section\n\n2255 petitioner might be warranted, such cases are few and far\n\nbetween.     See Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063-64.            The circumstances of the\n\npetitioner's case are not such as to demand the appointment of\n\ncounsel.10    It follows that Judge Keeton could not reconsider a\n\nprior ruling merely because the presence of counsel might have\n\nproduced new or better arguments.          United States v. Velez Carrero,\n\n140 F.3d 327, 329-30 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n     10\n      The fact that Judge Keeton appointed counsel to handle the\nremainder of the petitioner's claims is not dispositive. While\nsuch an appointment was within Judge Keeton's discretion, it does\nnot follow that Judge Freedman's contrary decision constituted an\nabuse of discretion. This variation merely serves to illustrate\nwhat every lawyer already knows:      that two judges can decide\ndiscretionary matters differently without either judge abusing his\nor her discretion. See, e.g., United States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d\n112, 125-26 (1st Cir. 1992); Williams v. Giant Eagle Mkts., Inc.,\n883 F.2d 1184, 1190 (3d Cir. 1989); United States v. Stubblefield,\n408 F.2d 309, 311 (6th Cir. 1969).\n\n                                        -36-\n\f              We need go no further. Finding no manifest injustice, we\n\nare constrained to hold that Judge Keeton abused his discretion in\n\nredeciding       and    countermanding      Judge    Freedman's      previous\n\nadjudication of the Confrontation Clause claim.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n              Although it is true that the law must always be vigilant\n\nto protect the rights of those who are convicted of serious crimes,\n\nour system of justice guarantees a fair trial, not a perfect one.\n\nSee United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508 (1983); United\n\nStates v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414, 418 (1st Cir. 1988).               Nowhere is\n\nthis principle more venerated than on collateral review.                  See,\n\ne.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 374-75 (2000) (holding that\n\nhabeas relief under the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2), is reserved\n\nfor unreasonable applications of Supreme Court precedent, not\n\nmerely to      remedy   incorrect   state   court   decisions).      In   this\n\ninstance, the petitioner's trial may not have been perfect, but it\n\nwas    most   assuredly   fair.     Accordingly,    we   reverse   the    order\n\ngranting a new trial and remand the matter to the district court\n\nwith directions to enter judgment for the United States and,\n\nconcomitantly, to reinstate the petitioner's convictions.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\f",

Goodman, Appellate Section, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John G.S. Flym, by appointment of the court, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These appeals, which have their genesis in an effort by the petitioner, Edward B. Ellis, to mount a collateral attack on his convictions for interstate transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, present challenging legal questions complicated by a strange procedural twist. That complication arose after the original trial judge denied Ellis's section 2255 petition in part and then recused himself as to the unadjudicated portion of the petition. A limited order of reassignment followed. The transferee judge, acting partly on the basis of a previously unadjudicated claim and partly on the basis of a previously adjudicated claim, proceeded to grant the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hybrid nature of this decision requires that we review its component parts separately. The first ground of decision involves the trial judge's handling of a jury note. We agree with the transferee judge's finding of error &#8212; the original trial judge used an incorrect procedure in dealing with the jury note &#8212; but we hold that this error was harmless under the circumstances. The second ground of decision involves whether the special seating arrangement afforded to the victim during her trial testimony offended the Confrontation Clause. We hold that under the law of the case doctrine the transferee judge should not have revisited the issue, but, rather, should have left intact the original judge's finding that no constitutional violation had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these holdings, we discern no principled basis for habeas relief. Consequently, we reverse the order granting the petitioner a new trial and remand the case with directions to enter judgment for the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, a jury convicted the petitioner on three counts of interstate transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423. The district court imposed a twenty-five year incarcerative term. On direct appeal, we affirmed the convictions and sentence. <i>United States v. Ellis,</i> 935 F.2d 385 (1st Cir.1991). We suggest that those who hunger for a more exegetic account of the crimes of conviction consult that opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, it suffices to say that the petitioner was found guilty of repeatedly abusing (in three different states) the youthful daughter of his live-in girlfriend. <i>Id.</i> at 388-89. The evidence adduced against him included the testimony of his victim, E.D. (who was nine years old at the time of trial). In a preliminary discussion, it was suggested, without objection from the petitioner's counsel (Attorney Goldings), that E.D. testify while seated \"in such a way that she does not look at [the petitioner].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding his initial acquiescence, Goldings objected to the special seating arrangement when E.D. was called as a witness. Judge Freedman overruled the objection. During her testimony, E.D. sat in a chair facing the jurors but facing away from the petitioner. The parties disagree both as to the exact angle between E.D. and the petitioner and as to how much of E.D.'s face the petitioner could see during her testimony. It is clear, however, that E.D., while testifying, could only have made eye contact with the petitioner by looking over her right shoulder. It is equally clear that she did not avail herself of this opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, the petitioner unsuccessfully challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, various evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, and the length of the sentence. <i>Id.</i> at 389-97. He did not advance any claim related either to the handling of the jury note (discussed <i>infra</i>) or to the special seating arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the petitioner moved pro se to vacate his sentence. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. In that petition, he maintained that Goldings had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel (including a failure to present certain exculpatory evidence and impedance of his right to testify); charged Goldings with having concealed a conflict of interest; lodged a Confrontation Clause challenge to the special seating arrangement; complained of prosecutorial misbehavior; and accused Judge Freedman of judicial bias and misconduct. He also filed two motions: one seeking the appointment of counsel and the other asking Judge Freedman to step aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Freedman denied the motion for appointment of counsel out of hand. As for the recusal motion, he did not disqualify himself generally, but, rather, proceeded to resolve four of the petitioner's five claims. Specifically, he denied the cognate ineffective assistance of counsel claims insofar as those claims touched upon the failure to present evidence and the supposed interference with the petitioner's right to testify; found no cognizable conflict of interest; and ruled that the assertions of prosecutorial misconduct were overblown. Given the present posture of the case, we need not discuss any of these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Freedman's disposition of the Confrontation Clause claim requires some elaboration. For purposes of that analysis, Judge Freedman accepted, without deciding, that Goldings's failure to pursue the claim on direct appeal established ineffective assistance of counsel (and, therefore, established \"cause\" necessary to overcome the applicable procedural bar). Judge Freedman then discussed the relevant Supreme Court precedents and explained that, as the trial judge, he had made an individualized determination that a special accommodation was needed because E.D. would have to testify regarding the \"heinous acts\" of sexual abuse that she had endured at the hands of someone who lived with her and who had threatened to kill her and her family members. Since these facts supported the use of the special seating arrangement, Judge Freedman concluded that an appeal from the court's decision to employ the special seating arrangement would have been futile, and, therefore, that Goldings's failure to challenge the arrangement on appeal was harmless. Accordingly, he denied both the Confrontation Clause claim and the related ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <i>See Lockhart v. Fretwell,</i> 506 U.S. 364, 369-70, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993) (outlining applicable prejudice requirement); <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having adjudicated these four sets of claims, Judge Freedman stopped short of resolving the whole of the petition. Instead, he recused himself as to the fifth claim (the accusation of judicial bias and misconduct). <i>See Murchu v. United States,</i> 926 F.2d 50, 53 n. 3 (1st Cir.1991) (suggesting \"that the district judge should have recused himself as to those portions of [a] section 2255 motion which alleged judicial misconduct\"). Instead, he asked the chief judge to reassign the case to a new judge to \"consider and render a decision on the balance of the petitioner's claims and enter judgment accordingly on those claims as well as those addressed by this court in its Memorandum and Order entered on March 2, 1998.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chief judge subsequently assigned the case to Judge Keeton. Judge Keeton appointed counsel to represent the petitioner and gave both parties leave to file supplementary memoranda on the allegations of judicial bias and misconduct concerning (1) the court's decision to allow a special seating arrangement; (2) certain comments and gestures supposedly made by Judge Freedman during E.D.'s testimony; and (3) Judge Freedman's handling of a note from the deliberating jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, Judge Keeton unequivocally rejected the petitioner's claims of judicial bias (finding, inter alia, that bias played no role in the establishment of the special seating arrangement, and that Judge Freedman had made no untoward comments or gestures during the trial). He concluded, however, that Judge Freedman's exchange of notes with the jury deprived the petitioner of the assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the case (and, thus, violated the Sixth Amendment).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Judge Keeton then opted to revisit the petitioner's already adjudicated Confrontation Clause claim. Deeming his predecessor's findings inadequate and the petitioner's view of E.D. during trial too constrained, Judge Keeton reversed the earlier ruling and declared unconstitutional the use of the special seating arrangement. Based on this pair of conclusions, Judge Keeton granted the section 2255 petition, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government thereupon filed these appeals. We treat them as one: they have been consolidated, and it would serve no useful purpose to dwell upon the technical considerations that prompted the government to file two appeals instead of one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, a convict in federal custody may ask the sentencing court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence on the ground that the court had imposed the sentence in violation of federal law (including, of course, the Constitution). <i>Brackett v. United States,</i> 270 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir.2001). In essence, then, section 2255 is a surrogate for the historic writ of habeas corpus. <i>See Davis v. United States,</i> 417 U.S. 333, 344, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an appeal is taken from an order under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, we examine the district court's legal conclusions de novo and scrutinize its findings of fact for clear error. <i>Familia-Consoro v. United States,</i> 160 F.3d 761, 764-65 (1st Cir.1998). When the district court dismisses claims without holding an evidentiary hearing, we take as true the sworn allegations of fact set forth in the petition unless those allegations are merely conclusory, contradicted by the record, or inherently incredible. <i>Mack v. United States,</i> 635 F.2d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir.1980); <i>see also United States v. McGill,</i> 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only the jury note and seating arrangement claims are in issue here. The petitioner has neither prosecuted a cross-appeal nor otherwise challenged Judge Freedman's disposition of his other section 2255 claims. This narrowed scope of review, together with the absence of a cross-appeal, dictates that we focus on the rulings of the successor judge. We proceed in two steps. First, we discuss Judge Keeton's assessment of the jury note claim. We then consider his assessment of the Confrontation Clause claim (concentrating, for reasons that will soon become apparent, on his authority to revisit Judge Freedman's earlier adjudication of that claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We preface our analysis with an acknowledgment that one court has flatly rejected the concept of partial recusal. <i>See United States v. Feldman,</i> 983 F.2d 144, 145 (9th Cir.1992) (\"[W]hen a judge determines that recusal is appropriate it is not within his discretion to recuse by subject matter or only as to certain issues and not others.\"). The majority view, however, supports the availability of such a case-management device. <i>See, e.g., Pashaian v. Eccelston Prop., Ltd.,</i> 88 F.3d 77, 84-85 (2d Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Kimberlin,</i> 781 F.2d 1247, 1258-59 (7th Cir.1985). While we have not spoken directly to the subject, we indicated our approval of the praxis in <i>Murchu,</i> 926 F.2d at 53 n. 3, 56-57. <i>See also Warner v. Rossignol,</i> 538 F.2d 910, 914 n. 6 (1st Cir.1976) (finding no loss of capacity to rule on retained issues even after recusal from other issues). Today, we make that approval explicit: we hold that a judge may, in an appropriate case, decide certain issues and recuse himself or herself as to others. This was an appropriate case, and we therefore hold that Judge Freedman's partial recusal was a valid exercise of judicial authority. Under the circumstances, it constituted a sound method of dealing with the prickly problem of balancing the demands of section 2255 &#8212; a statute that evinces a strong preference for post-conviction review by the judge who presided at the defendant's trial&#8212;with the demands of the recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a). We add, moreover, that the chief judge responded appropriately to this partial recusal by entering a limited order of reassignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although limited orders of reassignment may &#8212; as in this case &#8212; be necessary and proper, they place unaccustomed restraints on the transferee judge. When a court assumes jurisdiction for a limited purpose, it ordinarily should confine itself to that purpose. <i>Cf. United States v. Erwin,</i> 155 F.3d 818, 825 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that a magistrate judge may not overstep the bounds of an order of reference); <i>King v. Ionization Int'l, Inc.,</i> 825 F.2d 1180, 1185-86 (7th Cir.1987) (same). Observing the restrictions implied in such an order promotes the efficient operation of the courts and facilitates the winnowing of issues throughout successive stages of litigation. <i>See Erwin,</i> 155 F.3d at 825. By the same token, courts that carefully observe the boundaries of their assignments help stabilize the decisionmaking process, assure the predictability of results, and nourish proper working relationships between judicial units. <i>United States v. Rivera-Martinez,</i> 931 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir. 1991). This case illustrates the wisdom of adherence to these prudential policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Jury Note.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Keeton's first ground of decision arises out of the petitioner's allegation that, three and one-half hours after jury deliberations had begun, the jurors sent Judge Freedman a note asking: \"Does it have to be unanimous to be not guilty on a[sic] indictment if the vote come [sic] out uneven?\" Without consulting either side, the judge sent back a written response stating: \"The verdict on all counts must be unanimous. All 12 jur[ors] must agree.\" Approximately thirty minutes later, the jury found the petitioner guilty on all charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Judge Keeton discerned no evidence of judicial bias or partiality in Judge Freedman's conduct, he concluded that his predecessor had erred in handling the jury note and that the ex parte exchange between judge and jury had deprived the petitioner of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel at a critical stage in the proceedings. He found this error prejudicial, stating: \"Given the timing and substance of the ex parte communication, I conclude that it is likely that the trial judge's response had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\" In this regard, he theorized that the jury could have misunderstood the comment that \"[t]he verdict on <i>all counts</i> must be unanimous\" to preclude a partial verdict, an ambiguity that consultation with counsel could have prevented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Judge Keeton that Judge Freedman erred by failing to consult the parties before responding substantively to the deliberating jury's request for a supplementary instruction. <i>See Rogers v. United States,</i> 422 U.S. 35, 38-39, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975); <i>United States v. Parent,</i> 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1992). The incidence of error, however, does not end our inquiry. Because the petitioner did not raise any challenge to this supplemental instruction in his direct appeal, the claim is procedurally defaulted. It is, therefore, unreviewable on collateral attack unless the petitioner can show (1) cause sufficient to excuse his failure to raise it on direct appeal, and (2) actual prejudice. <i>See Bousley v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998); <i>Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Keeton found cause sufficient to excuse the procedural default. We assume, for argument's sake, the supportability of that finding. After all, the notes were not indexed on the district court's docket sheet, and the petitioner says that he did not learn of them until 1995 (when a friend discovered them in the case file). Thus, this ground of appeal arguably was unavailable to the petitioner at the time of his direct appeal. <i>Cf. Satterwhite v. Texas,</i> 486 U.S. 249, 255, 108 S.Ct. 1792, 100 L.Ed.2d 284 (1988) (finding that mere placement of ex parte orders in court file does not yield constructive notice satisfying the Sixth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question reduces, therefore, to whether any cognizable prejudice resulted from the error. Quoting <i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> 507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), Judge Keeton described the test as whether the error exerted a \"substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\" The petitioner resists this description; citing <i>United States v. Cronic,</i> 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), he argues that such errors can never be harmless because they necessarily involve the denial of counsel at a critical stage of a criminal trial. This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court recently has emphasized how seldom circumstances arise that justify a court in presuming prejudice (and, concomitantly, in forgoing particularized inquiry into whether a denial of counsel undermined the reliability of a judgment). <i>See Mickens v. Taylor,</i> 535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1241, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002); <i>Bell v. Cone,</i> 535 U.S. 685, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850-51, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). We, too, have stressed this point. <i>See, e.g., Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 12, 15 (1st Cir.1994). The only Sixth Amendment violations that fit within this narrowly circumscribed class are those that are pervasive in nature, permeating the entire proceeding. <i>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega,</i> 528 U.S. 470, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (collecting cases). In other words, the doctrine of per se prejudice applies to \"a wholesale denial of counsel,\" whereas conventional harmless error analysis applies to a \"short-term, localized denial of counsel.\" <i>Curtis v. Duval,</i> 124 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the petitioner does not posit that he lacked the effective assistance of counsel throughout the proceedings but only at a specific point in the trial (when the jury sent the note in question and the judge responded). This is a difference \"not of degree but of kind\" in terms of whether the court's error can be deemed per se prejudicial. <i>Cone,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 1851. We conclude, therefore, that prejudice cannot be presumed on the basis of the momentary lapse that occurred in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Cf. Rushen v. Spain,</i> 464 U.S. 114, 117-19 &amp; n. 2, 104 S.Ct. 453, 78 L.Ed.2d 267 (1983) (per curiam) (holding that an ex parte discussion between judge and juror can be harmless error); <i>Coleman v. Alabama,</i> 399 U.S. 1, 10-11, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) (remanding for harmlessness determination when court had improperly denied defendant counsel at preliminary hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clarifying that there is no presumption of prejudice does not doom the petitioner's quest. It simply means that the trial court's mishandling of the jury note does not lead automatically to the vacation of his convictions. We still must decide whether the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have left open the proper standard for gauging harmlessness when such a claim of error is raised on direct appeal, <i>see, e.g., Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 25 n. 5, the instant claim not only arises on collateral attack but also is procedurally defaulted. In such circumstances, it is settled in this circuit that a reviewing court must apply the \"actual prejudice\" standard delineated in <i>Brecht,</i> 507 U.S. at 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710. <i>See Sustache-Rivera v. United States,</i> 221 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Curtis,</i> 124 F.3d at 6-7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This standard requires us to ask whether the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the outcome of the proceedings. <i>Brecht,</i> 507 U.S. at 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710. In answering that query, the burden of proof as to harmlessness falls on the government. <i>O'Neal v. McAninch,</i> 513 U.S. 432, 438-44, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established the ground rules, we return to the particulars of the case at hand. Judge Keeton identified the correct test for gauging prejudice in this type of situation. In our view, however, he misapplied the test in hypothesizing that the phrase, \"The verdict on all counts must be unanimous,\" was \"subject to interpretation\" in an incorrect way (i.e., that the jurors must reach unanimous agreement on all counts combined, rather than on each count separately) and that it was \"likely\" to have influenced the verdict. When the <i>Brecht</i> standard is properly applied in the context of this case, the record reflects that the government has carried the devoir of persuasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The impetus for the standard articulated in <i>Brecht</i> is that the bar should be held fairly high on post-conviction review. Such proceedings are meant to afford relief only to those who have been grievously wronged, not to those who show merely a possibility &#8212; even a reasonable possibility &#8212; of harm. <i>See Brecht,</i> 507 U.S. at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710; <i>see also Singleton v. United States,</i> 26 F.3d 233, 237 n. 9 (1st Cir.1994). This applies with even greater force to procedurally defaulted claims raised for the first time on collateral review. <i>See United States v. Frady,</i> 456 U.S. 152, 166, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) (requiring such claims to clear a significantly higher hurdle on collateral attack than on direct review); <i>Knight v. United States,</i> 37 F.3d 769, 772-73 (1st Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that a court cannot grant collateral relief on \"mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error; the court must find that the defendant was actually prejudiced by the error.\" <i>Calderon v. Coleman,</i> 525 U.S. 141, 146, 119 S.Ct. 500, 142 L.Ed.2d 521 (1998). The error identified by Judge Keeton does not pass through this screen; our review of the instant record convinces us that it is highly improbable that the ex parte supplemental instruction had any effect on the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury instruction cannot be read in a vacuum, but, rather, must be taken in light of the charge as a whole. <i>See Cupp v. Naughten,</i> 414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973); <i>United States v. Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d 980, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987). In this instance, the jurors previously had received explicit instruction that \"[i]t's possible that you could find the government has proved its case as to all three counts, failed to prove it as to all three counts, or proved it as to one or more counts and not on the others.\" In framing the question to which Judge Freedman responded, the jurors asked, \"Does it have to be unanimous to be not guilty on <i>a</i> indictment ... ?\" This use of the article \"a\" indicates that they understood the court's earlier instruction. Because the context in which the jurors asked for supplemental instructions strongly suggests that they understood the independence of each count, we deem it highly probable that the jury interpreted the trial judge's relatively simple reply in the manner in which it was intended: as an admonition that, to render a verdict on any count, the jury must be unanimous as to that count. <i>See Boyde v. California,</i> 494 U.S. 370, 381-82, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990) (employing similar analysis on direct review); <i>Curtis,</i> 124 F.3d at 8 (using comparable inquiry to assess allegedly improper jury instruction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the timing of the verdict counsel persuasively in favor of a different conclusion. In some cases, a time line permits a reasonable inference that the error \"had a causal effect on a verdict returned within minutes of the court's action.\" <i>Curtis,</i> 124 F.3d at 7 n. 2. Here, however, we do not think that much weight can be placed on the fact that the jury returned its verdict some thirty-five minutes after Judge Freedman's response. We must consider the timing in the gross and scope of the entire record. <i>See Derman,</i> 298 F.3d at 46. The record reveals that the jury deliberated for only four hours in total. In that relatively short period, this was the deliberating jury's third note; in other words, it asked for, and received, two other responses during that interval. When put in this context, a third question more than half an hour before reaching a verdict does not strike us as significant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are fortified in our conclusion that the error was benign by the strength of the prosecution's case. The government adduced more than adequate evidence to support the jury's verdict on all three counts. As we stated on direct review, the evidence of the petitioner's guilt \"was overwhelming.\" <i>Ellis,</i> 935 F.2d at 390. Any suspicion that the supplemental instruction improperly drove the verdict is therefore highly implausible. <i>See United States v. Bullard,</i> 37 F.3d 765, 768 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Rogers v. Carver,</i> 833 F.2d 379, 385 n. 1 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the petitioner's argument that the supplemental instruction tipped the scales is woven from gossamer strands of speculation and surmise. Notwithstanding the error, we remain confident of the integrity of the verdict &#8212; especially in view of the apparent clarity of the charge as a whole and the robust evidence of the petitioner's guilt. Consequently, we find no actual prejudice. <i>See Calderon,</i> 525 U.S. at 146, 119 S.Ct. 500; <i>Brecht,</i> 507 U.S. at 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710. It follows that Judge Keeton's first ground of decision does not justify habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Confrontation Clause Claim.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the resolution of the jury note claim was plainly within the transferee judge's adjudicatory purview, the Confrontation Clause claim arguably was not. We briefly recapitulate the relevant facts (which are uncontradicted). After resolving the majority of the petitioner's section 2255 claims (including the Confrontation Clause claim), Judge Freedman granted in part the petitioner's motion to recuse and transferred the case so that another judge could hear and determine the fifth claim for relief (alleging judicial bias and misconduct). The successor judge resolved all the transferred claims against the petitioner (save only for the jury note claim, discussed <i>supra</i>). Yet, notwithstanding the limited scope of the transfer order, he ventured into other areas. Once there, he reconsidered, and overruled, his predecessor's prior adjudication of the Confrontation Clause claim. The government says that Judge Keeton exceeded his authority in revisiting that claim. The petitioner demurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conundrum implicates the law of the case doctrine. This doctrine has two branches. One branch involves the so-called mandate rule (which, with only a few exceptions, forbids, among other things, a lower court from relitigating issues that were decided by a higher court, whether explicitly or by reasonable implication, at an earlier stage of the same case). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bell,</i> 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Rivera-Martinez,</i> 931 F.2d at 150. The other branch, applicable here, is somewhat more flexible. It provides that \"unless corrected by an appellate tribunal, a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case constitutes the law of the case throughout the pendency of the litigation.\" <i>Flibotte v. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> 131 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1997). This means that a court ordinarily ought to respect and follow its own rulings, made earlier in the same case. <i>See Arizona v. California,</i> 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983) (explaining that \"when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case\"). This branch of the doctrine frowns upon, but does not altogether prohibit, reconsideration of orders within a single proceeding by a successor judge. <i>E.g., Flibotte,</i> 131 F.3d at 25. This appeal requires us to trace the contours of the exceptions that apply to this second branch of the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presumption, of course, is that a successor judge should respect the law of the case. The orderly functioning of the judicial process requires that judges of coordinate jurisdiction honor one another's orders and revisit them only in special circumstances. <i>See Stevenson v. Four Winds Travel, Inc.,</i> 462 F.2d 899, 904-05 (5th Cir.1972) (collecting cases); <i>TCF Film Corp. v. Gourley,</i> 240 F.2d 711, 713-14 &amp; n. 2 (3d Cir.1957) (collecting cases); 18B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 4478, at 670 (2d ed.2002). This limitation is anchored in a sea of salutary policies. <i>See generally</i> Joan Steinman, <i>Law of the Case: A Judicial Puzzle in Consolidated and Transferred Cases and in Multidistrict Litigation,</i> 135 U. Pa. L.Rev. 595, 602-05 (1987). For one thing, the law of the case doctrine affords litigants a high degree of certainty as to what claims are &#8212; and are not &#8212; still open for adjudication. <i>See Best v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 107 F.3d 544, 546 (7th Cir.1997); <i>see also Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.,</i> 486 U.S. 800, 816-17, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988). For another thing, it furthers the abiding interest shared by both litigants and the public in finality and repose. <i>See Wyoming v. Oklahoma,</i> 502 U.S. 437, 446, 112 S.Ct. 789, 117 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992). Third, it promotes efficiency; a party should be allowed his day in court, but going beyond that point deprives others of their days in court, squanders judicial resources, and breeds undue delay. <i>See Christianson,</i> 486 U.S. at 819, 108 S.Ct. 2166; <i>Rivera-Martinez,</i> 931 F.2d at 151. Fourth, the doctrine increases confidence in the adjudicatory process: reconsideration of previously litigated issues, absent strong justification, spawns inconsistency and threatens the reputation of the judicial system. <i>See</i> Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., <i>Preclusion as to Issues of Law: The Legal System's Interest,</i> 70 Iowa L.Rev. 81, 88 (1984) (collecting cases). Finally, judges who too liberally second-guess their co-equals effectively usurp the appellate function and embolden litigants to engage in judge-shopping and similar forms of arbitrage. <i>See Erwin,</i> 155 F.3d at 825; <i>see also White v. Higgins,</i> 116 F.2d 312, 317-18 (1st Cir.1940); 18B Wright et al., <i>supra</i> &#167; 4478.1, at 695.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These concerns are heightened in the federal habeas context. In the first place, the presumption against reconsideration is even stronger when the challenge arises on collateral attack of a criminal conviction (and, therefore, implicates society's reasonable reliance on the finality of a criminal conviction). <i>See Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (observing that \"the presumption that a criminal judgment is final is at its strongest in collateral attacks\"). In the second place, a section 2255 petition ordinarily must be brought before the trial judge. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255; <i>see also Gregory v. United States,</i> 585 F.2d 548, 550 (1st Cir.1978). This is not an idle gesture, for that judge has a unique knowledge of what transpired at trial and of what effect errors may have had. <i>See McGill,</i> 11 F.3d at 225; <i>Panico v. United States,</i> 412 F.2d 1151, 1155-56 (2d Cir.1969); <i>see also</i> Rule 4(a), Rules Governing Sec. 2255, advisory committee's note. For these reasons, a successor judge should be particularly hesitant to revisit portions of a section 2255 petition already adjudicated before the original trial judge. This is especially so in a case &#8212; like this one &#8212; in which the successor judge is operating under a limited transfer order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, there are times when the law of the case may give way. The question of what circumstances justify revisiting a ruling previously made in the same proceeding by a judge of coordinate jurisdiction is case-specific. <i>Christianson,</i> 486 U.S. at 817, 108 S.Ct. 2166; <i>TCF Film Corp.,</i> 240 F.2d at 714. The resolution of that question is guided, however, by certain general principles. We enumerate those principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, reconsideration is proper if the initial ruling was made on an inadequate record or was designed to be preliminary or tentative. <i>E.g., Peterson v. Lindner,</i> 765 F.2d 698, 704 (7th Cir.1985); <i>cf. Times Mirror Magazines, Inc. v. Las Vegas Sports News, L.L.C.,</i> 212 F.3d 157, 160 (3d Cir.2000) (emphasizing district court's authority to reconsider matters previously decided on preliminary injunction). Second, reconsideration may be warranted if there has been a material change in controlling law. <i>E.g., Tracey v. United States,</i> 739 F.2d 679, 682 (1st Cir. 1984); <i>Crane Co. v. Am. Standard, Inc.,</i> 603 F.2d 244, 248 (2d Cir.1979). Third, reconsideration may be undertaken if newly discovered evidence bears on the question. <i>E.g., Fisher v. Trainor,</i> 242 F.3d 24, 29 n. 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Pit River Home &amp; Agric. Coop. Ass'n v. United States,</i> 30 F.3d 1088, 1096 (9th Cir.1994). Lastly, reconsideration may be appropriate to avoid manifest injustice. <i>Christianson,</i> 486 U.S. at 817, 108 S.Ct. 2166. In that regard, however, neither doubt about the correctness of a predecessor judge's rulings nor a belief that the litigant may be able to make a more convincing argument the second time around will suffice to justify reconsideration. <i>See Fogel v. Chestnutt,</i> 668 F.2d 100, 109 (2d Cir.1981); <i>White,</i> 116 F.2d at 317-18. For this purpose, there is a meaningful difference between an arguably erroneous ruling (which does not justify revisitation by a co-equal successor judge) and an unreasonable ruling that paves the way for a manifestly unjust result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We employ this framework in assessing Judge Keeton's decision to revisit Judge Freedman's adjudication of the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim. In so doing, we recognize the desirability of according the successor judge a modicum of flexibility. Thus, we review a successor judge's decision to reconsider a coordinate judge's earlier ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>Delta Sav. Bank v. United States,</i> 265 F.3d 1017, 1027 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Loumar, Inc. v. Smith,</i> 698 F.2d 759, 763 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Keeton did not say why he opted to reopen the Confrontation Clause issue. It is apparent, however, that the first three conditions that might justify reconsideration are plainly absent here. Judge Freedman made his Confrontation Clause ruling based on full briefing, oral argument, and an examination of the record as a whole (the same record that was before Judge Keeton). In addition, he had the advantage of having presided over the trial and having witnessed the child's testimony at first hand. His rescript, filed on March 2, 1998, gives no indication that his Confrontation Clause ruling was meant to be tentative or preliminary. To the contrary, he instructed Judge Keeton to enter it as part of the final judgment upon completion of the proceedings, thereby signaling that he intended his ruling to be definitive. Finally, the petitioner neither presented new facts before Judge Keeton nor identified any intervening change in the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the record fails to suggest any reason why Judge Keeton should have revisited Judge Freedman's Confrontation Clause ruling unless he discerned a manifest injustice. That standard is difficult to achieve: a finding of manifest injustice requires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Arizona,</i> 460 U.S. at 618 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1382; <i>see also Dobbs v. Zant,</i> 506 U.S. 357, 358-59, 113 S.Ct. 835, 122 L.Ed.2d 103 (1993) (indicating that the previous ruling must be called into \"serious question\"); <i>Reed v. Rhodes,</i> 179 F.3d 453, 473 (6th Cir.1999) (finding that reconsideration did not constitute abuse of discretion when original judge's ruling was ill-explained and based on obviously unsound legal analysis). A mere \"doctrinal disposition\" to decide the issue differently will not suffice. <i>Agostini v. Felton,</i> 521 U.S. 203, 236, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have examined the record with great care. Fairly viewed, the special seating arrangement devised by Judge Freedman for the victim's testimony was not obviously outside the compass of Supreme Court precedent. Because the record does not support a finding of manifest injustice, Judge Keeton was bound to defer to Judge Freedman's ruling on that issue. His failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, it is important to set the stage (and, thus, establish the appropriate frame of reference). The petitioner concedes that he failed to advance, on direct appeal, his claim that the special seating arrangement violated the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, the claim is procedurally defaulted. In order to have succeeded on a collateral attack, therefore, he had to have shown both cause and prejudice. <i>See McCleskey v. Zant,</i> 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991); <i>Derman,</i> 298 F.3d at 45. Assuming, without deciding, that the petitioner had demonstrated cause sufficient to excuse his procedural default &#8212; a debatable proposition on this record &#8212; he still had to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel's failure to raise the Confrontation Clause issue on direct appeal, the outcome of that appeal would have been different. <i>See Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Phrased another way, he had to show that his attorney's alleged blunder worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, thereby undermining confidence in the fairness of the proceedings that culminated in his conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); <i>Frady,</i> 456 U.S. at 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we knit the cause and prejudice standard and the manifest injustice standard together. Judge Freedman found no error in the use of the special seating arrangement (and, thus, no prejudice). In order to revisit and reverse that ruling, Judge Keeton had to determine that Judge Freedman's finding was manifestly unjust (that is, that the finding was unreasonable or obviously wrong). It is that determination, necessarily implicit in Judge Keeton's actions, that we must review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry is channeled by a pair of Supreme Court opinions. Two years before the petitioner's conviction, the Court held unconstitutional, as violative of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, an Iowa statute that allowed the placement of an opaque screen between a defendant charged with sexual assault and his minor victims (there, two thirteen-year-old girls). <i>Coy v. Iowa,</i> 487 U.S. 1012, 1020-21, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988). Although the Court described face-to-face confrontation as instrumental in testing the veracity of a witness and integral to a fair trial, <i>id.</i> at 1016-20, 108 S.Ct. 2798, it specifically reserved the question of whether exceptions to the right of face-to-face confrontation might be recognized when \"necessary to further an important public policy,\" <i>id.</i> at 1021. To the extent that such exceptions might exist, the Court cautioned, they could not rest on generalized theses (such as those contained in the Iowa statute); rather, exceptions would require \"individualized findings\" as to particular witnesses and circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six weeks after the jury convicted the petitioner, the Supreme Court decided <i>Maryland v. Craig,</i> 497 U.S. 836, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990). The <i>Craig</i> Court upheld a Maryland statute that allowed child abuse victims to testify via one-way closed circuit television upon the trial court's determination that face-to-face confrontation with the alleged abuser was likely to cause serious emotional distress. <i>Id.</i> at 855, 110 S.Ct. 3157. Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, emphasized that the right to face-to-face confrontation is not an absolute requirement of the Confrontation Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 847-50, 110 S.Ct. 3157. An alternative arrangement is permissible as long as the arrangement is in furtherance of an important public policy &#8212; such as the protection of minors who have been victimized by sexual predators &#8212; and the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured. <i>Id.</i> at 854-55, 110 S.Ct. 3157. Even so, the trial court must make individualized, case-specific findings, and, in doing so, must address the particular child's susceptibility to the particular defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 855-60, 110 S.Ct. 3157.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the section 2255 petition, Judge Freedman reviewed these precedents. He concluded that the special seating arrangement used in the petitioner's trial passed constitutional muster. Based on his supportable findings anent the need for special treatment of the child witness, this conclusion is neither unreasonable nor obviously wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his post-conviction rescript, Judge Freedman carefully documented the considerations that had prompted him to resort to a modified seating arrangement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> He found that, given the nature of E.D.'s testimony, the child &#8212; who was nine years old at the time of trial &#8212; likely would have difficulty testifying in a public forum, and that she might reasonably fear testifying in front of the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner asserts that Judge Freedman's findings are inadequate to meet the <i>Craig</i> criteria. While this is a close question, we think that the findings suffice to withstand a claim of manifest injustice. In the first place, the less the intrusion on Sixth Amendment rights, the less detail is required in a trial court's findings. <i>See California v. Lord,</i> 30 Cal.App.4th 1718, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 455 (1994); <i>Brandon v. Alaska,</i> 839 P.2d 400, 409-10 (Alaska Ct. App.1992). In all events, Judge Freedman's rescript mentions specifically that the petitioner had threatened E.D. with harm if she told what he had done. This finding, in conjunction with other facts of record (such as the fact that the petitioner arguably had made menacing gestures during the pretrial proceedings, that he had struck E.D. before, and that he repeatedly had violated a \"no contact\" order after his arrest), leads us to conclude that the use of a special seating arrangement was justified. <i>See Vigil v. Tansy,</i> 917 F.2d 1277, 1279-80 (10th Cir.1990) (allowing pre-<i>Craig</i> trial court to justify moderate restriction on right to confront child witness on less rigorous individualized findings).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the adequacy of Judge Freedman's findings is buttressed by the hallmarks of testimonial reliability made manifest by the record. <i>See Craig,</i> 497 U.S. at 851, 110 S.Ct. 3157 (listing competence, administration of an oath, full opportunity for cross-examination, and full visibility of the child witness's body language and demeanor before judge, jury, and defendant as \"other elements of the confrontation right\"). These include the absence of any opaque physical barrier and the fact that the witness was required to give live testimony, under oath, in the presence of both the defendant and the jury. <i>See id.</i> To the extent that nervousness, body language, demeanor, and the like are important indicia of credibility, the jurors' entirely unimpaired view of the witness is persuasive. <i>See Morales v. Artuz,</i> 281 F.3d 55, 62 (2d Cir.2002); <i>Stanger v. Indiana,</i> 545 N.E.2d 1105, 1113 (Ind.Ct. App.1989). In addition, the petitioner had ample opportunity to cross-examine E.D. and to offer any evidence and arguments that might impugn her credibility. These are weighty factors. <i>See Louisiana v. Brockel,</i> 733 So.2d 640, 646 (La.Ct.App. 1999); <i>Boatright v. Georgia,</i> 192 Ga.App. 112, 385 S.E.2d 298, 302-03 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these circumstances, the petitioner argues that <i>Coy</i> demands a different result. We do not agree. The seating arrangement there was statutorily driven, not custom-tailored to fit the exigencies of a particular case. Moreover, it involved an opaque physical barrier. In contrast, no physical barrier separated E.D. from the petitioner during the instant trial. Many courts have found the absence of such a barrier to be of decretory significance in rejecting Confrontation Clause challenges. <i>See, e.g., N. Dakota v. Miller,</i> 631 N.W.2d 587, 594 (N.D.2001); <i>Smith v. Arkansas,</i> 340 Ark. 116, 8 S.W.3d 534, 537 (2000); <i>Utah v. Hoyt,</i> 806 P.2d 204, 209 (Utah Ct.App.1991); <i>Ortiz v. Georgia,</i> 188 Ga. App. 532, 374 S.E.2d 92, 95-96 (1988); <i>see also Morales,</i> 281 F.3d at 58-59 (pointing out that neither <i>Craig</i> nor <i>Coy</i> expatiate on unobstructed, in-court testimony); <i>Cumbie v. Singletary,</i> 991 F.2d 715, 721 (11th Cir.1993) (suggesting that <i>Coy</i> is inapplicable when child testifies in presence of defendant); <i>see generally</i> Bruce E. Bohlman, <i>The High Cost of Constitutional Rights in Child Abuse Cases &#8212; Is the Price Worth Paying?,</i> 66 N.D. L.Rev. 579, 589 (1990) (stating that seating arrangements not involving artificial barriers \"are apparently permissible under <i>Coy</i>\"). Given these marked differences, <i>Coy</i> is readily distinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are these the only bases for distinction. Unlike in <i>Coy,</i> the record here contains no evidence suggesting that what the petitioner actually saw of E.D.'s face at trial was substantially less than what he would have seen had she testified from the witness stand (and, indeed, Judge Freedman's description of the courtroom layout makes clear that E.D. would not have had to face the petitioner directly even if she had testified from the witness stand). The significance of this circumstance is reinforced by Judge Freedman's specific finding that the petitioner had a sufficient view of E.D.'s \"demeanor.\" This finding is not clearly erroneous, and, thus, deserves our respect. <i>See Familia-Consoro,</i> 160 F.3d at 764-65; <i>McGill,</i> 11 F.3d at 225. Both of these factors tend to support the constitutionality of the special seating arrangement. <i>See Smith,</i> 8 S.W.3d at 537-38 (collecting cases); <i>Brockel,</i> 733 So.2d at 646.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a further effort to denigrate the use of the special seating arrangement, the petitioner notes the lack of eye contact between him and E.D. We agree that the opportunity for eye contact, whether or not the witness chooses to act on it, is an important integer in the Sixth Amendment calculus. <i>Coy,</i> 487 U.S. at 1019, 108 S.Ct. 2798. But a defendant does not have a constitutional right to force eye contact with his accuser, <i>id.,</i> and we refuse to fashion a bright-line rule that the lack of such an opportunity, in and of itself, automatically translates into a constitutional violation. Most other courts that have considered the question have reached a similar conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>E.g., Hoyt,</i> 806 P.2d at 210; <i>Ortiz,</i> 374 S.E.2d at 95-96. Moreover, some courts have found that the lack of an easy opportunity for eye contact is palliated to a sufficient degree by a seating arrangement such as the one employed in this case (which preserves the line of sight and allows a witness to turn to make eye contact with the defendant). <i>See California v. Sharp,</i> 29 Cal.App.4th 1772, 36 Cal. Rptr.2d 117, 125 (1994); <i>Boatright,</i> 385 S.E.2d at 301.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. Although the lack of eye contact weighs in the petitioner's favor, all the other Confrontation Clause safeguards were present here. Mindful, as we are, that trial judges have some leeway to move a witness around a courtroom as long as those shifts retain an unobstructed line of sight between the defendant and the witness, <i>cf. Coy,</i> 487 U.S. at 1023, 108 S.Ct. 2798 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (suggesting that \"many such procedures may raise no substantial Confrontation Clause problem since they involve testimony in the presence of the defendant\"), we cannot say that Judge Freedman's core conclusion &#8212; that no Confrontation Clause violation occurred &#8212; was either unreasonable or obviously wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a further attempt to justify reconsideration, the petitioner submits that Judge Freedman erroneously denied him the assistance of counsel for his section 2255 petition. He argues, in effect, that his \"inartful\" pro se presentation before Judge Freedman may have influenced the court's rulings, freeing the successor judge to review them de novo. That argument is unavailing. A convicted criminal has no constitutional right to counsel with respect to habeas proceedings. <i>Pennsylvania v. Finley,</i> 481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). It is true that the petitioner could not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim until collateral review, <i>see Knight,</i> 37 F.3d at 774; <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993), but this makes no difference. We fail to see how an adscititious ineffective assistance claim entitles a criminal defendant to the assistance of counsel on subsequent collateral review. <i>See Moran v. McDaniel,</i> 80 F.3d 1261, 1271 (9th Cir.1996); <i>see also Lattimore v. Dubois,</i> 311 F.3d 46, 55-56 (1st Cir.2002). Although we have indicated that, in certain circumstances, the appointment of counsel for a section 2255 petitioner might be warranted, such cases are few and far between. <i>See Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1063-64. The circumstances of the petitioner's case are not such as to demand the appointment of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> It follows that Judge Keeton could not reconsider a prior ruling merely because the presence of counsel might have produced new or better arguments. <i>United States v. Velez Carrero,</i> 140 F.3d 327, 329-30 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Finding no manifest injustice, we are constrained to hold that Judge Keeton abused his discretion in redeciding and countermanding Judge Freedman's previous adjudication of the Confrontation Clause claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is true that the law must always be vigilant to protect the rights of those who are convicted of serious crimes, our system of justice guarantees a fair trial, not a perfect one. <i>See United States v. Hasting,</i> 461 U.S. 499, 508, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); <i>United States v. Polito,</i> 856 F.2d 414, 418 (1st Cir.1988). Nowhere is this principle more venerated than on collateral review. <i>See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 374-75, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (holding that habeas relief under the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(2), is reserved for unreasonable applications of Supreme Court precedent, not merely to remedy incorrect state court decisions). In this instance, the petitioner's trial may not have been perfect, but it was most assuredly fair. Accordingly, we reverse the order granting a new trial and remand the matter to the district court with directions to enter judgment for the United States and, concomitantly, to reinstate the petitioner's convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the handling of the jury note reflects error, not misconduct, this is an essentially semantic difference for purposes of the case at bar.

Jones,</i> 282 F.3d 893, 901 (6th Cir.2002) (affirming the grant of a state prisoner's habeas petition on the ground that the state courts \"unreasonably applied harmless error analysis to French's deprivation of counsel during the supplemental instruction\"). The Supreme Court recently vacated the Sixth Circuit's decision in <i>French</i> and remanded the case \"for further consideration in light of <i>Bell v. Cone</i>[].\" <i>Jones v. French,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2324, 153 L.Ed.2d 153 (2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be sure, one court has used the more rigorous \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard in circumstances similar to those presented in this case<i>See Starr v. Lockhart,</i> 23 F.3d 1280, 1291-92 (8th Cir. 1994). We reject that view as contrary both to circuit precedent and to the overwhelming weight of authority elsewhere. <i>See, e.g., Bains v. Cambra,</i> 204 F.3d 964, 976-77 (9th Cir.2000) (collecting cases); <i>Lyons v. Stovall,</i> 188 F.3d 327, 335 (6th Cir.1999); <i>Hogue v.

Because we conclude that Judge Freedman's refusal to grant habeas relief premised on the use of the special seating arrangement was neither unreasonable nor obviously wrong, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we do not reach the question of what (if any) prejudice inured.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Because the quantum and kind of prejudice that must be shown in connection with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is identical to that necessary to relieve a habeas petitioner from the effects of a procedural default,<i>see Prou v.

Since the petitioner did not request a hearing and did not object to the lack of contemporaneous findings, we accept Judge Freedman's later statement of his reasons in lieu of contemporaneous findings<i>Cf. California v. Sharp,</i> 29 Cal.App.4th 1772, 36 Cal. Rptr.2d 117, 124 &amp; n. 4 (1994) (extrapolating findings from the record where defendant failed to ask the trial court for findings).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To be sure, Judge Freedman's findings fell short of an express determination that E.D. ran a serious risk of trauma from testifying in front of the defendant &#8212; a type of determination suggested by<i>Craig,</i> 497 U.S. at 856, 110 S.Ct. 3157. Given that the petitioner's conviction pre-dated <i>Craig,</i> however, we think that the findings were adequate to justify the modest measures instituted in this case. <i>See Hardy v. Wigginton,</i> 922 F.2d 294, 299-300 (6th Cir.1990) (explaining that, in the interim between <i>Coy</i> and <i>Craig,</i> trial courts could not be expected to make <i>Craig</i>-type findings that were complete in every detail); <i>Vigil,</i> 917 F.2d at 1279-80 (similar).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We are aware that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has found the lack of eye contact fatal under an analogous &#8212; but differently worded &#8212; provision of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights<i>See Massachusetts v. Amirault,</i> 424 Mass. 618, 677 N.E.2d 652, 662 (Mass.1997) (terming it \"a non sequitur to argue from the proposition that, because the witness cannot be forced to look at the accused during his face-to-face testimony, that therefore this aspect of the art. 12 confrontation right is dispensable\").

While such an appointment was within Judge Keeton's discretion, it does not follow that Judge Freedman's contrary decision constituted an abuse of discretion.

Goodman, Appellate Section, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John G.S. Flym, by appointment of the court, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These appeals, which have their genesis in an effort by the petitioner, Edward B. Ellis, to mount a collateral attack on his convictions for interstate transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, present challenging legal questions complicated by a strange procedural twist. That complication arose after the original trial judge denied Ellis's section 2255 petition in part and then recused himself as to the unadjudicated portion of the petition. A limited order of reassignment followed. The transferee judge, acting partly on the basis of a previously unadjudicated claim and partly on the basis of a previously adjudicated claim, proceeded to grant the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hybrid nature of this decision requires that we review its component parts separately. The first ground of decision involves the trial judge's handling of a jury note. We agree with the transferee judge's finding of error &#8212; the original trial judge used an incorrect procedure in dealing with the jury note &#8212; but we hold that this error was harmless under the circumstances. The second ground of decision involves whether the special seating arrangement afforded to the victim during her trial testimony offended the Confrontation Clause. We hold that under the law of the case doctrine the transferee judge should not have revisited the issue, but, rather, should have left intact the original judge's finding that no constitutional violation had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of these holdings, we discern no principled basis for habeas relief. Consequently, we reverse the order granting the petitioner a new trial and remand the case with directions to enter judgment for the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, a jury convicted the petitioner on three counts of interstate transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423. The district court imposed a twenty-five year incarcerative term. On direct appeal, we affirmed the convictions and sentence. <i>United States v. Ellis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562610\"><a href=\"/opinion/562610/united-states-v-edward-b-ellis-aka-rocco-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991). We suggest that those who hunger for a more exegetic account of the crimes of conviction consult that opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, it suffices to say that the petitioner was found guilty of repeatedly abusing (in three different states) the youthful daughter of his live-in girlfriend. <i>Id.</i> at 388-89. The evidence adduced against him included the testimony of his victim, E.D. (who was nine years old at the time of trial). In a preliminary discussion, it was suggested, without objection from the petitioner's counsel (Attorney Goldings), that E.D. testify while seated \"in such a way that she does not look at [the petitioner].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding his initial acquiescence, Goldings objected to the special seating arrangement when E.D. was called as a witness. Judge Freedman overruled the objection. During her testimony, E.D. sat in a chair facing the jurors but facing away from the petitioner. The parties disagree both as to the exact angle between E.D. and the petitioner and as to how much of E.D.'s face the petitioner could see during her testimony. It is clear, however, that E.D., while testifying, could only have made eye contact with the petitioner by looking over her right shoulder. It is equally clear that she did not avail herself of this opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, the petitioner unsuccessfully challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, various evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, and the length of the sentence. <i>Id.</i> at 389-97. He did not advance any claim related either to the handling of the jury note (discussed <i>infra</i>) or to the special seating arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the petitioner moved pro se to vacate his sentence. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. In that petition, he maintained that Goldings had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel (including a failure to present certain exculpatory evidence and impedance of his right to testify); charged Goldings with having concealed a conflict of interest; lodged a Confrontation Clause challenge to the special seating arrangement; complained of prosecutorial misbehavior; and accused Judge Freedman of judicial bias and misconduct. He also filed two motions: one seeking the appointment of counsel and the other asking Judge Freedman to step aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Freedman denied the motion for appointment of counsel out of hand. As for the recusal motion, he did not disqualify himself generally, but, rather, proceeded to resolve four of the petitioner's five claims. Specifically, he denied the cognate ineffective assistance of counsel claims insofar as those claims touched upon the failure to present evidence and the supposed interference with the petitioner's right to testify; found no cognizable conflict of interest; and ruled that the assertions of prosecutorial misconduct were overblown. Given the present posture of the case, we need not discuss any of these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Freedman's disposition of the Confrontation Clause claim requires some elaboration. For purposes of that analysis, Judge Freedman accepted, without deciding, that Goldings's failure to pursue the claim on direct appeal established ineffective assistance of counsel (and, therefore, established \"cause\" necessary to overcome the applicable procedural bar). Judge Freedman then discussed the relevant Supreme Court precedents and explained that, as the trial judge, he had made an individualized determination that a special accommodation was needed because E.D. would have to testify regarding the \"heinous acts\" of sexual abuse that she had endured at the hands of someone who lived with her and who had threatened to kill her and her family members. Since these facts supported the use of the special seating arrangement, Judge Freedman concluded that an appeal from the court's decision to employ the special seating arrangement would have been futile, and, therefore, that Goldings's failure to challenge the arrangement on appeal was harmless. Accordingly, he denied both the Confrontation Clause claim and the related ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <i>See Lockhart v.

Instead, he asked the chief judge to reassign the case to a new judge to \"consider and render a decision on the balance of the petitioner's claims and enter judgment accordingly on those claims as well as those addressed by this court in its Memorandum and Order entered on March 2, 1998.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chief judge subsequently assigned the case to Judge Keeton. Judge Keeton appointed counsel to represent the petitioner and gave both parties leave to file supplementary memoranda on the allegations of judicial bias and misconduct concerning (1) the court's decision to allow a special seating arrangement; (2) certain comments and gestures supposedly made by Judge Freedman during E.D.'s testimony; and (3) Judge Freedman's handling of a note from the deliberating jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, Judge Keeton unequivocally rejected the petitioner's claims of judicial bias (finding, inter alia, that bias played no role in the establishment of the special seating arrangement, and that Judge Freedman had made no untoward comments or gestures during the trial). He concluded, however, that Judge Freedman's exchange of notes with the jury deprived the petitioner of the assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the case (and, thus, violated the Sixth Amendment).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Judge Keeton then opted to revisit the petitioner's already adjudicated Confrontation Clause claim. Deeming his predecessor's findings inadequate and the petitioner's view of E.D. during trial too constrained, Judge Keeton reversed the earlier ruling and declared unconstitutional the use of the special seating arrangement. Based on this pair of conclusions, Judge Keeton granted the section 2255 petition, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government thereupon filed these appeals.

The petitioner has neither prosecuted a cross-appeal nor otherwise challenged Judge Freedman's disposition of his other section 2255 claims. This narrowed scope of review, together with the absence of a cross-appeal, dictates that we focus on the rulings of the successor judge. We proceed in two steps. First, we discuss Judge Keeton's assessment of the jury note claim. We then consider his assessment of the Confrontation Clause claim (concentrating, for reasons that will soon become apparent, on his authority to revisit Judge Freedman's earlier adjudication of that claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We preface our analysis with an acknowledgment that one court has flatly rejected the concept of partial recusal. <i>See United States v.

The majority view, however, supports the availability of such a case-management device. <i>See, e.g., Pashaian v. Eccelston Prop., Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721307\"><a href=\"/opinion/721307/robert-pashaian-v-eccelston-properties-ltd-eccelston-leasing-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 84-85 (2d Cir.1996); <i>United States v.

While we have not spoken directly to the subject, we indicated our approval of the praxis in <i>Murchu,</i> 926 F.2d at 53 n. 3, 56-57. <i>See also Warner v.

Today, we make that approval explicit: we hold that a judge may, in an appropriate case, decide certain issues and recuse himself or herself as to others. This was an appropriate case, and we therefore hold that Judge Freedman's partial recusal was a valid exercise of judicial authority. Under the circumstances, it constituted a sound method of dealing with the prickly problem of balancing the demands of section 2255 &#8212; a statute that evinces a strong preference for post-conviction review by the judge who presided at the defendant's trial&#8212;with the demands of the recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a). We add, moreover, that the chief judge responded appropriately to this partial recusal by entering a limited order of reassignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although limited orders of reassignment may &#8212; as in this case &#8212; be necessary and proper, they place unaccustomed restraints on the transferee judge. When a court assumes jurisdiction for a limited purpose, it ordinarily should confine itself to that purpose. <i>Cf. United States v.

Observing the restrictions implied in such an order promotes the efficient operation of the courts and facilitates the winnowing of issues throughout successive stages of litigation. <i>See Erwin,</i> 155 F.3d at 825. By the same token, courts that carefully observe the boundaries of their assignments help stabilize the decisionmaking process, assure the predictability of results, and nourish proper working relationships between judicial units. <i>United States v.

He found this error prejudicial, stating: \"Given the timing and substance of the ex parte communication, I conclude that it is likely that the trial judge's response had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\" In this regard, he theorized that the jury could have misunderstood the comment that \"[t]he verdict on <i>all counts</i> must be unanimous\" to preclude a partial verdict, an ambiguity that consultation with counsel could have prevented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Judge Keeton that Judge Freedman erred by failing to consult the parties before responding substantively to the deliberating jury's request for a supplementary instruction. <i>See Rogers v.

In this instance, the jurors previously had received explicit instruction that \"[i]t's possible that you could find the government has proved its case as to all three counts, failed to prove it as to all three counts, or proved it as to one or more counts and not on the others.\" In framing the question to which Judge Freedman responded, the jurors asked, \"Does it have to be unanimous to be not guilty on <i>a</i> indictment ... ?\" This use of the article \"a\" indicates that they understood the court's earlier instruction. Because the context in which the jurors asked for supplemental instructions strongly suggests that they understood the independence of each count, we deem it highly probable that the jury interpreted the trial judge's relatively simple reply in the manner in which it was intended: as an admonition that, to render a verdict on any count, the jury must be unanimous as to that count. <i>See Boyde v.

Here, however, we do not think that much weight can be placed on the fact that the jury returned its verdict some thirty-five minutes after Judge Freedman's response. We must consider the timing in the gross and scope of the entire record. <i>See Derman,</i> 298 F.3d at 46. The record reveals that the jury deliberated for only four hours in total. In that relatively short period, this was the deliberating jury's third note; in other words, it asked for, and received, two other responses during that interval. When put in this context, a third question more than half an hour before reaching a verdict does not strike us as significant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are fortified in our conclusion that the error was benign by the strength of the prosecution's case.

Consequently, we find no actual prejudice. <i>See Calderon,</i> 525 U.S. at 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639091/calderon-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We briefly recapitulate the relevant facts (which are uncontradicted). After resolving the majority of the petitioner's section 2255 claims (including the Confrontation Clause claim), Judge Freedman granted in part the petitioner's motion to recuse and transferred the case so that another judge could hear and determine the fifth claim for relief (alleging judicial bias and misconduct). The successor judge resolved all the transferred claims against the petitioner (save only for the jury note claim, discussed <i>supra</i>). Yet, notwithstanding the limited scope of the transfer order, he ventured into other areas. Once there, he reconsidered, and overruled, his predecessor's prior adjudication of the Confrontation Clause claim. The government says that Judge Keeton exceeded his authority in revisiting that claim. The petitioner demurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conundrum implicates the law of the case doctrine. This doctrine has two branches. One branch involves the so-called mandate rule (which, with only a few exceptions, forbids, among other things, a lower court from relitigating issues that were decided by a higher court, whether explicitly or by reasonable implication, at an earlier stage of the same case). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602344\"><a href=\"/opinion/602344/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 250 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Rivera-Martinez,</i> 931 F.2d at 150. The other branch, applicable here, is somewhat more flexible. It provides that \"unless corrected by an appellate tribunal, a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or criminal case constitutes the law of the case throughout the pendency of the litigation.\" <i>Flibotte v. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748872\"><a href=\"/opinion/748872/albert-a-flibotte-v-pennsylvania-truck-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1997). This means that a court ordinarily ought to respect and follow its own rulings, made earlier in the same case. <i>See Arizona v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110895\"><a href=\"/opinion/110895/arizona-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 618, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110895\"><a href=\"/opinion/110895/arizona-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span> (1983) (explaining that \"when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case\"). This branch of the doctrine frowns upon, but does not altogether prohibit, reconsideration of orders within a single proceeding by a successor judge. <i>E.g., Flibotte,</i> 131 F.3d at 25. This appeal requires us to trace the contours of the exceptions that apply to this second branch of the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presumption, of course, is that a successor judge should respect the law of the case.

Third, it promotes efficiency; a party should be allowed his day in court, but going beyond that point deprives others of their days in court, squanders judicial resources, and breeds undue delay. <i>See Christianson,</i> 486 U.S. at 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fourth, the doctrine increases confidence in the adjudicatory process: reconsideration of previously litigated issues, absent strong justification, spawns inconsistency and threatens the reputation of the judicial system. <i>See</i> Geoffrey C.

In the first place, the presumption against reconsideration is even stronger when the challenge arises on collateral attack of a criminal conviction (and, therefore, implicates society's reasonable reliance on the finality of a criminal conviction). <i>See Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 697, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the second place, a section 2255 petition ordinarily must be brought before the trial judge. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255; <i>see also Gregory v.

For these reasons, a successor judge should be particularly hesitant to revisit portions of a section 2255 petition already adjudicated before the original trial judge.

The question of what circumstances justify revisiting a ruling previously made in the same proceeding by a judge of coordinate jurisdiction is case-specific. <i>Christianson,</i> 486 U.S. at 817, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We enumerate those principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, reconsideration is proper if the initial ruling was made on an inadequate record or was designed to be preliminary or tentative. <i>E.g., Peterson v. Lindner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454330\"><a href=\"/opinion/454330/lowell-peterson-v-kenneth-e-lindner-secretary-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 704 (7th Cir.1985); <i>cf.

Second, reconsideration may be warranted if there has been a material change in controlling law. <i>E.g., Tracey v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439056\"><a href=\"/opinion/439056/francis-p-tracey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></a></span>, 682 (1st Cir. 1984); <i>Crane Co. v.

Third, reconsideration may be undertaken if newly discovered evidence bears on the question. <i>E.g., Fisher v. Trainor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199303\"><a href=\"/opinion/199303/fisher-v-trainor/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 n. 5 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Pit River Home &amp; Agric.

Lastly, reconsideration may be appropriate to avoid manifest injustice. <i>Christianson,</i> 486 U.S. at 817, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2166</span></a></span>. In that regard, however, neither doubt about the correctness of a predecessor judge's rulings nor a belief that the litigant may be able to make a more convincing argument the second time around will suffice to justify reconsideration. <i>See Fogel v. Chestnutt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398653\"><a href=\"/opinion/398653/fed-sec-l-rep-p-98388-rosalind-fogel-and-gerald-fogel-v-george-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 109 (2d Cir.1981); <i>White,</i> 116 F.2d at 317-18. For this purpose, there is a meaningful difference between an arguably erroneous ruling (which does not justify revisitation by a co-equal successor judge) and an unreasonable ruling that paves the way for a manifestly unjust result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We employ this framework in assessing Judge Keeton's decision to revisit Judge Freedman's adjudication of the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim. In so doing, we recognize the desirability of according the successor judge a modicum of flexibility. Thus, we review a successor judge's decision to reconsider a coordinate judge's earlier ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>Delta Sav. Bank v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774960\"><a href=\"/opinion/774960/delta-savings-bank-a-california-savings-association-young-i-kim-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1027 (9th Cir.2001); <i>Loumar, Inc. v.

It is apparent, however, that the first three conditions that might justify reconsideration are plainly absent here. Judge Freedman made his Confrontation Clause ruling based on full briefing, oral argument, and an examination of the record as a whole (the same record that was before Judge Keeton). In addition, he had the advantage of having presided over the trial and having witnessed the child's testimony at first hand. His rescript, filed on March 2, 1998, gives no indication that his Confrontation Clause ruling was meant to be tentative or preliminary. To the contrary, he instructed Judge Keeton to enter it as part of the final judgment upon completion of the proceedings, thereby signaling that he intended his ruling to be definitive. Finally, the petitioner neither presented new facts before Judge Keeton nor identified any intervening change in the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the record fails to suggest any reason why Judge Keeton should have revisited Judge Freedman's Confrontation Clause ruling unless he discerned a manifest injustice. That standard is difficult to achieve: a finding of manifest injustice requires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See Arizona,</i> 460 U.S. at 618 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110895\"><a href=\"/opinion/110895/arizona-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fairly viewed, the special seating arrangement devised by Judge Freedman for the victim's testimony was not obviously outside the compass of Supreme Court precedent. Because the record does not support a finding of manifest injustice, Judge Keeton was bound to defer to Judge Freedman's ruling on that issue. His failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, it is important to set the stage (and, thus, establish the appropriate frame of reference). The petitioner concedes that he failed to advance, on direct appeal, his claim that the special seating arrangement violated the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, the claim is procedurally defaulted. In order to have succeeded on a collateral attack, therefore, he had to have shown both cause and prejudice. <i>See McCleskey v.

Assuming, without deciding, that the petitioner had demonstrated cause sufficient to excuse his procedural default &#8212; a debatable proposition on this record &#8212; he still had to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel's failure to raise the Confrontation Clause issue on direct appeal, the outcome of that appeal would have been different. <i>See Strickler v.

The <i>Craig</i> Court upheld a Maryland statute that allowed child abuse victims to testify via one-way closed circuit television upon the trial court's determination that face-to-face confrontation with the alleged abuser was likely to cause serious emotional distress. <i>Id.</i> at 855, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112489\"><a href=\"/opinion/112489/maryland-v-craig/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While this is a close question, we think that the findings suffice to withstand a claim of manifest injustice. In the first place, the less the intrusion on Sixth Amendment rights, the less detail is required in a trial court's findings. <i>See California v.

App.1992). In all events, Judge Freedman's rescript mentions specifically that the petitioner had threatened E.D. with harm if she told what he had done. This finding, in conjunction with other facts of record (such as the fact that the petitioner arguably had made menacing gestures during the pretrial proceedings, that he had struck E.D. before, and that he repeatedly had violated a \"no contact\" order after his arrest), leads us to conclude that the use of a special seating arrangement was justified. <i>See Vigil v.

App.1989). In addition, the petitioner had ample opportunity to cross-examine E.D. and to offer any evidence and arguments that might impugn her credibility. These are weighty factors. <i>See Louisiana v.

We do not agree. The seating arrangement there was statutorily driven, not custom-tailored to fit the exigencies of a particular case. Moreover, it involved an opaque physical barrier. In contrast, no physical barrier separated E.D. from the petitioner during the instant trial. Many courts have found the absence of such a barrier to be of decretory significance in rejecting Confrontation Clause challenges. <i>See, e.g., N. Dakota v.

L.Rev. 579, 589 (1990) (stating that seating arrangements not involving artificial barriers \"are apparently permissible under <i>Coy</i>\"). Given these marked differences, <i>Coy</i> is readily distinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are these the only bases for distinction. Unlike in <i>Coy,</i> the record here contains no evidence suggesting that what the petitioner actually saw of E.D.'s face at trial was substantially less than what he would have seen had she testified from the witness stand (and, indeed, Judge Freedman's description of the courtroom layout makes clear that E.D. would not have had to face the petitioner directly even if she had testified from the witness stand). The significance of this circumstance is reinforced by Judge Freedman's specific finding that the petitioner had a sufficient view of E.D.'s \"demeanor.\" This finding is not clearly erroneous, and, thus, deserves our respect. <i>See Familia-Consoro,</i> 160 F.3d at 764-65; <i>McGill,</i> 11 F.3d at 225. Both of these factors tend to support the constitutionality of the special seating arrangement. <i>See Smith,</i> 8 S.W.3d at 537-38 (collecting cases); <i>Brockel,</i> 733 So.2d at 646.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a further effort to denigrate the use of the special seating arrangement, the petitioner notes the lack of eye contact between him and E.D. We agree that the opportunity for eye contact, whether or not the witness chooses to act on it, is an important integer in the Sixth Amendment calculus. <i>Coy,</i> 487 U.S. at 1019, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112146\"><a href=\"/opinion/112146/coy-v-iowa/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2798</span></a></span>. But a defendant does not have a constitutional right to force eye contact with his accuser, <i>id.,</i> and we refuse to fashion a bright-line rule that the lack of such an opportunity, in and of itself, automatically translates into a constitutional violation. Most other courts that have considered the question have reached a similar conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>E.g., Hoyt,</i> 806 P.2d at 210; <i>Ortiz,</i> 374 S.E.2d at 95-96. Moreover, some courts have found that the lack of an easy opportunity for eye contact is palliated to a sufficient degree by a seating arrangement such as the one employed in this case (which preserves the line of sight and allows a witness to turn to make eye contact with the defendant). <i>See California v. Sharp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255609\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255609/people-v-sharp/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Although the lack of eye contact weighs in the petitioner's favor, all the other Confrontation Clause safeguards were present here. Mindful, as we are, that trial judges have some leeway to move a witness around a courtroom as long as those shifts retain an unobstructed line of sight between the defendant and the witness, <i>cf. Coy,</i> 487 U.S. at 1023, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112146\"><a href=\"/opinion/112146/coy-v-iowa/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2798</span></a></span> (O'Connor, J., concurring) (suggesting that \"many such procedures may raise no substantial Confrontation Clause problem since they involve testimony in the presence of the defendant\"), we cannot say that Judge Freedman's core conclusion &#8212; that no Confrontation Clause violation occurred &#8212; was either unreasonable or obviously wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a further attempt to justify reconsideration, the petitioner submits that Judge Freedman erroneously denied him the assistance of counsel for his section 2255 petition. He argues, in effect, that his \"inartful\" pro se presentation before Judge Freedman may have influenced the court's rulings, freeing the successor judge to review them de novo. That argument is unavailing. A convicted criminal has no constitutional right to counsel with respect to habeas proceedings. <i>Pennsylvania v. Finley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111880\"><a href=\"/opinion/111880/pennsylvania-v-finley/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 555, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111880\"><a href=\"/opinion/111880/pennsylvania-v-finley/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span> (1987). It is true that the petitioner could not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim until collateral review, <i>see Knight,</i> 37 F.3d at 774; <i>United States v.

We fail to see how an adscititious ineffective assistance claim entitles a criminal defendant to the assistance of counsel on subsequent collateral review. <i>See Moran v. McDaniel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715824\"><a href=\"/opinion/715824/96-cal-daily-op-serv-2298-96-daily-journal-dar-3660-richard-allan/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span>, 1271 (9th Cir.1996); <i>see also Lattimore v.

Although we have indicated that, in certain circumstances, the appointment of counsel for a section 2255 petitioner might be warranted, such cases are few and far between. <i>See Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1063-64. The circumstances of the petitioner's case are not such as to demand the appointment of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> It follows that Judge Keeton could not reconsider a prior ruling merely because the presence of counsel might have produced new or better arguments. <i>United States v.
