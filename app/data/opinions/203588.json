Gleason on brief for petitioner.\n     Gregory G. Katsas Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nEmily Anne Radford, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, and Vanessa O. Lefort, Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n                        December 12, 2008\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.       The petitioner, Eduardo Muñoz-\n\nMonsalve, sees due process violations at every twist and turn.       We\n\ndistill his wide-ranging array of arguments into three claims of\n\nerror; namely: (i) that the immigration judge (IJ) failed to\n\ninitiate a competency hearing: (ii) that the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) incorrectly affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination:    and   (iii)   that     the   BIA   adjudicated    his\n\nadministrative appeal despite a gap in the administrative record.1\n\nDiscerning no merit in any of these claims, we deny the instant\n\npetition for judicial review.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The facts, which we draw mainly from the IJ's decision\n\nand the exhibits referenced herein, are uncomplicated.\n\n           The petitioner is a native and citizen of Colombia.       He\n\nwas apprehended while attempting to enter the United States, using\n\nhis brother's passport, in October of 2001. An immigration officer\n\ninterviewed him at the point of entry — a Miami airport.           In a\n\nsworn statement given to this interviewer, the petitioner stated\n\nthat his motivation for repairing to the United States was largely\n\neconomic; he had been out of work in his native land and wanted a\n\n\n     1\n       At various points in his brief, the petitioner seems to\nimply that he is contesting the agency's failure to grant\nwithholding of removal and/or relief under the United Nations\nConvention Against Torture. Because the petitioner has not set\nforth any developed argumentation anent these issues, we deem them\nwaived. See Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st Cir.\n2005). Thus, we make no further mention of either issue.\n\n                                -2-\n\fjob.   As an apparent aside, he also mentioned some vaguely defined\n\ntrouble with the National Liberation Army (ELN), a paramilitary\n\nguerilla   group.    According   to   country      reports    admitted     into\n\nevidence, the ELN exercised some significant control over parts of\n\nColombia notwithstanding the Colombian government's efforts to curb\n\nthe group's demonstrated penchant for violence.\n\n           Two days later, a different immigration officer conducted\n\na so-called \"credible fear\" interview.        During that session, the\n\npetitioner denied having an affiliation with any political faction,\n\ndescribing the ELN's interactions with him as attempted extortion\n\nthat came about after ELN members mined the records of the local\n\nChamber of Commerce in search of deep-pocket prospects.\n\n           Immigration   officials      referred    the      matter   to   the\n\nimmigration court.    Removal proceedings were instituted, and the\n\npetitioner cross-applied for asylum.\n\n           At a hearing held in November of 2005, the petitioner\n\ntold a new and different story.       He explained that he had been a\n\nLiberal Party activist in Colombia from 1991 forward.                 In that\n\ncapacity, he had spent his weekends campaigning year after year for\n\nvarious Liberal Party candidates.          His duties included making\n\nspeeches, handing out political t-shirts, counting votes, and\n\nmonitoring elections. He testified that, on two occasions in 1991,\n\nELN members directed him to curtail his political involvement and\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fordered him to give them money.          He paid off his tormentors but did\n\nnot forgo participation in partisan politics.\n\n            The petitioner further testified that his brother, a\n\nfellow Liberal Party member, was shot and killed in 1991.                      The\n\npetitioner witnessed the slaying.            He asserted that his family\n\nsubsequently received a letter from the ELN taking credit for the\n\nhomicide and linking it to the family's political activism.\n\n            The petitioner's grisly tale did not end there.              He said\n\nthat his brother-in-law was killed in 1993 — a killing that he also\n\nattributed to the ELN, citing his family's receipt of a letter to\n\nthat effect.\n\n            Notwithstanding these alleged maraudings, the petitioner\n\nrecounted   that   he    remained   in    Colombia    and    persisted    in   his\n\npolitical activities.         In 2001, however, he claimed to have been\n\nshot twice during a confrontation with the ELN.               He complained to\n\nboth the police and the army, but to no avail.              Shortly thereafter,\n\nhe fled to the United States.\n\n            The IJ considered the petitioner's testimony, the country\n\nreports, and other documentary evidence.             He emphasized the stark\n\ncontrast    between     the   petitioner's    hearing       testimony    and   the\n\npetitioner's earlier statements as well as the utter absence of any\n\nextrinsic evidence corroborating either the petitioner's political\n\ninvolvement or any politically-based problems with the ELN.                    On\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat basis, the IJ found the petitioner's testimony incredible,\n\ndenied his request for asylum, and ordered his removal.\n\n            The petitioner's attempt to appeal to the BIA was at\n\nfirst stymied because the administrative record had disappeared.\n\nWhen the record was located, the petitioner claimed that it was\n\nincomplete inasmuch as it did not contain the transcript of a\n\nmaster calendar conference, held on a date not specified by the\n\npetitioner, at which he purportedly appeared with a high fever and\n\nhanded the IJ notes from the emergency room records of a local\n\nhospital.   The petitioner described this conference as \"brief\" and\n\nacknowledged that the only business transacted was the rescheduling\n\nof the merits hearing.\n\n            Deeming   the   record    sufficiently   intact   to   permit\n\nintelligent review, the BIA overruled the petitioner's objection\n\nand processed his appeal.     In the end, it affirmed the IJ's ukase.\n\nThis timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\nII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            Following the filing of a petition for judicial review of\n\na final order of removal, this court typically reviews the decision\n\nof the BIA.   But when, as now, the BIA adopts portions of the IJ's\n\nopinion, we review those portions of the IJ's opinion as well.\n\nBebri v. Mukasey, 545 F.3d 47, 49-50(1st Cir. 2008); Romilus v.\n\nAshcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             Findings of fact, including credibility determinations,\n\nare reviewed under the familiar substantial evidence rubric. Under\n\nthis deferential formulation, contested findings will be upheld as\n\nlong   as    they   are   \"supported    by    reasonable,      substantial,    and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" Segran v.\n\nMukasey, 511 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).           This means that the agency's\n\ndetermination must stand unless the facts, taken in the aggregate,\n\n\"point[]     unerringly     in    the   opposite    direction,\"     Laurent    v.\n\nAshcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004), or \"compel[] a contrary\n\nconclusion,\" Segran, 511 F.3d at 5.                 Given these precepts, a\n\ncredibility determination will endure if and to the extent that the\n\nIJ   has    given   reasoned     consideration     to   the   evidence   and   has\n\nprovided a cogent explanation for his finding.                Chhay v. Gonzales,\n\n540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008); Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 87\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n             We review most legal questions, including the due process\n\nchallenges launched here, de novo.            See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999).           We accord deference, however, to\n\nthe agency's reasonable interpretations of statutes and regulations\n\nthat it administers.       See Segran, 511 F.3d at 5; see also Chevron\n\nU.S.A., Inc., v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n\n843-44 (1984).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           The petitioner's brief is not a model of clarity.           As\n\nbest we can tell, he appears to be making three basic claims of\n\nerror.   We address these claims sequentially.\n\n                           A.    Competency.\n\n           The petitioner's most loudly bruited claim is that his\n\nmental impairment was so obvious throughout the course of the\n\nproceedings that the IJ, acting sua sponte, should have initiated\n\na competency evaluation.    In the petitioner's view, this failure\n\ntransgressed the Due Process Clause.       We do not agree.\n\n           As a matter of background, it is important to recognize\n\nthat not every trial error sinks to the level of a due process\n\nviolation.    This   principle    has    special   relevance   in   asylum\n\nproceedings, in which the relief sought comprises a discretionary\n\ngrant by the Attorney General.    See Laurent, 359 F.3d at 61-62; see\n\nalso 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).     Aliens seeking asylum are entitled\n\nto basic procedural protections and to a fair hearing — but not to\n\na letter-perfect one.   See Puliser v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 311\n\n(1st Cir. 2008); Brue v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 1227, 1233 (10th Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           In this context, fundamental fairness means in general\n\nterms that the alien must have a meaningful opportunity to present\n\nevidence and be heard by an impartial judge.          See, e.g., Sok v.\n\nMukasey, 541 F.3d 43, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2008); Aguilar-Solis, 168\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fF.3d at 568-69.         In managing an asylum hearing, however, an IJ may\n\nwork within \"wide margins\" without \"offend[ing] the principle of\n\nfundamental fairness.\"          Laurent, 359 F.3d at 62.\n\n                An incompetent alien is entitled to additional procedural\n\nsafeguards to help ensure the realization of his due process right\n\nto a fundamentally fair hearing.                   As authorized by statute, 8\n\nU.S.C.      §    1229a(b)(3),    the     Attorney     General   has   promulgated\n\nregulations that spell out the additional rights of aliens who are\n\nhandicapped by mental incompetency.                   See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.4,\n\n1240.10(c).          As we shall explain, this case does not require us to\n\nprobe those regulations.2\n\n                Whether an alien is competent is a different question.\n\nThe petitioner here was represented by counsel — and in the first\n\ninstance, it is the advocate's role, not the IJ's, to broach the\n\nissue of mental competence.             See Brue, 464 F.3d at 1233; see also\n\nSok, 541 F.3d at 47-48. In this instance, the petitioner's counsel\n\nfailed to raise the issue of competency in the immigration court,\n\nnor   did       he   request   that    an    evaluation   of    the   petitioner's\n\ncompetency be undertaken.             The failure to raise a competency issue\n\nin a timely manner renders an ensuing claim of error particularly\n\nweak.     See Sok, 541 F.3d at 47-48.             Put another way, where as here\n\n\n\n      2\n       The petitioner hints that the statute and regulations are\ninadequate on their face. This argument is undeveloped and, hence,\nwaived. See Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 20 n.3 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                            -8-\n\fa petitioner fails to bring the possibility of incompetence to the\n\nattention of the immigration court, an IJ is not normally expected\n\nto initiate evaluative proceedings sua sponte. See id.\n\n          Of   course,    exceptional     circumstances    may    require\n\nextraordinary measures.    Here, however, the circumstances are not\n\nexceptional.    The   record   contains    no   significantly    probative\n\nevidence of any lack of competency on the petitioner's part.\n\nCertainly, the petitioner submitted none.        His plea for relief is\n\nfurther undercut because he did not ask the BIA to allow him to\n\nreopen to present new evidence of incompetency, nor did he make a\n\nproffer of what the new evidence might have shown.          Finally, he\n\ncontinues to refrain from offering any such enlightenment in this\n\nvenue.\n\n          When all is said and done, the petitioner's claim seems\n\nto rest entirely on the premise that his incompetence is evident\n\nfrom the record of the hearing.         We have scoured the record and\n\nfind that it belies the petitioner's premise.       Reading the hearing\n\ntranscript, the most that we could expect the IJ to have seen is\n\nthat, on a few isolated occasions, the petitioner stumbled over his\n\nanswers and that his statements, overall, were inconsistent with\n\nthose given during prior interviews.       In our view, these glitches\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fare more consistent with a prevaricating petitioner than with a\n\nmentally incompetent one.3\n\n           This leaves the bare assertions of the petitioner's\n\ncounsel.   Those assertions simply cannot carry the weight of a due\n\nprocess claim.    An attorney's conclusory statements regarding his\n\nclient's mental incompetence, proffered for the first time in an\n\nappellate brief, are not a substitute for proof.4\n\n           If   more   were   needed   —   and   we   doubt   that   it   is   —\n\nsucceeding on a due process claim would require a showing of\n\nprejudice; that is, a showing that the faulty practice prejudiced\n\nthe conduct of the hearing in some material way, such that it\n\naffected the outcome.     See Puliser, 524 F.3d at 311.         A petitioner\n\n\n     3\n       To be sure, the petitioner claimed to have been shot in\n2001, and his counsel alleges for the first time in his brief in\nthis court that the shooting resulted in a head wound. Even if\nthis is so — the hearing transcript itself is unclear on this point\n— that wound occurred years before and the record contains no link\nbetween the purported head wound and a subsequent mental\nimpairment. Furthermore, the petitioner testified that he suffered\nno lasting medical aftereffects from the shooting other than a\nslight hearing loss and occasional headaches. This symptomology\nalone is much too slender a reed on which to rest a claim of mental\nincompetence. Cf. Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(noting that complaints of pain and poor memory do not rise to the\nlevel of mental incompetence in an immigration case).\n     4\n       The petitioner's attorney claims to have been aware of his\nclient's incompetence but to have stood mute because the client\nwould have denied any impairment.      We refer counsel to the\nMassachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, R. 1.14: if an\nattorney who believes that his client's mental capacity is\ndiminished such that he is exposed to harm, cannot act in his own\ninterest, or cannot make an adequately considered decision\nregarding issues in his representation, his attorney should take\n\"reasonably necessary protective action.\"\n\n                                   -10-\n\fcan carry his burden only by a specific showing that the challenged\n\npractice likely affected the result of the hearing.                  See id.; see\n\nalso Teng v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 12, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                  In this case, it is unclear how the lack of a competency\n\nevaluation        could   have   prejudiced     the   petitioner's    substantial\n\nrights.       For one thing, there is nothing to indicate that the\n\npetitioner either is or would have been found to be incompetent.\n\nFor another thing, incompetency is not a basis for a grant of\n\nasylum,5 see Nee Hao Wong v. INS, 550 F.2d 521, 523 (9th Cir.\n\n1977), and there has been no showing that a guardian would have\n\nbeen       able    to   offer    proof   that   would   have   established   the\n\npetitioner's case.\n\n               That ends this aspect of the matter.             For aught that\n\nappears, the petitioner had the hearing that due process required.\n\nHe was represented by counsel, presented testimony and evidence,\n\nplainly understood the questions posed to him, and seems to have\n\nappreciated the consequences attendant to the hearing. As a matter\n\nof procedural due process, no more was exigible. See id.; Aguilar-\n\nSolis, 168 F.3d at 568-69.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       Indeed, incompetence may in certain circumstances constitute\na ground for either exclusion or removal of an alien. See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(1) (2008); see also Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st\nCir. 2000).\n\n                                         -11-\n\f                                B.   Credibility.\n\n            An applicant for asylum has the burden of proving that he\n\nis a refugee because of either past persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected\n\nground    such    as    race,   religion,        nationality,   membership     in   a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.                    See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).                Although an applicant's\n\ncredible testimony may be sufficient to carry his burden of proof,\n\nan IJ is entitled to evaluate the asylum-seeker's credibility and\n\nto   require     corroboration       of   self-serving    testimony     when   such\n\ncorroboration appears to be readily obtainable.                   See Chhay, 540\n\nF.3d at 6.       Material inconsistencies between an early immigration\n\ninterview and later testimony may form the basis for an adverse\n\ncredibility determination.           See, e.g., Bebri, 545 F.3d at 48; Pan,\n\n489 F.3d at 86.\n\n            To a large extent, determining credibility is a matter of\n\nsound judgment and common sense.                 Thus, when an alien's earlier\n\nstatements omit any mention of a particularly significant event or\n\ndatum, an IJ is justified — at least in the absence of a compelling\n\nexplanation — in doubting the petitioner's veracity.                    See, e.g.,\n\nSegran, 511 F.3d at 7.          After all, an alien's testimony \"need not\n\nbe taken at face value.\"         Bebri, 545 F.3d at 49 n.2.\n\n            We add, moreover, that an IJ is entitled to consider the\n\ncontext    and    the    totality    of    the    circumstances    in   evaluating\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fcredibility.       See id.     So too the IJ is warranted in weighing in\n\nthe    balance    the    existence    and   availability     of    corroborating\n\nevidence, and the effect of its non-production.                   See Chhay, 540\n\nF.3d at 6; Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nFinally, a credibility determination is not necessarily an all-or-\n\nnothing proposition; an IJ may choose to believe one part of an\n\nalien's testimony, disbelieve other parts, and accord different\n\nweight to different pieces of testimony.          See Chhay, 540 F.3d at 8.\n\n            Here, the petitioner tries to cloak this claim of error\n\nin the raiment of due process.         This masquerade does not alter the\n\nstandard of review. Although the petitioner uses the vocabulary of\n\ndue process, his attack, stripped to its bare essence, is on the\n\nIJ's factfinding.          As such, the substantial evidence standard\n\ngoverns.    See Pan, 489 F.3d at 84.\n\n            So viewed, the petitioner's claim fails. Merely weighing\n\nthe evidence in a way that is unfavorable to the petitioner's\n\ninterests is neither a violation of due process nor a badge of\n\nerror.    Chhay, 540 F.3d at 8.        Simply put, this is a case in which\n\nthe petitioner has told different tales at different times.                    In\n\nthat circumstance, a judge is entitled to \"sharply discount\" the\n\ntestimony.       Pan, 489 F.3d at 86; see Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427\n\nF.3d     115,    121    (1st   Cir.   2005).     And   the    utter     lack   of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fcorroboration, easily obtainable were the petitioner's tale true,6\n\nsupports the adverse credibility determination.\n\n            To    cinch    matters,    the    IJ    explained   his   reasoning\n\npersuasively and in great detail.            That explanation focused on the\n\npetitioner's failure to mention any of his supposedly \"extensive\"\n\npolitical     activities     in   either     of    his   original   immigration\n\ninterviews.      The IJ noted as well that the petitioner did not see\n\nfit to refer to the two murders of family members until the\n\nhearing. The IJ was understandably skeptical that the petitioner's\n\nfailure to report these important events earlier indicated recent\n\nfabrication.     See Segran, 511 F.3d at 7.          Finally, the IJ pointed\n\nto the petitioner's prior statement that he came to the United\n\nStates seeking work.       That was flatly inconsistent with his later\n\nclaim that he was fleeing persecution.\n\n            In sum, we find no reason to disturb the IJ's adverse\n\ncredibility determination.7           The record, fairly read, does not\n\ncompel a finding that the petitioner testified truthfully.                  It\n\n\n     6\n       For example, the petitioner could have produced the letters\nallegedly received by his family, the records of medical treatment\nincident to the supposed 2001 shooting, his party membership card,\nor the like.    He offered none of these documents.    His failure\neither to do so or to explain their absence speaks volumes about\nthe truthfulness of his testimony.\n     7\n       The petitioner's reliance on the country reports to support\nreversal is misplaced.    The inquiry here is not about the IJ's\nappreciation of the ELN's role generally but, rather, about whether\nthe petitioner himself was persecuted on the basis of his political\nopinion. In the particular circumstances of this case, the country\nreports do not shed any light on that question.\n\n                                      -14-\n\ffollows inexorably that the adverse credibility determination is\n\nbulwarked by substantial evidence.

The Missing Transcript.\n\n           The petitioner's last claim of error relates to the\n\nmissing transcript of the master calendar conference.                   This claim\n\nis jejune.\n\n           To comply with the demands of due process, hearing\n\ntranscripts need only be reasonably complete and accurate.                       See\n\nKheireddine v.

Indeed, the record of the hearing itself\n\nis complete in every particular.                The petitioner's remonstrance\n\nrelates   only    to    the    missing      transcript   of    a   brief   calendar\n\nconference, at which no evidence was taken.\n\n           The petitioner has provided a barebones outline of this\n\nobjection: his counsel makes a conclusory statement that the\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\femergency room notes would have had a bearing on the issue of\n\ncompetence.

Lefort, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief, for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Eduardo Muñoz-Monsalve, sees due process violations at every twist and turn. We distill his wide-ranging array of arguments into three claims of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> error; namely: (i) that the immigration judge (IJ) failed to initiate a competency hearing: (ii) that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) incorrectly affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility determination: and (iii) that the BIA adjudicated his administrative appeal despite a gap in the administrative record.<sup>[1]</sup> Discerning no merit in any of these claims, we deny the instant petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts, which we draw mainly from the IJ's decision and the exhibits referenced herein, are uncomplicated.</p>\n<p>The petitioner is a native and citizen of Colombia. He was apprehended while attempting to enter the United States, using his brother's passport, in October of 2001. An immigration officer interviewed him at the point of entry  a Miami airport. In a sworn statement given to this interviewer, the petitioner stated that his motivation for repairing to the United States was largely economic; he had been out of work in his native land and wanted a job. As an apparent aside, he also mentioned some vaguely defined trouble with the National Liberation Army (ELN), a paramilitary guerilla group. According to country reports admitted into evidence, the ELN exercised some significant control over parts of Colombia notwithstanding the Colombian government's efforts to curb the group's demonstrated penchant for violence.</p>\n<p>Two days later, a different immigration officer conducted a so-called \"credible fear\" interview. During that session, the petitioner denied having an affiliation with any political faction, describing the ELN's interactions with him as attempted extortion that came about after ELN members mined the records of the local Chamber of Commerce in search of deep-pocket prospects.</p>\n<p>Immigration officials referred the matter to the immigration court. Removal proceedings were instituted, and the petitioner cross-applied for asylum.</p>\n<p>At a hearing held in November of 2005, the petitioner told a new and different story. He explained that he had been a Liberal Party activist in Colombia from 1991 forward. In that capacity, he had spent his weekends campaigning year after year for various Liberal Party candidates. His duties included making speeches, handing out political t-shirts, counting votes, and monitoring elections. He testified that, on two occasions in 1991, ELN members directed him to curtail his political involvement and ordered him to give them money. He paid off his tormentors but did not forgo participation in partisan politics.</p>\n<p>The petitioner further testified that his brother, a fellow Liberal Party member, was shot and killed in 1991. The petitioner witnessed the slaying. He asserted that his family subsequently received a letter from the ELN taking credit for the homicide and linking it to the family's political activism.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's grisly tale did not end there. He said that his brother-in-law was killed in 1993  a killing that he also attributed to the ELN, citing his family's receipt of a letter to that effect.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these alleged maraudings, the petitioner recounted that he remained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> in Colombia and persisted in his political activities. In 2001, however, he claimed to have been shot twice during a confrontation with the ELN. He complained to both the police and the army, but to no avail. Shortly thereafter, he fled to the United States.</p>\n<p>The IJ considered the petitioner's testimony, the country reports, and other documentary evidence. He emphasized the stark contrast between the petitioner's hearing testimony and the petitioner's earlier statements as well as the utter absence of any extrinsic evidence corroborating either the petitioner's political involvement or any politically-based problems with the ELN. On that basis, the IJ found the petitioner's testimony incredible, denied his request for asylum, and ordered his removal.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's attempt to appeal to the BIA was at first stymied because the administrative record had disappeared. When the record was located, the petitioner claimed that it was incomplete inasmuch as it did not contain the transcript of a master calendar conference, held on a date not specified by the petitioner, at which he purportedly appeared with a high fever and handed the IJ notes from the emergency room records of a local hospital. The petitioner described this conference as \"brief\" and acknowledged that the only business transacted was the rescheduling of the merits hearing.</p>\n<p>Deeming the record sufficiently intact to permit intelligent review, the BIA overruled the petitioner's objection and processed his appeal. In the end, it affirmed the IJ's ukase. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>Following the filing of a petition for judicial review of a final order of removal, this court typically reviews the decision of the BIA. But when, as now, the BIA adopts portions of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of the IJ's opinion as well. <i>Bebri v. Mukasey,</i> 545 F.3d 47, 49-50(1st Cir.2008); <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Findings of fact, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under the familiar substantial evidence rubric. Under this deferential formulation, contested findings will be upheld as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Segran v. Mukasey,</i> 511 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). This means that the agency's determination must stand unless the facts, taken in the aggregate, \"point[ ] unerringly in the opposite direction,\" <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2004), or \"compel[ ] a contrary conclusion,\" <i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 5. Given these precepts, a credibility determination will endure if and to the extent that the IJ has given reasoned consideration to the evidence and has provided a cogent explanation for his finding. <i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We review most legal questions, including the due process challenges launched here, de novo. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir.1999). We accord deference, however, to the agency's reasonable interpretations of statutes and regulations that it administers. <i>See </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 5; <i>see also </i><i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc., v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The petitioner's brief is not a model of clarity. As best we can tell, he appears to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> be making three basic claims of error. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Competency.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The petitioner's most loudly bruited claim is that his mental impairment was so obvious throughout the course of the proceedings that the IJ, acting sua sponte, should have initiated a competency evaluation. In the petitioner's view, this failure transgressed the Due Process Clause. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>As a matter of background, it is important to recognize that not every trial error sinks to the level of a due process violation. This principle has special relevance in asylum proceedings, in which the relief sought comprises a discretionary grant by the Attorney General. <i>See </i><i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 61-62; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). Aliens seeking asylum are entitled to basic procedural protections and to a fair hearing  but not to a letter-perfect one. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> 524 F.3d 302, 311 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Brue v. Gonzales,</i> 464 F.3d 1227, 1233 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>In this context, fundamental fairness means in general terms that the alien must have a meaningful opportunity to present evidence and be heard by an impartial judge. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> 541 F.3d 43, 47-48 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 568-69. In managing an asylum hearing, however, an IJ may work within \"wide margins\" without \"offend[ing] the principle of fundamental fairness.\" <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 62.</p>\n<p>An incompetent alien is entitled to additional procedural safeguards to help ensure the realization of his due process right to a fundamentally fair hearing. As authorized by statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(3), the Attorney General has promulgated regulations that spell out the additional rights of aliens who are handicapped by mental incompetency. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.4, 1240.10(c). As we shall explain, this case does not require us to probe those regulations.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Whether an alien is competent is a different question. The petitioner here was represented by counsel  and in the first instance, it is the advocate's role, not the IJ's, to broach the issue of mental competence. <i>See </i><i>Brue,</i> 464 F.3d at 1233; <i>see also </i><i>Sok,</i> 541 F.3d at 47-48. In this instance, the petitioner's counsel failed to raise the issue of competency in the immigration court, nor did he request that an evaluation of the petitioner's competency be undertaken. The failure to raise a competency issue in a timely manner renders an ensuing claim of error particularly weak. <i>See </i><i>Sok,</i> 541 F.3d at 47-48. Put another way, where as here a petitioner fails to bring the possibility of incompetence to the attention of the immigration court, an IJ is not normally expected to initiate evaluative proceedings sua sponte. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Of course, exceptional circumstances may require extraordinary measures. Here, however, the circumstances are not exceptional. The record contains no significantly probative evidence of any lack of competency on the petitioner's part. Certainly, the petitioner submitted none. His plea for relief is further undercut because he did not ask the BIA to allow him to reopen to present new evidence of incompetency, nor did he make a proffer of what the new evidence might have shown. Finally, he continues to refrain from offering any such enlightenment in this venue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> When all is said and done, the petitioner's claim seems to rest entirely on the premise that his incompetence is evident from the record of the hearing. We have scoured the record and find that it belies the petitioner's premise. Reading the hearing transcript, the most that we could expect the IJ to have seen is that, on a few isolated occasions, the petitioner stumbled over his answers and that his statements, overall, were inconsistent with those given during prior interviews. In our view, these glitches are more consistent with a prevaricating petitioner than with a mentally incompetent one.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>This leaves the bare assertions of the petitioner's counsel. Those assertions simply cannot carry the weight of a due process claim. An attorney's conclusory statements regarding his client's mental incompetence, proffered for the first time in an appellate brief, are not a substitute for proof.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we doubt that it is  succeeding on a due process claim would require a showing of prejudice; that is, a showing that the faulty practice prejudiced the conduct of the hearing in some material way, such that it affected the outcome. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311. A petitioner can carry his burden only by a specific showing that the challenged practice likely affected the result of the hearing. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Teng v. Mukasey,</i> 516 F.3d 12, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>In this case, it is unclear how the lack of a competency evaluation could have prejudiced the petitioner's substantial rights. For one thing, there is nothing to indicate that the petitioner either is or would have been found to be incompetent. For another thing, incompetency is not a basis for a grant of asylum,<sup>[5]</sup><i>see </i><i>Nee Hao Wong v. INS,</i> 550 F.2d 521, 523 (9th Cir. 1977), and there has been no showing that a guardian would have been able to offer proof that would have established the petitioner's case.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. For aught that appears, the petitioner had the hearing that due process required. He was represented by counsel, presented testimony and evidence, plainly understood the questions posed to him, and seems to have appreciated the consequences attendant to the hearing. As a matter of procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> due process, no more was exigible. <i>See id.; </i><i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 568-69.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Credibility.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An applicant for asylum has the burden of proving that he is a refugee because of either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground such as race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2). Although an applicant's credible testimony may be sufficient to carry his burden of proof, an IJ is entitled to evaluate the asylum-seeker's credibility and to require corroboration of self-serving testimony when such corroboration appears to be readily obtainable. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 6. Material inconsistencies between an early immigration interview and later testimony may form the basis for an adverse credibility determination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bebri,</i> 545 F.3d at 48; <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86.</p>\n<p>To a large extent, determining credibility is a matter of sound judgment and common sense. Thus, when an alien's earlier statements omit any mention of a particularly significant event or datum, an IJ is justified  at least in the absence of a compelling explanation  in doubting the petitioner's veracity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 7. After all, an alien's testimony \"need not be taken at face value.\" <i>Bebri,</i> 545 F.3d at 49 n. 2.</p>\n<p>We add, moreover, that an IJ is entitled to consider the context and the totality of the circumstances in evaluating credibility. <i>See id.</i> So too the IJ is warranted in weighing in the balance the existence and availability of corroborating evidence, and the effect of its non-production. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 6; <i>Kho v. Keisler,</i> 505 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir.2007). Finally, a credibility determination is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition; an IJ may choose to believe one part of an alien's testimony, disbelieve other parts, and accord different weight to different pieces of testimony. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>Here, the petitioner tries to cloak this claim of error in the raiment of due process. This masquerade does not alter the standard of review. Although the petitioner uses the vocabulary of due process, his attack, stripped to its bare essence, is on the IJ's factfinding. As such, the substantial evidence standard governs. <i>See </i><i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p>So viewed, the petitioner's claim fails. Merely weighing the evidence in a way that is unfavorable to the petitioner's interests is neither a violation of due process nor a badge of error. <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 8. Simply put, this is a case in which the petitioner has told different tales at different times. In that circumstance, a judge is entitled to \"sharply discount\" the testimony. <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86; <i>see </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2005). And the utter lack of corroboration, easily obtainable were the petitioner's tale true,<sup>[6]</sup> supports the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the IJ explained his reasoning persuasively and in great detail. That explanation focused on the petitioner's failure to mention any of his supposedly \"extensive\" political activities in either of his original immigration interviews. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> The IJ noted as well that the petitioner did not see fit to refer to the two murders of family members until the hearing. The IJ was understandably skeptical that the petitioner's failure to report these important events earlier indicated recent fabrication. <i>See </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 7. Finally, the IJ pointed to the petitioner's prior statement that he came to the United States seeking work. That was flatly inconsistent with his later claim that he was fleeing persecution.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find no reason to disturb the IJ's adverse credibility determination.<sup>[7]</sup> The record, fairly read, does not compel a finding that the petitioner testified truthfully. It follows inexorably that the adverse credibility determination is bulwarked by substantial evidence. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 571.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Missing Transcript.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The petitioner's last claim of error relates to the missing transcript of the master calendar conference. This claim is jejune.</p>\n<p>To comply with the demands of due process, hearing transcripts need only be reasonably complete and accurate. <i>See </i><i>Kheireddine v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 80, 84-85 (1st Cir.2005). To make out a due process violation based on gaps in the record, then, a petitioner must show at a bare minimum that the gaps relate to matters material to his case and that the absence of missing transcripts is prejudicial. <i>See id.</i> Simply showing an imperfection in the record is not enough; the complaining party must show specific prejudice materially affecting his ability to obtain meaningful review. <i>Teng,</i> 516 F.3d at 17.</p>\n<p>Here, the record of the immigration proceeding is substantially complete. Indeed, the record of the hearing itself is complete in every particular. The petitioner's remonstrance relates only to the missing transcript of a brief calendar conference, at which no evidence was taken.</p>\n<p>The petitioner has provided a barebones outline of this objection: his counsel makes a conclusory statement that the emergency room notes would have had a bearing on the issue of competence. But he fails plausibly to explain how or why that is so.</p>\n<p>In any event, the law is pellucid that if a missing transcript reasonably could be recreated by the complaining party, its absence is not prejudicial. <i>See </i><i>Kheireddine,</i> 427 F.3d at 86. This is such a case. The original emergency room record presumably still exists, yet the petitioner made no effort before the BIA (or before us, for that matter) either to produce that record or to explain why it is not available. Because it would have been child's play simply to resubmit these notes, this claim of error founders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the BIA's decision.</p>\n<p><i>The petition for review is denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At various points in his brief, the petitioner seems to imply that he is contesting the agency's failure to grant withholding of removal and/or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Because the petitioner has not set forth any developed argumentation anent these issues, we deem them waived. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, we make no further mention of either issue.</p>\n<p>[2]  The petitioner hints that the statute and regulations are inadequate on their face. This argument is undeveloped and, hence, waived. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  To be sure, the petitioner claimed to have been shot in 2001, and his counsel alleges for the first time in his brief in this court that the shooting resulted in a head wound. Even if this is so  the hearing transcript itself is unclear on this point  that wound occurred years before and the record contains no link between the purported head wound and a subsequent mental impairment. Furthermore, the petitioner testified that he suffered no lasting medical aftereffects from the shooting other than a slight hearing loss and occasional headaches. This symptomology alone is much too slender a reed on which to rest a claim of mental incompetence. <i>Cf. </i><i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that complaints of pain and poor memory do not rise to the level of mental incompetence in an immigration case).</p>\n<p>[4]  The petitioner's attorney claims to have been aware of his client's incompetence but to have stood mute because the client would have denied any impairment. We refer counsel to the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, R. 1.14: if an attorney who believes that his client's mental capacity is diminished such that he is exposed to harm, cannot act in his own interest, or cannot make an adequately considered decision regarding issues in his representation, his attorney should take \"reasonably necessary protective action.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, incompetence may in certain circumstances constitute a ground for either exclusion or removal of an alien. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1) (2008); <i>see also </i><i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, the petitioner could have produced the letters allegedly received by his family, the records of medical treatment incident to the supposed 2001 shooting, his party membership card, or the like. He offered none of these documents. His failure either to do so or to explain their absence speaks volumes about the truthfulness of his testimony.</p>\n<p>[7]  The petitioner's reliance on the country reports to support reversal is misplaced. The inquiry here is not about the IJ's appreciation of the ELN's role generally but, rather, about whether the petitioner himself was persecuted on the basis of his political opinion. In the particular circumstances of this case, the country reports do not shed any light on that question.</p>\n\n</div>",

We distill his wide-ranging array of arguments into three claims of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> error; namely: (i) that the immigration judge (IJ) failed to initiate a competency hearing: (ii) that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) incorrectly affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility determination: and (iii) that the BIA adjudicated his administrative appeal despite a gap in the administrative record.<sup>[1]</sup> Discerning no merit in any of these claims, we deny the instant petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts, which we draw mainly from the IJ's decision and the exhibits referenced herein, are uncomplicated.</p>\n<p>The petitioner is a native and citizen of Colombia. He was apprehended while attempting to enter the United States, using his brother's passport, in October of 2001. An immigration officer interviewed him at the point of entry  a Miami airport. In a sworn statement given to this interviewer, the petitioner stated that his motivation for repairing to the United States was largely economic; he had been out of work in his native land and wanted a job. As an apparent aside, he also mentioned some vaguely defined trouble with the National Liberation Army (ELN), a paramilitary guerilla group. According to country reports admitted into evidence, the ELN exercised some significant control over parts of Colombia notwithstanding the Colombian government's efforts to curb the group's demonstrated penchant for violence.</p>\n<p>Two days later, a different immigration officer conducted a so-called \"credible fear\" interview. During that session, the petitioner denied having an affiliation with any political faction, describing the ELN's interactions with him as attempted extortion that came about after ELN members mined the records of the local Chamber of Commerce in search of deep-pocket prospects.</p>\n<p>Immigration officials referred the matter to the immigration court. Removal proceedings were instituted, and the petitioner cross-applied for asylum.</p>\n<p>At a hearing held in November of 2005, the petitioner told a new and different story. He explained that he had been a Liberal Party activist in Colombia from 1991 forward. In that capacity, he had spent his weekends campaigning year after year for various Liberal Party candidates. His duties included making speeches, handing out political t-shirts, counting votes, and monitoring elections. He testified that, on two occasions in 1991, ELN members directed him to curtail his political involvement and ordered him to give them money. He paid off his tormentors but did not forgo participation in partisan politics.</p>\n<p>The petitioner further testified that his brother, a fellow Liberal Party member, was shot and killed in 1991. The petitioner witnessed the slaying. He asserted that his family subsequently received a letter from the ELN taking credit for the homicide and linking it to the family's political activism.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's grisly tale did not end there. He said that his brother-in-law was killed in 1993  a killing that he also attributed to the ELN, citing his family's receipt of a letter to that effect.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these alleged maraudings, the petitioner recounted that he remained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> in Colombia and persisted in his political activities. In 2001, however, he claimed to have been shot twice during a confrontation with the ELN. He complained to both the police and the army, but to no avail. Shortly thereafter, he fled to the United States.</p>\n<p>The IJ considered the petitioner's testimony, the country reports, and other documentary evidence. He emphasized the stark contrast between the petitioner's hearing testimony and the petitioner's earlier statements as well as the utter absence of any extrinsic evidence corroborating either the petitioner's political involvement or any politically-based problems with the ELN. On that basis, the IJ found the petitioner's testimony incredible, denied his request for asylum, and ordered his removal.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's attempt to appeal to the BIA was at first stymied because the administrative record had disappeared. When the record was located, the petitioner claimed that it was incomplete inasmuch as it did not contain the transcript of a master calendar conference, held on a date not specified by the petitioner, at which he purportedly appeared with a high fever and handed the IJ notes from the emergency room records of a local hospital. The petitioner described this conference as \"brief\" and acknowledged that the only business transacted was the rescheduling of the merits hearing.</p>\n<p>Deeming the record sufficiently intact to permit intelligent review, the BIA overruled the petitioner's objection and processed his appeal. In the end, it affirmed the IJ's ukase. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>Following the filing of a petition for judicial review of a final order of removal, this court typically reviews the decision of the BIA. But when, as now, the BIA adopts portions of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of the IJ's opinion as well. <i>Bebri v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The petitioner's brief is not a model of clarity. As best we can tell, he appears to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> be making three basic claims of error. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Competency.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The petitioner's most loudly bruited claim is that his mental impairment was so obvious throughout the course of the proceedings that the IJ, acting sua sponte, should have initiated a competency evaluation. In the petitioner's view, this failure transgressed the Due Process Clause. We do not agree.</p>\n<p>As a matter of background, it is important to recognize that not every trial error sinks to the level of a due process violation. This principle has special relevance in asylum proceedings, in which the relief sought comprises a discretionary grant by the Attorney General. <i>See </i><i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 61-62; <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). Aliens seeking asylum are entitled to basic procedural protections and to a fair hearing  but not to a letter-perfect one. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203272\"><a href=\"/opinion/203272/pulisir-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 311 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Brue v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168199\"><a href=\"/opinion/168199/brue-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1233 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>In this context, fundamental fairness means in general terms that the alien must have a meaningful opportunity to present evidence and be heard by an impartial judge. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203476\"><a href=\"/opinion/203476/sok-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 47-48 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 568-69. In managing an asylum hearing, however, an IJ may work within \"wide margins\" without \"offend[ing] the principle of fundamental fairness.\" <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 62.</p>\n<p>An incompetent alien is entitled to additional procedural safeguards to help ensure the realization of his due process right to a fundamentally fair hearing. As authorized by statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(3), the Attorney General has promulgated regulations that spell out the additional rights of aliens who are handicapped by mental incompetency. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.4, 1240.10(c). As we shall explain, this case does not require us to probe those regulations.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Whether an alien is competent is a different question. The petitioner here was represented by counsel  and in the first instance, it is the advocate's role, not the IJ's, to broach the issue of mental competence. <i>See </i><i>Brue,</i> 464 F.3d at 1233; <i>see also </i><i>Sok,</i> 541 F.3d at 47-48. In this instance, the petitioner's counsel failed to raise the issue of competency in the immigration court, nor did he request that an evaluation of the petitioner's competency be undertaken. The failure to raise a competency issue in a timely manner renders an ensuing claim of error particularly weak. <i>See </i><i>Sok,</i> 541 F.3d at 47-48. Put another way, where as here a petitioner fails to bring the possibility of incompetence to the attention of the immigration court, an IJ is not normally expected to initiate evaluative proceedings sua sponte. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>Of course, exceptional circumstances may require extraordinary measures. Here, however, the circumstances are not exceptional. The record contains no significantly probative evidence of any lack of competency on the petitioner's part. Certainly, the petitioner submitted none. His plea for relief is further undercut because he did not ask the BIA to allow him to reopen to present new evidence of incompetency, nor did he make a proffer of what the new evidence might have shown. Finally, he continues to refrain from offering any such enlightenment in this venue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> When all is said and done, the petitioner's claim seems to rest entirely on the premise that his incompetence is evident from the record of the hearing. We have scoured the record and find that it belies the petitioner's premise. Reading the hearing transcript, the most that we could expect the IJ to have seen is that, on a few isolated occasions, the petitioner stumbled over his answers and that his statements, overall, were inconsistent with those given during prior interviews. In our view, these glitches are more consistent with a prevaricating petitioner than with a mentally incompetent one.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>This leaves the bare assertions of the petitioner's counsel. Those assertions simply cannot carry the weight of a due process claim. An attorney's conclusory statements regarding his client's mental incompetence, proffered for the first time in an appellate brief, are not a substitute for proof.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we doubt that it is  succeeding on a due process claim would require a showing of prejudice; that is, a showing that the faulty practice prejudiced the conduct of the hearing in some material way, such that it affected the outcome. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311. A petitioner can carry his burden only by a specific showing that the challenged practice likely affected the result of the hearing. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Teng v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203153\"><a href=\"/opinion/203153/teng-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>In this case, it is unclear how the lack of a competency evaluation could have prejudiced the petitioner's substantial rights. For one thing, there is nothing to indicate that the petitioner either is or would have been found to be incompetent. For another thing, incompetency is not a basis for a grant of asylum,<sup>[5]</sup><i>see </i><i>Nee Hao Wong v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343356\"><a href=\"/opinion/343356/howard-nee-hao-wong-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span>, 523 (9th Cir. 1977), and there has been no showing that a guardian would have been able to offer proof that would have established the petitioner's case.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. For aught that appears, the petitioner had the hearing that due process required. He was represented by counsel, presented testimony and evidence, plainly understood the questions posed to him, and seems to have appreciated the consequences attendant to the hearing. As a matter of procedural <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> due process, no more was exigible. <i>See id.; </i><i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 568-69.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Credibility.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An applicant for asylum has the burden of proving that he is a refugee because of either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground such as race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2). Although an applicant's credible testimony may be sufficient to carry his burden of proof, an IJ is entitled to evaluate the asylum-seeker's credibility and to require corroboration of self-serving testimony when such corroboration appears to be readily obtainable. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 6. Material inconsistencies between an early immigration interview and later testimony may form the basis for an adverse credibility determination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bebri,</i> 545 F.3d at 48; <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86.</p>\n<p>To a large extent, determining credibility is a matter of sound judgment and common sense. Thus, when an alien's earlier statements omit any mention of a particularly significant event or datum, an IJ is justified  at least in the absence of a compelling explanation  in doubting the petitioner's veracity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 7. After all, an alien's testimony \"need not be taken at face value.\" <i>Bebri,</i> 545 F.3d at 49 n. 2.</p>\n<p>We add, moreover, that an IJ is entitled to consider the context and the totality of the circumstances in evaluating credibility. <i>See id.</i> So too the IJ is warranted in weighing in the balance the existence and availability of corroborating evidence, and the effect of its non-production. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 6; <i>Kho v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202978\"><a href=\"/opinion/202978/kho-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2007). Finally, a credibility determination is not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition; an IJ may choose to believe one part of an alien's testimony, disbelieve other parts, and accord different weight to different pieces of testimony. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>Here, the petitioner tries to cloak this claim of error in the raiment of due process. This masquerade does not alter the standard of review. Although the petitioner uses the vocabulary of due process, his attack, stripped to its bare essence, is on the IJ's factfinding. As such, the substantial evidence standard governs. <i>See </i><i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p>So viewed, the petitioner's claim fails. Merely weighing the evidence in a way that is unfavorable to the petitioner's interests is neither a violation of due process nor a badge of error. <i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 8. Simply put, this is a case in which the petitioner has told different tales at different times. In that circumstance, a judge is entitled to \"sharply discount\" the testimony. <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86; <i>see </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 121 (1st Cir.2005). And the utter lack of corroboration, easily obtainable were the petitioner's tale true,<sup>[6]</sup> supports the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the IJ explained his reasoning persuasively and in great detail. That explanation focused on the petitioner's failure to mention any of his supposedly \"extensive\" political activities in either of his original immigration interviews. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> The IJ noted as well that the petitioner did not see fit to refer to the two murders of family members until the hearing. The IJ was understandably skeptical that the petitioner's failure to report these important events earlier indicated recent fabrication. <i>See </i><i>Segran,</i> 511 F.3d at 7. Finally, the IJ pointed to the petitioner's prior statement that he came to the United States seeking work. That was flatly inconsistent with his later claim that he was fleeing persecution.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find no reason to disturb the IJ's adverse credibility determination.<sup>[7]</sup> The record, fairly read, does not compel a finding that the petitioner testified truthfully. It follows inexorably that the adverse credibility determination is bulwarked by substantial evidence. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 571.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The Missing Transcript.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The petitioner's last claim of error relates to the missing transcript of the master calendar conference. This claim is jejune.</p>\n<p>To comply with the demands of due process, hearing transcripts need only be reasonably complete and accurate. <i>See </i><i>Kheireddine v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201881\"><a href=\"/opinion/201881/kheireddine-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84-85 (1st Cir.2005). To make out a due process violation based on gaps in the record, then, a petitioner must show at a bare minimum that the gaps relate to matters material to his case and that the absence of missing transcripts is prejudicial. <i>See id.</i> Simply showing an imperfection in the record is not enough; the complaining party must show specific prejudice materially affecting his ability to obtain meaningful review. <i>Teng,</i> 516 F.3d at 17.</p>\n<p>Here, the record of the immigration proceeding is substantially complete. Indeed, the record of the hearing itself is complete in every particular. The petitioner's remonstrance relates only to the missing transcript of a brief calendar conference, at which no evidence was taken.</p>\n<p>The petitioner has provided a barebones outline of this objection: his counsel makes a conclusory statement that the emergency room notes would have had a bearing on the issue of competence. But he fails plausibly to explain how or why that is so.</p>\n<p>In any event, the law is pellucid that if a missing transcript reasonably could be recreated by the complaining party, its absence is not prejudicial. <i>See </i><i>Kheireddine,</i> 427 F.3d at 86. This is such a case. The original emergency room record presumably still exists, yet the petitioner made no effort before the BIA (or before us, for that matter) either to produce that record or to explain why it is not available. Because it would have been child's play simply to resubmit these notes, this claim of error founders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we uphold the BIA's decision.</p>\n<p><i>The petition for review is denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  At various points in his brief, the petitioner seems to imply that he is contesting the agency's failure to grant withholding of removal and/or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Because the petitioner has not set forth any developed argumentation anent these issues, we deem them waived. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, we make no further mention of either issue.</p>\n<p>[2]  The petitioner hints that the statute and regulations are inadequate on their face. This argument is undeveloped and, hence, waived. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>[3]  To be sure, the petitioner claimed to have been shot in 2001, and his counsel alleges for the first time in his brief in this court that the shooting resulted in a head wound. Even if this is so  the hearing transcript itself is unclear on this point  that wound occurred years before and the record contains no link between the purported head wound and a subsequent mental impairment. Furthermore, the petitioner testified that he suffered no lasting medical aftereffects from the shooting other than a slight hearing loss and occasional headaches. This symptomology alone is much too slender a reed on which to rest a claim of mental incompetence. <i>Cf. </i><i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 262 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that complaints of pain and poor memory do not rise to the level of mental incompetence in an immigration case).</p>\n<p>[4]  The petitioner's attorney claims to have been aware of his client's incompetence but to have stood mute because the client would have denied any impairment. We refer counsel to the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, R. 1.14: if an attorney who believes that his client's mental capacity is diminished such that he is exposed to harm, cannot act in his own interest, or cannot make an adequately considered decision regarding issues in his representation, his attorney should take \"reasonably necessary protective action.\"</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, incompetence may in certain circumstances constitute a ground for either exclusion or removal of an alien. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1) (2008); <i>see also </i><i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 262 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, the petitioner could have produced the letters allegedly received by his family, the records of medical treatment incident to the supposed 2001 shooting, his party membership card, or the like. He offered none of these documents. His failure either to do so or to explain their absence speaks volumes about the truthfulness of his testimony.</p>\n<p>[7]  The petitioner's reliance on the country reports to support reversal is misplaced. The inquiry here is not about the IJ's appreciation of the ELN's role generally but, rather, about whether the petitioner himself was persecuted on the basis of his political opinion. In the particular circumstances of this case, the country reports do not shed any light on that question.</p>\n\n</div>",
