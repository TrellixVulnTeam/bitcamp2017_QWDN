Rafael   Baella-Silva,     Laura\n\nCaruncho-Marcano, and the Conjugal Partnership Baella-Caruncho\n\n(collectively \"Baella-Silva\") appeal the district court's judgment\n\nassessing liquidated damages and an additional monetary sanction\n\nagainst Baella-Silva.\n\n     The sanctions order at issue here was entered after the\n\ndistrict court determined that Baella-Silva had breached a prior\n\nsettlement agreement which had been completely incorporated into\n\nthe district court's earlier dismissal judgment.               The settlement\n\nresolved a dispute concerning the allocation of attorneys' fees\n\nbetween Rafael Baella-Silva, an attorney, and the Hulsey Litigation\n\nGroup, LLC, including attorneys Paul H. Hulsey and Cherie K. Durand\n\n(collectively \"Hulsey\").\n\n     The   fee   dispute   arose    over   an    award   of   attorneys'    fees\n\nresulting from their joint efforts in representing a Puerto Rican\n\ncompany, Palmas del Sol, S.E., in litigation against United States\n\nFidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&G) (hereinafter referred to as\n\n\"the USF&G litigation\").      Baella-Silva began as the lead attorney\n\nfor Palmas del Sol, but when the USF&G litigation was removed to\n\nfederal court, he retained the aid of the Hulsey Group.                  Later,\n\nBaella-Silva completely withdrew from the case, but before his\n\nwithdrawal, he secured an agreement for his accrued fees.                In the\n\narrangement, Hulsey agreed to remit to Baella-Silva a certain\n\npercentage of any attorneys' fees awarded in the USF&G litigation.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fThe USF&G litigation produced a settlement in favor of Palmas del\n\nSol, triggering the attorneys' contingent fee arrangement with\n\ntheir client.\n\n     Baella-Silva filed this breach of contract action in the local\n\ncourt of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on September 2, 2004,\n\nalleging that Hulsey had refused to pay him the agreed upon\n\npercentage of the contingent fee.       On September 10, 2004, Hulsey\n\nremoved the case to federal court, asserting the existence of\n\ncomplete   diversity   between   the   real   parties    in   interest   for\n\npurposes of federal jurisdiction.       Hulsey simultaneously asserted\n\nthat although nondiverse parties appear in the caption, they had\n\nbeen fraudulently joined by Baella-Silva in an attempt to defeat\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.\n\n     Baella-Silva opposed the removal and requested that the case\n\nbe remanded back to the Commonwealth court due to a lack of\n\ncomplete diversity.    USF&G deposited the disputed funds with the\n\nclerk of court.   The district court held a hearing on the motion to\n\nremand on Friday, October 1, 2004, but did not rule on the motion\n\nbecause the parties entered into a settlement agreement concerning\n\nthe attorneys' fee litigation on the same day.          The district court\n\nincorporated the settlement into its judgment (hereinafter \"the\n\nsettlement judgment\") and filed it under seal.\n\n     The settlement judgment resolved the attorneys' fee issue by\n\nawarding a specified sum to Baella-Silva and allocating to Hulsey\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthe remainder of the amount deposited with the clerk.                In addition\n\nto settling the fee dispute, the settlement judgment included a\n\nconfidentiality clause providing for liquidated damages in the\n\namount of $50,000 in the event either party disclosed the terms of\n\nthe settlement agreement, and Baella-Silva expressly relinquished\n\nall claims against his former client, Palmas del Sol, and its\n\npartners relating to the USF&G litigation and agreed to have no\n\ncontact with anyone working for or on behalf of Hulsey, Palmas del\n\nSol, or its partners.           The settlement judgment states that all\n\nparties agree to accept the district court's jurisdiction and that\n\nthe district court \"shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms\n\nof this [a]greement.\"          No party appealed the settlement judgment.\n\n     On   the      following    Monday,     October   4,   2004,    Baella-Silva\n\nelectronically filed on the federal district court's public docket\n\na motion for disbursement of funds, which disclosed some of the\n\ndetails of the sealed settlement judgment. Baella-Silva also filed\n\ntwo lawsuits in the local Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol\n\nand its individual partners for amounts allegedly owed to him.\n\nHulsey immediately filed a motion to suspend disbursement of all\n\nfunds   and   to    impose     sanctions,    asserting     that   Baella-Silva's\n\nactions breached the express terms of the settlement judgment by\n\ndisclosing its confidential terms as well as by suing and harassing\n\nPalmas del Sol and its partners.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f      Following a hearing, the district court entered a sanctions\n\norder on December 22, 2004, concluding that Baella-Silva had\n\nbreached the confidentiality clause by filing the motion for\n\ndisbursement electronically, where it was posted live on the\n\nclerk's   public   docket    for    approximately          one   hour   before    he\n\nrequested the clerk to seal the motion.                 Accordingly, the court\n\nentered judgment against Baella-Silva in the amount of $50,000 for\n\nliquidated damages as set forth in the settlement judgment.                      The\n\ndistrict court also found that Baella-Silva had breached the\n\nsettlement judgment a second time by filing two separate lawsuits\n\nagainst Palmas del Sol and its individual partners, seeking damages\n\ntotaling $20,320.       The district court assessed an additional\n\nsanction of $20,320 for this breach.                 The district court denied\n\nBaella-Silva's     motion   to    reconsider,        and   Baella-Silva    timely\n\nappealed the district court's sanctions order.\n\n      On appeal, Baella-Silva argues that the district court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment and\n\nthe   sanctions    order    due    to   a     lack    of   complete     diversity.\n\nAlternatively, Baella-Silva argues that the district court erred in\n\nassessing liquidated damages and the additional sanctions.\n\n                             I.    Jurisdiction\n\n      Because   the   parties     settled     the     underlying    dispute,     the\n\ndistrict court did not explicitly rule on the jurisdictional issues\n\nraised in Baella-Silva's motion to remand.                 By incorporating the\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fsettlement completely into a final judgment, however, the district\n\ncourt assumed it had jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment.\n\nIn the settlement judgment, the parties acknowledged and agreed to\n\nthat jurisdiction as well as the court's continuing jurisdiction to\n\nenforce the agreement.        The parties did not bring a direct appeal\n\nchallenging the district court's jurisdiction or any other aspect\n\nof the settlement judgment within the time period provided for\n\nappeal.      See Lipman v. Dye, 294 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting\n\nthat \"[w]ithout appeal, the court's prior Settlement Order of\n\nDismissal became final thus barring any further attempt to reopen\n\nthe case in ordinary course\").         Now, as part of his appeal of the\n\nsanctions order, Baella-Silva attempts to collaterally attack the\n\njurisdictional basis for the settlement judgment, asserting a lack\n\nof complete diversity.\n\n       \"It has long been settled that a lack of complete diversity\n\nbetween the parties deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction\n\nover the lawsuit.\" Casas Office Machs., Inc. v. Mita Copystar Am.,\n\nInc., 42 F.3d 668, 673 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal marks omitted).\n\nFurthermore, \"[a] court without subject-matter jurisdiction may not\n\nacquire it by consent of the parties.\"         Fafel v. DiPaola, 399 F.3d\n\n403,   410    (1st   Cir.   2005).    \"Weighing     against   this   seemingly\n\n'inflexible'      jurisdictional     requirement,    however,   is   a   strong\n\ninterest in the finality of judgments.\"             Id. (internal citation\n\nomitted).      A district court's express or implicit determination\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthat it has jurisdiction is open to direct review, but it is res\n\njudicata when collaterally attacked.     Id.\n\n     In an effort to balance the competing policies of observing\n\nlimits on federal jurisdiction and respecting the finality of\n\njudgments, \"this court has established a high bar for collaterally\n\nvacating a judgment for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\"        Id.\n\nNamely, the judgment must be void in order to be vacated for lack\n\nof subject-matter jurisdiction on collateral review:\n\n     A void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous\n     one, in that the latter is subject only to direct attack.\n     A void judgment is one which, from its inception, was a\n     complete nullity and without legal effect. . . . While\n     absence of subject matter jurisdiction may make a\n     judgment void, such total want of jurisdiction must be\n     distinguished from an error in the exercise of\n     jurisdiction . . . [which] will not render the judgment\n     void. Only in the rare instance of a clear usurpation of\n     power will a judgment be rendered void.\n\nId. (internal marks omitted) (quoting Lubben v. Selective Serv.\n\nSys. Local Bd. No. 27, 453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972)).         Under\n\nthis standard, if the record supports an \"arguable basis\" for\n\nconcluding   that   subject-matter   jurisdiction   existed,   a   final\n\njudgment cannot be collaterally attacked as void.      Id. at 411.\n\n     The district court implicitly found it had jurisdiction to\n\nenter the settlement judgment.       We will therefore treat Baella-\n\nSilva's collateral attack on the settlement judgment in this appeal\n\nas we would treat an appeal from the denial of a motion for relief\n\nfrom a void judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n60(b)(4).    See id. at 409.    Accordingly, we will independently\n\n                                 -8-\n\fexamine the record to determine whether there is an arguable basis\n\nfor concluding that subject-matter jurisdiction existed or whether\n\nthe judgment is void as a clear usurpation of power.    See id. at\n\n410 (applying de novo review).    See also Nemaizer v. Baker, 793\n\nF.2d 58, 65 (2d Cir. 1986) (\"When a district court has not\n\nexplicitly noted why it assumed jurisdiction over a suit, appellate\n\ncourts will independently examine the record to determine whether\n\na reasonable basis existed for the lower court's implicit finding\n\nthat it had jurisdiction.\").\n\n     Our review of the record convinces us that there is an\n\narguable basis for concluding that subject matter jurisdiction\n\nexisted to enter the settlement judgment.   The complaint indicates\n\nthat the citizenship of the parties is not completely diverse\n\nbecause Palmas del Sol and its partners are citizens of Puerto\n\nRico, as is Baella-Silva.   The notice of removal, however, avers\n\nthat complete diversity exists and specifically asserts that the\n\nnondiverse parties listed on the complaint are not real parties in\n\ninterest but were in fact fraudulently joined in an effort to\n\npreclude removal to federal court.\n\n     There are grounds for crediting the averments of the notice of\n\nremoval.   The fee dispute that resulted in the settlement judgment\n\ninvolved a fee arrangement entered into only between Hulsey and\n\nBaella-Silva, between whom complete diversity exists.    USF&G had\n\ndeposited the amount of the disputed fees with the clerk of court\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fin fulfillment of its settlement in the USF&G litigation with\n\nPalmas del Sol.       Puerto Rico law does not recognize an attorneys'\n\nlien, which would have made Palmas del Sol a necessary party, see\n\nMartinez v. Hernandez, 456 F.2d 262, 264 (1st Cir. 1972), and\n\nBaella-Silva had withdrawn from his representation of Palmas del\n\nSol in the USF&G litigation.             He had contracted for his accrued\n\nfees directly with Hulsey, not Palmas del Sol or its partners.\n\nThus, the notice of removal, asserting that Baella-Silva had no\n\nclaim against the nondiverse parties of Palmas del Sol and its\n\npartners and that they were fraudulently joined, provides an\n\narguable basis for diversity jurisdiction.                 Because an arguable\n\nbasis for subject matter jurisdiction exists in the record, the\n\njudgment is not void, and Baella-Silva's collateral attack on the\n\nsettlement judgment must fail.\n\n       Baella-Silva    also     argues    that   the    district   court    lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction to enter the sanctions order.                     The\n\nnotice of appeal is timely as to the sanctions order.              \"[W]e review\n\nde novo the district court's legal conclusion that it had subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction to enforce its judgment.\"               Fafel, 399 F.3d at\n\n410.      \"Subject     matter     jurisdiction     may     be   independent    or\n\nancillary.\" Lipman, 294 F.3d at 20. Ancillary jurisdiction exists\n\nwhere the district court has ensured its continuing jurisdiction to\n\nenforce a settlement agreement either by \"including a provision\n\nexplicitly     retaining        [enforcement]          jurisdiction\"   or     \"by\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fincorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the court's\n\norder.\" Id. (citing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511\n\nU.S. 375, 380-81 (1994)).            See also Fafel, 399 F.3d at 413;\n\nMunicipality of San Juan v. Rullan, 318 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    The district court here clearly ensured its continuing\n\nancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement by doing\n\nboth.    We thus turn to the merits of Baella-Silva's challenges to\n\nthe sanctions order.\n\n                               II.   Sanctions\n\n     Following a hearing, the district court assessed $50,000 in\n\nliquidated      damages   against     Baella-Silva       for    breaching     the\n\nconfidentiality clause of the settlement judgment, and the court\n\nimposed    an    additional    $20,320      sanction     for    Baella-Silva's\n\nsubsequent act of filing two separate lawsuits in Commonwealth\n\ncourt against Palmas del Sol and its partners, in violation of the\n\nsettlement judgment.      Baella-Silva appeals the imposition of both\n\nsanctions.\n\n     First,     Baella-Silva    argues      that   he   did    not   breach   the\n\nconfidentiality clause by electronically filing an unsealed motion\n\nfor disbursement of funds on the district court's public docket web\n\nsite.     The confidentiality clause of the settlement judgment\n\nprovides that the \"[a]greement and its terms are confidential and\n\nshall not be disclosed to any person.\"              The clause acknowledges\n\nthat \"[c]onfidentiality is the substantial consideration for th[e]\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcompromise\" and provides that \"[a]ny violation of confidentiality\n\n. . . will result in liquidated damages of Fifty Thousand Dollars\n\n($50,000.00) to be assessed by this Honorable Court after notice\n\nand hearing.\"      (Id. (emphasis in original).)                Baella-Silva asserts\n\nthat    absent     proof    that        a    third    party    actually       viewed    the\n\ninformation in the motion, the electronic filing does not in itself\n\namount to \"disclosure.\"\n\n       The   district      court    found       that    there       was   disclosure    in\n\nviolation of the agreement, because the information had been posted\n\non a public website and was accessible to the general public for\n\nnearly an hour.            The district court noted, \"Indeed, the very\n\nessence of disclosure is present in this case, even if no third\n\nparty viewed it.\"       We agree.\n\n       A breach of a settlement agreement incorporated into an order\n\nis a violation of the court order.                   Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381.          As\n\nwith   civil     contempt     actions,         we    review   the     district    court's\n\nultimate finding that a clause in the settlement judgment was\n\nbreached     for   an   abuse      of       discretion.       See    United    States    v.\n\nSaccoccia, 433 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"In civil contempt\n\ncases, we first look to the text of the order to determine whether\n\nit is clear.       As to findings of fact, we review for clear error,\n\nwhile the trial court's ultimate finding on contempt is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion.\") (internal marks omitted); see also\n\nEureka Broadband Corp. v. Wentworth Leasing Corp., 400 F.3d 62, 67\n\n\n                                              -12-\n\f(1st Cir. 2005) (noting that \"we review the district court's legal\n\nconclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error\").                We\n\nbear in mind that an abuse of discretion may arise from either \"a\n\nmistake of law [or] a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\"                 Rodger\n\nEdwards, LLC v. Fiddes & Son Ltd., 437 F.3d 140, 142 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (internal marks omitted).\n\n       We see no clear error in the district court's determination\n\nthat   Baella-Silva   violated      the    confidentiality      clause    of   the\n\nagreement.   Baella-Silva and his attorney actively participated in\n\nnegotiating and drafting the agreement, its terms were clear, the\n\nsettlement was incorporated into the district court's judgment, and\n\nthat judgment was never appealed.              Filing a document on the\n\ndistrict court's electronic filing system is not consistent with\n\nkeeping information confidential.           Documents filed electronically\n\nare immediately available electronically over the Internet, and the\n\ncourt's website provides 24-hour access to the court's electronic\n\ndocket.   The website sets forth a separate procedure for filing a\n\nmotion under seal, and that procedure does not include an option\n\nfor electronic filing.    We think it is fair to presume in this day\n\nand age that every attorney understands that an electronic filing\n\nis   immediately   available   to    the    public   and   is   not   a   sealed\n\ndocument.    See Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., 212 F.3d 624, 631 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (stating that it is not excusable neglect for an\n\nattorney to choose to read an unambiguous judicial decree \"through\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\frose-colored glasses\" and thus cause a misunderstanding); United\n\nStates v. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting it is\n\nreasonable for a court to presume an attorney knows the local rules\n\nof practice, even including those unwritten rules that have become\n\nan established custom).\n\n     The settlement judgment was itself filed under seal for the\n\npurpose of preventing it from being available to anyone accessing\n\nthe court's electronic filing system.        The district court stated\n\nthat the settlement judgment included specific instructions to the\n\nclerk of court concerning the disbursement of the funds \"so as to\n\npreclude any of the parties from having to file a motion for\n\ndisbursement, and the parties so understood.” (Id.) Yet, Baella-\n\nSilva filed the motion electronically, thereby presenting the\n\nconfidential terms of the agreement to the general public.         Also,\n\nUSF&G's counsel, a party who was not privy to the settlement and\n\nwith whom Hulsey was still involved in litigation, received an\n\nautomatic electronic mail notification of the filing. The district\n\ncourt was not convinced that no one had seen the motion, and in any\n\nevent, concluded that public disclosure had occurred by the filing.\n\n     The   district   court's   findings   that   Baella-Silva's   filing\n\ndisclosed confidential terms of the settlement in violation of the\n\nsettlement judgment are not clearly erroneous.        Nor did the court\n\nabuse its discretion in assessing $50,000 in liquidated damages.\n\nThe parties had agreed that this would be the proper sanction for\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fa breach of the confidentiality clause, and that agreement had been\n\nincorporated into the settlement judgment, which was not appealed.\n\n     Second, Baella-Silva argues that the district court erred by\n\nimposing a $20,320 sanction for his filing of two lawsuits in the\n\nCommonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its partners.     The\n\nparties agreed that the district court would retain enforcement\n\nauthority over the settlement judgment, and, contrary to Baella-\n\nSilva's assertions, no state-law limitations affect the district\n\ncourt's inherent power to fashion an equitable remedy to punish a\n\nviolation of its decree.   \"A trial court has wide discretion in its\n\nchoice of sanctions,\" and \"[o]nce the trial court has chosen a\n\nparticular sanction, appellate review is for abuse of discretion.\"\n\nGoya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt. Co., 290 F.3d 63, 77-78 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 974 (2002). See Whitney Bros. Co. v.\n\nSprafkin, 60 F.3d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1995) (recognizing \"that the\n\ndistrict court is better situated than the court of appeals to\n\nmarshal the pertinent facts and apply the fact-dependent legal\n\nstandard\" involved in determining whether to impose sanctions\n\n(internal marks omitted)).   When a monetary sanction is chosen, we\n\nlikewise review the amount of the sanction only for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   See Goya Foods, Inc., 290 F.3d at 78.\n\n     The settlement judgment explicitly prohibited Baella-Silva\n\nfrom having further contact with any of the partners of Palmas del\n\nSol, unless Palmas initiated the contact, and Baella-Silva and his\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fwife expressly relinquished any basis they may have had or ever\n\nwould have to file suit against Palmas or its partners \"for any\n\nreason whatsoever related to the underlying facts of [the USF&G\n\nlitigation].\"      The settlement judgment is clearly worded.              The\n\nevidence at the hearing demonstrated that the first of the two\n\npost-settlement suits was an attempt to recover fees for work done\n\nspecifically to secure standing for Palmas del Sol in the USF&G\n\nlitigation.       The second suit, seeking fees for unrelated work\n\nperformed over ten years earlier when there are no grounds for such\n\na claim in Puerto Rico law, is easily seen as a transparent attempt\n\nto   intimidate    and   harass   the   defendants   in   violation   of   the\n\nagreement.      The district court did not commit clear error in\n\nfinding that Baella-Silva breached the settlement judgment by\n\nfiling the Commonwealth suits.\n\n      Finally, we conclude that the amount of the sanction, which is\n\nequal to the amount that Baella-Silva sought in the Commonwealth\n\ncourt in violation of the settlement judgment, is not excessive.\n\n\"[A] party who seeks to overturn a monetary sanction on grounds of\n\nexcessiveness bears a heavy burden.\"         Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack\n\nMgmt. Co., 344 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).                \"[S]o long as a\n\nsanction is reasonably proportionate to the offending conduct, the\n\ntrial court's quantification of it ought not to be disturbed.\" Id.\n\nat 20.    Compensation for losses is not the only factor to be\n\nconsidered, however, because \"[s]anctions stem, in part, from a\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fneed to regulate conduct during litigation.\"               Id.   Thus, setting\n\nthe amount of an effective sanction may include punitive concerns\n\nas well as considerations of deterrence.         Id. at 20-21.         In light\n\nof these multiple purposes and Baella-Silva's apparent willingness\n\nto disregard the terms of the settlement judgment, we cannot say\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in setting the amount\n\nof the additional sanction.\n\n     We   find   no   abuse   of   discretion   in   the    district    court's\n\nsanctions order.\n\n     Affirmed.    Costs are awarded to the appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

The settlement resolved a dispute concerning the allocation of attorneys' fees between Rafael Baella-Silva, an attorney, and the Hulsey Litigation Group, LLC, including attorneys Paul H. Hulsey and Cherie K. Durand (collectively \"Hulsey\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fee dispute arose over an award of attorneys' fees resulting from their joint efforts in representing a Puerto Rican company, Palmas del Sol, S.E., in litigation against United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF &amp; G) (hereinafter referred to as \"the USF &amp; G litigation\"). Baella-Silva began as the lead attorney for Palmas del Sol, but when the USF &amp; G litigation was removed to federal court, he retained the aid of the Hulsey Group. Later, Baella-Silva completely withdrew from the case, but before his withdrawal, he secured an agreement for his accrued fees. In the arrangement, Hulsey agreed to remit to Baella-Silva a certain percentage of any attorneys' fees awarded in the USF &amp; G litigation. The USF &amp; G litigation produced a settlement in favor of Palmas del Sol, triggering the attorneys' contingent fee arrangement with their client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baella-Silva filed this breach of contract action in the local court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on September 2, 2004, alleging that Hulsey had refused to pay him the agreed upon percentage of the contingent fee. On September 10, 2004, Hulsey removed the case to federal court, asserting the existence of complete diversity between the real parties in interest for purposes of federal jurisdiction. Hulsey simultaneously asserted that although nondiverse parties appear in the caption, they had been fraudulently joined by Baella-Silva in an attempt to defeat diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baella-Silva opposed the removal and requested that the case be remanded back to the Commonwealth court due to a lack of complete diversity. USF &amp; G deposited the disputed funds with the clerk of court. The district court held a hearing on the motion to remand on Friday, October 1, 2004, but did not rule on the motion because the parties entered into a settlement agreement concerning the attorneys' fee litigation on the same day. The district court incorporated the settlement into its judgment (hereinafter \"the settlement judgment\") and filed it under seal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement judgment resolved the attorneys' fee issue by awarding a specified sum to Baella-Silva and allocating to Hulsey the remainder of the amount deposited with the clerk. In addition to settling the fee dispute, the settlement judgment included a confidentiality clause providing for liquidated damages in the amount of $50,000 in the event either party disclosed the terms of the settlement agreement, and Baella-Silva expressly relinquished all claims against his former client, Palmas del Sol, and its partners relating to the USF &amp; G litigation and agreed to have no contact with anyone working for or on behalf of Hulsey, Palmas del Sol, or its partners. The settlement judgment states that all parties agree to accept the district court's jurisdiction and that the district court \"shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this [a]greement.\" No party appealed the settlement judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the following Monday, October 4, 2004, Baella-Silva electronically filed on the federal district court's public docket a motion for disbursement of funds, which disclosed some of the details of the sealed settlement judgment. Baella-Silva also filed two lawsuits in the local Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its individual partners for amounts allegedly owed to him. Hulsey immediately filed a motion to suspend disbursement of all funds and to impose sanctions, asserting that Baella-Silva's actions breached the express terms of the settlement judgment by disclosing its confidential terms as well as by suing and harassing Palmas del Sol and its partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the district court entered a sanctions order on December 22, 2004, concluding that Baella-Silva had breached the confidentiality clause by filing the motion for disbursement electronically, where it was posted live on the clerk's public docket for approximately one hour before he requested the clerk to seal the motion. Accordingly, the court entered judgment against Baella-Silva in the amount of $50,000 for liquidated damages as set forth in the settlement judgment. The district court also found that Baella-Silva had breached the settlement judgment a second time by filing two separate lawsuits against Palmas del Sol and its individual partners, seeking damages totaling $20,320. The district court assessed an additional sanction of $20,320 for this breach. The district court denied Baella-Silva's motion to reconsider, and Baella-Silva timely appealed the district court's sanctions order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Baella-Silva argues that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment and the sanctions order due to a lack of complete diversity. Alternatively, Baella-Silva argues that the district court erred in assessing liquidated damages and the additional sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the parties settled the underlying dispute, the district court did not explicitly rule on the jurisdictional issues raised in Baella-Silva's motion to remand. By incorporating the settlement completely into a final judgment, however, the district court assumed it had jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment. In the settlement judgment, the parties acknowledged and agreed to that jurisdiction as well as the court's continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The parties did not bring a direct appeal challenging the district court's jurisdiction or any other aspect of the settlement judgment within the time period provided for appeal. <i>See Lipman v. Dye,</i> 294 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that \"[w]ithout appeal, the court's prior Settlement Order of Dismissal became final thus barring any further attempt to reopen the case in ordinary course\"). Now, as part of his appeal of the sanctions order, Baella-Silva attempts to collaterally attack the jurisdictional basis for the settlement judgment, asserting a lack of complete diversity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It has long been settled that a lack of complete diversity between the parties deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction over the lawsuit.\" <i>Casas Office Machs., Inc. v. Mita Copystar Am., Inc.,</i> 42 F.3d 668, 673 (1st Cir.1994) (internal marks omitted). Furthermore, \"[a] court without subject-matter jurisdiction may not acquire it by consent of the parties.\" <i>Fafel v. DiPaola,</i> 399 F.3d 403, 410 (1st Cir.2005). \"Weighing against this seemingly `inflexible' jurisdictional requirement, however, is a strong interest in the finality of judgments.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citation omitted). A district court's express or implicit determination that it has jurisdiction is open to direct review, but it is <i>res judicata</i> when collaterally attacked. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to balance the competing policies of observing limits on federal jurisdiction and respecting the finality of judgments, \"this court has established a high bar for collaterally vacating a judgment for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> Namely, the judgment must be void in order to be vacated for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on collateral review:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous one, in that the latter is subject only to direct attack. A void judgment is one which, from its inception, was a complete nullity and without legal effect. . . . While absence of subject matter jurisdiction may make a judgment void, such total want of jurisdiction must be distinguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction . . . [which] will not render the judgment void. Only in the rare instance of a clear usurpation of power will a judgment be rendered void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (internal marks omitted) (quoting <i>Lubben v. Selective Serv. Sys. Local Bd. No. 27,</i> 453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir.1972)). Under this standard, if the record supports an \"arguable basis\" for concluding that subject-matter jurisdiction existed, a final judgment cannot be collaterally attacked as void. <i>Id.</i> at 411.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court implicitly found it had jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment. We will therefore treat Baella-Silva's collateral attack on the settlement judgment in this appeal as we would treat an appeal from the denial of a motion for relief from a void judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4). <i>See id.</i> at 409. Accordingly, we will independently examine the record to determine whether there is an arguable basis for concluding that subject-matter jurisdiction existed or whether the judgment is void as a clear usurpation of power. <i>See id.</i> at 410 (applying <i>de novo</i> review). <i>See also Nemaizer v. Baker,</i> 793 F.2d 58, 65 (2d Cir.1986) (\"When a district court has not explicitly noted why it assumed jurisdiction over a suit, appellate courts will independently examine the record to determine whether a reasonable basis existed for the lower court's implicit finding that it had jurisdiction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record convinces us that there is an arguable basis for concluding that subject matter jurisdiction existed to enter the settlement judgment. The complaint indicates that the citizenship of the parties is not completely diverse because Palmas del Sol and its partners are citizens of Puerto Rico, as is Baella-Silva. The notice of removal, however, avers that complete diversity exists and specifically asserts that the nondiverse parties listed on the complaint are not real parties in interest but were in fact fraudulently joined in an effort to preclude removal to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are grounds for crediting the averments of the notice of removal. The fee dispute that resulted in the settlement judgment involved a fee arrangement entered into only between Hulsey and Baella-Silva, between whom complete diversity exists. USF &amp; G had deposited the amount of the disputed fees with the clerk of court in fulfillment of its settlement in the USF &amp; G litigation with Palmas del Sol. Puerto Rico law does not recognize an attorneys' lien, which would have made Palmas del Sol a necessary party, <i>see Martinez v. Hernandez,</i> 456 F.2d 262, 264 (1st Cir.1972), and Baella-Silva had withdrawn from his representation of Palmas del Sol in the USF &amp; G litigation. He had contracted for his accrued fees directly with Hulsey, not Palmas del Sol or its partners. Thus, the notice of removal, asserting that Baella-Silva had no claim against the nondiverse parties of Palmas del Sol and its partners and that they were fraudulently joined, provides an arguable basis for diversity jurisdiction. Because an arguable basis for subject matter jurisdiction exists in the record, the judgment is not void, and Baella-Silva's collateral attack on the settlement judgment must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baella-Silva also argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the sanctions order. The notice of appeal is timely as to the sanctions order. \"[W]e review <i>de novo</i> the district court's legal conclusion that it had subject-matter jurisdiction to enforce its judgment.\" <i>Fafel,</i> 399 F.3d at 410. \"Subject matter jurisdiction may be independent or ancillary.\" <i>Lipman,</i> 294 F.3d at 20. Ancillary jurisdiction exists where the district court has ensured its continuing jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement either by \"including a provision explicitly retaining [enforcement] jurisdiction\" or \"by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the court's order.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 380-81, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994)). <i>See also Fafel,</i> 399 F.3d at 413; <i>Municipality of San Juan v. Rullan,</i> 318 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.2003). The district court here clearly ensured its continuing ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement by doing both. We thus turn to the merits of Baella-Silva's challenges to the sanctions order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the district court assessed $50,000 in liquidated damages against Baella-Silva for breaching the confidentiality clause of the settlement judgment, and the court imposed an additional $20,320 sanction for Baella-Silva's subsequent act of filing two separate lawsuits in Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its partners, in violation of the settlement judgment. Baella-Silva appeals the imposition of both sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Baella-Silva argues that he did not breach the confidentiality clause by electronically filing an unsealed motion for disbursement of funds on the district court's public docket web site. The confidentiality clause of the settlement judgment provides that the \"[a]greement and its terms are confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person.\" The clause acknowledges that \"[c]onfidentiality is the substantial consideration for th[e] compromise\" and provides that \"[a]ny violation of confidentiality . . . will result in liquidated damages of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) to be assessed by this Honorable Court after notice and hearing.\" (<i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original).) Baella-Silva asserts that absent proof that a third party actually viewed the information in the motion, the electronic filing does not in itself amount to \"disclosure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that there was disclosure in violation of the agreement, because the information had been posted on a public website and was accessible to the general public for nearly an hour. The district court noted, \"Indeed, the very essence of disclosure is present in this case, even if no third party viewed it.\" We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A breach of a settlement agreement incorporated into an order is a violation of the court order. <i>Kokkonen,</i> 511 U.S. at 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673. As with civil contempt actions, we review the district court's ultimate finding that a clause in the settlement judgment was breached for an abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Saccoccia,</i> 433 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir.2005) (\"In civil contempt cases, we first look to the text of the order to determine whether it is clear. As to findings of fact, we review for clear error, while the trial court's ultimate finding on contempt is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\") (internal marks omitted); <i>see also Eureka Broadband Corp. v. Wentworth Leasing Corp.,</i> 400 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that \"we review the district court's legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error\"). We bear in mind that an abuse of discretion may arise from either \"a mistake of law [or] a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\" <i>Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes &amp; Son Ltd.,</i> 437 F.3d 140, 142 (1st Cir.2006) (internal marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no clear error in the district court's determination that Baella-Silva violated the confidentiality clause of the agreement. Baella-Silva and his attorney actively participated in negotiating and drafting the agreement, its terms were clear, the settlement was incorporated into the district court's judgment, and that judgment was never appealed. Filing a document on the district court's electronic filing system is not consistent with keeping information confidential. Documents filed electronically are immediately available electronically over the Internet, and the court's website provides 24-hour access to the court's electronic docket. The website sets forth a separate procedure for filing a motion under seal, and that procedure does not include an option for electronic filing. We think it is fair to presume in this day and age that every attorney understands that an electronic filing is immediately available to the public and is not a sealed document. <i>See Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 624, 631 (1st Cir.2000) (stating that it is not excusable neglect for an attorney to choose to read an unambiguous judicial decree \"through rose-colored glasses\" and thus cause a misunderstanding); <i>United States v. Magana,</i> 127 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1997) (noting it is reasonable for a court to presume an attorney knows the local rules of practice, even including those unwritten rules that have become an established custom).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement judgment was itself filed under seal for the purpose of preventing it from being available to anyone accessing the court's electronic filing system. The district court stated that the settlement judgment included specific instructions to the clerk of court concerning the disbursement of the funds \"so as to preclude any of the parties from having to file a motion for disbursement, and the parties so understood.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Yet, Baella-Silva filed the motion electronically, thereby presenting the confidential terms of the agreement to the general public. Also, USF &amp; G's counsel, a party who was not privy to the settlement and with whom Hulsey was still involved in litigation, received an automatic electronic mail notification of the filing. The district court was not convinced that no one had seen the motion, and in any event, concluded that public disclosure had occurred by the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings that Baella-Silva's filing disclosed confidential terms of the settlement in violation of the settlement judgment are not clearly erroneous. Nor did the court abuse its discretion in assessing $50,000 in liquidated damages. The parties had agreed that this would be the proper sanction for a breach of the confidentiality clause, and that agreement had been incorporated into the settlement judgment, which was not appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Baella-Silva argues that the district court erred by imposing a $20,320 sanction for his filing of two lawsuits in the Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its partners. The parties agreed that the district court would retain enforcement authority over the settlement judgment, and, contrary to Baella-Silva's assertions, no state-law limitations affect the district court's inherent power to fashion an equitable remedy to punish a violation of its decree. \"A trial court has wide discretion in its choice of sanctions,\" and \"[o]nce the trial court has chosen a particular sanction, appellate review is for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt. Co.,</i> 290 F.3d 63, 77-78 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 974, 123 S.Ct. 434, 154 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002). <i>See Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin,</i> 60 F.3d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing \"that the district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the fact-dependent legal standard\" involved in determining whether to impose sanctions (internal marks omitted)). When a monetary sanction is chosen, we likewise review the amount of the sanction only for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Goya Foods, Inc.,</i> 290 F.3d at 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement judgment explicitly prohibited Baella-Silva from having further contact with any of the partners of Palmas del Sol, unless Palmas initiated the contact, and Baella-Silva and his wife expressly relinquished any basis they may have had or ever would have to file suit against Palmas or its partners \"for any reason whatsoever related to the underlying facts of [the USF &amp; G litigation].\" The settlement judgment is clearly worded. The evidence at the hearing demonstrated that the first of the two post-settlement suits was an attempt to recover fees for work done specifically to secure standing for Palmas del Sol in the USF &amp; G litigation. The second suit, seeking fees for unrelated work performed over ten years earlier when there are no grounds for such a claim in Puerto Rico law, is easily seen as a transparent attempt to intimidate and harass the defendants in violation of the agreement. The district court did not commit clear error in finding that Baella-Silva breached the settlement judgment by filing the Commonwealth suits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we conclude that the amount of the sanction, which is equal to the amount that Baella-Silva sought in the Commonwealth court in violation of the settlement judgment, is not excessive. \"[A] party who seeks to overturn a monetary sanction on grounds of excessiveness bears a heavy burden.\" <i>Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt. Co.,</i> 344 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.2003). \"[S]o long as a sanction is reasonably proportionate to the offending conduct, the trial court's quantification of it ought not to be disturbed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. Compensation for losses is not the only factor to be considered, however, because \"[s]anctions stem, in part, from a need to regulate conduct during litigation.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, setting the amount of an effective sanction may include punitive concerns as well as considerations of deterrence. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. In light of these multiple purposes and Baella-Silva's apparent willingness to disregard the terms of the settlement judgment, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in setting the amount of the additional sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's sanctions order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The settlement resolved a dispute concerning the allocation of attorneys' fees between Rafael Baella-Silva, an attorney, and the Hulsey Litigation Group, LLC, including attorneys Paul H. Hulsey and Cherie K. Durand (collectively \"Hulsey\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fee dispute arose over an award of attorneys' fees resulting from their joint efforts in representing a Puerto Rican company, Palmas del Sol, S.E., in litigation against United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF &amp; G) (hereinafter referred to as \"the USF &amp; G litigation\"). Baella-Silva began as the lead attorney for Palmas del Sol, but when the USF &amp; G litigation was removed to federal court, he retained the aid of the Hulsey Group. Later, Baella-Silva completely withdrew from the case, but before his withdrawal, he secured an agreement for his accrued fees. In the arrangement, Hulsey agreed to remit to Baella-Silva a certain percentage of any attorneys' fees awarded in the USF &amp; G litigation. The USF &amp; G litigation produced a settlement in favor of Palmas del Sol, triggering the attorneys' contingent fee arrangement with their client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baella-Silva filed this breach of contract action in the local court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on September 2, 2004, alleging that Hulsey had refused to pay him the agreed upon percentage of the contingent fee. On September 10, 2004, Hulsey removed the case to federal court, asserting the existence of complete diversity between the real parties in interest for purposes of federal jurisdiction. Hulsey simultaneously asserted that although nondiverse parties appear in the caption, they had been fraudulently joined by Baella-Silva in an attempt to defeat diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baella-Silva opposed the removal and requested that the case be remanded back to the Commonwealth court due to a lack of complete diversity. USF &amp; G deposited the disputed funds with the clerk of court. The district court held a hearing on the motion to remand on Friday, October 1, 2004, but did not rule on the motion because the parties entered into a settlement agreement concerning the attorneys' fee litigation on the same day. The district court incorporated the settlement into its judgment (hereinafter \"the settlement judgment\") and filed it under seal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement judgment resolved the attorneys' fee issue by awarding a specified sum to Baella-Silva and allocating to Hulsey the remainder of the amount deposited with the clerk. In addition to settling the fee dispute, the settlement judgment included a confidentiality clause providing for liquidated damages in the amount of $50,000 in the event either party disclosed the terms of the settlement agreement, and Baella-Silva expressly relinquished all claims against his former client, Palmas del Sol, and its partners relating to the USF &amp; G litigation and agreed to have no contact with anyone working for or on behalf of Hulsey, Palmas del Sol, or its partners. The settlement judgment states that all parties agree to accept the district court's jurisdiction and that the district court \"shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this [a]greement.\" No party appealed the settlement judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the following Monday, October 4, 2004, Baella-Silva electronically filed on the federal district court's public docket a motion for disbursement of funds, which disclosed some of the details of the sealed settlement judgment. Baella-Silva also filed two lawsuits in the local Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its individual partners for amounts allegedly owed to him. Hulsey immediately filed a motion to suspend disbursement of all funds and to impose sanctions, asserting that Baella-Silva's actions breached the express terms of the settlement judgment by disclosing its confidential terms as well as by suing and harassing Palmas del Sol and its partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the district court entered a sanctions order on December 22, 2004, concluding that Baella-Silva had breached the confidentiality clause by filing the motion for disbursement electronically, where it was posted live on the clerk's public docket for approximately one hour before he requested the clerk to seal the motion. Accordingly, the court entered judgment against Baella-Silva in the amount of $50,000 for liquidated damages as set forth in the settlement judgment. The district court also found that Baella-Silva had breached the settlement judgment a second time by filing two separate lawsuits against Palmas del Sol and its individual partners, seeking damages totaling $20,320. The district court assessed an additional sanction of $20,320 for this breach. The district court denied Baella-Silva's motion to reconsider, and Baella-Silva timely appealed the district court's sanctions order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Baella-Silva argues that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment and the sanctions order due to a lack of complete diversity. Alternatively, Baella-Silva argues that the district court erred in assessing liquidated damages and the additional sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the parties settled the underlying dispute, the district court did not explicitly rule on the jurisdictional issues raised in Baella-Silva's motion to remand. By incorporating the settlement completely into a final judgment, however, the district court assumed it had jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment. In the settlement judgment, the parties acknowledged and agreed to that jurisdiction as well as the court's continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The parties did not bring a direct appeal challenging the district court's jurisdiction or any other aspect of the settlement judgment within the time period provided for appeal. <i>See Lipman v.

Under this standard, if the record supports an \"arguable basis\" for concluding that subject-matter jurisdiction existed, a final judgment cannot be collaterally attacked as void. <i>Id.</i> at 411.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court implicitly found it had jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment. We will therefore treat Baella-Silva's collateral attack on the settlement judgment in this appeal as we would treat an appeal from the denial of a motion for relief from a void judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4). <i>See id.</i> at 409. Accordingly, we will independently examine the record to determine whether there is an arguable basis for concluding that subject-matter jurisdiction existed or whether the judgment is void as a clear usurpation of power. <i>See id.</i> at 410 (applying <i>de novo</i> review). <i>See also Nemaizer v.

The complaint indicates that the citizenship of the parties is not completely diverse because Palmas del Sol and its partners are citizens of Puerto Rico, as is Baella-Silva. The notice of removal, however, avers that complete diversity exists and specifically asserts that the nondiverse parties listed on the complaint are not real parties in interest but were in fact fraudulently joined in an effort to preclude removal to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are grounds for crediting the averments of the notice of removal. The fee dispute that resulted in the settlement judgment involved a fee arrangement entered into only between Hulsey and Baella-Silva, between whom complete diversity exists. USF &amp; G had deposited the amount of the disputed fees with the clerk of court in fulfillment of its settlement in the USF &amp; G litigation with Palmas del Sol. Puerto Rico law does not recognize an attorneys' lien, which would have made Palmas del Sol a necessary party, <i>see Martinez v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span>, 264 (1st Cir.1972), and Baella-Silva had withdrawn from his representation of Palmas del Sol in the USF &amp; G litigation. He had contracted for his accrued fees directly with Hulsey, not Palmas del Sol or its partners. Thus, the notice of removal, asserting that Baella-Silva had no claim against the nondiverse parties of Palmas del Sol and its partners and that they were fraudulently joined, provides an arguable basis for diversity jurisdiction. Because an arguable basis for subject matter jurisdiction exists in the record, the judgment is not void, and Baella-Silva's collateral attack on the settlement judgment must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baella-Silva also argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the sanctions order. The notice of appeal is timely as to the sanctions order. \"[W]e review <i>de novo</i> the district court's legal conclusion that it had subject-matter jurisdiction to enforce its judgment.\" <i>Fafel,</i> 399 F.3d at 410. \"Subject matter jurisdiction may be independent or ancillary.\" <i>Lipman,</i> 294 F.3d at 20. Ancillary jurisdiction exists where the district court has ensured its continuing jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement either by \"including a provision explicitly retaining [enforcement] jurisdiction\" or \"by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the court's order.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Kokkonen v.

The district court here clearly ensured its continuing ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement by doing both. We thus turn to the merits of Baella-Silva's challenges to the sanctions order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, the district court assessed $50,000 in liquidated damages against Baella-Silva for breaching the confidentiality clause of the settlement judgment, and the court imposed an additional $20,320 sanction for Baella-Silva's subsequent act of filing two separate lawsuits in Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its partners, in violation of the settlement judgment. Baella-Silva appeals the imposition of both sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Baella-Silva argues that he did not breach the confidentiality clause by electronically filing an unsealed motion for disbursement of funds on the district court's public docket web site. The confidentiality clause of the settlement judgment provides that the \"[a]greement and its terms are confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person.\" The clause acknowledges that \"[c]onfidentiality is the substantial consideration for th[e] compromise\" and provides that \"[a]ny violation of confidentiality . . . will result in liquidated damages of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) to be assessed by this Honorable Court after notice and hearing.\" (<i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original).) Baella-Silva asserts that absent proof that a third party actually viewed the information in the motion, the electronic filing does not in itself amount to \"disclosure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that there was disclosure in violation of the agreement, because the information had been posted on a public website and was accessible to the general public for nearly an hour.

Baella-Silva and his attorney actively participated in negotiating and drafting the agreement, its terms were clear, the settlement was incorporated into the district court's judgment, and that judgment was never appealed. Filing a document on the district court's electronic filing system is not consistent with keeping information confidential. Documents filed electronically are immediately available electronically over the Internet, and the court's website provides 24-hour access to the court's electronic docket. The website sets forth a separate procedure for filing a motion under seal, and that procedure does not include an option for electronic filing. We think it is fair to presume in this day and age that every attorney understands that an electronic filing is immediately available to the public and is not a sealed document. <i>See Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198919\"><a href=\"/opinion/198919/mirpuri-v-act-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 631 (1st Cir.2000) (stating that it is not excusable neglect for an attorney to choose to read an unambiguous judicial decree \"through rose-colored glasses\" and thus cause a misunderstanding); <i>United States v. Magana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197561\"><a href=\"/opinion/197561/united-states-v-magana/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.1997) (noting it is reasonable for a court to presume an attorney knows the local rules of practice, even including those unwritten rules that have become an established custom).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement judgment was itself filed under seal for the purpose of preventing it from being available to anyone accessing the court's electronic filing system. The district court stated that the settlement judgment included specific instructions to the clerk of court concerning the disbursement of the funds \"so as to preclude any of the parties from having to file a motion for disbursement, and the parties so understood.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Yet, Baella-Silva filed the motion electronically, thereby presenting the confidential terms of the agreement to the general public. Also, USF &amp; G's counsel, a party who was not privy to the settlement and with whom Hulsey was still involved in litigation, received an automatic electronic mail notification of the filing. The district court was not convinced that no one had seen the motion, and in any event, concluded that public disclosure had occurred by the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings that Baella-Silva's filing disclosed confidential terms of the settlement in violation of the settlement judgment are not clearly erroneous. Nor did the court abuse its discretion in assessing $50,000 in liquidated damages. The parties had agreed that this would be the proper sanction for a breach of the confidentiality clause, and that agreement had been incorporated into the settlement judgment, which was not appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Baella-Silva argues that the district court erred by imposing a $20,320 sanction for his filing of two lawsuits in the Commonwealth court against Palmas del Sol and its partners. The parties agreed that the district court would retain enforcement authority over the settlement judgment, and, contrary to Baella-Silva's assertions, no state-law limitations affect the district court's inherent power to fashion an equitable remedy to punish a violation of its decree. \"A trial court has wide discretion in its choice of sanctions,\" and \"[o]nce the trial court has chosen a particular sanction, appellate review is for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Goya Foods, Inc. v.

When a monetary sanction is chosen, we likewise review the amount of the sanction only for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Goya Foods, Inc.,</i> 290 F.3d at 78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement judgment explicitly prohibited Baella-Silva from having further contact with any of the partners of Palmas del Sol, unless Palmas initiated the contact, and Baella-Silva and his wife expressly relinquished any basis they may have had or ever would have to file suit against Palmas or its partners \"for any reason whatsoever related to the underlying facts of [the USF &amp; G litigation].\" The settlement judgment is clearly worded. The evidence at the hearing demonstrated that the first of the two post-settlement suits was an attempt to recover fees for work done specifically to secure standing for Palmas del Sol in the USF &amp; G litigation. The second suit, seeking fees for unrelated work performed over ten years earlier when there are no grounds for such a claim in Puerto Rico law, is easily seen as a transparent attempt to intimidate and harass the defendants in violation of the agreement. The district court did not commit clear error in finding that Baella-Silva breached the settlement judgment by filing the Commonwealth suits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we conclude that the amount of the sanction, which is equal to the amount that Baella-Silva sought in the Commonwealth court in violation of the settlement judgment, is not excessive. \"[A] party who seeks to overturn a monetary sanction on grounds of excessiveness bears a heavy burden.\" <i>Goya Foods, Inc. v. Wallack Mgmt. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200638\"><a href=\"/opinion/200638/goya-foods-inc-v-unanue/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2003). \"[S]o long as a sanction is reasonably proportionate to the offending conduct, the trial court's quantification of it ought not to be disturbed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. Compensation for losses is not the only factor to be considered, however, because \"[s]anctions stem, in part, from a need to regulate conduct during litigation.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, setting the amount of an effective sanction may include punitive concerns as well as considerations of deterrence. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. In light of these multiple purposes and Baella-Silva's apparent willingness to disregard the terms of the settlement judgment, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in setting the amount of the additional sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's sanctions order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
