Petitioner Eddy Sunarno, a native and\n\ncitizen of Indonesia, seeks review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration   Appeals   (BIA)   denying   his   motion    to   reopen   his\n\nimmigration   proceedings,    which   consisted   of    applications    for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).    Sunarno, who is Catholic, alleges that he\n\nwas persecuted by Indonesian Muslims on account of his religion.\n\nWe deny the petition.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ), Sunarno\n\nprovided the following testimony.         He was born in Indonesia in\n\n1957, and was baptized as a Catholic in 1986.          On August 7, 1992,\n\nhe was on his way to the central market when he was followed and\n\nstopped by two Muslim men who demanded to see his identification\n\ncard (which listed his address and identified him as a Catholic).\n\nThese men threatened to kill Sunarno and his family if he refused\n\nto convert to Islam.\n\n          Several days later, in the middle of the night on August\n\n13, 1992, two men who he believed were the earlier assailants set\n\nfire to the convenience store that he owned and operated.         Sunarno\n\ntestified that when the convenience store burned down, he lost\n\n$600,000, but that he did not report the fire and the loss to the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fauthorities.1   Petitioner then moved to Jakarta and experienced no\n\nfurther violence during his two remaining years in Indonesia.\n\n           Sunarno entered the United States on March 18, 1994 as a\n\nnon-immigrant visitor authorized to remain in the country through\n\nSeptember 17, 1994.      In a Notice to Appear issued on April 21,\n\n2003, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged petitioner\n\nas removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) as an alien who had\n\noverstayed his visa.       On October 13, 2003, he filed an asylum\n\napplication with the former INS.\n\n           At a hearing in July 2005, Sunarno conceded removability,\n\nbut   renewed   his   request   for   relief   in   the   form   of   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           In an oral decision, the IJ ruled that, because Sunarno\n\nhad failed to apply for asylum within one year of his arrival in\n\nthe United States, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B)(2002),\n\nhis request for asylum was time-barred. Additionally, the IJ found\n\nthat petitioner did not qualify for any of the exceptions to the\n\none-year filing deadline.       With respect to his CAT and withholding\n\nof removal claims, the IJ made several adverse credibility findings\n\nand ruled that Sunarno had failed to establish that it was more\n\n\n      1\n        Petitioner's asylum application also indicates that while\nhe and his family watched the store burn down from his nearby home,\nhis father collapsed and died.        Petitioner did not mention\nwitnessing the store's destruction or the death of his father\nduring his direct testimony before the IJ, and when cross-examined\nby the government's attorney, he stated that he had forgotten these\nfacts.\n\n                                      -3-\n\flikely than not that he would suffer persecution or torture upon\n\nhis return to Indonesia.\n\n          The     BIA   did   not     address   the   IJ's     credibility\n\ndetermination, but upheld the IJ's ruling that Sunarno's asylum\n\nclaim was time-barred and affirmed the denial of his CAT and\n\nwithholding of removal claims. Sunarno did not petition this court\n\nfor review of that decision.\n\n          Instead, he filed a motion to reopen, seeking to submit\n\nadditional testimony and evidence relevant to his claims.2              This\n\n\"new\" evidence consisted mainly of newspaper articles documenting\n\nthe prejudice and violence that Christians in Indonesia experienced\n\nat the hands of Muslim extremists.         The Board denied petitioner's\n\nmotion to reopen, finding that the articles were insufficient to\n\nestablish a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians and\n\n\"[did]   not    demonstrate   that    conditions   ha[d]     worsened   for\n\nChristians in Indonesia such that the respondent would now be able\n\nto show a clear probability that he would be persecuted in his\n\ncountry of origin on account of his religion.\"\n\n                                    II.\n\n          We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n     2\n        Although his motion to reopen also alleged a due process\nviolation based on a problem with the interpreter at his hearing,\nSunarno failed to mention this argument in the brief submitted to\nthis court, and it has therefore been waived.       Nikijuluw v.\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fBecause motions to reopen implicate significant policy concerns, we\n\nmust give substantial deference to the Board's decisions on such\n\nrequests.    See, e.g., Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (explaining that motions to reopen are disfavored in\n\nlight   of   the   strong   public   interest     in   finality     and   speedy\n\nprocessing of claims); Lemus v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 399, 401 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).    Accordingly, \"we will uphold a denial of a motion to\n\nreopen unless we conclude that the BIA either committed a material\n\nerror   of   law   or   exercised    its   authority     in    an   arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or irrational manner.\"         Beltre-Veloz, 533 F.3d at 9.\n\n             To succeed on a motion to reopen, petitioner must state\n\n\"new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the\n\nmotion is granted.\"       8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Kechichian\n\nv. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2008).             A motion to reopen\n\nmust be denied unless the new evidence \"establish[es] a prima facie\n\ncase sufficient to ground a claim of eligibility for the underlying\n\nsubstantive    relief.\"      Raza,   484   F.3d    at   128.        We    address\n\npetitioner's claims for withholding of removal and relief under the\n\nCAT in turn.\n\n             An alien applying for withholding of removal must show\n\nthat it is \"more likely than not\" that either he will be singled\n\nout for persecution upon return to his country of origin, 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.16(b)(2), or that there is a \"pattern or practice\" in his\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhome country of persecution of a group with which he identifies.\n\nId.   Sunarno made no such showing in this case.\n\n           In his brief before this court, petitioner does not even\n\nattempt to prove that he would be singled out for persecution in\n\nIndonesia.    Instead, he makes a cursory reference to an alleged\n\n\"pattern or practice\" of discrimination against Christians in\n\nIndonesia and draws the unsupported conclusion that \"for sure [he]\n\nwould be persecuted on account of his religion\" if forced to\n\nreturn.      However,   the   Board    reasonably   determined   that   the\n\nadditional evidence submitted by Sunarno in connection with his\n\nmotion to reopen was insufficient for a prima facie showing of\n\neligibility for relief.\n\n           This court has \"repeatedly held that 'discrimination in\n\nIndonesia does not, without more, qualify a Christian Indonesian\n\nnational for asylum.'\"        Datau v. Mukasey, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL\n\n3917134, at *3 (1st Cir.          Aug. 27, 2008) (quoting Sombah v.\n\nMukasey, 529 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 2008)); see also Pulisir v.\n\nMukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 308-09 (1st Cir. 2008); Kho v. Keisler, 505\n\nF.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2007).3          The new evidence submitted along\n\nwith petitioner's motion to reopen did not establish anything\n\n\"more\" than isolated incidents of such discrimination.             As the\n\n\n      3\n        Indeed, in recent decisions, we have noted an improvement\nin conditions for Indonesian Christians and an \"advance in inter-\nreligious tolerance.\" See, e.g., Datau, 2008 WL 3917134, at *3;\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 119, 122 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fBoard noted, the new evidence, which consisted mainly of news\n\narticles about specific crimes in Indonesia, merely indicated that\n\n\"Muslim extremists continue to carry out terrorist attacks and that\n\nChristians are sometimes targeted for violence.\"    Petitioner did\n\nnot establish a change in country conditions that would have\n\nallowed him to prove that, if returned to Indonesia, he was more\n\nlikely than not to be persecuted as part of a general pattern or\n\npractice.    Therefore, his claim for withholding of removal must\n\nfail.\n\n            In order to qualify for relief under the CAT, an alien\n\nmust show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured\n\nupon return to his country.    8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2); Jamal v.\n\nMukasey, 531 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 2008).     The new evidence in\n\nSunarno's motion to reopen was plainly insufficient to establish a\n\nprima facie case for relief under the CAT.   In any event, because\n\npetitioner's brief does not make any argument about his eligibility\n\nfor relief under the CAT, the issue has been waived.\n\n            Petition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
