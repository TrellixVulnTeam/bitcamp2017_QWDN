Petitioner Nestoras Bollanos, a\n\nnative and citizen of Albania, petitions for review of a final\n\norder of removal of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which\n\ndenied his petitions for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection   under   the   Convention    Against   Torture   (CAT).   An\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) found that Bollanos had not previously been\n\npersecuted on the basis of a protected ground, and that he had not\n\nmet his burden of establishing a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.    The BIA dismissed Bollanos's appeal, holding that\n\neven if Bollanos had proven past persecution, circumstances in\n\nAlbania have changed fundamentally such that he no longer has a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution there. We affirm the BIA and deny\n\nthe petition.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          On or about November 25, 2002, Bollanos entered the\n\nUnited States from Canada using a stolen and altered passport.        On\n\nJanuary 31, 2003, Bollanos was served with a Notice to Appear in\n\nremoval proceedings before an IJ.       Bollanos conceded removability,\n\nand on March 3, 2004, he filed an application requesting political\n\nasylum and withholding of removal on the basis of his religion,\n\nnationality, and political opinion, as well as protection under the\n\nCAT.\n\n          In support of his application, Bollanos offered evidence\n\nthat he had suffered persecution in Albania and Greece on account\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fof his religion, nationality, and political opinion.         Bollanos, an\n\nethnic Greek, was born in Albania.          Under Albania's communist\n\nregime,   he   and    his   family    suffered    ethnic   and   religious\n\ndiscrimination.      After the fall of communism in the early 1990s,\n\nBollanos moved with his family to Greece.            While in Greece, he\n\nbecame interested in politics and joined Omonia, a group organized\n\nto advocate for the rights of ethnic Greeks in Albania.          Over the\n\nnext several years, Bollanos traveled back and forth between Greece\n\nand Albania with some frequency.       Ethnic Greeks living in Albania\n\ncontinued to suffer discrimination under the new government, and\n\nBollanos returned to Albania in part to ensure that his family's\n\nland was not seized by the government or northern Albanians during\n\nthe family's absence.       Bollanos last returned to Albania in 2002\n\nfor his grandfather's funeral.\n\n           While in Albania, Bollanos suffered mistreatment at the\n\nhands of the police on three occasions.          He was arrested in 1994,\n\n1998, and 2000 because of his support for the rights of ethnic\n\nGreeks.   Each time, he was beaten while in custody, and on the\n\nfirst and third occasions, he was treated so severely that he\n\nrequired medical attention after his release.\n\n           Bollanos also claims to have experienced persecution in\n\nGreece.   Around 1999, he began dating an Albanian Muslim woman who\n\nwas vacationing in Greece.      At some point thereafter, the woman's\n\nfather and brothers threatened Bollanos and demanded that he marry\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe woman.   Bollanos then stopped dating the woman.    Around the\n\nsame time, Bollanos's mother apparently received a note from the\n\nwoman's family threatening to kill him.     The woman now lives in\n\nAlbania. Bollanos and his family have had no further problems with\n\nthe woman's family.\n\n          In an oral decision issued on June 9, 2004, the IJ denied\n\nBollanos's application for asylum.   Although the IJ found Bollanos\n\nto be credible, she found that he had \"failed to establish . . . a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution in either Albania or Greece.\"1\n\nThe IJ found that although Bollanos had suffered discrimination\n\n\"throughout his life, both in Albania and Greece [for] a variety of\n\nreasons,\" that treatment did not amount to persecution.     Having\n\ndenied his application for asylum, the IJ also denied Bollanos's\n\napplication for withholding of removal.     Finally, the IJ denied\n\nBollanos's CAT application, stating that the police mistreatment to\n\nwhich Bollanos testified \"[did] not appear to constitute torture.\"\n\n          On October 31, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling,\n\nfinding that \"even if [Bollanos] had established past persecution,\n\nthe preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that there has been\n\n\n     1\n          Bollanos argues in his brief that the IJ found he had\nsuffered past persecution. Although the transcript of the IJ's\noral opinion contains the statement \"I do believe that it is\nestablished that [the] treatment [suffered by Bollanos] constitutes\npersecution,\" it is clear from context that a transcription error\nomitted a \"not\" from the sentence.      Indeed, in the very next\nparagraph, the IJ states: \"Again, I find that the harm inflicted on\nthe respondent does constitute discrimination . . . . But that\ndoes not amount to persecution.\"\n\n                               -4-\n\fa 'fundamental change in circumstances [in Albania] such that the\n\napplicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.'\"\n\n(quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A), (1)(ii)).            The BIA noted\n\nevidence in the record indicating that Albania \"has undergone major\n\nreforms,\" particularly with respect to safe-guarding the rights of\n\nminorities, conducting peaceful elections, and reducing religious\n\nintolerance.     In addition, the BIA found that Bollanos was not\n\nentitled to protection under the CAT.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Bollanos makes several claims on appeal.             First, he\n\nclaims that the BIA erred in determining that circumstances in\n\nAlbania   had   changed   so   as   to   preclude   a   reasonable   fear   of\n\npersecution.     Second, Bollanos argues that the BIA violated his\n\nright to due process of law when it failed to determine whether he\n\nwas eligible for humanitarian asylum. Third, Bollanos asserts that\n\nthe BIA erred in not awarding him relief under the CAT.              Finally,\n\nBollanos argues that the BIA erred and violated his due process\n\nrights in upholding the IJ's order of removal to Greece.\n\n            To be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that\n\nhe is a \"refugee.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).         To do so, the alien\n\nmust show that he fears persecution \"on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"    Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,\n\n390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004).         The alien bears the burden of\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fproof for establishing his eligibility for asylum.                8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).    Once an applicant has established that he has\n\nsuffered persecution in the past, he is \"presumed to have a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution on the basis of the original\n\nclaim.\"   8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); see also El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,\n\n331 F.3d 195, 203 (1st Cir. 2003); Fergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). However, the alien will nonetheless be ineligible\n\nfor   asylum   if   \"[t]here    has    been   a    fundamental   change   in\n\ncircumstances such that [he] no longer has a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution in [his] country.\"        8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A); see\n\nalso El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 203.\n\n           Generalized evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate a\n\nchange in circumstances when \"there is a specific danger to the\n\napplicant.\"     Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 36 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\"[C]hanges in country conditions must be shown to have negated the\n\nparticular     applicant's     well-founded       fear   of   persecution.\"\n\nFergiste, 138 F.3d at 19. Whether circumstances have fundamentally\n\nchanged is a factual question that we review under the deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.         See Estrada-Canales v. Gonzales,\n\n437 F.3d 208, 215 (1st Cir. 2006).            Thus, we must accept the\n\nagency's determinations \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.\"              Rodriguez-Ramirez v.\n\nAshcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f              Here,      substantial      evidence        supports     the        BIA's\n\ndetermination         that   circumstances        in     Albania     have     changed\n\nfundamentally such that Bollanos can have no well-founded fear of\n\npersecution      there.         During   Bollanos's       removal    hearing,      the\n\ngovernment introduced into evidence the State Department's 2003\n\nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices for Albania and its 2004\n\nProfile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania.                      Both\n\nreports indicate that since 2000 -- the last time Bollanos claims\n\nto have suffered persecution in Albania -- treatment of those\n\nadvancing       the     rights    of     ethnic    minorities        has     improved\n\nsubstantially.2         Specifically, politically-motivated violence has\n\ndecreased significantly. Elections in October 2003 \"were conducted\n\nunder a new electoral code, which addressed many of the concerns\n\nthat arose from the 2001 parliamentary elections.\"                   The elections\n\nwere       \"generally    free    of    violence    and    considered        the    most\n\ntransparent in Albania's short democratic history, with no police\n\ninterference.\"          Although there were some \"small-scale clashes\n\n\n       2\n          Despite having checked the box for religious persecution\non his application for asylum and presenting evidence of religious\ndiscrimination to the IJ and BIA, Bollanos claims in his brief that\nhe has \"never claimed that he ha[s] been persecuted in the past on\naccount of his religion.\" To the extent he does make such a claim,\nsubstantial   evidence   supports   a  determination   of   changed\ncircumstances. In particular, the 2003 Country Report states that\n\"[t]he Constitution provides for freedom of religion[,] and the\nGovernment generally respected this right in practice. . . .\nRelations among the various religious groups were generally\namicable.\" Likewise, the 2004 Asylum Claims Profile notes that\nAlbania is \"recognized for its religious tolerance,\" and \"all\nreligious groups freely practice their faith[s].\"\n\n                                         -7-\n\fbetween     individual      competing       party      supporters\"        in    Himara,\n\nBollanos's hometown, the candidate representing the Greek minority\n\n-- Bollanos's cousin -- won.           In addition, in 2004 ethnic Greeks\n\nheld five parliamentary seats and two ministerial positions and\n\n\"participated actively in various political parties.\"                           Despite\n\nBollanos's contention to the contrary, this is not generalized\n\nevidence,    but     rather      evidence       that   bears      directly     on   the\n\nreasonableness of his fear of persecution.\n\n            Bollanos     argues     that    the    BIA    neglected     to     consider\n\nevidence that conditions in Albania remain dire. Yet, the majority\n\nof   the   evidence    that      Bollanos   presented        to   the   IJ     concerns\n\nconditions    only     up   to    2001.         Moreover,    even    those      reports\n\nintroduced by Bollanos that describe conditions since 2001 could\n\nsupport a finding of changed circumstances.                       For example, one\n\nreport notes remedial measures being taken by the government to\n\nreduce police misconduct.           Another recounts efforts by police to\n\ndecrease    tensions     between    ethnic       Greeks     and   other    Albanians.\n\nFinally, much of the evidence to which Bollanos points -- while\n\nindicative of problems in Albania, to be sure -- does not support\n\na reasonable fear of persecution on a protected ground.                             For\n\nexample, a high incidence of police misconduct, if not directed at\n\na protected class of people, does not prove eligibility for asylum.\n\n            The BIA did not err in denying Bollanos's claim for\n\nasylum. Because Bollanos's asylum claim fails, his application for\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fwithholding of removal necessarily fails as well.           See Mediouni v.\n\nINS, 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Likewise, the BIA's determination that Bollanos was not\n\nentitled to CAT relief is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n           In his brief, Bollanos claims that the BIA violated his\n\ndue   process   rights   by   failing   to   award   him   relief    based   on\n\nhumanitarian asylum, a discretionary doctrine sometimes available\n\neven in the absence of a threat of future persecution.              See Waweru\n\nv. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 199, 205 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[T]his is granted\n\nonly in cases of 'extraordinary suffering . . . .'\"); see also 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A); Matter of Chen, 20 I. & N. Dec. 16,\n\n19-21 (BIA 1989).    This due process claim is frivolous.3\n\n           Bollanos argues for the first time on appeal that the IJ\n\nerred in directing his deportation to Greece after it found that he\n\nhad not been firmly resettled there.          Because Bollanos failed to\n\nraise this claim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction over it now.\n\nSee Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).              In any\n\nevent, the IJ did not err in directing Bollanos's removal to\n\nGreece.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n           Bollanos's claim that the BIA violated his due process\nrights by upholding the BIA's order of removal to Greece also lacks\nany merit.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

Whether circumstances have fundamentally changed is a factual question that we review under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>See Estrada-Canales v.

Thus, we must accept the agency's determinations \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" <i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v.

During Bollanos's removal hearing, the government introduced into evidence the State Department's 2003 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Albania and its 2004 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania. Both reports indicate that since 2000 &#8212; the last time Bollanos claims to have suffered persecution in Albania &#8212; treatment of those advancing the rights of ethnic minorities has improved substantially.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Specifically, politically-motivated violence has decreased significantly. Elections in October 2003 \"were conducted under a new electoral code, which addressed many of the concerns that arose from the 2001 parliamentary elections.\" The elections were \"generally free of violence and considered the most transparent in Albania's short democratic history, with no police interference.\" Although there were some \"smallscale clashes between individual competing party supporters\" in Himara, Bollanos's hometown, the candidate representing the Greek minority &#8212; Bollanos's cousin &#8212; won. In addition, in 2004 ethnic Greeks held five parliamentary seats and two ministerial positions and \"participated actively in various political parties.\" Despite Bollanos's contention to the contrary, this is not generalized evidence, but rather evidence that bears directly on the reasonableness of his fear of persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bollanos argues that the BIA neglected to consider evidence that conditions in Albania remain dire. Yet, the majority of the evidence that Bollanos presented to the IJ concerns conditions only up to 2001. Moreover, even those reports introduced by Bollanos that describe conditions since 2001 could support a finding of changed circumstances. For example, one report notes remedial measures being taken by the government to reduce police misconduct. Another recounts efforts by police to decrease tensions between ethnic Greeks and other Albanians. Finally, much of the evidence to which Bollanos points &#8212; while indicative of problems in Albania, to be sure &#8212; does not support a reasonable fear of persecution on a protected ground. For example, a high incidence of police misconduct, if not directed at a protected class of people, does not prove eligibility for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA did not err in denying Bollanos's claim for asylum. Because Bollanos's asylum claim fails, his application for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well. <i>See Mediouni v. INS,</i> 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the BIA's determination that Bollanos was not entitled to CAT relief is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, Bollanos claims that the BIA violated his due process rights by failing to award him relief based on humanitarian asylum, a discretionary doctrine sometimes available even in the absence of a threat of future persecution. <i>See Waweru v. Gonzales,</i> 437 F.3d 199, 205 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[T]his is granted only in cases of `extraordinary suffering . . . .'\"); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A); <i>Matter of Chen,</i> 20 I. &amp; N.

An Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Bollanos had not previously been persecuted on the basis of a protected ground, and that he had not met his burden of establishing a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA dismissed Bollanos's appeal, holding that even if Bollanos had proven past persecution, circumstances in Albania have changed fundamentally such that he no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution there. We affirm the BIA and deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about November 25, 2002, Bollanos entered the United States from Canada using a stolen and altered passport. On January 31, 2003, Bollanos was served with a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings before an IJ. Bollanos conceded removability, and on March 3, 2004, he filed an application requesting political asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of his religion, nationality, and political opinion, as well as protection under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his application, Bollanos offered evidence that he had suffered persecution in Albania and Greece on account of his religion, nationality, and political opinion. Bollanos, an ethnic Greek, was born in Albania. Under Albania's communist regime, he and his family suffered ethnic and religious discrimination. After the fall of communism in the early 1990s, Bollanos moved with his family to Greece. While in Greece, he became interested in politics and joined Omonia, a group organized to advocate for the rights of ethnic Greeks in Albania. Over the next several years, Bollanos traveled back and forth between Greece and Albania with some frequency. Ethnic Greeks living in Albania continued to suffer discrimination under the new government, and Bollanos returned to Albania in part to ensure that his family's land was not seized by the government or northern Albanians during the family's absence. Bollanos last returned to Albania in 2002 for his grandfather's funeral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in Albania, Bollanos suffered mistreatment at the hands of the police on three occasions. He was arrested in 1994, 1998, and 2000 because of his support for the rights of ethnic Greeks. Each time, he was beaten while in custody, and on the first and third occasions, he was treated so severely that he required medical attention after his release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bollanos also claims to have experienced persecution in Greece. Around 1999, he began dating an Albanian Muslim woman who was vacationing in Greece. At some point thereafter, the woman's father and brothers threatened Bollanos and demanded that he marry the woman. Bollanos then stopped dating the woman. Around the same time, Bollanos's mother apparently received a note from the woman's family threatening to kill him. The woman now lives in Albania. Bollanos and his family have had no further problems with the woman's family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral decision issued on June 9, 2004, the IJ denied Bollanos's application for asylum. Although the IJ found Bollanos to be credible, she found that he had \"failed to establish . . . a well-founded fear of persecution in either Albania or Greece.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The IJ found that although Bollanos had suffered discrimination \"throughout his life, both in Albania and Greece [for] a variety of reasons,\" that treatment did not amount to persecution. Having denied his application for asylum, the IJ also denied Bollanos's application for withholding of removal. Finally, the IJ denied Bollanos's CAT application, stating that the police mistreatment to which Bollanos testified \"[did] not appear to constitute torture.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling, finding that \"even if [Bollanos] had established past persecution, the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that there has been a `fundamental change in circumstances [in Albania] such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.'\" (quoting 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A), (1)(ii)). The BIA noted evidence in the record indicating that Albania \"has undergone major reforms,\" particularly with respect to safe-guarding the rights of minorities, conducting peaceful elections, and reducing religious intolerance. In addition, the BIA found that Bollanos was not entitled to protection under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bollanos makes several claims on appeal. First, he claims that the BIA erred in determining that circumstances in Albania had changed so as to preclude a reasonable fear of persecution. Second, Bollanos argues that the BIA violated his right to due process of law when it failed to determine whether he was eligible for humanitarian asylum. Third, Bollanos asserts that the BIA erred in not awarding him relief under the CAT. Finally, Bollanos argues that the BIA erred and violated his due process rights in upholding the IJ's order of removal to Greece.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that he is a \"refugee.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1)(A).

During Bollanos's removal hearing, the government introduced into evidence the State Department's 2003 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Albania and its 2004 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania. Both reports indicate that since 2000 &#8212; the last time Bollanos claims to have suffered persecution in Albania &#8212; treatment of those advancing the rights of ethnic minorities has improved substantially.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Specifically, politically-motivated violence has decreased significantly.
