O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Chester J. Chalupowski, Jr., on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and David Hadas,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          September 27, 2005\n\f              Per Curiam.       This is an appeal from the denial of a\n\nmotion   under      Fed.   R.   Civ.   P.    60(b)(6).      The   district   court\n\ndismissed the pro se appellants' civil rights suit with prejudice\n\non   motion    of    the   defendant.         It   then   summarily   denied   the\n\nappellants' Rule 60(b) motion, which asserted that they had not\n\nreceived notice that the court was considering dismissal of their\n\nsuit.    We affirm.\n\n              On this record, we conclude that the dismissal of the\n\nsuit without notice did not affect the appellants' substantial\n\nrights, and so the denial of Rule 60(b) relief was proper.                     See\n\nTransaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Area Boliviana, 24 F.3d 457, 462 (2d\n\nCir. 1994) (stating that a Rule 60(b) motion based on lack of\n\nnotice may be denied where there is no prejudice to substantial\n\nrights).      Even if the appellants had received notice of the motion\n\nto   dismiss,    their     official    capacity      suit   for   injunctive   and\n\ndeclaratory relief would have been properly dismissed based on\n\nYounger abstention principles.              Appellants asked the federal court\n\nto order the defendant, a state court appellate judge before whom\n\na motion for contempt was then the only pending matter, to recuse\n\nherself \"from further hearing in this matter.\"                    This the court\n\ncould not do.         See Juidice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 335 (1977)\n\n(applying Younger to a case seeking to enjoin state court judges\n\nfrom pursuing contempt proceedings against the plaintiffs); accord\n\nCasa Marie, Inc. v. Superior Court of Puerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f263 (1st Cir. 1993); Gersten v. Rundle, 833 F. Supp. 906, 912-13\n\n(S.D. Fla. 1993); Williams v. North, 638 F. Supp. 457, 463 (D. Md.\n\n1986).\n\n          A   dismissal   based   on    Younger   is   without   prejudice.\n\nMaymo-Melendez v. Alvarez-Ramirez, 364 F.3d 27, 32 n.4 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 110 (2004).              Therefore, insofar as\n\nappellants brought an official capacity suit seeking injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief, we affirm but direct the district court to\n\nmodify its judgment to be without prejudice. See Caldwell v. Camp,\n\n594 F.2d 705, 708 (8th Cir. 1979) (directing such modification under\n\nsimilar circumstances).    Insofar as the individual capacity suit\n\nwas dismissed with prejudice based on the defendant's absolute\n\nimmunity from suit, we affirm.         See Bagby v. Brondhaven, 98 F.3d\n\n1096, 1100 (8th Cir. 1996) (concluding that defendant was entitled\n\nto qualified immunity and remanding to the district court with\n\ninstructions to dismiss with prejudice); Clark v. Brown, 861 F.2d\n\n66, 67 (4th Cir. 1988) (same); see also Romero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-\n\nAgosto, 75 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming \"in all respects\"\n\na with prejudice dismissal based on absolute legislative immunity).\n\n          Affirmed and remanded for the limited purpose of making\n\nthe modification described herein.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
