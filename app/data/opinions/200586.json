ARNOLD, Senior Circuit Judge.             This is an appeal from a\n\nsentence imposed upon Murray Spaulding after he pleaded guilty to\n\ncertain drug offenses.         The question raised on this appeal is\n\nwhether two of Mr. Spaulding’s prior convictions should have been\n\nexcluded when the District Court was tallying his criminal-history\n\nscore.    Mr. Spaulding argues that they should have been excluded\n\nbecause they qualify as crimes “similar to” two offenses that\n\nUnited    States    Sentencing   Guideline    §     4A1.2(c)(1)   explicitly\n\nexcludes from being counted.          We conclude that Mr. Spaulding’s\n\nconvictions are not “similar to” any listed offenses, and we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Mr.    Spaulding   was   the   target   of   a   government   drug\n\noperation.    He sold a large quantity of cocaine to a confidential\n\ninformant over an extended time period.           He pleaded guilty to one\n\ncount of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams\n\nor more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(B), and 846, and five counts of distribution of cocaine,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). He was sentenced\n\nto the statutory minimum 60 months’ imprisonment, five years of\n\nsupervised release, a fine of $3000, and a special assessment of\n\n$600.     Mr. Spaulding objected to this sentence at the time of\n\nsentencing, maintaining that he is entitled to “safety valve”\n\nrelief under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), which allows a district court to\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fsentence a defendant below the statutory minimum if, among other\n\nthings, the defendant falls within Criminal History Category I.\n\nThe crux of Mr. Spaulding’s argument is that two of his prior\n\nconvictions--shoplifting and violating a condition of release--were\n\nimproperly counted toward his criminal history.                He argues that\n\nthey should have been excluded under § 4A1.2(c)(1) because they are\n\n“similar to” crimes listed therein.          The District Court rejected\n\nthis argument, concluding that Mr. Spaulding fell into Criminal\n\nHistory Category II and was, therefore, ineligible for “safety\n\nvalve” relief.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           Whether   a   crime    is   “similar   to”   a     crime   listed    in\n\n§ 4A1.2(c)(1) is a question of law, and we therefore review the\n\nDistrict Court’s decision de novo. See United States v. Palmer, 203\n\nF.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           All parties agree that Mr. Spaulding is entitled to\n\n“safety valve” relief from the statutory minimum sentence only if\n\neither   his   conviction   for   shoplifting     or    his    conviction      for\n\nviolating a court protective order is excluded from his criminal\n\nhistory under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(1).         Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c),\n\n“Sentences for all felony offenses are counted.                  Sentences for\n\nmisdemeanor and petty offenses are counted, except as follows: (1)\n\nsentences for the following prior offenses and offenses similar to\n\nthem, by any name they are known,” are generally not counted.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c). The Guideline then lists a number of offenses\n\nwhich are not to be counted including convictions for insufficient\n\nfunds checks and disorderly conduct.\n\n          Mr. Spaulding does not allege that either of the crimes\n\nat issue in this case is included in the list of excluded offenses.\n\nInstead, he argues that his crimes are “similar to” certain listed\n\noffenses, so they should have been excluded from his criminal-\n\nhistory score.   In United States v. Unger, this Court concluded\n\nthat to determine whether a conviction is “similar to” a listed\n\noffense, we look to the substance of the offense rather than the\n\nname of the offense and eschew any state-law classifications.   915\n\nF.2d 759, 763 (1st Cir. 1990).1   Determining whether two crimes are\n\nsimilar necessarily requires us to begin by looking to the elements\n\nof the two offenses. Although the elements need not match exactly,\n\ntwo crimes cannot be termed “similar” if they involve wholly\n\ndifferent elements.   At the same time, such things as the relative\n\ndanger posed by each crime and the risk of recidivism displayed by\n\neach crime are relevant in deciding whether a crime is “similar to”\n\na listed offense.\n\n          Mr. Spaulding argues that his conviction for theft, a\n\nshoplifting charge for theft of products valued at approximately\n\n$21, should be excluded because it is similar to an insufficient_-\n\n\n     1\n      Unger was about § 4A1.2(c)(2) rather than §4A1.2(c)(1), but\nit is relevant nevertheless, because “similar to” is the same\nphrase in both provisions.\n\n                                  -4-\n\ffunds check — a listed offense.                  This argument has some initial\n\nappeal as both crimes involve theft.                  We do not believe that the\n\ntwo crimes are sufficiently similar to exclude shoplifting under\n\n§    4A1.2(c)(1),        however,    because     shoplifting     poses     a   markedly\n\ngreater risk to the public.             Passing a bad check poses little risk\n\nof physical confrontation, because the perpetrator is not present\n\nwhen the victim realizes that he has been victimized. Shoplifting,\n\non    the   other       hand,    creates   the    very    real   risk    of    physical\n\nconfrontation between the perpetrator and the victim.                          A store\n\nemployee or customer may confront the perpetrator in an attempt to\n\nthwart      the    crime.        This   risk     of   confrontation      precludes   a\n\nconclusion that shoplifting is “similar to” passing a bad check.\n\nThus, the District Court did not err in counting Mr. Spaulding’s\n\nconviction for theft in calculating his criminal-history score.\n\n              Mr. Spaulding likewise argues that his conviction for\n\nviolation of his conditions of release should have been excluded\n\nbecause it         is   “similar    to”    the   listed    offense    of   disorderly\n\nconduct.          Mr. Spaulding’s offense conduct involved his making\n\ncontact with his ex-wife, in violation of both a protective order\n\nthat she had obtained against him and conditions of his release\n\nfrom state custody.2            Both parties agree that Mr. Spaulding did not\n\n\n       2\n      Mr. Spaulding was adjudged guilty only of violating the terms\nof his release, not of violating the protective order. The latter\ncharge was dismissed, but Mr. Spaulding does not assert that this\ndismissal was based upon a finding that his behavior did not\nviolate the protective order.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fphysically harm his ex-wife; he clearly violated the order that he\n\nstay away from her, however, and there is some evidence that he was\n\nharassing her.    Mr. Spaulding argues that, in light of the fact\n\nthat he did not physically harm his ex-wife, this offense is\n\nsimilar to, if not less serious than, disturbing the peace.        We\n\nagree with the District Court that his offense is not “similar to”\n\ndisturbing the peace, because he was under two court orders at the\n\ntime of his conduct.   As the District Court correctly pointed out,\n\nviolation of a court order is a more serious offense than a run-of-\n\nthe-mill    public-disturbance   case.   The   Sentencing   Guidelines\n\nthemselves treat crimes committed while under court supervision as\n\nmore serious than other crimes.     See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d) (calling\n\nfor a two-level increase in criminal history if an offense was\n\ncommitted while under any criminal justice sentence). In addition,\n\nthat Mr. Spaulding violated the court order demonstrates a higher\n\nrisk of recidivism than a run-of-the-mill public-disorder offense.\n\nThis higher risk of recidivism is demonstrated by the fact that Mr.\n\nSpaulding regarded the criminal justice system with so little\n\nrespect that he was willing to violate two judicial orders.      This\n\nhigher risk of recidivism indicated by his violation of a release\n\norder renders Mr. Spaulding’s crime more serious than disorderly\n\nconduct.3   Thus, the District Court did not err in assessing Mr.\n\n\n     3\n      Mr. Spaulding’s brief to this Court asserts that he was not\neven guilty of this crime, as his ex-wife approached him. We will\nnot consider this assertion, because Mr. Spaulding was adjudged\n\n                                  -6-\n\fSpaulding one criminal-history point for this prior conviction.\n\n          Having concluded that neither of Mr. Spaulding’s prior\n\noffenses should have been excluded as “similar to” listed offenses,\n\nwe hold that Mr. Spaulding was properly placed in Criminal History\n\nCategory II, rendering him ineligible for “safety valve” relief\n\nfrom the statutory minimum sentence.   The District Court’s ruling\n\nis, therefore, affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nguilty.   Sentencing courts are not to reexamine the evidence\nunderlying prior convictions in deciding whether to count prior\ncrimes toward a defendant’s criminal-history score.\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

He was sentenced to the statutory minimum 60 months' imprisonment, five years of supervised release, a fine of $3000, and a special assessment of $600. Mr. Spaulding objected to this sentence at the time of sentencing, maintaining that he is entitled to \"safety valve\" relief under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), which allows a district court to sentence a defendant below the statutory minimum if, among other things, the defendant falls within Criminal History Category I. The crux of Mr. Spaulding's argument is that two of his prior convictions &#8212; shoplifting and violating a condition of release &#8212; were improperly counted toward his criminal history. He argues that they should have been excluded under &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1) because they are \"similar to\" crimes listed therein. The District Court rejected this argument, concluding that Mr. Spaulding fell into Criminal History Category II and was, therefore, ineligible for \"safety valve\" relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a crime is \"similar to\" a crime listed in &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1) is a question of law, and we therefore review the District Court's decision <i>de novo. See United States v. Palmer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767577\"><a href=\"/opinion/767577/united-states-v-charles-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All parties agree that Mr. Spaulding is entitled to \"safety valve\" relief from the statutory minimum sentence only if either his conviction for shoplifting or his conviction for violating a court protective order is excluded from his criminal history under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1). Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c), \"Sentences for all felony offenses are counted. Sentences for misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted, except as follows: (1) sentences for the following prior offenses and offenses similar to them, by any name they are known,\" are generally not counted. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(c). The Guideline then lists a number of offenses which are not to be counted including convictions for insufficient funds checks and disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Spaulding does not allege that either of the crimes at issue in this case is included in the list of excluded offenses. Instead, he argues that his crimes are \"similar to\" certain listed offenses, so they should have been excluded from his criminal-history score. In <i>United States v. Unger,</i> this Court concluded that to determine whether a conviction is \"similar to\" a listed offense, we look to the substance of the offense rather than the name of the offense and eschew any state-law classifications. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548928\"><a href=\"/opinion/548928/united-states-v-eric-n-unger/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 763 (1st Cir.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Determining whether two crimes are similar necessarily requires us to begin by looking to the elements of the two offenses. Although the elements need not match exactly, two crimes cannot be termed \"similar\" if they involve wholly different elements. At the same time, such things as the relative danger posed by each crime and the risk of recidivism displayed by each crime are relevant in deciding whether a crime is \"similar to\" a listed offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Spaulding argues that his conviction for theft, a shoplifting charge for theft of products valued at approximately $21, should be excluded because it is similar to an insufficient &#8212; funds check &#8212; a listed offense. This argument has some initial appeal as both crimes involve theft. We do not believe that the two crimes are sufficiently similar to exclude shoplifting under &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1), however, because shoplifting poses a markedly greater risk to the public. Passing a bad check poses little risk of physical confrontation, because the perpetrator is not present when the victim realizes that he has been victimized. Shoplifting, on the other hand, creates the very real risk of physical confrontation between the perpetrator and the victim. A store employee or customer may confront the perpetrator in an attempt to thwart the crime. This risk of confrontation precludes a conclusion that shoplifting is \"similar to\" passing a bad check. Thus, the District Court did not err in counting Mr. Spaulding's conviction for theft in calculating his criminal-history score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Spaulding likewise argues that his conviction for violation of his conditions of release should have been excluded because it is \"similar to\" the listed offense of disorderly conduct. Mr. Spaulding's offense conduct involved his making contact with his ex-wife, in violation of both a protective order that she had obtained against him and conditions of his release from state custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Both parties agree that Mr. Spaulding did not physically harm his ex-wife; he clearly violated the order that he stay away from her, however, and there is some evidence that he was harassing her. Mr. Spaulding argues that, in light of the fact that he did not physically harm his ex-wife, this offense is similar to, if not less serious than, disturbing the peace. We agree with the District Court that his offense is not \"similar to\" disturbing the peace, because he was under two court orders at the time of his conduct. As the District Court correctly pointed out, violation of a court order is a more serious offense than a run-of-the-mill public-disturbance case. The Sentencing Guidelines themselves treat crimes committed while under court supervision as more serious than other crimes. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d) (calling for a two-level increase in criminal history if an offense was committed while under any criminal justice sentence). In addition, that Mr. Spaulding violated the court order demonstrates a higher risk of recidivism than a run-of-the-mill public-disorder offense. This higher risk of recidivism is demonstrated by the fact that Mr. Spaulding regarded the criminal justice system with so little respect that he was willing to violate two judicial orders. This higher risk of recidivism indicated by his violation of a release order renders Mr. Spaulding's crime more serious than disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, the District Court did not err in assessing Mr. Spaulding one criminal-history point for this prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that neither of Mr. Spaulding's prior offenses should have been excluded as \"similar to\" listed offenses, we hold that Mr. Spaulding was properly placed in Criminal History Category II, rendering him ineligible for \"safety valve\" relief from the statutory minimum sentence. The District Court's ruling is, therefore, <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Unger</i> was about &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2) rather than &#167; 4A1.2(c)(1), but it is relevant nevertheless, because \"similar to\" is the same phrase in both provisions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Mr. Spaulding was adjudged guilty only of violating the terms of his release, not of violating the protective order.
