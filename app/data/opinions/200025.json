In similar, albeit unrelated cases, two\n\nPuerto Rico municipalities and certain of their officers seek stays\n\nof judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 8(a).             In both cases\nplaintiffs complain of alleged political discrimination on the\n\ndefendants' part in dismissing and/or failure to hire them in the\n\nrespective municipalities.\n           In one case, No. 02-1529, the Municipality of Gurabo and\n\ntwo of its officials seek a stay of two orders of the district\n\ncourt: one, awarding plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages;\n\nthe   other,   ordering   that    plaintiffs   be   reinstated      to   their\n\npositions with the municipality. Defendants now seek a stay without\n\nthe posting of any bond or conditioned upon the posting of a bond\n\nin half the amount ordered by the district court.1\n\n           Defendants claim that they should not be required to post\n\na bond because the \"municipality has a mechanism for assessing\n\nfuture budgetary expenses\" and hence has the capacity to meet the\namount    of   the   judgment    should   it   be   affirmed   on    appeal.\n\nAlternatively, they argue that the $2.7 million bond set by the\n\ndistrict court is excessive.        In addition, the Gurabo defendants\n\nclaim that they are entitled to a stay, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n62(f).    Finally, the Gurabo defendants seek a stay of the order\n\nrequiring reinstatement on the basis of the traditional four-part\n\nstandard applied to injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Although punitive damages were awarded against the individual\nofficers in Gurabo, the request for a stay from this court only\naddresses the claims against the municipality.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            In    the    second      case,     Nos.     02-1139      and    1140,    the\n\nMunicipality of Adjuntas and certain of its officers seek to stay\n\na judgment awarding plaintiffs compensatory damages against the\nmunicipality      and     punitive      damages        against       the    individual\n\ndefendants.       The procedural posture of this case is somewhat\n\ndifferent from that of the Gurabo case.                   The Gurabo defendants\nmoved for a stay of judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.                        The\n\nAdjuntas defendants sought a stay only in opposition to plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for a writ of execution, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 69.\n\n            In response to the opposition, the district court in the\n\nAdjuntas   case,       acting    \"in   accordance       with     the   practice      and\n\nprocedure of [Puerto Rico],\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a), ordered the\n\nmunicipality to include the damages awarded against them in their\nbudget for the upcoming fiscal year.                  See 21 L.P.R.A. § 4303(c)\n\n(\"it   shall     be     mandatory      [for    a      municipality]        to   include\n\nappropriations with sufficient credits for the following purposes\n. . . (3) payment of court judgments\").                   The court ordered the\n\nindividual defendants to pay damages by June 14 but did grant them\na stay, conditioned on their posting of a supersedeas bond in the\n\ndamage amount.\n\n            The Municipality of Adjuntas now seeks a stay without the\n\nposting    of    any    bond    or   conditioned       upon    the     posting      of   a\n\n\"reasonable\" supersedeas bond.            It bases its claim on the adverse\n\npublic policy consequences that would attend the district court\n\norder to include the judgment in the municipal budget and on the\n\nfact that Puerto Rico law entitles municipalities to stays of\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fmonetary judgments without the posting of any bond, P.R. R. Civ. P.\n\n69.6.\n\n            The individual defendants in the Adjuntas case seek a\nstay without the posting of bond on the ground that Puerto Rico law\n\nprovides that the Commonwealth will \"assume the payment of any\n\njudgment    that   may   be   entered   against     an   [official    of    the\nCommonwealth sued in individual capacity for actions undertaken in\n\nthe course of his employment].\"2           32 L.P.R.A. § 3085.    Since the\n\nCommonwealth will assume any debt, the plaintiffs are guaranteed\n\npayment and, hence, defendants claim, no security is needed. Given\n\nthe complexity of the issues raised, this court granted temporary\n\nstays in both cases.\n\n            Defendants seek to stay judgments ordering both monetary\nand injunctive relief.        Stays of injunctive orders, such as for\n\nreinstatement,     are   evaluated   under    the   traditional      four-part\n\nstandard applied to injunctions.3          \"The sine qua non [of the stay\npending appeal standard] is whether the [movants] are likely to\n\nsucceed on the merits.\"       Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).   In essence, the issuance of a stay depends on \"whether\n\nthe harm caused [movant] without the [stay], in light of the\n\n[movant's] likelihood of eventual success on the merits, outweighs\n\n        2\n      A municipal officer is considered an official                    of   the\nCommonwealth for purposes of 32 L.P.R.A. § 3085.\n        3\n      The considerations are: (1) whether the applicant has made\na strong showing of success on the merits; (2) whether the\napplicant will be irreparably harmed absent injunctive relief; (3)\nwhether issuance of the stay will injure other parties; and (4)\nwhere the public interest lies. Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S.\n770, 776-77 (1987).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthe harm the [stay] will cause [the non-moving party].\"                          United\n\nSteelworkers of America v. Textron, Inc., 836 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (internal quotations omitted).\n              Stays of monetary judgments are ordinarily sought under\n\neither Fed.       R.   Civ.     P.   62(d)    or    62(f).4      Under    Rule   62(d),\n\nexecution of a money judgment is automatically stayed pending\nappeal upon the posting of a supersedeas bond. The nature and the\n\namount of the bond is entrusted to the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.    Sckolnick v. Harlow, 820 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 1987).                       The\n\nbond requirement          is    intended     to    protect     the   interest    of   the\n\ncreditor's right under judgment during the pendency of the appeal.\n\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Boyd, 781 F.2d 1494, 1498 (11th Cir.\n\n1986).    Courts have held that no bond is required if: (1) the\ndefendant's ability to pay is so plain that the posting of a bond\n\nwould    be   a   waste    of    money;      or    (2)   the   bond    would    put   the\n\ndefendant's other creditors in undue jeopardy.                       Olympia Equipment\n\nLeasing Corp. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 786 F.2d 794, 796 (7th Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n              Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(f) provides, on the other hand, that\n\n\"[i]n any state in which a judgment is a lien upon the property of\n\nthe judgment debtor . . ., a judgment debtor is entitled . . . to\n\nsuch a stay as would be accorded the judgment debtor had the action\n\n\n     4\n      It is at least arguable that a monetary judgment may also be\nstayed under the traditional standard for issuing injunctions.\nAdequate protection for plaintiffs/appellees would be a factor in\nevaluating the propriety of any such request. The municipality in\nthe instant case has not sought to enjoin the damage award on these\ngrounds.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fbeen maintained in the courts of that state.\"       The district court\n\nmust grant a stay without a bond if the requirements of Rule 62(f)\n\nare met.    Absent a stay on some ground, plaintiffs are free to seek\nexecution of the judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 69.\n\n            As far as the Gurabo defendants' request for a stay of\n\nthe order of reinstatement is concerned, we do not believe that the\ndefendants have shown a clear likelihood of success of the merits,\n\neven if they are correct in contending that the plaintiffs lack a\n\nproperty interest in their positions under Puerto Rico law.       Their\n\nclaim that the monetary judgment should be stayed because the\n\nmunicipality has the capacity to meet any judgment upheld on appeal\n\nwas not made below and, in any event, the municipality has failed\n\nto provide this court with adequate documentation supporting its\ncapacity.    See, e.g., Sealover v. Carey Canada, 806 F.Supp. 59, 62\n\n(M.D. Pa. 1992) (while proof of ability to pay is proper ground for\n\nomitting bond requirement, claim must be rejected where the court\nlacks \"information necessary to make such a determination\").      Nor,\n\non the record before us, do we find any merit in the defendants'\nclaim that the bond set by the     district court is excessive.\n\n            The Gurabo defendants also claim to be entitled to a stay\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(f).      However, this rule applies only\n\nwhen the \"judgment is a lien upon the property of a judgment\n\ndebtor.\"    Since, under Puerto Rico law, a judgment becomes a lien\n\nupon property only after the judgment creditor applies to the court\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fand the court issues a writ of attachment, P.R. R. Civ. P. 51.3,\n\nRule 62(f) does not appear to apply.5\n\n             This brings us to the Adjuntas defendants.                        Even though\nthe municipality may be entitled to a stay without posting a bond\n\nin Puerto Rico courts, it is entitled to a similar stay in federal\n\ncourt     only    if     the     strictures        of   Rule       62(f)    are     met.     The\nmunicipality has provided no argument to show that Rule 62(f) is\n\nsatisfied, and, as we have already noted, such a claim does not\n\nseem likely to succeed.\n\n             With       regard    to   the    district         court       order    that     the\n\nmunicipality include the cost of the judgment in its 2002-2003\n\nmunicipal        budget    (the     only     relief      against       the    municipality\n\nplaintiffs now claim to be seeking), we agree that the public\ninterest considerations brought forth by the municipality are not\n\nfrivolous. See Olympia Equipment Leasing Corp., 786 F.2d at 796\n\n(\"inflexible requirement of a bond\" may be inappropriate in certain\nsituations). However, these arguments have not yet been presented\n\nin the district court.\n            As for the individual Adjuntas defendants, Puerto Rico\n\nlaw provides that the Commonwealth will in certain cases \"assume\n\nthe   payment      of     any   judgment     that       may   be    entered        against   an\n\n[official of the Commonwealth sued in his personal capacity]\" due\n\n      5\n      See Marandino v. D'Elia, 151 F.R.D. 227, 228 (D.Conn. 1993)\n(judgment debtor not entitled to automatic stay under Rule 62(f)\nbecause Connecticut law required that certificate be filed in\nrecord office before lien was created); Aldasoro v. Kennerson, 915\nF.Supp. 188, 190-91 (S.D. Cal. 1995) (Rule 62(f) inapplicable\nbecause to create lien judgment creditor must file judgment in\noffice of County Recorder).\n\n                                             -8-\n\fto \"acts or omissions committed in good faith in the course of his\n\nemployment and within the scope of his functions.\"                32 L.P.R.A. §\n\n3085.    Since the individual defendants have not shown that the\nCommonwealth will find that the acts in the instant case were\n\n\"committed    in   good   faith,\"   the       possibility    exists    that    the\n\nCommonwealth will not assume payment of the judgment.                  Thus, the\ndistrict court      did   not   abuse    its   discretion    in     ordering   the\n\nindividual defendants to post a supersedeas bond.\n\n             Ordinarily, the failure of the municipalities thus far to\n\njustify stays would resolve the issue of interim relief.                However,\n\nat the very least, the municipalities and the individual defendants\n\nshould be given time to post supersedeas bonds; and, if they have\n\nany arguments as to why bonds in the full amount of the judgments\nare unnecessary and why lesser amounts will suffice, we leave it\n\nopen to the district court to entertain such arguments.\n\n             Accordingly, we deny the stays sought and vacate our\ncurrent temporary stay effective 10 days from the date of this\n\norder.     During    that   period,      the    defendants    can    post   bonds\n\nconsistent with Rule 62(d) or return to the district court for any\n\nother relief including extensions of time or reductions in amount\n\nthat that court may in its discretion be prepared to afford.                   The\n\nmotion made by defendants/appellants in the Gurabo case \"requesting\n\ncertification to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\" is denied.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f",
