Demissie with whom Doherty & Demissie was on\nbrief for petitioner.\n\n          Janice K. Redfern, Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, with whom Robert D. McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, and Christopher C. Fuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, were\non brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          April 8, 2003\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        Diland Herbert is a native and\n\ncitizen of Trinidad and Tobago, a lawful permanent resident of the\n\nUnited States for almost twenty-five years, and the father of a\n\nten-year-old American citizen.     He petitions for review of the\n\ndenial of his motion to reopen a decision in absentia to deport\n\nhim.   The motion was denied because he was approximately thirty\n\nminutes late for his hearing on January 11, 2002.         8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229a(b)(5)(A) (2000).     This is, however, not a tardiness case\n\nalone; there are other unusual circumstances.       In light of these\n\nunusual circumstances, we grant the petition for review, reverse\n\nthe denial of the motion to review, and remand to the agency for\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Herbert's problems started with a criminal conviction in\n\n1999 for domestic abuse of a woman who is now his fiancee and the\n\nmother of his child.     Herbert pled guilty in Massachusetts state\n\ncourt to family abuse/assault and battery, assault and battery on\n\na police officer, and resisting arrest.        Herbert was originally\n\nsentenced to two years in prison; the court, however, granted his\n\nmotion to reduce the sentence to a 364-day suspended sentence. The\n\nINS charged Herbert with being subject to removal from the United\n\nStates under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) on the grounds that he\n\nhad been convicted of an aggravated felony and sentenced to at\n\nleast a year in prison.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f              The INS action led to a series of hearings beginning in\n\nSeptember      2000    before   immigration     judges   in     Louisiana     and\n\nMassachusetts.        Herbert appeared at all but one of these hearings;\n\nat the Louisiana hearing where Herbert did not appear, Herbert's\n\ncounsel informed the court that Herbert had moved to Massachusetts\n\nand requested, and obtained, a change of venue to the Boston\n\nImmigration Court. Counsel retained by Herbert appeared at several\n\nhearings and may have participated in all of them.             At a hearing in\n\nBoston   on    January    10,   2001,   Herbert    admitted    the   charge    of\n\nremovability but requested an opportunity to apply for cancellation\n\nof removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b).             Herbert submitted evidence\n\nshowing that his sentence had been reduced to less than a year,\n\nwhich rendered him eligible for cancellation.                The next day, the\n\nINS responded by filing an amended notice to appear that charged\n\nHerbert with removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), based\n\non his conviction for a crime of domestic violence.               In response,\n\nHerbert again admitted the charge of removability, but applied for\n\ncancellation     of    removal.     Herbert's      amended    application     was\n\nadmitted at a hearing on June 12, 2001.             At the June 12 hearing,\n\nthe IJ continued the case until January 11, 2002 and personally\n\nserved Herbert and his counsel with notice of the next hearing.\n\n              The hearing on January 11, 2002 was scheduled for 1 p.m.\n\nAt approximately 10:50 a.m. that day, Herbert's attorney, Stephen\n\nLagana, filed an emergency motion for continuance with the IJ. The\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fmotion explained that Attorney Lagana had been ordered to appear\n\nbefore a magistrate judge in federal district court for a hearing\n\nin another matter, continued from the preceding day.             Lagana, who\n\nhad told Herbert in a phone conversation on January 8, 2002 that he\n\nwould be at Herbert's hearing, never communicated to Herbert or\n\nHerbert's family that he would be unable to participate.                 Later\n\nthat day, Herbert told the IJ's clerk that he had expected Lagana\n\nto be there at the hearing to represent him.\n\n             Though Herbert himself arrived late, Herbert's mother,\n\nAngela Herbert-Thomas, and grandmother, Elty S. Herbert, arrived at\n\nthe courthouse at 12:00 p.m. When Herbert did not arrive promptly,\n\nHerbert-Thomas informed the court personnel that she had spoken\n\nwith Herbert that morning and that he would be arriving shortly.\n\nDespite Herbert-Thomas's statement and Lagana's motion, the IJ\n\nnevertheless proceeded in absentia and ordered Herbert deported to\n\nTrinidad and Tobago.        The motion for a continuance was still\n\npending when the IJ ordered Herbert deported.\n\n             Herbert himself arrived about thirty minutes late for the\n\nhearing.     Herbert and his fiancee, Alisya Dancy, had planned to\n\ntake public transportation to the hearing together with their\n\nchild, but they elected to call a cab instead since it was raining\n\nand their child was recovering from a throat infection.              Herbert\n\nand Dancy called the cab slightly after 12:00 p.m. and it arrived\n\nat   12:30   p.m.    The   cab   was    delayed   by   heavy   traffic   along\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fMassachusetts Avenue and I-93 North and arrived at the courthouse\n\nat 1:20 p.m.     Herbert and Dancy were further delayed by a line at\n\nthe   courthouse   entrance   and   did   not    actually    arrive    at   the\n\ncourtroom until around 1:30 p.m.       After he arrived, Herbert spoke\n\nto the IJ's clerk, who advised him that he had 180 days to file a\n\nmotion to reopen.\n\n           Herbert,   who   retained   different    counsel     at    Lagana's\n\nsuggestion, filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings on\n\nApril 11, 2002 and an amended motion to reopen on April 16, 2002.\n\nIn the motion, Herbert argued that his attorney's unexpected\n\nfailure to appear, the heavy rainfall and traffic congestion, and\n\nhis   family's   presence   and   communication    with     court    personnel\n\ntogether constituted extraordinary circumstances within the meaning\n\nof 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) (2002).           In support of his motion,\n\nHerbert submitted affidavits from himself, Dancy, Herbert-Thomas,\n\nElty, and his new attorney, and a copy of Lagana's emergency motion\n\nfor continuance.\n\n           The IJ denied Herbert's motion in a written decision on\n\nApril 26, 2002.    The IJ held, \"Pendency of a motion for continuance\n\nwill not excuse appearance of the respondent at any scheduled\n\nhearing addressed in the motion.\"         Because the court had not yet\n\ngranted the continuance, the IJ concluded, the mere filing of the\n\nmotion did not excuse Herbert's absence.          The IJ also ruled that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\funexpected traffic and heavy rainfall do not amount to exceptional\n\ncircumstances.      8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).\n\n            Herbert appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. On\n\nJuly 24, 2002, the BIA affirmed, without opinion, the decision of\n\nthe IJ.     This appeal follows.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             Our review of the BIA's denial of the motion to reopen is\n\nfor abuse of discretion.            INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323-24\n\n(1992); Thomas v. INS, 976 F.2d 786, 789 (1st Cir. 1992) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n            Where     the    BIA     has   summarily      affirmed   the     IJ's\n\ndetermination    under      its    streamlined   procedures,    we   treat    the\n\nfindings and conclusion of the IJ as the Board's own opinion.\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003); Chen v. INS,\n\n87 F.3d 5, 8 n.3 (1st Cir. 1996).          The IJ's decision thus stands as\n\nthe final agency decision.            See Albathani, 318 F.3d at 373; 8\n\nC.F.R. § 3.1(a)(7)(iii).\n\n            Several    statutory      provisions    are    pertinent   to    the\n\nanalysis.      The first, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), concerns in\n\nabsentia hearings and provides:\n\n            Any alien who, after written notice . . . has been\n            provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record,\n            does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be\n            ordered removed in absentia if the [INS] establishes by\n            clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the\n            written notice was so provided and that the alien is\n            removable . . . .\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          A petition for review challenging an order entered in\n\nabsentia is, by statute, \"confined to (i) the validity of the\n\nnotice provided to the alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien's not\n\nattending the proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the alien is\n\nremovable.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(D).      The first and third\n\nclauses are not at issue.    The adequacy of the agency's reasoning\n\nunder the second clause is reviewed, as stated, for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n          Congress also gave guidance as to when a timely motion to\n\nreopen should be allowed:\n\n          Such an order may be rescinded only --\n                 (i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days\n          after the date of the order of removal if the alien\n          demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of\n          exceptional circumstances    (as defined in subsection\n          (e)(1) of this section)[.]\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).    Subsection (e)(1) provides:\n\n          The   term   \"exceptional    circumstances\"   refers   to\n          exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the\n          alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child,\n          or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling\n          circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).      We focus here on the requirement of\n\n\"exceptional circumstances . . . beyond the control of the alien.\"\n\n          These restrictions were adopted in response to a serious\n\nproblem: some aliens deliberately did not appear for hearings and\n\nthus effectively extended their stay in this country.   This tactic\n\nimposed considerable costs on the INS and disrupted its efforts to\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fpromptly schedule and hear requests for discretionary relief from\n\nremoval.   This court has taken the restrictions seriously.\n\n           In Thomas, this court held, over the dissent of then-\n\nJudge Breyer, that where the petitioner and his attorney appeared\n\napproximately thirty minutes late, counsel had made no effort to\n\ncontact the judge and inform him they would be delayed, and\n\nprevious   absences   by    the   attorney   (including   one   without\n\nexplanation) had necessitated continuances, there was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in denying a motion to reopen.       See 976 F.2d at 788,\n\n790.   Thomas was the last and apparently only occasion on which\n\nthis court addressed a similar issue.\n\n           Other circuits have sometimes found error in denial of\n\nmotions to reopen when the petitioner was tardy.           See, e.g.,\n\nNazarova v. INS, 171 F.3d 478, 484 (7th Cir. 1999) (holding that\n\nBIA abused its discretion by upholding IJ's denial of motion to\n\nreopen where alien was two hours late because she was waiting for\n\nher interpreter); Jerezano v. INS, 169 F.3d 613, 615 (9th Cir.\n\n1999) (reversing denial of alien's motion to reopen where alien\n\n\"was 15 to 20 minutes late, but arrived while the IJ was still on\n\nthe bench\").\n\n           We think this is one of those rare cases in which\n\nexceptional circumstances exist. The totality of the circumstances\n\nmust be considered.        The most important factor to us is that\n\nHerbert's counsel timely notified the IJ that he had been required\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fto appear that day in U.S. District Court and therefore requested\n\na continuance of the immigration hearing.          The IJ did not act on\n\nthat motion, but rather conducted an in absentia hearing. We would\n\nthink that ordinarily a requirement by a federal judge that counsel\n\nappear in federal court would be given precedence.               The IJ, in\n\ndenying the motion to reopen, rejected this circumstance with the\n\ncomment that until he granted the continuance \"all parties must\n\nattend the hearing and be prepared to go forward.\"         It appears it\n\nwas   not   possible   for   Herbert's   counsel   to   attend    separate,\n\ncontemporaneous hearings before the federal magistrate judge and\n\nthe IJ -- that is why the continuance was requested.1               In that\n\nsense, the IJ's rejection of the motion for continuance as a reason\n\nto reopen was arbitrary and it was capricious.\n\n            As for the stated need of the parties to be present while\n\nthe IJ decided the motion for continuance, there are two responses.\n\nFirst, under the regulations, Herbert was entitled to have counsel\n\npresent.    See Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"Aliens have a statutory right to be represented by counsel, at\n\ntheir own expense, in deportation proceedings.          That right is an\n\nintegral part of the procedural due process to which the alien is\n\nentitled.\") (citation and internal quotation omitted); see also\n\n\n      1\n       The record shows that counsel had appeared with Herbert at\nprior hearings.   There is nothing in the record to suggest the\nmotion for a continuance was a ploy to avoid the deportation\nhearing. Indeed, Herbert's relatives and witnesses were apparently\nalready on their way to the hearing when the motion was filed.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fRomero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 1994) (\"As the\n\nSupreme Court has noted, 'a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness\n\nin the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right\n\nto defend with counsel an empty formality.'\") (quoting Ungar v.\n\nSarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964)).     It is highly improbable, to\n\nsay the least, that Herbert would have chosen to go forward without\n\nhis counsel on a matter of such importance to him.   Second, Herbert\n\nbelieved his counsel would be there for the hearing -- he did not\n\nknow of the motion for continuance.     Had his counsel been there at\n\n1 p.m., counsel would have explained, as Herbert's relatives did,\n\nthat Herbert was on his way.     Since the relatives were witnesses,\n\ntheir testimony could have been taken first, and there would have\n\nbeen no delay.   Cf. Jerezano, 169 F.3d at 615 (\"It is accepted\n\npractice for courts to give tardy litigants a second chance by\n\nputting them at the end of the calendar, and it seems both harsh\n\nand unrealistic to treat as a nonappearance a litigant's failure to\n\nbe in the courtroom at the precise moment his case is called.\").\n\nWe question whether, on these unique facts, there was even a true\n\n\"failure to appear.\"   See id.\n\n          We would agree with the INS that if there were meaningful\n\ndelay and if this were a simple situation of Herbert miscalculating\n\nhow long it would take him to get to the hearing room on a winter's\n\nday in Boston, this rationale would not suffice to overturn a\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdenial of a motion to reopen.2    See, e.g., Sharma v. INS, 89 F.3d\n\n545, 547-48 (9th Cir. 1996).    But that situation is not this case,\n\nand here the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying\n\nthe motion to reopen.    The circumstances in this case were in fact\n\nexceptional.   See Nazarova, 171 F.3d at 484 (\"We . . . agree with\n\nthe Second Circuit that, when an IJ's decision to enter an in\n\nabsentia deportation order and her subsequent refusal to reopen the\n\norder threaten the alien's constitutional or statutory rights,\n\ncircumstances may exist that are sufficiently exceptional to excuse\n\nnonappearance and warrant remand.\"); Romero-Morales, 25 F.3d at 129\n\n(identifying the alien's good faith reliance on counsel and the\n\navailability of relatives to testify on his behalf as factors that\n\ncould contribute to a finding that extraordinary circumstances\n\nexist).\n\n           Accordingly, we grant the petition, vacate the denial of\n\nthe motion to reopen, and remand to the agency with directions that\n\nHerbert be permitted to present his claims for cancellation of\n\nremoval.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n                          *Dissent follows*\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       We do not reach the claim of denial of due process or the\nquestion of what role the child's illness should play in the\nanalysis.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f              CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.      I would remand\n\nthis case for further proceedings due to the fact that the record\n\non   appeal    is   insufficiently   developed   to   enable   a   reliable\n\nappellate determination as to whether the denial of the motion to\n\nreopen constitutes an abuse of discretion, let alone an arbitrary\n\nand capricious agency action.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

This tactic imposed considerable costs on the INS and disrupted its efforts to promptly schedule and hear requests for discretionary relief from removal. This court has taken the restrictions seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Thomas,</i> this court held, over the dissent of then-Judge Breyer, that where the petitioner and his attorney appeared approximately thirty minutes late, counsel had made no effort to contact the judge and inform him they would be delayed, and previous absences by the attorney (including one without explanation) had necessitated continuances, there was no abuse of discretion in denying a motion to reopen. <i>See</i> 976 F.2d at 788, 790. <i>Thomas</i> was the last and apparently only occasion on which this court addressed a similar issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have sometimes found error in denial of motions to reopen when the petitioner was tardy. <i>See, e.g., Nazarova v. INS,</i> 171 F.3d 478, 484 (7th Cir.1999) (holding that BIA abused its discretion by upholding IJ's denial of motion to reopen where alien was two hours late because she was waiting for her interpreter); <i>Jerezano v. INS,</i> 169 F.3d 613, 615 (9th Cir.1999) (reversing denial of alien's motion to reopen where alien \"was 15 to 20 minutes late, but arrived while the IJ was still on the bench\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this is one of those rare cases in which exceptional circumstances exist. The totality of the circumstances must be considered. The most important factor to us is that Herbert's counsel timely notified the IJ that he had been required to appear that day in U.S. District Court and therefore requested a continuance of the immigration hearing. The IJ did not act on that motion, but rather conducted an in absentia hearing. We would think that ordinarily a requirement by a federal judge that counsel appear in federal court would be given precedence. The IJ, in denying the motion to reopen, rejected this circumstance with the comment that until he granted the continuance \"all parties must attend the hearing and be prepared to go forward.\" It appears it was not possible for Herbert's counsel to attend separate, contemporaneous hearings before the federal magistrate judge and the IJ &#8212; that is why the continuance was requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In that sense, the IJ's rejection of the motion for continuance as a reason to reopen was arbitrary and it was capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the stated need of the parties to be present while the IJ decided the motion for continuance, there are two responses. First, under the regulations, Herbert was entitled to have counsel present. <i>See Saakian v. INS,</i> 252 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Aliens have a statutory right to be represented by counsel, at their own expense, in deportation proceedings. That right is an integral part of the procedural due process to which the alien is entitled.\") (citation and internal quotation omitted); <i>see also Romero-Morales v. INS,</i> 25 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir.1994) (\"As the Supreme Court has noted, `a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.'\") (quoting <i>Ungar v. Sarafite,</i> 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964)). It is highly improbable, to say the least, that Herbert would have chosen to go forward without his counsel on a matter of such importance to him. Second, Herbert believed his counsel would be there for the hearing &#8212; he did not know of the motion for continuance. Had his counsel been there at 1 p.m., counsel would have explained, as Herbert's relatives did, that Herbert was on his way. Since the relatives were witnesses, their testimony could have been taken first, and there would have been no delay. <i>Cf. Jerezano,</i> 169 F.3d at 615 (\"It is accepted practice for courts to give tardy litigants a second chance by putting them at the end of the calendar, and it seems both harsh and unrealistic to treat as a nonappearance a litigant's failure to be in the courtroom at the precise moment his case is called.\"). We question whether, on these unique facts, there was even a true \"failure to appear.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would agree with the INS that if there were meaningful delay and if this were a simple situation of Herbert miscalculating how long it would take him to get to the hearing room on a winter's day in Boston, this rationale would not suffice to overturn a denial of a motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Sharma v. INS,</i> 89 F.3d 545, 547-48 (9th Cir.1996). But that situation is not this case, and here the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the motion to reopen. The circumstances in this case were in fact exceptional. <i>See Nazarova,</i> 171 F.3d at 484 (\"We ... agree with the Second Circuit that, when an IJ's decision to enter an in absentia deportation order and her subsequent refusal to reopen the order threaten the alien's constitutional or statutory rights, circumstances may exist that are sufficiently exceptional to excuse nonappearance and warrant remand.\"); <i>Romero-Morales,</i> 25 F.3d at 129 (identifying the alien's good faith reliance on counsel and the availability of relatives to testify on his behalf as factors that could contribute to a finding that extraordinary circumstances exist).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> the petition, <i>vacate</i> the denial of the motion to reopen, and <i>remand</i> to the agency with directions that Herbert be permitted to present his claims for cancellation of removal. So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record shows that counsel had appeared with Herbert at prior hearings.

He petitions for review of the denial of his motion to reopen a decision in absentia to deport him. The motion was denied because he was approximately thirty minutes late for his hearing on January 11, 2002. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(A) (2000). This is, however, not a tardiness case alone; there are other unusual circumstances. In light of these unusual circumstances, we grant the petition for review, reverse the denial of the motion to review, and remand to the agency for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Herbert's problems started with a criminal conviction in 1999 for domestic abuse of a woman who is now his fiancee and the mother of his child. Herbert pled guilty in Massachusetts state court to family abuse/assault and battery, assault and battery on a police officer, and resisting arrest. Herbert was originally sentenced to two years in prison; the court, however, granted his motion to reduce the sentence to a 364-day suspended sentence. The INS charged Herbert with being subject to removal from the United States under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) on the grounds that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony and sentenced to at least a year in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS action led to a series of hearings beginning in September 2000 before immigration judges in Louisiana and Massachusetts. Herbert appeared at all but one of these hearings; at the Louisiana hearing where Herbert did not appear, Herbert's counsel informed the court that Herbert had moved to Massachusetts and requested, and obtained, a change of venue to the Boston Immigration Court. Counsel retained by Herbert appeared at several hearings and may have participated in all of them. At a hearing in Boston on January 10, 2001, Herbert admitted the charge of removability but requested an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(b). Herbert submitted evidence showing that his sentence had been reduced to less than a year, which rendered him eligible for cancellation. The next day, the INS responded by filing an amended notice to appear that charged Herbert with removability under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), based on his conviction for a crime of domestic violence. In response, Herbert again admitted the charge of removability, but applied for cancellation of removal. Herbert's amended application was admitted at a hearing on June 12, 2001.

The first, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(A), concerns in absentia hearings and provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any alien who, after written notice ... has been provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed in absentia if the [INS] establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A petition for review challenging an order entered in absentia is, by statute, \"confined to (i) the validity of the notice provided to the alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien's not attending the proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the alien is removable.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(D). The first and third clauses are not at issue. The adequacy of the agency's reasoning under the second clause is reviewed, as stated, for abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress also gave guidance as to when a timely motion to reopen should be allowed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an order may be rescinded only &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section)[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(b)(5)(C). Subsection (e)(1) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"exceptional circumstances\" refers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(e)(1).

This tactic imposed considerable costs on the INS and disrupted its efforts to promptly schedule and hear requests for discretionary relief from removal. This court has taken the restrictions seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Thomas,</i> this court held, over the dissent of then-Judge Breyer, that where the petitioner and his attorney appeared approximately thirty minutes late, counsel had made no effort to contact the judge and inform him they would be delayed, and previous absences by the attorney (including one without explanation) had necessitated continuances, there was no abuse of discretion in denying a motion to reopen. <i>See</i> 976 F.2d at 788, 790. <i>Thomas</i> was the last and apparently only occasion on which this court addressed a similar issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have sometimes found error in denial of motions to reopen when the petitioner was tardy. <i>See, e.g., Nazarova v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762573\"><a href=\"/opinion/762573/natalia-nazarova-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 484 (7th Cir.1999) (holding that BIA abused its discretion by upholding IJ's denial of motion to reopen where alien was two hours late because she was waiting for her interpreter); <i>Jerezano v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762179\"><a href=\"/opinion/762179/99-cal-daily-op-serv-1558-1999-daily-journal-dar-1997-rudy-gabriel/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span>, 615 (9th Cir.1999) (reversing denial of alien's motion to reopen where alien \"was 15 to 20 minutes late, but arrived while the IJ was still on the bench\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this is one of those rare cases in which exceptional circumstances exist. The totality of the circumstances must be considered. The most important factor to us is that Herbert's counsel timely notified the IJ that he had been required to appear that day in U.S. District Court and therefore requested a continuance of the immigration hearing. The IJ did not act on that motion, but rather conducted an in absentia hearing. We would think that ordinarily a requirement by a federal judge that counsel appear in federal court would be given precedence. The IJ, in denying the motion to reopen, rejected this circumstance with the comment that until he granted the continuance \"all parties must attend the hearing and be prepared to go forward.\" It appears it was not possible for Herbert's counsel to attend separate, contemporaneous hearings before the federal magistrate judge and the IJ &#8212; that is why the continuance was requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In that sense, the IJ's rejection of the motion for continuance as a reason to reopen was arbitrary and it was capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the stated need of the parties to be present while the IJ decided the motion for continuance, there are two responses. First, under the regulations, Herbert was entitled to have counsel present. <i>See Saakian v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199426\"><a href=\"/opinion/199426/saakian-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Aliens have a statutory right to be represented by counsel, at their own expense, in deportation proceedings. That right is an integral part of the procedural due process to which the alien is entitled.\") (citation and internal quotation omitted); <i>see also Romero-Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670688\"><a href=\"/opinion/670688/porfirio-romero-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 130-31 (2d Cir.1994) (\"As the Supreme Court has noted, `a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.'\") (quoting <i>Ungar v. Sarafite,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106786\"><a href=\"/opinion/106786/ungar-v-sarafite/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 589, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106786\"><a href=\"/opinion/106786/ungar-v-sarafite/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106786\"><a href=\"/opinion/106786/ungar-v-sarafite/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span> (1964)). It is highly improbable, to say the least, that Herbert would have chosen to go forward without his counsel on a matter of such importance to him. Second, Herbert believed his counsel would be there for the hearing &#8212; he did not know of the motion for continuance. Had his counsel been there at 1 p.m., counsel would have explained, as Herbert's relatives did, that Herbert was on his way. Since the relatives were witnesses, their testimony could have been taken first, and there would have been no delay. <i>Cf. Jerezano,</i> 169 F.3d at 615 (\"It is accepted practice for courts to give tardy litigants a second chance by putting them at the end of the calendar, and it seems both harsh and unrealistic to treat as a nonappearance a litigant's failure to be in the courtroom at the precise moment his case is called.\"). We question whether, on these unique facts, there was even a true \"failure to appear.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would agree with the INS that if there were meaningful delay and if this were a simple situation of Herbert miscalculating how long it would take him to get to the hearing room on a winter's day in Boston, this rationale would not suffice to overturn a denial of a motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Sharma v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721557\"><a href=\"/opinion/721557/96-cal-daily-op-serv-5242-96-daily-journal-dar-8473-vikesh-datt/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 547-48 (9th Cir.1996). But that situation is not this case, and here the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the motion to reopen. The circumstances in this case were in fact exceptional. <i>See Nazarova,</i> 171 F.3d at 484 (\"We ... agree with the Second Circuit that, when an IJ's decision to enter an in absentia deportation order and her subsequent refusal to reopen the order threaten the alien's constitutional or statutory rights, circumstances may exist that are sufficiently exceptional to excuse nonappearance and warrant remand.\"); <i>Romero-Morales,</i> 25 F.3d at 129 (identifying the alien's good faith reliance on counsel and the availability of relatives to testify on his behalf as factors that could contribute to a finding that extraordinary circumstances exist).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> the petition, <i>vacate</i> the denial of the motion to reopen, and <i>remand</i> to the agency with directions that Herbert be permitted to present his claims for cancellation of removal. So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record shows that counsel had appeared with Herbert at prior hearings.
