William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Francisco Objio on brief pro se.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Mark W. Pearlstein\nand Allison D. Burroughs, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                       November 28, 2000\n\f             Per Curiam.          After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties submissions, we reverse the appellant’s\n\nconviction     on    Count    10   of   the      indictment       and   affirm   the\n\nconvictions on Counts 9 and 11.\n\n             With regard to Count 10, we see no evidence in the\n\nrecord from which a rational jury could have concluded that\n\nanyone   with    whom      appellant    Francisco         Objio    (“Objio”)      was\n\nassociated actually possessed cocaine on or about the date\n\ncharged.     It seems clear that a group of individuals (with whom\n\nthe   government      claimed       Objio     was   associated)         planned     a\n\ntransaction for July 19, 1997.                It also is undisputed that\n\nthose    plans      fell   through      and      that   the   transaction         was\n\nrescheduled for July 21, 1997.                   But we see no evidence to\n\nindicate whether that deal actually was completed as planned.\n\nNothing is contained in the recorded conversations which would\n\nindicate that the deal had been completed.                          Further, the\n\ngovernment’s cooperating witness did not testify that the deal\n\never happened.       He only stated that he purchased cocaine from\n\nco-defendant        Osvaldo    Maldonado         (a/k/a     “Pepe”)       on   three\n\noccasions in July 1997.             He was never asked whether one of\n\nthose three occasions was on or about July 21.                      And we do not\n\nthink    a   rational      jury    could    so    infer    from     the    evidence\n\npresented.\n\n             In order to establish Objio’s liability as an aider\n\nand abettor, the government was required to show that someone\n\fwith whom he was associated actually committed the charged\n\ncrime (i.e., possession of cocaine with intent to distribute).\n\nSee United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 998 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).       Since we see no proof that anyone managed to\n\ncomplete the deal as planned, we must reverse the conviction on\n\nCount 10.\n\n              We do think the evidence was sufficient to convict on\n\nCounts 9 and 11.        With regard to count 11, the cooperating\n\nwitness testified that the group was planning a one kilogram\n\npurchase on the day in question.              He also testified that a\n\nmember   of    the   group    (“Pepe”)     paid   others,     including   co-\n\ndefendant     Francisco      Mata   (“Mata”),     $500   to   transport   the\n\ncocaine.    And because the cocaine was seized from Mata while he\n\nwas transporting it, we know that someone associated with the\n\ngroup    (namely,     Mata)     committed       the    substantive    crime:\n\npossession with intent to distribute.                 A rational jury could\n\nfurther conclude that in recorded phone conversations earlier\n\nin the day, other members of the group were discussing the\n\nprice to be paid for the cocaine and were trying to determine\n\nwhether they had enough cash to make the purchase.                   In this\n\ncontext, the remark, “And Cuchi (Objio’s a/k/a) have like\n\nseven” could be interpreted by a rational jury to mean that\n\nObjio was contributing a portion of the purchase price.               Though\n\nthe remark is open to other interpretations, it was the jury’s\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\ftask to interpret the remark.      We find that in light of all the\n\nevidence,    the   jury’s   interpretation     of   the     evidence   was\n\nrational.\n\n            For the same reasons, the conviction for conspiracy\n\nunder Count 9 should stand.\n\n            Finally,   we   see   no   plain   error   in    the   court’s\n\ninstructions.      The instruction with regard to             aiding and\n\nabetting a crime adequately set out the requirements for a\n\nconviction.     See United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d\n\nat 998 (citing Nye & Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 619\n\n(1949)).    To the extent any of the challenged instructions were\n\nerroneous, those alleged errors cannot constitute plain error,\n\nas they concern issues which were not seriously in dispute at\n\ntrial.     See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 469-70\n\n(1997) (where issue “was essentially uncontroverted at trial .\n\n. . and has remained so on appeal,” error in jury instructions\n\nwas not plain error).\n\n            Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part;\n\nmatter remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
