John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jonathan G. Mermin, with whom Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau &\nPachios, LLP, was on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 12, 2009\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.                Appellant Frank Arbour pled\n\nguilty to five counts in an indictment that charged him with\n\nconspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and\n\ncocaine base, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); being a felon in possession of\n\nfirearms, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); and possessing stolen firearms, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(j).            The district court sentenced Arbour to 100\n\nmonths' imprisonment.           He appeals his sentence only.\n\n            This case presents one issue:                 whether the sentencing\n\ncourt erroneously concluded that Arbour was a \"leader or organizer\"\n\nof a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or\n\nwas otherwise extensive.            See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a).           The district\n\ncourt's affirmative finding resulted in a four-level increase in\n\nArbour's offense level.\n\n            Arbour argues that the district court's conclusion was\n\nerroneous for two reasons.                First, he asserts that he was not\n\ninvolved in a single criminal activity but rather in a number of\n\nseparate, unconnected criminal activities.                 None of these criminal\n\nactivities       standing      alone,   Arbour    says,     satisfy    §   3B1.1(a)'s\n\nrequirement       that   the    criminal       activity    involve    five   or   more\n\nparticipants or be \"otherwise extensive.\"                  Second, he argues that\n\neven   if   he    was    involved    in    a   single     criminal    activity    that\n\nsatisfied § 3B1.1(a)'s numerosity or extensiveness requirement, he\n\ncould not be properly characterized as a leader or organizer of\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\ffive participants in the criminal activity.                   We disagree with\n\nArbour's contentions and affirm his sentence.\n\n                                  I.     Facts\n\n            Because Arbour's conviction resulted from a guilty plea,\n\nwe   draw   the   facts   from    the    plea     colloquy,   the   Presentence\n\nInvestigation Report and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.\n\nSee United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            For   a   period     of     roughly    eighteen    months,   Arbour\n\ntrafficked in powder cocaine and crack cocaine in Maine.                 Arbour\n\nsupplied a number of individuals with drugs for purposes of both\n\nresale and consumption.        Included among these individuals was Roy\n\nDubreil, who sold both forms of cocaine to others, often from his\n\nhome.    At some point, Arbour moved in with Dubreil.\n\n            While Arbour was operating his drug trafficking business,\n\nhe collected a number of firearms.                Because he was a convicted\n\nfelon, Arbour was prohibited from purchasing the firearms himself\n\nand therefore he enlisted three others to purchase the weapons for\n\nhim.    Two of these straw men, John Jackson and John Giannelli, were\n\nfamiliar to Arbour from his drug trafficking business. Jackson was\n\none of Arbour's customers and also occasionally delivered drugs for\n\nArbour. Giannelli frequently bought drugs from Dubreil. For their\n\nservices in purchasing firearms for him, Arbour paid both Jackson\n\nand Giannelli with drugs.             Arbour paid Baron Thompson, a third\n\nperson he enlisted to purchase firearms, in cash.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            The three ersatz buyers acquired a total of six firearms\n\nfrom a hardware store in Maine.           Thompson alone purchased three\n\nfirearms.   Unable to purchase firearms himself because of his age,\n\nJackson acquired two weapons indirectly, by enlisting a woman of\n\nage, Crystal Landry, to purchase the firearms for him.           Arbour was\n\ndirectly involved in Giannelli's purchase from the hardware store,\n\naccompanying Giannelli to the store and discretely identifying the\n\nfirearm he desired.1\n\n            The   firearms   that   Thompson,    Jackson   and   Giannelli\n\nacquired for Arbour soon left Arbour's possession.               Giannelli\n\ntestified that, on the date of his purchase of the weapon, he\n\nwitnessed a number of people from out of state arrive at Dubreil's\n\nhome.   According to Giannelli, the visitors supplied Arbour with\n\ndrugs from Massachusetts, receiving money or \"goods\" in exchange.\n\nGiannelli observed the men going into a room with Arbour and\n\nDubreil. Afterward, when Giannelli asked Dubreil where the firearm\n\nhe had purchased for Arbour was, Dubreil told him that it was\n\n\"already gone.\"    Of the three weapons Thompson had purchased, two\n\nof them were discovered in the possession of a Massachusetts\n\nresident during a search of that person's home by law enforcement.\n\nThat individual was also in the possession of seventy bags of\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Thompson, Jackson, Landry and Giannelli were all convicted of\nvarious firearms offenses for their roles in these purchases.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcocaine.     The firearms acquired by Jackson and Landry were never\n\nfound, either in Arbour's possession or anywhere else.\n\n            Eventually, the authorities investigated Arbour's drug\n\ntrafficking operation, ultimately searching Arbour's and Dubreil's\n\nresidence. In Arbour's room, the police discovered bedroom scales,\n\nplastic     baggies    with   cocaine   residue,   three    firearms,   and\n\nammunition.    In Dubreil's room the authorities found ten firearms\n\nand ammunition.       Many of the firearms had been stolen, including\n\nthe three firearms found in Arbour's bedroom.        Arbour subsequently\n\npled guilty to five drug and firearms related charges.\n\n            At Arbour's sentencing hearing, a number of witnesses\n\ntestified about his drug trafficking business and acquisition of\n\nfirearms.    In addition to this testimony, defense counsel conceded\n\nat sentencing that Arbour had traded guns for cocaine on at least\n\none occasion.\n\n            On the basis of sentencing hearing testimony and other\n\nrecord evidence, the district court determined that Arbour was a\n\nleader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or\n\nmore participants or was otherwise extensive.              See § 3B1.1(a).\n\nAlthough the court explicitly found that Arbour's criminal activity\n\ninvolved five or more participants, the court also observed that\n\nthe criminal activity involved both Arbour's drug dealing and his\n\nillegal acquisition of firearms.          The district court also found\n\nthat Arbour held a leadership or organizational role within the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcriminal activity.    When discussing Arbour's status as a leader or\n\norganizer, the court addressed the factors set forth in application\n\nnote four of the guidelines commentary accompanying § 3B1.1(a).\n\nSee § 3B1.1, cmt. n.4.    Although the court observed that not every\n\nfactor counseled in favor of designating Arbour as a leader or\n\norganizer, it found that many of them supported such a designation.\n\nIn addition to noting the nature of Arbour's participation in the\n\ncommission of the offenses, the court found that Arbour recruited\n\naccomplices   and   exercised   decision-making   authority   over   both\n\nJackson and Giannelli.\n\n                           II.    Discussion\n\n          In order to invoke § 3B1.1(a), a district court must make\n\na finding as to scope -- that the criminal activity involved five\n\nor more participants2 or was otherwise extensive -- and a finding\n\nas to status -- that the defendant acted as an organizer and leader\n\nof the criminal activity. United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d\n\n105, 111 (1st Cir. 1995).        The district court's findings must\n\nsatisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard.      United States\n\nv. Pierre, 484 F.3d 75, 89 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          Arbour challenges both the scope and status findings of\n\nthe district court. Because both findings are factbound, we review\n\neach for clear error.     Pierre, 484 F.3d at 89; United States v.\n\n\n2\n  \"A 'participant' is a person who is criminally responsible for\nthe commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\"\n§ 3B1.1, cmt. n.1.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fColón-Muñoz, 318 F.3d 348, 364 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Role-in-the-\n\noffense determinations are innately fact-specific.                   The court of\n\nappeals   must,    therefore,      pay    heed   to   the   sentencing      judge's\n\nviews.\") (quoting United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)).      We will not find clear error unless \"'on the entire\n\nevidence [we are] left with the definite and firm conviction that\n\na mistake has been committed.'\"           United States v. Brown, 298 F.3d\n\n120, 122 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer\n\nCity, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1986)).\n\n                            A.   Scope determination\n\n            Arbour argues that he was not involved in a single\n\ncriminal activity that involved five or more participants or was\n\notherwise extensive.        Rather, he contends that he was involved in\n\nfour   separate    clusters      of   criminal     activity,       none    of   which\n\nindividually      met   §     3B1.1(a)'s       numerosity     or    extensiveness\n\nrequirement. Arbour identifies these four clusters by their direct\n\nparticipants: 1) Arbour, Jackson, and Landry; 2) Arbour, Giannelli\n\nand    Jeremy   Messer;     3)   Arbour    and    Thompson;    and    4)    Arbour,\n\nGiannelli, Dubreil, and Dean James.3             In Arbour's view, each group\n\nwas associated with separate instances of criminal activity -- the\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The government introduced evidence that Messer had asked\nGiannelli to purchase a firearm for Arbour and may have accompanied\nArbour and Giannelli to the hardware store when the purchase was\nmade. James helped collect money for Arbour that related to stolen\ncocaine.\n\n                                         -7-\n\ffirst three were involved in the procurement of firearms and the\n\nfourth, in drug trafficking.\n\n            For § 3B1.1(a) to apply, the criminal activity that the\n\ndefendant   led    or   organized      must   have   involved    five   or   more\n\nparticipants or been extensive.               § 3B1.1(a).     The disjunctive\n\nlanguage of § 3B1.1(a) is important -- a criminal activity may be\n\nextensive even if does not involve five or more participants.                 Id.\n\ncmt. n.3 (\"In assessing whether [a criminal activity] is 'otherwise\n\nextensive,' all persons involved during the course of the entire\n\noffense are to be considered.           Thus, a fraud that involved only\n\nthree   participants     but    used    the    unknowing    services    of   many\n\noutsiders could be considered extensive.\"); see also United States\n\nv. Laboy, 351 F.3d 578, 585 n.10 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"The 'five or\n\nmore    participants'     and    'otherwise      extensive'      elements     are\n\nalternative means of finding the required scope under § 3B1.1.\");\n\nUnited States v. D'Andrea, 107 F.3d 949, 957 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(citing Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 413).\n\n            In addition, a court may look beyond the specific crimes\n\nfor which the defendant was convicted when determining whether the\n\ncriminal    activity    satisfied      the    numerosity    or   extensiveness\n\nrequirement.      Laboy, 351 F.3d at 585-86.         The court may consider\n\nall \"relevant conduct\" surrounding the crimes of conviction.                  Id.\n\nat 586 (rejecting defendant's argument that the assessment was\n\nlimited to the people directly involved in the three drug sales to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwhich      the        defendant      pled      guilty      when      making     the\n\nnumerosity/extensiveness determination).\n\n            Here, the district court did not commit clear error when\n\nit found that Arbour was involved in a criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\n\nAlthough the court found that Arbour's criminal activity met both\n\nthe numerosity and extensiveness requirements of § 3B1.1(a), we\n\nfocus on the extensiveness component.\n\n            When       determining      whether     a    criminal    activity   is\n\nextensive, we have noted that courts should consider \"the totality\n\nof the circumstances, including not only the number of participants\n\nbut also the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the\n\nscheme.\"    Pierre, 484 F.3d at 89 (quoting United States v. Dietz,\n\n950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 1991)).                   Arbour was involved in an\n\nextensive criminal activity -- the trade of drugs for firearms and\n\nvice-versa       --   that   involved    a   host   of   knowing    and   unknowing\n\nparticipants.         This overarching activity encompassed all of the\n\nfour clusters of criminal activity that Arbour identifies.\n\n            Arbour trafficked drugs in Maine for a period of roughly\n\neighteen months, supplying various individuals, including Dubreil,\n\nwith cocaine and crack cocaine.                 In the course of this drug\n\ntrafficking, Arbour unlawfully acquired at least six firearms.                   At\n\nsentencing, the government introduced evidence linking Arbour's\n\nunlawful acquisition of firearms with his drug trafficking.                   On at\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fleast two occasions, Arbour, a convicted felon unable to obtain\n\nfirearms legally, paid others -- in the form of drugs -- to acquire\n\nfirearms for him.         Jackson, who dealt drugs for Arbour on a fairly\n\nregular basis, acquired two firearms for Arbour in order to pay off\n\na drug debt.      In acquiring these firearms for Arbour, Jackson, who\n\nwas   too   young    to    purchase   the   weapons   himself,   employed   the\n\nservices of Landry.           In addition to Jackson, Arbour enlisted\n\nGiannelli to acquire firearms for him, paying Giannelli with\n\ncocaine for his service.\n\n            The     government   also    introduced   evidence   that,   after\n\npaying others drugs to acquire firearms for him, Arbour traded\n\nthese firearms for drugs. First, Giannelli testified that after he\n\nturned a firearm over to Arbour, he witnessed a number of men\n\narrive at Dubreil's home in cars with either Massachusetts or\n\nConnecticut plates.         Giannelli observed the men enter a room with\n\nArbour and Dubreil, and explained that it was his understanding\n\nthat these individuals supplied Arbour with drugs and received\n\n\"goods\" in exchange.         Subsequently, when Giannelli inquired into\n\nthe status of the firearm he purchased for Arbour, Dubreil told him\n\nit was \"already gone.\"\n\n            Second, during a raid of a home in Massachusetts, federal\n\nagents acquired, in addition to a significant amount of cocaine, a\n\nnumber of firearms. Two of these firearms were traced to Thompson,\n\nwho had purchased them at Arbour's direction and expense. Finally,\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fduring the district court proceedings, Arbour's counsel conceded\n\nthat Arbour traded guns for cocaine on at least one occasion.\n\n            In light of the significant evidence of cross-pollination\n\nbetween Arbour's drug and firearms dealings, both in the form of\n\noverlapping goods and criminal participants, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the district court clearly erred in rejecting Arbour's attempt\n\nto compartmentalize his criminal activity into separate, unrelated\n\nclusters.\n\n                         B.     Status determination\n\n            That the record supports the district court's finding\n\nthat   Arbour    was   involved    in    an    extensive     criminal      activity,\n\nhowever, does not end the matter.              United States v. Thiongo, 344\n\nF.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[T]he mere fact that the defendant\n\nwas involved in an extensive criminal activity does not support a\n\nfinding the defendant was an organizer or leader under § 3B.1.\")\n\n(citation    omitted).        To   qualify     for   an    enhancement      under   §\n\n3B1.1(a),    a   defendant     must   have     either     organized   or    led   the\n\ncriminal activity.       Accordingly, we address § 3B1.1(a)'s status\n\ncomponent.\n\n            Arbour's challenge to the district court's status finding\n\nhas two parts.     First, he contends that he did not lead or organize\n\nanyone, but merely interacted with various people during the\n\ncommission of crimes.         Second, Arbour argues implicitly throughout\n\nhis brief that, even if he led or organized some people, he did not\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\flead or organize the number of people required by § 3B1.1(a).                The\n\nmagic number, in Arbour's view, is five or more individuals.\n\n             Arbour's first argument is easily dismissed -- the record\n\nevidence amply supports the district court's finding that Arbour\n\nled    or   organized   criminal     participants     including    Jackson   and\n\nGiannelli.4       Both the guideline commentary and case-law provide\n\ndirection for considering whether a defendant qualifies as a\n\n\"leader or organizer.\"          The guideline commentary provides a non-\n\nexhaustive list of factors that include:                (1) the exercise of\n\ndecision-making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the\n\ncommission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4)\n\nthe claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5)\n\nthe degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense;\n\n(6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the\n\ndegree of control and authority exercised over others. § 3B1.1(a),\n\ncmt. n.4.     \"There need not be proof of each and every factor before\n\na defendant can be termed an organizer or leader.\" Tejada-Beltran,\n\n50 F.3d at 111.\n\n             The case law has further defined the terms leader and\n\norganizer.     \"[T]he term leader implies the exercise of some degree\n\nof    dominance    or   power   in   a   hierarchy,   and   also   implies   the\n\nauthority to ensure that other persons will heed commands.\"                  Id.\n\n\n4\n  The district court did not label Arbour a \"leader\" as opposed to\nan \"organizer\" or vice-versa, appearing to conclude that Arbour\ncould be characterized as both.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fAnd \"[o]ne may be classified as an organizer, though perhaps not as\n\na    leader,    if   he   coordinates   others        so   as    to    facilitate   the\n\ncommission of criminal activity.\"              Id.\n\n               With respect to leading, Arbour, who was at the top of\n\nthe relevant drug dealing operation in Maine, exercised decision-\n\nmaking authority over Giannelli, personally choosing which firearm\n\nhe    wanted    Giannelli    to   purchase.          See   §    3B1.1(a),    cmt.   n.4\n\n(\"exercise of decision-making authority\").                      But the record even\n\nmore clearly supports a characterization of Arbour as an organizer.\n\nThere was evidence that Arbour hatched the plan to acquire firearms\n\nillegally and that he sought out three others, Jackson, Giannelli,\n\nand Thompson, to procure the weapons in his stead.                            See id.\n\n(\"degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense\";\n\n\"nature    of    participation     in   the    commission         of   the   offense\";\n\n\"recruitment of accomplices\").           Arbour's puppetry enabled him to\n\nlater use these firearms as currency in his drug trade.                             See\n\nTejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 112 (\"coordinat[ing] others so as to\n\nfacilitate the commission of criminal activity\").\n\n               We turn finally to the second part of Arbour's challenge,\n\nwhich focuses on what he perceives to be § 3B1.1(a)'s requirement\n\nthat he lead or organize at least five individuals.                            Arbour\n\ncontends that, because he did not lead or organize five others, he\n\ndoes not qualify for an enhancement.             This contention lacks merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f             On at least one occasion, we have acknowledged the\n\npossibility that the number of individuals a defendant must lead or\n\norganize to qualify under § 3B1.1(a) may depend in part on the\n\ndistrict court's scope finding.        Specifically, the question may\n\nhinge on whether the court finds the criminal activity to involve\n\nfive or more participants or whether it finds the activity to be\n\n\"otherwise extensive.\"      See Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 414.          In Rostoff,\n\nwe established that where the defendant is involved in a criminal\n\nactivity that is \"otherwise extensive,\" there is no requirement\n\nthat   the   defendant   \"lead   or   organize\"    at    least    four   other\n\nparticipants.      Id. (\"Unlike numerosity, extensiveness does not\n\ndepend upon a finding that a criminal activity embraced no fewer\n\nthan five criminally responsible participants, much less a finding\n\nthat   the   activity    included   four   or   more    persons    under   the\n\ndefendant's direct control.\").\n\n             But we also noted in Rostoff that \"some courts have held\n\nthat, when the applicability of § 3B1.1(a) depends upon numerosity\n\nrather than extensiveness, the defendant must be shown personally\n\nto have [led or organized] no fewer than four other participants.\"\n\n53 F.3d at 413 n.15 (citations omitted).5         In so noting, we cited\n\ndecisions from the Seventh and Tenth circuits.

Mermin, with whom Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau &amp; Pachios, LLP, was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Appellant Frank Arbour pled guilty to five counts in an indictment that charged him with conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); being a felon in possession of firearms, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); and possessing stolen firearms, 18 U.S.C. § 922(j). The district court sentenced Arbour to 100 months' imprisonment. He appeals his sentence only.</p>\n<p>This case presents one issue: whether the sentencing court erroneously concluded that Arbour was a \"leader or organizer\" of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). The district court's affirmative finding resulted in a four-level increase in Arbour's offense level.</p>\n<p>Arbour argues that the district court's conclusion was erroneous for two reasons. First, he asserts that he was not involved in a single criminal activity but rather in a number of separate, unconnected criminal activities. None of these criminal activities standing alone, Arbour says, satisfy § 3B1.1(a)'s requirement that the criminal activity involve five or more participants or be \"otherwise extensive.\" Second, he argues that even if he was involved in a single criminal activity that satisfied § 3B1.1(a)'s numerosity or extensiveness requirement, he could not be properly characterized as a leader or organizer of five participants in the criminal activity. We disagree with Arbour's contentions and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Arbour's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the plea colloquy, the Presentence Investigation Report and the transcript of the sentencing hearing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>For a period of roughly eighteen months, Arbour trafficked in powder cocaine and crack cocaine in Maine. Arbour supplied a number of individuals with drugs for purposes of both resale and consumption. Included among these individuals was Roy Dubreil, who sold both forms of cocaine to others, often from his home. At some point, Arbour moved in with Dubreil.</p>\n<p>While Arbour was operating his drug trafficking business, he collected a number of firearms. Because he was a convicted felon, Arbour was prohibited from purchasing the firearms himself and therefore he enlisted three others to purchase the weapons for him. Two of these straw men, John Jackson and John Giannelli, were familiar to Arbour from his drug trafficking business. Jackson was one of Arbour's customers and also occasionally delivered drugs for Arbour. Giannelli frequently bought drugs from Dubreil. For <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> their services in purchasing firearms for him, Arbour paid both Jackson and Giannelli with drugs. Arbour paid Baron Thompson, a third person he enlisted to purchase firearms, in cash.</p>\n<p>The three ersatz buyers acquired a total of six firearms from a hardware store in Maine. Thompson alone purchased three firearms. Unable to purchase firearms himself because of his age, Jackson acquired two weapons indirectly, by enlisting a woman of age, Crystal Landry, to purchase the firearms for him. Arbour was directly involved in Giannelli's purchase from the hardware store, accompanying Giannelli to the store and discretely identifying the firearm he desired.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The firearms that Thompson, Jackson and Giannelli acquired for Arbour soon left Arbour's possession. Giannelli testified that, on the date of his purchase of the weapon, he witnessed a number of people from out of state arrive at Dubreil's home. According to Giannelli, the visitors supplied Arbour with drugs from Massachusetts, receiving money or \"goods\" in exchange. Giannelli observed the men going into a room with Arbour and Dubreil. Afterward, when Giannelli asked Dubreil where the firearm he had purchased for Arbour was, Dubreil told him that it was \"already gone.\" Of the three weapons Thompson had purchased, two of them were discovered in the possession of a Massachusetts resident during a search of that person's home by law enforcement. That individual was also in the possession of seventy bags of cocaine. The firearms acquired by Jackson and Landry were never found, either in Arbour's possession or anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the authorities investigated Arbour's drug trafficking operation, ultimately searching Arbour's and Dubreil's residence. In Arbour's room, the police discovered bedroom scales, plastic baggies with cocaine residue, three firearms, and ammunition. In Dubreil's room the authorities found ten firearms and ammunition. Many of the firearms had been stolen, including the three firearms found in Arbour's bedroom. Arbour subsequently pled guilty to five drug and firearms related charges.</p>\n<p>At Arbour's sentencing hearing, a number of witnesses testified about his drug trafficking business and acquisition of firearms. In addition to this testimony, defense counsel conceded at sentencing that Arbour had traded guns for cocaine on at least one occasion.</p>\n<p>On the basis of sentencing hearing testimony and other record evidence, the district court determined that Arbour was a leader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. <i>See</i> § 3B1.1(a). Although the court explicitly found that Arbour's criminal activity involved five or more participants, the court also observed that the criminal activity involved both Arbour's drug dealing and his illegal acquisition of firearms. The district court also found that Arbour held a leadership or organizational role within the criminal activity. When discussing Arbour's status as a leader or organizer, the court addressed the factors set forth in application note four of the guidelines commentary accompanying § 3B1.1(a). <i>See</i> § 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4. Although the court observed that not every factor counseled in favor of designating Arbour as a leader or organizer, it found that many of them supported such a designation. In addition to noting the nature <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> of Arbour's participation in the commission of the offenses, the court found that Arbour recruited accomplices and exercised decision-making authority over both Jackson and Giannelli.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In order to invoke § 3B1.1(a), a district court must make a finding as to scope that the criminal activity involved five or more participants<sup>[2]</sup> or was otherwise extensive and a finding as to statusthat the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of the criminal activity. <i>United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1995). The district court's findings must satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>United States v. Pierre,</i> 484 F.3d 75, 89 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Arbour challenges both the scope and status findings of the district court. Because both findings are factbound, we review each for clear error. <i>Pierre,</i> 484 F.3d at 89; <i>United States v. Colón-Muñoz,</i> 318 F.3d 348, 364 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Role-in-the-offense determinations are innately fact-specific. The court of appeals must, therefore, pay heed to the sentencing judge's views.\") (quoting <i>United States v. Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d 398, 413 (1st Cir.1995)). We will not find clear error unless \"`on the entire evidence [we are] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 298 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C.,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Scope determination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Arbour argues that he was not involved in a single criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Rather, he contends that he was involved in four separate clusters of criminal activity, none of which individually met § 3B1.1(a)'s numerosity or extensiveness requirement. Arbour identifies these four clusters by their direct participants: 1) Arbour, Jackson, and Landry; 2) Arbour, Giannelli and Jeremy Messer; 3) Arbour and Thompson; and 4) Arbour, Giannelli, Dubreil, and Dean James.<sup>[3]</sup> In Arbour's view, each group was associated with separate instances of criminal activitythe first three were involved in the procurement of firearms and the fourth, in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>For § 3B1.1(a) to apply, the criminal activity that the defendant led or organized must have involved five or more participants <i>or</i> been extensive. § 3B1.1(a). The disjunctive language of § 3B1.1(a) is importanta criminal activity may be extensive even if does not involve five or more participants. <i>Id.</i> cmt. n. 3 (\"In assessing whether [a criminal activity] is `otherwise extensive,' all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered. Thus, a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Laboy,</i> 351 F.3d 578, 585 n. 10 (1st Cir.2003) (\"The `five or more participants' and `otherwise extensive' elements are alternative means of finding the required scope under § 3B1.1.\"); <i>United States v. D'Andrea,</i> 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> F.3d 949, 957 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 413).</p>\n<p>In addition, a court may look beyond the specific crimes for which the defendant was convicted when determining whether the criminal activity satisfied the numerosity or extensiveness requirement. <i>Laboy,</i> 351 F.3d at 585-86. The court may consider all \"relevant conduct\" surrounding the crimes of conviction. <i>Id.</i> at 586 (rejecting defendant's argument that the assessment was limited to the people directly involved in the three drug sales to which the defendant pled guilty when making the numerosity/extensiveness determination).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court did not commit clear error when it found that Arbour was involved in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Although the court found that Arbour's criminal activity met both the numerosity and extensiveness requirements of § 3B1.1(a), we focus on the extensiveness component.</p>\n<p>When determining whether a criminal activity is extensive, we have noted that courts should consider \"the totality of the circumstances, including not only the number of participants but also the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.\" <i>Pierre,</i> 484 F.3d at 89 (quoting <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 53 (1st Cir.1991)). Arbour was involved in an extensive criminal activitythe trade of drugs for firearms and vice-versathat involved a host of knowing and unknowing participants. This overarching activity encompassed all of the four clusters of criminal activity that Arbour identifies.</p>\n<p>Arbour trafficked drugs in Maine for a period of roughly eighteen months, supplying various individuals, including Dubreil, with cocaine and crack cocaine. In the course of this drug trafficking, Arbour unlawfully acquired at least six firearms. At sentencing, the government introduced evidence linking Arbour's unlawful acquisition of firearms with his drug trafficking. On at least two occasions, Arbour, a convicted felon unable to obtain firearms legally, paid othersin the form of drugs to acquire firearms for him. Jackson, who dealt drugs for Arbour on a fairly regular basis, acquired two firearms for Arbour in order to pay off a drug debt. In acquiring these firearms for Arbour, Jackson, who was too young to purchase the weapons himself, employed the services of Landry. In addition to Jackson, Arbour enlisted Giannelli to acquire firearms for him, paying Giannelli with cocaine for his service.</p>\n<p>The government also introduced evidence that, after paying others drugs to acquire firearms for him, Arbour traded these firearms for drugs. First, Giannelli testified that after he turned a firearm over to Arbour, he witnessed a number of men arrive at Dubreil's home in cars with either Massachusetts or Connecticut plates. Giannelli observed the men enter a room with Arbour and Dubreil, and explained that it was his understanding that these individuals supplied Arbour with drugs and received \"goods\" in exchange. Subsequently, when Giannelli inquired into the status of the firearm he purchased for Arbour, Dubreil told him it was \"already gone.\"</p>\n<p>Second, during a raid of a home in Massachusetts, federal agents acquired, in addition to a significant amount of cocaine, a number of firearms. Two of these firearms were traced to Thompson, who had purchased them at Arbour's direction and expense. Finally, during the district court proceedings, Arbour's counsel conceded that Arbour traded guns for cocaine on at least one occasion.</p>\n<p>In light of the significant evidence of cross-pollination between Arbour's drug <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> and firearms dealings, both in the form of overlapping goods and criminal participants, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in rejecting Arbour's attempt to compartmentalize his criminal activity into separate, unrelated clusters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Status determination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That the record supports the district court's finding that Arbour was involved in an extensive criminal activity, however, does not end the matter. <i>United States v. Thiongo,</i> 344 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[T]he mere fact that the defendant was involved in an extensive criminal activity does not support a finding the defendant was an organizer or leader under § 3B.1.\") (citation omitted). To qualify for an enhancement under § 3B1.1(a), a defendant must have either organized or led the criminal activity. Accordingly, we address § 3B1.1(a)'s status component.</p>\n<p>Arbour's challenge to the district court's status finding has two parts. First, he contends that he did not lead or organize anyone, but merely interacted with various people during the commission of crimes. Second, Arbour argues implicitly throughout his brief that, even if he led or organized some people, he did not lead or organize the number of people required by § 3B1.1(a). The magic number, in Arbour's view, is five or more individuals.</p>\n<p>Arbour's first argument is easily dismissed the record evidence amply supports the district court's finding that Arbour led or organized criminal participants including Jackson and Giannelli.<sup>[4]</sup> Both the guideline commentary and case-law provide direction for considering whether a defendant qualifies as a \"leader or organizer.\" The guideline commentary provides a non-exhaustive list of factors that include: (1) the exercise of decision-making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. § 3B1.1(a), cmt. n. 4. \"There need not be proof of each and every factor before a defendant can be termed an organizer or leader.\" <i>Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d at 111.</p>\n<p>The case law has further defined the terms leader and organizer. \"[T]he term leader implies the exercise of some degree of dominance or power in a hierarchy, and also implies the authority to ensure that other persons will heed commands.\" <i>Id.</i> And \"[o]ne may be classified as an organizer, though perhaps not as a leader, if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to leading, Arbour, who was at the top of the relevant drug dealing operation in Maine, exercised decisionmaking authority over Giannelli, personally choosing which firearm he wanted Giannelli to purchase. <i>See</i> § 3B1.1(a), cmt. n. 4 (\"exercise of decision-making authority\"). But the record even more clearly supports a characterization of Arbour as an organizer. There was evidence that Arbour hatched the plan to acquire firearms illegally and that he sought out three others, Jackson, Giannelli, and Thompson, to procure the weapons in his stead. <i>See id.</i> (\"degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense\"; \"nature of participation in the commission of the offense\"; \"recruitment of accomplices\"). Arbour's puppetry enabled him to later use these firearms as currency in his drug trade. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> <i>See </i><i>Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d at 112 (\"coordinat[ing] others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity\").</p>\n<p>We turn finally to the second part of Arbour's challenge, which focuses on what he perceives to be § 3B1.1(a)'s requirement that he lead or organize at least five individuals. Arbour contends that, because he did not lead or organize five others, he does not qualify for an enhancement. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p>On at least one occasion, we have acknowledged the possibility that the number of individuals a defendant must lead or organize to qualify under § 3B1.1(a) may depend in part on the district court's scope finding. Specifically, the question may hinge on whether the court finds the criminal activity to involve five or more participants <i>or</i> whether it finds the activity to be \"otherwise extensive.\" <i>See </i><i>Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 414. In <i>Rostoff,</i> we established that where the defendant is involved in a criminal activity that is \"otherwise extensive,\" there is no requirement that the defendant \"lead or organize\" at least four other participants. <i>Id.</i> (\"Unlike numerosity, extensiveness does not depend upon a finding that a criminal activity embraced no fewer than five criminally responsible participants, much less a finding that the activity included four or more persons under the defendant's direct control.\").</p>\n<p>But we also noted in <i>Rostoff</i> that \"some courts have held that, when the applicability of § 3B1.1(a) depends upon numerosity rather than extensiveness, the defendant must be shown personally to have [led or organized] no fewer than four other participants.\" 53 F.3d at 413 n. 15 (citations omitted).<sup>[5]</sup> In so noting, we cited decisions from the Seventh and Tenth circuits. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Carson,</i> 9 F.3d 576, 584 (7th Cir.1993) and <i>United States v. Reid,</i> 911 F.2d 1456, 1465 n. 8 (10th Cir. 1990)).</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, the guideline commentary makes plain that a defendant needs only to have led or organized <i>one</i> criminal participant, besides himself of course, to qualify as a leader or organizer under § 3B1.1(a). § 3B1.1(a), cmt. n. 2 (\"To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor <i>of one or more other participants.\"</i>) (emphasis added). Nearly every circuit court has reached this same conclusion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gaskin,</i> 364 F.3d 438, 466-67 (2d Cir.2004) (\"Defendant need have been an organizer or leader only with respect to any one of these [criminal participants] for the § 3B1.1(a) enhancement to apply.\"); <i>United States v. Harvey,</i> 532 F.3d 326, 338 (4th Cir.2008) (same); <i>United States v. Eis,</i> 322 F.3d 1023 (8th Cir. 2003) (same); <i>United States v.

In fact, the circuits we cited in <i>Rostoff,</i> the Seventh and Tenth, have since abandoned any requirement that the defendant lead or organize at least four others in order to qualify for an enhancement under § 3B1.1(a). <i>See </i><i>Camacho,</i> 137 F.3d at 1224 n. 3; <i>Kamoga,</i> 177 F.3d at 621-22 (noting that § 3B1.1 \"is designed precisely to prevent masterminds <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> of criminal schemes from escaping responsibility for their role simply by delegating some authority to only one or two deputies\").</p>\n<p>Accordingly, both because the district court supportably concluded that Arbour's criminal activity was extensive, <i>see </i><i>Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 413, and because Arbour led or organized one or more of the five or more individuals involved in his criminal activity, he qualifies as a leader or organizer under § 3B1.1.

Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Appellant Frank Arbour pled guilty to five counts in an indictment that charged him with conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); being a felon in possession of firearms, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); and possessing stolen firearms, 18 U.S.C. § 922(j). The district court sentenced Arbour to 100 months' imprisonment. He appeals his sentence only.</p>\n<p>This case presents one issue: whether the sentencing court erroneously concluded that Arbour was a \"leader or organizer\" of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). The district court's affirmative finding resulted in a four-level increase in Arbour's offense level.</p>\n<p>Arbour argues that the district court's conclusion was erroneous for two reasons. First, he asserts that he was not involved in a single criminal activity but rather in a number of separate, unconnected criminal activities. None of these criminal activities standing alone, Arbour says, satisfy § 3B1.1(a)'s requirement that the criminal activity involve five or more participants or be \"otherwise extensive.\" Second, he argues that even if he was involved in a single criminal activity that satisfied § 3B1.1(a)'s numerosity or extensiveness requirement, he could not be properly characterized as a leader or organizer of five participants in the criminal activity. We disagree with Arbour's contentions and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Arbour's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the plea colloquy, the Presentence Investigation Report and the transcript of the sentencing hearing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Graciani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>For a period of roughly eighteen months, Arbour trafficked in powder cocaine and crack cocaine in Maine. Arbour supplied a number of individuals with drugs for purposes of both resale and consumption. Included among these individuals was Roy Dubreil, who sold both forms of cocaine to others, often from his home. At some point, Arbour moved in with Dubreil.</p>\n<p>While Arbour was operating his drug trafficking business, he collected a number of firearms. Because he was a convicted felon, Arbour was prohibited from purchasing the firearms himself and therefore he enlisted three others to purchase the weapons for him. Two of these straw men, John Jackson and John Giannelli, were familiar to Arbour from his drug trafficking business. Jackson was one of Arbour's customers and also occasionally delivered drugs for Arbour. Giannelli frequently bought drugs from Dubreil. For <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> their services in purchasing firearms for him, Arbour paid both Jackson and Giannelli with drugs. Arbour paid Baron Thompson, a third person he enlisted to purchase firearms, in cash.</p>\n<p>The three ersatz buyers acquired a total of six firearms from a hardware store in Maine. Thompson alone purchased three firearms. Unable to purchase firearms himself because of his age, Jackson acquired two weapons indirectly, by enlisting a woman of age, Crystal Landry, to purchase the firearms for him. Arbour was directly involved in Giannelli's purchase from the hardware store, accompanying Giannelli to the store and discretely identifying the firearm he desired.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The firearms that Thompson, Jackson and Giannelli acquired for Arbour soon left Arbour's possession. Giannelli testified that, on the date of his purchase of the weapon, he witnessed a number of people from out of state arrive at Dubreil's home. According to Giannelli, the visitors supplied Arbour with drugs from Massachusetts, receiving money or \"goods\" in exchange. Giannelli observed the men going into a room with Arbour and Dubreil. Afterward, when Giannelli asked Dubreil where the firearm he had purchased for Arbour was, Dubreil told him that it was \"already gone.\" Of the three weapons Thompson had purchased, two of them were discovered in the possession of a Massachusetts resident during a search of that person's home by law enforcement. That individual was also in the possession of seventy bags of cocaine. The firearms acquired by Jackson and Landry were never found, either in Arbour's possession or anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the authorities investigated Arbour's drug trafficking operation, ultimately searching Arbour's and Dubreil's residence. In Arbour's room, the police discovered bedroom scales, plastic baggies with cocaine residue, three firearms, and ammunition. In Dubreil's room the authorities found ten firearms and ammunition. Many of the firearms had been stolen, including the three firearms found in Arbour's bedroom. Arbour subsequently pled guilty to five drug and firearms related charges.</p>\n<p>At Arbour's sentencing hearing, a number of witnesses testified about his drug trafficking business and acquisition of firearms. In addition to this testimony, defense counsel conceded at sentencing that Arbour had traded guns for cocaine on at least one occasion.</p>\n<p>On the basis of sentencing hearing testimony and other record evidence, the district court determined that Arbour was a leader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. <i>See</i> § 3B1.1(a). Although the court explicitly found that Arbour's criminal activity involved five or more participants, the court also observed that the criminal activity involved both Arbour's drug dealing and his illegal acquisition of firearms. The district court also found that Arbour held a leadership or organizational role within the criminal activity. When discussing Arbour's status as a leader or organizer, the court addressed the factors set forth in application note four of the guidelines commentary accompanying § 3B1.1(a). <i>See</i> § 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4. Although the court observed that not every factor counseled in favor of designating Arbour as a leader or organizer, it found that many of them supported such a designation. In addition to noting the nature <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> of Arbour's participation in the commission of the offenses, the court found that Arbour recruited accomplices and exercised decision-making authority over both Jackson and Giannelli.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In order to invoke § 3B1.1(a), a district court must make a finding as to scope that the criminal activity involved five or more participants<sup>[2]</sup> or was otherwise extensive and a finding as to statusthat the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of the criminal activity. <i>United States v. Tejada-Beltran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.1995).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span> (1985)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Scope determination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Arbour argues that he was not involved in a single criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Rather, he contends that he was involved in four separate clusters of criminal activity, none of which individually met § 3B1.1(a)'s numerosity or extensiveness requirement. Arbour identifies these four clusters by their direct participants: 1) Arbour, Jackson, and Landry; 2) Arbour, Giannelli and Jeremy Messer; 3) Arbour and Thompson; and 4) Arbour, Giannelli, Dubreil, and Dean James.<sup>[3]</sup> In Arbour's view, each group was associated with separate instances of criminal activitythe first three were involved in the procurement of firearms and the fourth, in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>For § 3B1.1(a) to apply, the criminal activity that the defendant led or organized must have involved five or more participants <i>or</i> been extensive. § 3B1.1(a). The disjunctive language of § 3B1.1(a) is importanta criminal activity may be extensive even if does not involve five or more participants. <i>Id.</i> cmt. n. 3 (\"In assessing whether [a criminal activity] is `otherwise extensive,' all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered. Thus, a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Laboy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200764\"><a href=\"/opinion/200764/united-states-v-laboy/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>, 585 n. 10 (1st Cir.2003) (\"The `five or more participants' and `otherwise extensive' elements are alternative means of finding the required scope under § 3B1.1.\"); <i>United States v. D'Andrea,</i> 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> F.3d 949, 957 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 413).</p>\n<p>In addition, a court may look beyond the specific crimes for which the defendant was convicted when determining whether the criminal activity satisfied the numerosity or extensiveness requirement. <i>Laboy,</i> 351 F.3d at 585-86. The court may consider all \"relevant conduct\" surrounding the crimes of conviction. <i>Id.</i> at 586 (rejecting defendant's argument that the assessment was limited to the people directly involved in the three drug sales to which the defendant pled guilty when making the numerosity/extensiveness determination).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court did not commit clear error when it found that Arbour was involved in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Although the court found that Arbour's criminal activity met both the numerosity and extensiveness requirements of § 3B1.1(a), we focus on the extensiveness component.</p>\n<p>When determining whether a criminal activity is extensive, we have noted that courts should consider \"the totality of the circumstances, including not only the number of participants but also the width, breadth, scope, complexity, and duration of the scheme.\" <i>Pierre,</i> 484 F.3d at 89 (quoting <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1991)). Arbour was involved in an extensive criminal activitythe trade of drugs for firearms and vice-versathat involved a host of knowing and unknowing participants. This overarching activity encompassed all of the four clusters of criminal activity that Arbour identifies.</p>\n<p>Arbour trafficked drugs in Maine for a period of roughly eighteen months, supplying various individuals, including Dubreil, with cocaine and crack cocaine. In the course of this drug trafficking, Arbour unlawfully acquired at least six firearms. At sentencing, the government introduced evidence linking Arbour's unlawful acquisition of firearms with his drug trafficking. On at least two occasions, Arbour, a convicted felon unable to obtain firearms legally, paid othersin the form of drugs to acquire firearms for him. Jackson, who dealt drugs for Arbour on a fairly regular basis, acquired two firearms for Arbour in order to pay off a drug debt. In acquiring these firearms for Arbour, Jackson, who was too young to purchase the weapons himself, employed the services of Landry. In addition to Jackson, Arbour enlisted Giannelli to acquire firearms for him, paying Giannelli with cocaine for his service.</p>\n<p>The government also introduced evidence that, after paying others drugs to acquire firearms for him, Arbour traded these firearms for drugs. First, Giannelli testified that after he turned a firearm over to Arbour, he witnessed a number of men arrive at Dubreil's home in cars with either Massachusetts or Connecticut plates. Giannelli observed the men enter a room with Arbour and Dubreil, and explained that it was his understanding that these individuals supplied Arbour with drugs and received \"goods\" in exchange. Subsequently, when Giannelli inquired into the status of the firearm he purchased for Arbour, Dubreil told him it was \"already gone.\"</p>\n<p>Second, during a raid of a home in Massachusetts, federal agents acquired, in addition to a significant amount of cocaine, a number of firearms. Two of these firearms were traced to Thompson, who had purchased them at Arbour's direction and expense. Finally, during the district court proceedings, Arbour's counsel conceded that Arbour traded guns for cocaine on at least one occasion.</p>\n<p>In light of the significant evidence of cross-pollination between Arbour's drug <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> and firearms dealings, both in the form of overlapping goods and criminal participants, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in rejecting Arbour's attempt to compartmentalize his criminal activity into separate, unrelated clusters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Status determination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>That the record supports the district court's finding that Arbour was involved in an extensive criminal activity, however, does not end the matter. <i>United States v. Thiongo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200648\"><a href=\"/opinion/200648/united-states-v-thiongo/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[T]he mere fact that the defendant was involved in an extensive criminal activity does not support a finding the defendant was an organizer or leader under § 3B.1.\") (citation omitted). To qualify for an enhancement under § 3B1.1(a), a defendant must have either organized or led the criminal activity. Accordingly, we address § 3B1.1(a)'s status component.</p>\n<p>Arbour's challenge to the district court's status finding has two parts. First, he contends that he did not lead or organize anyone, but merely interacted with various people during the commission of crimes. Second, Arbour argues implicitly throughout his brief that, even if he led or organized some people, he did not lead or organize the number of people required by § 3B1.1(a). The magic number, in Arbour's view, is five or more individuals.</p>\n<p>Arbour's first argument is easily dismissed the record evidence amply supports the district court's finding that Arbour led or organized criminal participants including Jackson and Giannelli.<sup>[4]</sup> Both the guideline commentary and case-law provide direction for considering whether a defendant qualifies as a \"leader or organizer.\" The guideline commentary provides a non-exhaustive list of factors that include: (1) the exercise of decision-making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. § 3B1.1(a), cmt. n. 4. \"There need not be proof of each and every factor before a defendant can be termed an organizer or leader.\" <i>Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d at 111.</p>\n<p>The case law has further defined the terms leader and organizer. \"[T]he term leader implies the exercise of some degree of dominance or power in a hierarchy, and also implies the authority to ensure that other persons will heed commands.\" <i>Id.</i> And \"[o]ne may be classified as an organizer, though perhaps not as a leader, if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to leading, Arbour, who was at the top of the relevant drug dealing operation in Maine, exercised decisionmaking authority over Giannelli, personally choosing which firearm he wanted Giannelli to purchase. <i>See</i> § 3B1.1(a), cmt. n. 4 (\"exercise of decision-making authority\"). But the record even more clearly supports a characterization of Arbour as an organizer. There was evidence that Arbour hatched the plan to acquire firearms illegally and that he sought out three others, Jackson, Giannelli, and Thompson, to procure the weapons in his stead. <i>See id.</i> (\"degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense\"; \"nature of participation in the commission of the offense\"; \"recruitment of accomplices\"). Arbour's puppetry enabled him to later use these firearms as currency in his drug trade. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> <i>See </i><i>Tejada-Beltran,</i> 50 F.3d at 112 (\"coordinat[ing] others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity\").</p>\n<p>We turn finally to the second part of Arbour's challenge, which focuses on what he perceives to be § 3B1.1(a)'s requirement that he lead or organize at least five individuals. Arbour contends that, because he did not lead or organize five others, he does not qualify for an enhancement. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p>On at least one occasion, we have acknowledged the possibility that the number of individuals a defendant must lead or organize to qualify under § 3B1.1(a) may depend in part on the district court's scope finding. Specifically, the question may hinge on whether the court finds the criminal activity to involve five or more participants <i>or</i> whether it finds the activity to be \"otherwise extensive.\" <i>See </i><i>Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 414. In <i>Rostoff,</i> we established that where the defendant is involved in a criminal activity that is \"otherwise extensive,\" there is no requirement that the defendant \"lead or organize\" at least four other participants. <i>Id.</i> (\"Unlike numerosity, extensiveness does not depend upon a finding that a criminal activity embraced no fewer than five criminally responsible participants, much less a finding that the activity included four or more persons under the defendant's direct control.\").</p>\n<p>But we also noted in <i>Rostoff</i> that \"some courts have held that, when the applicability of § 3B1.1(a) depends upon numerosity rather than extensiveness, the defendant must be shown personally to have [led or organized] no fewer than four other participants.\" 53 F.3d at 413 n. 15 (citations omitted).<sup>[5]</sup> In so noting, we cited decisions from the Seventh and Tenth circuits. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Carson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"657209\"><a href=\"/opinion/657209/united-states-v-joseph-b-carson-john-k-lanter-wilbert-hall-aaron/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 584 (7th Cir.1993) and <i>United States v.

Arbour's numerosity argument as to status must therefore also fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Thompson, Jackson, Landry and Giannelli were all convicted of various firearms offenses for their roles in these purchases.</p>\n<p>[2]  \"A `participant' is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\" § 3B1.1, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government introduced evidence that Messer had asked Giannelli to purchase a firearm for Arbour and may have accompanied Arbour and Giannelli to the hardware store when the purchase was made. James helped collect money for Arbour that related to stolen cocaine.</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court did not label Arbour a \"leader\" as opposed to an \"organizer\" or vice-versa, appearing to conclude that Arbour could be characterized as both.</p>\n<p>[5]  As these cases indicate, \"[t]he operative number of other persons is four rather than five, since the defendant himself must be counted as a participant and the defendant presumably is under his own control.\" <i>Rostoff,</i> 53 F.3d at 413 (citations omitted).</p>\n\n</div>",
