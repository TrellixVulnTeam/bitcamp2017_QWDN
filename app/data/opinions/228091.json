Colbert, dated October 22, 1946, was not executed by him when he was of the sound and disposing mind required by the Alaska statute. 3 A.C.L.A. &#167; 59-1-2: \"Every person of twenty-one years of age and upwards, of sound mind, may by last will devise all his or her property * * *.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 27, 1947, in a proceeding in \"The Estate of Louis D.

On July 31, 1947, Hayes moved that probate court to revoke the letters testamentary given by it to the Bank, alleging as her interest warranting her right to seek such revocation that she was created executrix under a later will of Colbert dated October 22, 1946.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hayes thus had the burden of proving that the will of October 22, 1946, was executed by Colbert when he had the sound and disposing mind required by the Alaska statute.

He dismissed Hayes' petition to revoke the letters to the Bank, finding as to the will of October 22nd that \"at the time said pretended will offered for probate by Petitioner, Thelma D. Hayes, was signed by the said Louis D. Colbert, Deceased, the said Louis D. Colbert was not of sound and disposing mind and memory and he was unable to comprehend the nature or purpose of the business being transacted or the purpose or consequences of signing said will, and was unable to understand or know what was then being done.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hayes appealed to the Alaska district court from the order of dismissal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The proceeding on appeal to the district court is as in equity.

Hayes started the proceeding with the presumption of Colbert's sanity. That presumption, under the federal practice, disappeared upon the introduction of the substantial evidence of Colbert's incompetency, hereafter discussed. Del Vecchio v.

The Bank's witnesses, who had seen and conversed with Colbert in a period of from two days to two weeks before October 22, 1946, gave testimony that Colbert thought his bed in the hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, where he was under treatment, was on a non-existing river and that a boat was sailing into his hospital room and he was going to board it. He said he wanted to put on his shoes and walk to California.
