CARLSON,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n        [Hon. John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Howard and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael B. Whipple and The Hallett Law Firm on brief for\nappellant.\n     Thomas E. Delahanty, II, United States Attorney and Margaret\nD. McGaughey, Appellate Chief on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 9, 2011\n\f      Per Curiam.       We have reviewed the record and the parties'\n\nsubmissions, and we affirm.\n\n      The appellant, David C. Carlson (\"Carlson\"), was convicted of\n\nfailing to pay a legal child support obligation in violation of the\n\nChild Support Recovery Act, 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(3) (\"CSRA\").             He\n\nargues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that\n\nhe could be found guilty of violating the CSRA so long as the jury\n\nconcluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he was able to pay at\n\nleast a portion of his child support obligation but failed to do\n\nso. Carlson takes the position that the CSRA only imposes criminal\n\nliability where the defendant is able to pay the entire amount of\n\nchild support due but fails to do so.           We reject this reading of\n\nthe statute.        In doing so, we are in accord with our sister\n\ncircuits who have decided the question. See United States v. Bell,\n\n598 F.3d 366, 371 (7th Cir. 2010); United States v. Davis, 588 F.3d\n\n1173, 1177 (8th Cir. 2009); United States v. Kukafka, 478 F.3d 531,\n\n539 (3d Cir. 2007); United States v. Mattice, 186 F.3d 219, 228 (2d\n\nCir. 1999);   United States v. Mathes, 151 F.3d 251 (5th Cir. 1998);\n\nsee also    United States v. Smith, 278 F.3d 33, 40 n. 4 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (citing Mattice with approval).\n\n      Carlson also challenges the district court's jury instruction\n\nexplaining the requirement that the outstanding child support debt\n\nbe greater than $10,000 or remain unpaid for longer than two years.\n\nSee   18   U.S.C.   §   228(a)(3).    Carlson    challenges   the   court's\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fexplanation of the \"greater than $10,000\" prong.           We see no plain\n\nerror in the court's instruction, as it is undisputed that the\n\nchild support debt in question remained unpaid from the time the\n\ndivorce was finalized in 2004 until the defendant was arrested in\n\n2008.   See United States v. Matos-Luchi, 627 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (citation omitted).      It was of no consequence, then, whether\n\nthe district court properly explained the \"greater than $10,000\"\n\nprong to the jury.         We see no basis in the record on which to\n\nconclude     that   this   challenge    to   the   jury   instructions   was\n\npreserved.\n\n     Affirmed.      See 1st Cir. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f",
