William C. Hillman, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                      Lipez, Selya and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David M.

This is the defendants' second attempt to\n\ntake a direct appeal from a bankruptcy court order under 28\n\nU.S.C.     §   158(d)(2),1    added   by     section   1233(a)(2)(B)    of   the\n\nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA),\n\nPub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23, 202-03 (2005).                 We denied the\n\nprevious petition because of \"[t]he existence of a serious\n\njurisdictional question,2 and the substantial possibility that\n\njurisdiction would ultimately be found lacking,\" leaving us to\n\nfear \"that allowing the appeal to proceed m[ight] not serve the\n\npurposes of section 158(d).\"               In re Weaver, 542 F.3d 257, 259\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (per curiam).          We further stated that \"if, as the\n\nbankruptcy court found in certifying this appeal, there are\n\nhundreds       of   cases   pending   in    the   Bankruptcy   Court   for   the\n\n\n     1\n         The pertinent part of that subdivision provides as follows:\n\n               The appropriate court of appeals shall have\n               jurisdiction of appeals [from bankruptcy court\n               judgments, orders, and decrees, including\n               interlocutory orders with leave of the\n               district court or bankruptcy appellate panel]\n               if the bankruptcy appellate panel involved,\n               acting on its own motion or on the request of\n               a party to the judgment, order, or decree . .\n               ., or all the appellants and appellees (if\n               any)    acting    jointly,    [make    certain\n               certifications] and if the court of appeals\n               authorizes the direct appeal of the judgment,\n               order, or decree.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2)(A).\n     2\n      The jurisdictional question was whether this court had\njurisdiction despite the appellant's failure to file a timely\nnotice of appeal or to seek permission from this court to appeal.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fDistrict of Massachusetts raising the same issue certified here,\n\nit would be preferable to resolve that issue in a case not\n\nraising   the    potentially      fatal   procedural      problems    presented\n\nhere.\"    Id.        We cautioned both lower courts and litigants to\n\navoid such problems in future cases by carefully following the\n\nprocedures set forth in section 158 and in the applicable rules.\n\nId.\n\n           Rather than waiting for a procedurally clean case, the\n\ndefendants attempted to cure the procedural problems with this\n\ncase by moving for reconsideration of the interlocutory order in\n\nquestion and then assaying a direct appeal from the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's denial of that motion.            In so doing, they created other\n\nprocedural problems, which prompted us to issue an order to show\n\ncause why this case should not be transmitted to the district\n\ncourt.3      Without        deciding   whether    the   procedural     problems\n\nidentified      in    the   show-cause    order   would    preclude    us   from\n\nauthorizing a direct appeal, we exercise our discretion to deny\n\nsuch authorization because, even if the certified issue is\n\nsufficiently important to warrant a direct appeal (a matter on\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      The problems identified in the order to show cause were the\nbankruptcy court's transmission of the notice of appeal and motion\nfor leave to take an interlocutory appeal to this court rather than\nto the district court as required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8003(b) and\nthe defendants' failure to file a timely petition for leave to take\na direct appeal in this court as required by Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n8001(f)(5).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fwhich we take no view), this case is not an appropriate vehicle\n\nfor resolving that issue.       We explain briefly.\n\n           In   their    response        to   the    show-cause    order,     the\n\ndefendants identify the issue warranting a direct appeal as\n\n\"[w]hether or not the act of postponing a mortgage foreclosure\n\nsale during a pending bankruptcy violates the automatic stay.\"\n\nThe   bankruptcy   court     resolved      that     issue   adversely   to    the\n\ndefendants in its decision issued on March 27, 2008, denying the\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment and granting partial\n\nsummary judgment to the plaintiff.            But the defendants failed to\n\nfile a timely notice of appeal from that decision.                 See Weaver,\n\n542 F.3d at 258.    Despite this omission, the defendants' present\n\nnotice of appeal purports to appeal not only from the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's recent denial of their motion for reconsideration but\n\nalso from the original summary judgment decision itself.\n\n           Given that sequence of events, granting leave to take\n\na direct appeal now would present the same jurisdictional issue\n\nthat we previously found unsettling.                 See Rodríguez-Antuna v.\n\nChase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(holding that \"a punctual appeal from an order denying . . . a\n\n[post-judgment] motion [other than one of the timely filed\n\nmotions   specified     in   Fed.   R.    App.      P.   4(a)(4)(A)]   does   not\n\nautomatically produce a Lazarus-like effect; it cannot resurrect\n\nappellants' expired right to contest the merits of the underlying\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fjudgment, nor bring the judgment itself before [the appellate\n\ncourt] for review\"). The continued existence of that issue again\n\nmakes it unlikely that authorizing a direct appeal would result\n\nin a \"definitive resolution of the underlying legal question by\n\nthis court.\"   Weaver, 542 F.3d at 259.\n\n           We need go no further.    For these reasons, we deny the\n\nrequest for leave to take a direct appeal to this court under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 158(d)(2) and direct the Clerk to transmit the case to\n\nthe district court for docketing and for a ruling on whether to\n\ngrant defendants' petition for leave to take an interlocutory\n\nappeal.   See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8003(b) & (d), 8007(b).\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
