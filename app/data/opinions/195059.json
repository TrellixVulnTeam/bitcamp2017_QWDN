This case concerns an action brought under\n                    \n\nthe Miller  Act, 40 U.S.C.    270a-f (1986),  in the name  of the\n\nUnited States for  the use and  benefit of Luis A.  Cabrera, S.E.\n\n(\"Cabrera\"),   a   subcontractor,   against     Sun   Engineering\n\nEnterprises, Inc. (\"Sun Engineering\"), a general  contractor, and\n\nits  surety,  CNA  Casualty  of  Puerto Rico  (\"CNA\").    In  the\n\ncomplaint, Cabrera claimed  money it was due under  a subcontract\n\nwith Sun Engineering.  After  a non-jury trial, the United States\n\nDistrict Court for  the District of  Puerto Rico awarded  Cabrera\n\n$44,769.25.  Sun Engineering then filed this appeal claiming that\n\nthe  district court  improperly amended  the  pre-trial order  at\n\ntrial, and that  there was insufficient  evidence to support  the\n\ncourt's  findings of  fact.   For the  reasons stated  herein, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                      I.  BACKGROUND\n\n          We review the facts in favor of the prevailing party at\n\ntrial,  Cabrera.   See  American  Title  Ins.  Co. v.  East  West\n                                                                 \n\nFinancial  Corp.,  959  F.2d  345,  346 (1st  Cir.  1992).    Sun\n                \n\nEngineering  is  a  construction  company  which  was  the  prime\n\ncontractor for  a federal project  involving partially renovating\n\nthe United States  General Post Offices in San  Juan, Puerto Rico\n\n(\"the Project\").  Cabrera was a subcontractor on the Project.  On\n\nDecember 21, l989,  Mr.  Luis Cabrera submitted a price quotation\n\nto Mr. Francisco Jim nez, the president of Sun Engineering, which\n\ndetailed, item by item, the work which the Project blueprints and\n\nspecifications required with respect to supplying  and installing\n\n                               -2-\n\nvinyl floors, dry wall partitions,  and acoustical ceilings.  The\n\nquotation estimated  the cost  of the work  to be  $106,707.35.1 \n\nMr. Cabrera and  Mr. Jim nez then discussed the  precise terms of\n\nthe quotation.  On January 8, l990, Sun Engineering sent a letter\n\nto  Cabrera  accepting  Cabrera's  December  21, l989  quotation.\n\nAlthough  the  parties had  negotiated some  changes to  the work\n\nspecified  in the quotation,  and a reduced  \"estimated\" contract\n\nprice of  $80,000, an absolute  price for the contract  was never\n\nagreed  upon.   Rather, Cabrera  and  Sun Engineering  informally\n\nagreed that Sun  Engineering would pay Cabrera based  on the work\n\nCabrera actually performed.\n\n          After the contract was formed, Cabrera  commenced work.\n\nDuring the course of the Project,  Mr. Jim nez verbally requested\n\nthat  Cabrera  perform  additional work  not  encompassed  by the\n\noriginal  contract.   This  work involved  floor underlays.   Mr.\n\nIsmael El as, the designer of the Project  who also served as the\n\nProject  inspector for the  Post Office, also  verbally requested\n\nCabrera to  make changes with  respect to some partitions  it was\n\ninstalling.  Cabrera  completed all work required  on the Project\n\nby June 5, l99l.\n\n          Cabrera billed Sun Engineering $105,495.39 for the work\n\nit performed.  Sun Engineering made progress  payments to Cabrera\n\ntotalling $60,726.14.  Sun Engineering refused to pay Cabrera the\n\n                    \n\n1  At trial, there was some dispute  regarding the precise dollar\nfigure of this initial quotation.  The present appeal does not in\nany way turn upon the exact figure of this initial quotation, and\nfor the purposes of this opinion, we will assume that $l06,707.35\nwas the correct figure.\n\n                               -3-\n\nbalance of $44,769.25.\n\n          Cabrera  then  filed   suit.    As  its   defense,  Sun\n\nEngineering claimed  that the contract  was for a total  price of\n\n$80,000,  and  therefore,  Sun  Engineering   only  owed  Cabrera\n\n$l9,273.86.     Sun   Engineering  also   claimed  that   Cabrera\n\nnegligently performed its work, and delayed the completion of the\n\nProject.\n\n          After  trial, the district court found that the parties\n\nentered  into an  informal  contract.    In accordance  with  the\n\ncontract,   Cabrera was entitled  to be paid $105,495.39  for the\n\nwork  it had  performed  on the  Project.   The court  found that\n\nCabrera was not responsible for  any Project delays.  Because Sun\n\nEngineering had only  paid Cabrera $60,726.14, the  court entered\n\njudgment in Cabrera's favor in the amount of $44,769.25.\n\n           Sun  Engineering   then  filed   this  appeal.     Sun\n\nEngineering makes  three arguments  on appeal.   Sun  Engineering\n\ncontends  that 1)  by allowing  a modification  of the  pre-trial\n\norder at trial, the district court permitted Cabrera to introduce\n\nevidence  with  respect   to  the  cost  of   the  contract  that\n\ncontradicted a stipulated  fact, and changed Cabrera's  theory of\n\nits case, in violation of Fed. R.  Civ. P. 16(e); 2) the evidence\n\npresented  at  trial   did  not  support  the   district  court's\n\nconclusion that valid change  orders were issued to Cabrera;  and\n\n3) the record does not  support the district court's finding that\n\nCabrera   was  not   responsible  for   Project   delays.     Sun\n\nEngineering's arguments are meritless.\n\n                               -4-\n\n                    II.  THE RULE 16 CHALLENGE\n\n          In the final  pre-trial order,  the  parties stipulated\n\nthat \"the agreed  price on said  subcontract was $80,000.\"     At\n\ntrial, Cabrera  introduced its  December 21,  l989 quotation  for\n\n$106,707.35  as an  exhibit.   Sun  Engineering  objected to  the\n\nintroduction of this  exhibit on the ground that  the parties had\n\nstipulated that there  was a contract for $80,000,  and that this\n\nevidence, which  suggested a  different price  for the  contract,\n\ncontradicted   that  stipulation.      The  court  overruled  Sun\n\nEngineering's objection  and permitted  Cabrera to  introduce the\n\nexhibit  because  the  court  believed  that  the  quotation  was\n\nrelevant to the  negotiations between the  parties, and what  the\n\nparties intended to  be the terms of  the contract.    On appeal,\n\nSun Engineering  argues that the  court violated Fed. R.  Civ. P.\n\n16(e)2 by effectively amending  the pre-trial order at  trial and\n\npermitting  Cabrera to  introduce evidence  which contradicted  a\n\nstipulated fact, and which changed Cabrera's theory of its case.\n\n          A  trial court  has broad  discretion  to preserve  the\n\nintegrity  and purpose  of the  pre-trial  order.

Ram rez Pomales, 839 F.2d at 3.  After the pre-\n                                 \n\ntrial conference, an  order shall be entered reciting  the action\n\ntaken, and this order then  controls the subsequent course of the\n\naction,  unless modified by a subsequent order.   Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\nl6(d),(e); Ram rez Pomales, 839 F.2d at 3.  The interpretation of\n                          \n\na  pre-trial order is the  responsibility of the  trial court.  A\n\ntrial court should construe the pre-trial order liberally so that\n\nit  covers any  of the  possible legal  or factual  theories that\n\nmight be  embraced by  its  language.   Geremia,  653 F.2d  at  5\n                                               \n\n(quoting Rodr gues v. Ripley Indus., Inc., 507 F.2d 782, 787 (lst\n                                         \n\nCir. l974) (citing  6 C. Wright  &amp; A. Miller, Federal  Practice &amp;\n                                                                 \n\nProcedure   l527, at 609 &amp; n.47 (l971))).\n         \n\n                               -6-\n\n          Contrary to Sun  Engineering's contention, the district\n\ncourt  did not  amend the  pre-trial  order.   Rather, the  court\n\nreviewed the pre-trial  order, and based on its interpretation of\n\nthat order, found that the exhibit Cabrera  proposed to introduce\n\nwas admissible.   The district court's actions were  not an abuse\n\nof  discretion.     After   Sun  Engineering   objected  to   the\n\nintroduction  of  the  exhibit, the  court  reviewed  the factual\n\nstipulation in the  context of Cabrera's legal  theory, which was\n\nalso set out  in the pre-trial order.   The court found  that the\n\nintroduction of  the exhibit by  Cabrera was consistent  with its\n\ntheory  of the  case.    Pursuant to  the  contract, Cabrera  was\n\nentitled  to  be  paid  on the  basis  of  the  work it  actually\n\nperformed.   The December  21, l989 quotation  and the subsequent\n\nchange orders established the work  that Cabrera was to perform. \n\nWhile the factual stipulation did provide that the agreed cost of\n\nthe contract was  $80,000, the court stated that  it would simply\n\ndefy  logic to  find that  Cabrera stipulated  that the  absolute\n\nprice of the contract was $80,000, in  light of its theory of the\n\ncase.    Rather,  the  court   found  that  the  only  reasonable\n\ninterpretation  of the  stipulation  was that  it referred  to an\n\nagreed \"estimated\"  contract cost  of $80,000.   The court  acted\n\nwithin  its discretion in  interpreting the stipulation  and pre-\n\ntrial order in this manner, and we will not disturb its ruling.\n\n                     III.  THE CHANGE ORDERS\n\n          Sun  Engineering  argues  that  in   light  of  federal\n\nregulations  which  purportedly  require  all  change  orders  on\n\n                               -7-\n\ngovernment   projects  to  be   in  writing,  the   evidence  was\n\ninsufficient  to support a finding that  valid change orders were\n\nissued to Cabrera.\n\n          An  appellate  court  will  review a  district  court's\n\nfindings of fact  in a bench trial for clear error.  Dedham Water\n                                                                 \n\nCo. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (lst  Cir.\n                                   \n\nl992); Fed. R. Civ.  P. 52(a).3  A  finding is clearly  erroneous\n\nwhen  the reviewing  court is  left  with the  definite and  firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has  been committed.  See Dedham Water,\n                                                                \n\n972 F.2d at 457.  Mixed questions of fact and law,  which require\n\na court  to determine  if certain facts  possess, or  lack, legal\n\nsignificance in a given case,  are also reviewed for clear error.\n\nRoland M., 910 F.2d at 990.  Absent a showing that the court made\n         \n\na mistake  of law,  we  will give  effect to  the trial's  courts\n\nfindings.  Id. at 990-91.\n              \n\n          The  record  supports   the  district  court's  factual\n\nfindings that change orders were  issued to Cabrera.  Mr. Cabrera\n\nand  Mr. Jim nez  testified  that  after  Cabrera  submitted  the\n\n                    \n\n3   Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 52(a) provides  in pertinent\npart:\n\n            In  all  actions  tried  upon  the  facts\n            without a jury . . . the court shall find\n            the facts specially  and state separately\n            its  conclusions  of   law  thereon,  and\n            judgment  shall  be entered  pursuant  to\n            Rule  58  . .  .  .   Findings  of  fact,\n            whether  based  on  oral  or  documentary\n            evidence, shall  not be set  aside unless\n            clearly erroneous,  and due  regard shall\n            be  given to the opportunity of the trial\n            court to  judge  of  the  credibility  of\n            witnesses.\n\n                               -8-\n\noriginal  quotation to  Mr. Jim nez  detailing  the work  Cabrera\n\nproposed  to do, Mr. Jim nez requested  that Cabrera make certain\n\nchanges to the  quotation.  Mr.  Cabrera also offered  undisputed\n\ntestimony  that after  the  parties  entered  into  the  original\n\ncontract,  Mr. Jim nez orally requested that Cabrera perform work\n\nbeyond that encompassed  in the  contract with  respect to  floor\n\nunderlays.   Mr. Jim nez  and Mr. El as  both testified  that Mr.\n\nEl as also  orally requested Cabrera  to do additional  work with\n\nrespect  to  partitions,  that  Mr. Jim nez  was  aware  of  this\n\nrequest, and that Cabrera made those requested changes.\n\n          Cabrera claims that even if oral changes were issued to\n\nCabrera,  they  were  of  no  legal consequence.    There  is  no\n\nrequirement,  however, that  change  orders to  subcontractors on\n\ngovernment projects  be in writing and approved by the government\n\nto be legally binding.   Despite Sun Engineering's  contention to\n\nthe contrary,   48 C.F.R.   43.201 (1992)  does not impose such a\n\nrequirement.4    Part  43  of the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations\n\ngenerally  addresses  government  policies   and  procedures  for\n\npreparing  and  processing  contract  modifications.   48  C.F.R.\n\n  43.000  et  seq.

The  regulations  are directed  to\n                  \n\n                    \n\n4  48 C.F.R.   43.201(a) (1992) provides in pertinent part:\n\n            Generally, Government contracts contain a\n            changes   clause    that   permits    the\n            contracting  officer  to  make unilateral\n            changes, in designated  areas, within the\n            general scope of the contract.  These are\n            accomplished  by  issuing  written change\n            orders on Standard Form  30, Amendment of\n            Solicitation/Modification   of   Contract\n            (SF 30), unless otherwise provided.    \n\n                               -9-\n\ngovernment contracting  officers and  those parties who  contract\n\ndirectly  with them.  Section 43.20l  is specifically directed at\n\nthe procedures which the  government's contracting officer should\n\nfollow  when issuing a  change order to  its contracting partner.\n\nGenerally, the  relationship covered  by the  regulation is  that\n\nbetween  the  officer and  the prime  contractor on  a government\n\nproject.  The  regulation does not apply to  more remote parties,\n\nsuch  as   subcontractors,  who contract  solely  with the  prime\n\ncontractor.  We have  been unable to find any  other statutory or\n\nregulatory  requirement  which  purports  to  control  the  prime\n\ncontractor's relationship with its subcontractors with respect to\n\nthe logistics of contract modifications, such as change orders.5\n\n          The  prime  contractor/subcontractor   relationship  is\n\ngoverned by the terms of the contract between the parties.   See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., United States for  Control Systems, Inc. v.  Arundel Corp.,\n                                                                \n\n814 F.2d 193,  196-97 (5th Cir.), modified on  other grounds, 826\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1987).   In the present case, the court  found\n\nthat the contractual dealings between Cabrera and Sun Engineering\n\nwere informal at best.  The parties never  signed a final written\n\ncontract.   Moreover, there was  no oral  or written  contractual\n\nprovision which required that any change orders issued to Cabrera\n\nhad to be in writing, or approved by the  contracting officer, in\n\n                    \n\n5   In  its brief,  Sun Engineering  points to  the testimony  of\nMr. El as and Mr.  Delgado, an architect who worked  for the Post\nOffice,  who  both  stated  that  change  orders  were  generally\naccomplished  through  written  directives.     Their  testimony,\nhowever, also referred to the relationship between the government\nand the prime contractor.\n\n                               -10-\n\norder to  be  valid.   Therefore, the oral change orders at issue\n\nwere legally binding, and the district court properly  found that\n\nCabrera was entitled  to be paid for the  work performed pursuant\n\nto  those orders.   This  finding is  in accord with  the general\n\npurpose of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C.    270a-f (1986), a remedial\n\nstatute, enacted to assure that all workers and subcontractors on\n\ngovernment projects received compensation for their efforts.  See\n                                                                 \n\nF.D. Rich Co.  v. United States for Use of Indus.

DELAY CLAIM\n\n          Sun Engineering  contends  that  the  district  court's\n\nfinding that Cabrera  was not responsible  for Project delays  is\n\nunsupported  by  the record.    We  disagree  and find  that  the\n\nevidence amply supports the court's  findings.  Mr. Cabrera,  Mr.\n\nDelgado  and Mr. El as all  offered uncontradicted testimony that\n\nCabrera completed  all required work  on the Project.   There was\n\nevidence that Cabrera  did correct some deficiencies  in its work\n\nafter the  scheduled completion  date of the  Project.   With the\n\nexception of the testimony of Mr. Jim nez, however, the record is\n\nvoid of  any  evidence  that  this \"delay\"  translated  into  any\n\nfinancial   penalty  to  Sun  Engineering.    While  Mr.  Jim nez\n\ntestified  that  Sun  Engineering was  financially  penalized for\n\ndelays which  were in fact  caused by Cabrera, Mr.  El as offered\n\nconflicting  testimony to  the effect  that  Sun Engineering  was\n\nsolely responsible  for the delays.   The trial court  refused to\n\ncredit Mr.  Jim nez' testimony.   It was well within  the court's\n\n                               -11-\n\ndiscretion to determine whether or not it found Mr. Jim nez to be\n\na credible witness.  See Dedham Water Co., Inc., 972 F.2d at 461.\n                                               \n\nThere was no error in the court's findings.\n\n                         V.  DOUBLE COSTS\n\n          Because  Sun Engineering filed  a frivolous  appeal, we\n\nfind it appropriate to assess  a monetary penalty of double costs\n\nagainst it.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides that\n\n\"[i]f  a court  of  appeals  shall determine  that  an appeal  is\n\nfrivolous, it may  award just damages and single  or double costs\n\nto the  appellee.\"  Westcott  Constr.

An appeal  is\n          \n\nfrivolous if  the  \"result  was obvious\"  or  the  arguments  are\n\n\"wholly without merit.\"  Id.  \"[I]t is enough that the appellants\n                            \n\nand their attorney should have been aware that the appeal  had no\n\nchance of  success.\"   E.H.

The record also  amply supports\n\nthe  trial  judge's factual  findings,  and there  are  simply no\n\nreasonable  grounds to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nWe therefore award Cabrera double costs.\n\n                               -12-\n",

Sec. 270a-f (1986), in the name of the United States for the use and benefit of Luis A. Cabrera, S.E.  (\"Cabrera\"), a subcontractor, against Sun Engineering Enterprises, Inc.  (\"Sun Engineering\"), a general contractor, and its surety, CNA Casualty of Puerto Rico (\"CNA\").  In the complaint, Cabrera claimed money it was due under a subcontract with Sun Engineering.  After a non-jury trial, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico awarded Cabrera $44,769.25.  Sun Engineering then filed this appeal claiming that the district court improperly amended the pre-trial order at trial, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the court's findings of fact.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in favor of the prevailing party at trial, Cabrera.   See American Title Ins. Co. v. East West Financial Corp., 959 F.2d 345, 346 (1st Cir. 1992).  Sun Engineering is a construction company which was the prime contractor for a federal project involving partially renovating the United States General Post Offices in San Juan, Puerto Rico (\"the Project\").  Cabrera was a subcontractor on the Project.  On December 21, l989, Mr. Luis Cabrera submitted a price quotation to Mr. Francisco Jimenez, the president of Sun Engineering, which detailed, item by item, the work which the Project blueprints and specifications required with respect to supplying and installing vinyl floors, dry wall partitions, and acoustical ceilings.  The quotation estimated the cost of the work to be $106,707.35.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Mr. Cabrera and Mr. Jimenez then discussed the precise terms of the quotation.  On January 8, l990, Sun Engineering sent a letter to Cabrera accepting Cabrera's December 21, l989 quotation.  Although the parties had negotiated some changes to the work specified in the quotation, and a reduced \"estimated\" contract price of $80,000, an absolute price for the contract was never agreed upon.  Rather, Cabrera and Sun Engineering informally agreed that Sun Engineering would pay Cabrera based on the work Cabrera actually performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the contract was formed, Cabrera commenced work.  During the course of the Project, Mr. Jimenez verbally requested that Cabrera perform additional work not encompassed by the original contract.  This work involved floor underlays.  Mr. Ismael Elas, the designer of the Project who also served as the Project inspector for the Post Office, also verbally requested Cabrera to make changes with respect to some partitions it was installing.  Cabrera completed all work required on the Project by June 5, l99l.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabrera billed Sun Engineering $105,495.39 for the work it performed.  Sun Engineering made progress payments to Cabrera totalling $60,726.14.  Sun Engineering refused to pay Cabrera the balance of $44,769.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabrera then filed suit.  As its defense, Sun Engineering claimed that the contract was for a total price of $80,000, and therefore, Sun Engineering only owed Cabrera $l9,273.86.  Sun Engineering also claimed that Cabrera negligently performed its work, and delayed the completion of the Project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, the district court found that the parties entered into an informal contract.  In accordance with the contract, Cabrera was entitled to be paid $105,495.39 for the work it had performed on the Project.  The court found that Cabrera was not responsible for any Project delays.  Because Sun Engineering had only paid Cabrera $60,726.14, the court entered judgment in Cabrera's favor in the amount of $44,769.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sun Engineering then filed this appeal.  Sun Engineering makes three arguments on appeal.  Sun Engineering contends that 1) by allowing a modification of the pre-trial order at trial, the district court permitted Cabrera to introduce evidence with respect to the cost of the contract that contradicted a stipulated fact, and changed Cabrera's theory of its case, in violation of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 16(e);  2) the evidence presented at trial did not support the district court's conclusion that valid change orders were issued to Cabrera;  and 3) the record does not support the district court's finding that Cabrera was not responsible for Project delays.  Sun Engineering's arguments are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE RULE 16 CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final pre-trial order, the parties stipulated that \"the agreed price on said subcontract was $80,000.\"  At trial, Cabrera introduced its December 21, l989 quotation for $106,707.35 as an exhibit.  Sun Engineering objected to the introduction of this exhibit on the ground that the parties had stipulated that there was a contract for $80,000, and that this evidence, which suggested a different price for the contract, contradicted that stipulation.  The court overruled Sun Engineering's objection and permitted Cabrera to introduce the exhibit because the court believed that the quotation was relevant to the negotiations between the parties, and what the parties intended to be the terms of the contract.  On appeal, Sun Engineering argues that the court violated Fed.  R. Civ. P. 16(e)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by effectively amending the pre-trial order at trial and permitting Cabrera to introduce evidence which contradicted a stipulated fact, and which changed Cabrera's theory of its case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court has broad discretion to preserve the integrity and purpose of the pre-trial order.   Roland M. v. Concord School Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 999 (lst Cir. l990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 912 (1991).  An appellate court should exercise minimal interference with a trial court's interpretation of a pre-trial order and a court's decision to permit the introduction of evidence, or exclude evidence, based on that interpretation.   See Ramrez Pomales v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., S.A., 839 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. l988);   Geremia v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 653 F.2d 1, 5 (lst Cir. l981);  6 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. 1527, at 279-286 (1990).  \"Unless there is manifest injustice or the district court has abused its discretion to the point of being arbitrary,\" the court's ruling will not be disturbed.   Nickerson v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., 900 F.2d 412, 422 (lst Cir. l990);  Ramrez Pomales, 839 F.2d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l6 provides that at the final pre-trial conference the participants shall formulate a plan for trial.   Ramrez Pomales, 839 F.2d at 3.  After the pre-trial conference, an order shall be entered reciting the action taken, and this order then controls the subsequent course of the action, unless modified by a subsequent order.  Fed. R. Civ. P. l6(d),(e);  Ramrez Pomales, 839 F.2d at 3.  The interpretation of a pre-trial order is the responsibility of the trial court.  A trial court should construe the pre-trial order liberally so that it covers any of the possible legal or factual theories that might be embraced by its language.   Geremia, 653 F.2d at 5 (quoting  Rodrgues v. Ripley Indus., Inc., 507 F.2d 782, 787 (lst Cir. l974) (citing 6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Sec. l527, at 609 &amp; n.47 (l971))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Sun Engineering's contention, the district court did not amend the pre-trial order.  Rather, the court reviewed the pre-trial order, and based on its interpretation of that order, found that the exhibit Cabrera proposed to introduce was admissible.  The district court's actions were not an abuse of discretion.  After Sun Engineering objected to the introduction of the exhibit, the court reviewed the factual stipulation in the context of Cabrera's legal theory, which was also set out in the pre-trial order.  The court found that the introduction of the exhibit by Cabrera was consistent with its theory of the case.  Pursuant to the contract, Cabrera was entitled to be paid on the basis of the work it actually performed.  The December 21, l989 quotation and the subsequent change orders established the work that Cabrera was to perform.  While the factual stipulation did provide that the agreed cost of the contract was $80,000, the court stated that it would simply defy logic to find that Cabrera stipulated that the absolute price of the contract was $80,000, in light of its theory of the case.  Rather, the court found that the only reasonable interpretation of the stipulation was that it referred to an agreed \"estimated\" contract cost of $80,000.  The court acted within its discretion in interpreting the stipulation and pre-trial order in this manner, and we will not disturb its ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE CHANGE ORDERS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sun Engineering argues that in light of federal regulations which purportedly require all change orders on government projects to be in writing, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that valid change orders were issued to Cabrera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court will review a district court's findings of fact in a bench trial for clear error.   Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (lst Cir. l992);  Fed.  R. Civ. P. 52(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  A finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.   See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457.  Mixed questions of fact and law, which require a court to determine if certain facts possess, or lack, legal significance in a given case, are also reviewed for clear error.   Roland M., 910 F.2d at 990.  Absent a showing that the court made a mistake of law, we will give effect to the trial's courts findings.   Id. at 990-91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the district court's factual findings that change orders were issued to Cabrera.  Mr. Cabrera and Mr. Jimenez testified that after Cabrera submitted the original quotation to Mr. Jimenez detailing the work Cabrera proposed to do, Mr. Jimenez requested that Cabrera make certain changes to the quotation.  Mr. Cabrera also offered undisputed testimony that after the parties entered into the original contract, Mr. Jimenez orally requested that Cabrera perform work beyond that encompassed in the contract with respect to floor underlays.  Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Elas both testified that Mr. Elas also orally requested Cabrera to do additional work with respect to partitions, that Mr. Jimenez was aware of this request, and that Cabrera made those requested changes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabrera claims that even if oral changes were issued to Cabrera, they were of no legal consequence.  There is no requirement, however, that change orders to subcontractors on government projects be in writing and approved by the government to be legally binding.  Despite Sun Engineering's contention to the contrary, 48 C.F.R. Sec. 43.201 (1992) does not impose such a requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Part 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations generally addresses government policies and procedures for preparing and processing contract modifications. 48 C.F.R. Sec. 43.000 et seq.  (1992).  The regulations are directed to government contracting officers and those parties who contract directly with them.  Section 43.20l is specifically directed at the procedures which the government's contracting officer should follow when issuing a change order to its contracting partner.  Generally, the relationship covered by the regulation is that between the officer and the prime contractor on a government project.  The regulation does not apply to more remote parties, such as subcontractors, who contract solely with the prime contractor.  We have been unable to find any other statutory or regulatory requirement which purports to control the prime contractor's relationship with its subcontractors with respect to the logistics of contract modifications, such as change orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prime contractor/subcontractor relationship is governed by the terms of the contract between the parties.   See, e.g., United States for Control Systems, Inc. v. Arundel Corp., 814 F.2d 193, 196-97 (5th Cir.), modified on other grounds, 826 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1987).  In the present case, the court found that the contractual dealings between Cabrera and Sun Engineering were informal at best.  The parties never signed a final written contract.  Moreover, there was no oral or written contractual provision which required that any change orders issued to Cabrera had to be in writing, or approved by the contracting officer, in order to be valid.  Therefore, the oral change orders at issue were legally binding, and the district court properly found that Cabrera was entitled to be paid for the work performed pursuant to those orders.  This finding is in accord with the general purpose of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 270a-f (1986), a remedial statute, enacted to assure that all workers and subcontractors on government projects received compensation for their efforts.   See F.D. Rich Co. v. United States for Use of Indus.  Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 124 (l974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DELAY CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sun Engineering contends that the district court's finding that Cabrera was not responsible for Project delays is unsupported by the record.  We disagree and find that the evidence amply supports the court's findings.  Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Delgado and Mr. Elas all offered uncontradicted testimony that Cabrera completed all required work on the Project.  There was evidence that Cabrera did correct some deficiencies in its work after the scheduled completion date of the Project.  With the exception of the testimony of Mr. Jimenez, however, the record is void of any evidence that this \"delay\" translated into any financial penalty to Sun Engineering.  While Mr. Jimenez testified that Sun Engineering was financially penalized for delays which were in fact caused by Cabrera, Mr. Elas offered conflicting testimony to the effect that Sun Engineering was solely responsible for the delays.  The trial court refused to credit Mr. Jimenez' testimony.  It was well within the court's discretion to determine whether or not it found Mr. Jimenez to be a credible witness.   See Dedham Water Co., Inc., 972 F.2d at 461.  There was no error in the court's findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. DOUBLE COSTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Sun Engineering filed a frivolous appeal, we find it appropriate to assess a monetary penalty of double costs against it.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides that \"[i]f a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\"   Westcott Constr.  Corp. v. Firemen's Fund of New Jersey, 996 F.2d 14, 17 (lst Cir. l993).  An appeal is frivolous if the \"result was obvious\" or the arguments are \"wholly without merit.\"  Id. \"[I]t is enough that the appellants and their attorney should have been aware that the appeal had no chance of success.\"   E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Servs., 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (lst Cir. l990).  Sun Engineering's arguments on appeal are wholly without merit.  There is no legal support for Sun Engineering's Fed.  R. Civ. P. 16(e) challenge, or its contention that change orders issued to Cabrera had to be in writing to be legally binding.  The record also amply supports the trial judge's factual findings, and there are simply no reasonable grounds to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.  We therefore award Cabrera double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At trial, there was some dispute regarding the precise dollar figure of this initial quotation.

(\"Sun Engineering\"), a general contractor, and its surety, CNA Casualty of Puerto Rico (\"CNA\").  In the complaint, Cabrera claimed money it was due under a subcontract with Sun Engineering.  After a non-jury trial, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico awarded Cabrera $44,769.25.  Sun Engineering then filed this appeal claiming that the district court improperly amended the pre-trial order at trial, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the court's findings of fact.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in favor of the prevailing party at trial, Cabrera.   See American Title Ins. Co. v. East West Financial Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579945\"><a href=\"/opinion/579945/american-title-insurance-company-v-east-west-financial-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span>, 346 (1st Cir. 1992).  Sun Engineering is a construction company which was the prime contractor for a federal project involving partially renovating the United States General Post Offices in San Juan, Puerto Rico (\"the Project\").  Cabrera was a subcontractor on the Project.  On December 21, l989, Mr. Luis Cabrera submitted a price quotation to Mr. Francisco Jimenez, the president of Sun Engineering, which detailed, item by item, the work which the Project blueprints and specifications required with respect to supplying and installing vinyl floors, dry wall partitions, and acoustical ceilings.  The quotation estimated the cost of the work to be $106,707.35.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Mr. Cabrera and Mr. Jimenez then discussed the precise terms of the quotation.  On January 8, l990, Sun Engineering sent a letter to Cabrera accepting Cabrera's December 21, l989 quotation.  Although the parties had negotiated some changes to the work specified in the quotation, and a reduced \"estimated\" contract price of $80,000, an absolute price for the contract was never agreed upon.  Rather, Cabrera and Sun Engineering informally agreed that Sun Engineering would pay Cabrera based on the work Cabrera actually performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the contract was formed, Cabrera commenced work.  During the course of the Project, Mr. Jimenez verbally requested that Cabrera perform additional work not encompassed by the original contract.  This work involved floor underlays.  Mr. Ismael Elas, the designer of the Project who also served as the Project inspector for the Post Office, also verbally requested Cabrera to make changes with respect to some partitions it was installing.  Cabrera completed all work required on the Project by June 5, l99l.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabrera billed Sun Engineering $105,495.39 for the work it performed.  Sun Engineering made progress payments to Cabrera totalling $60,726.14.  Sun Engineering refused to pay Cabrera the balance of $44,769.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabrera then filed suit.  As its defense, Sun Engineering claimed that the contract was for a total price of $80,000, and therefore, Sun Engineering only owed Cabrera $l9,273.86.  Sun Engineering also claimed that Cabrera negligently performed its work, and delayed the completion of the Project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After trial, the district court found that the parties entered into an informal contract.  In accordance with the contract, Cabrera was entitled to be paid $105,495.39 for the work it had performed on the Project.  The court found that Cabrera was not responsible for any Project delays.  Because Sun Engineering had only paid Cabrera $60,726.14, the court entered judgment in Cabrera's favor in the amount of $44,769.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sun Engineering then filed this appeal.  Sun Engineering makes three arguments on appeal.  Sun Engineering contends that 1) by allowing a modification of the pre-trial order at trial, the district court permitted Cabrera to introduce evidence with respect to the cost of the contract that contradicted a stipulated fact, and changed Cabrera's theory of its case, in violation of Fed.  R. Civ. P. 16(e);  2) the evidence presented at trial did not support the district court's conclusion that valid change orders were issued to Cabrera;  and 3) the record does not support the district court's finding that Cabrera was not responsible for Project delays.  Sun Engineering's arguments are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE RULE 16 CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final pre-trial order, the parties stipulated that \"the agreed price on said subcontract was $80,000.\"  At trial, Cabrera introduced its December 21, l989 quotation for $106,707.35 as an exhibit.  Sun Engineering objected to the introduction of this exhibit on the ground that the parties had stipulated that there was a contract for $80,000, and that this evidence, which suggested a different price for the contract, contradicted that stipulation.  The court overruled Sun Engineering's objection and permitted Cabrera to introduce the exhibit because the court believed that the quotation was relevant to the negotiations between the parties, and what the parties intended to be the terms of the contract.  On appeal, Sun Engineering argues that the court violated Fed.  R. Civ. P. 16(e)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> by effectively amending the pre-trial order at trial and permitting Cabrera to introduce evidence which contradicted a stipulated fact, and which changed Cabrera's theory of its case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court has broad discretion to preserve the integrity and purpose of the pre-trial order.

Rather, the court reviewed the pre-trial order, and based on its interpretation of that order, found that the exhibit Cabrera proposed to introduce was admissible.  The district court's actions were not an abuse of discretion.  After Sun Engineering objected to the introduction of the exhibit, the court reviewed the factual stipulation in the context of Cabrera's legal theory, which was also set out in the pre-trial order.  The court found that the introduction of the exhibit by Cabrera was consistent with its theory of the case.  Pursuant to the contract, Cabrera was entitled to be paid on the basis of the work it actually performed.  The December 21, l989 quotation and the subsequent change orders established the work that Cabrera was to perform.  While the factual stipulation did provide that the agreed cost of the contract was $80,000, the court stated that it would simply defy logic to find that Cabrera stipulated that the absolute price of the contract was $80,000, in light of its theory of the case.  Rather, the court found that the only reasonable interpretation of the stipulation was that it referred to an agreed \"estimated\" contract cost of $80,000.  The court acted within its discretion in interpreting the stipulation and pre-trial order in this manner, and we will not disturb its ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE CHANGE ORDERS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sun Engineering argues that in light of federal regulations which purportedly require all change orders on government projects to be in writing, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that valid change orders were issued to Cabrera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court will review a district court's findings of fact in a bench trial for clear error.

See Dedham Water, 972 F.2d at 457.  Mixed questions of fact and law, which require a court to determine if certain facts possess, or lack, legal significance in a given case, are also reviewed for clear error.   Roland M., 910 F.2d at 990.  Absent a showing that the court made a mistake of law, we will give effect to the trial's courts findings.   Id. at 990-91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the district court's factual findings that change orders were issued to Cabrera.  Mr. Cabrera and Mr. Jimenez testified that after Cabrera submitted the original quotation to Mr. Jimenez detailing the work Cabrera proposed to do, Mr. Jimenez requested that Cabrera make certain changes to the quotation.  Mr. Cabrera also offered undisputed testimony that after the parties entered into the original contract, Mr. Jimenez orally requested that Cabrera perform work beyond that encompassed in the contract with respect to floor underlays.  Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Elas both testified that Mr. Elas also orally requested Cabrera to do additional work with respect to partitions, that Mr. Jimenez was aware of this request, and that Cabrera made those requested changes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cabrera claims that even if oral changes were issued to Cabrera, they were of no legal consequence.  There is no requirement, however, that change orders to subcontractors on government projects be in writing and approved by the government to be legally binding.  Despite Sun Engineering's contention to the contrary, 48 C.F.R. Sec. 43.201 (1992) does not impose such a requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Part 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations generally addresses government policies and procedures for preparing and processing contract modifications. 48 C.F.R. Sec. 43.000 et seq.  (1992).  The regulations are directed to government contracting officers and those parties who contract directly with them.  Section 43.20l is specifically directed at the procedures which the government's contracting officer should follow when issuing a change order to its contracting partner.  Generally, the relationship covered by the regulation is that between the officer and the prime contractor on a government project.  The regulation does not apply to more remote parties, such as subcontractors, who contract solely with the prime contractor.  We have been unable to find any other statutory or regulatory requirement which purports to control the prime contractor's relationship with its subcontractors with respect to the logistics of contract modifications, such as change orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prime contractor/subcontractor relationship is governed by the terms of the contract between the parties.   See, e.g., United States for Control Systems, Inc. v. Arundel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484963\"><a href=\"/opinion/484963/united-states-of-america-for-the-use-and-benefit-of-control-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 196-97 (5th Cir.), modified on other grounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492652\"><a href=\"/opinion/492652/united-states-of-america-for-the-use-and-benefit-of-control-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1987).  In the present case, the court found that the contractual dealings between Cabrera and Sun Engineering were informal at best.  The parties never signed a final written contract.  Moreover, there was no oral or written contractual provision which required that any change orders issued to Cabrera had to be in writing, or approved by the contracting officer, in order to be valid.  Therefore, the oral change orders at issue were legally binding, and the district court properly found that Cabrera was entitled to be paid for the work performed pursuant to those orders.  This finding is in accord with the general purpose of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 270a-f (1986), a remedial statute, enacted to assure that all workers and subcontractors on government projects received compensation for their efforts.   See F.D. Rich Co. v. United States for Use of Indus.  Lumber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109048\"><a href=\"/opinion/109048/fd-rich-co-v-united-states-ex-rel-industrial-lumber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 124 (l974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DELAY CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sun Engineering contends that the district court's finding that Cabrera was not responsible for Project delays is unsupported by the record.  We disagree and find that the evidence amply supports the court's findings.  Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Delgado and Mr. Elas all offered uncontradicted testimony that Cabrera completed all required work on the Project.  There was evidence that Cabrera did correct some deficiencies in its work after the scheduled completion date of the Project.  With the exception of the testimony of Mr. Jimenez, however, the record is void of any evidence that this \"delay\" translated into any financial penalty to Sun Engineering.  While Mr. Jimenez testified that Sun Engineering was financially penalized for delays which were in fact caused by Cabrera, Mr. Elas offered conflicting testimony to the effect that Sun Engineering was solely responsible for the delays.  The trial court refused to credit Mr. Jimenez' testimony.  It was well within the court's discretion to determine whether or not it found Mr. Jimenez to be a credible witness.   See Dedham Water Co., Inc., 972 F.2d at 461.  There was no error in the court's findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. DOUBLE COSTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Sun Engineering filed a frivolous appeal, we find it appropriate to assess a monetary penalty of double costs against it.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 provides that \"[i]f a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\"   Westcott Constr.  Corp. v. Firemen's Fund of New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609221\"><a href=\"/opinion/609221/westcott-construction-corp-v-firemens-fund-of-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (lst Cir. l993).  An appeal is frivolous if the \"result was obvious\" or the arguments are \"wholly without merit.\"  Id. \"[I]t is enough that the appellants and their attorney should have been aware that the appeal had no chance of success.\"   E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544608\"><a href=\"/opinion/544608/eh-ashley-co-inc-and-willow-associates-v-wells-fargo-alarm/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span>, 1280 (lst Cir. l990).  Sun Engineering's arguments on appeal are wholly without merit.  There is no legal support for Sun Engineering's Fed.  R. Civ. P. 16(e) challenge, or its contention that change orders issued to Cabrera had to be in writing to be legally binding.  The record also amply supports the trial judge's factual findings, and there are simply no reasonable grounds to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.  We therefore award Cabrera double costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At trial, there was some dispute regarding the precise dollar figure of this initial quotation.
