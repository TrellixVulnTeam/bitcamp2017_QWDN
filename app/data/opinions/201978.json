Gleason on brief for petitioners.\n     John M. Lynch, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nCivil Division, United States Department of Justice, Peter D.\nKeisler, Assistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron,\nAssistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n                        December 22, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.              Petitioners in this immigration\n\ncase sought asylum relief, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (CAT).                The Immigration Judge\n\nand Board of Immigration Appeals denied relief, finding the asylum\n\napplication      time-barred       and      the    other     claims     meritless.\n\nPetitioners did not timely seek judicial review of that decision;\n\ninstead, they moved for reconsideration before the BIA, were\n\ndenied, and then sought judicial review of that latter denial.\n\n           Their petition presents a question of first impression in\n\nthis   circuit   as    to   limits     on   jurisdiction:     whether    8   U.S.C.\n\nยง 1158(a), which forbids direct review of the decision that an\n\nasylum application is time-barred, applies equally to review of the\n\nBIA's denial of reconsideration on the same issue.               We hold that it\n\ndoes, and therefore that we have no jurisdiction as to denial of\n\nasylum to the petitioners.\n\n           We     do    have       jurisdiction      over      the    denial    of\n\nreconsideration as to withholding of removal and CAT protection.\n\nSince we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nreconsideration of these claims, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                         I.\n\n           Petitioners       are   a   married     couple,    Agron   and    Sonila\n\nMehilli, and their three children, Xhesika, Xhonathan, and Serxhi\n\nMehilli.   All rely on the application for relief of the father,\n\nAgron Mehilli (\"Mehilli\").\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fA. Mehilli's Application and Testimony\n\n           Mehilli, a native of Albania, arrived in the United\n\nStates on a date which is the subject of some dispute.              Mehilli\n\napplied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on June\n\n23, 2001; in that application, he stated that he entered the United\n\nStates on December 5, 2000.       He later changed that date of entry,\n\nas we explain below.       On January 14, 2002, the former Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (INS)1 instituted removal proceedings\n\nagainst him.\n\n           On May 9, 2003, Mehilli appeared before an initial\n\nImmigration Judge.     He testified that he left Albania in late\n\nNovember of 2000 and traveled to Athens, then Milan, and finally\n\nLos Angeles, arriving on December 5, 2000.              Mehilli told the\n\ninitial IJ that he entered the United States using a false passport\n\nbearing the name Fatmir Gjata.          The initial IJ immediately asked\n\nthe government to check whether a Fatmir Gjata entered the country\n\non that date; the government ran a computer check and found no\n\nmatches.    When this was relayed to Mehilli, he said, \"I don't\n\nbelieve    it,   because    I   came,   that's   the   way   I   came   from\n\nAlbania . . . that's the name.\"         He added: \"I cannot lie.\"\n\n\n\n\n1\n    On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS\nsubsequently ceased to exist. See Homeland Security Act of 2002,\nPub. L. No. 107-296, ยง 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as\namended at 6 U.S.C. ยง 291(a)).\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            Mehilli later appeared before a second IJ on three\n\ndifferent dates in 2003 to offer further testimony.           At the first\n\nof these hearings, the IJ said he would \"start the case de novo\"\n\nand would take testimony even on issues covered by the initial IJ,\n\nbecause he needed to make credibility determinations himself.\n\n            Mehilli then testified to a version of events that\n\ndiffered substantially from both his earlier testimony and his\n\nasylum application: he stated that he had traveled from Athens to\n\nMilan using the name Fatmir Gjata, but that he had then traveled\n\nfrom Milan to Los Angeles with a Slovenian passport bearing the\n\nname Marko Brezar.     He also stated that he arrived on May 4, 2001,\n\nnot December 5, 2000.       Mehilli submitted as evidence a passport\n\nbearing the name Marko Brezar; he also submitted a plane ticket\n\nbearing the same name, which he said he had used to fly to Los\n\nAngeles.    Asked why he was changing his testimony, he testified\n\nthat \"the person that gave me these passports and tickets\" told him\n\n\"not to show the name and date that I arrived here.\"\n\n            During    the   same   hearing,   the    second   IJ   addressed\n\nMehilli's motion for a new trial, in which he argued that the\n\ninitial    IJ   had   behaved   improperly    by    discounting    Mehilli's\n\ncredibility and trying to impeach his testimony on peripheral\n\nissues.    The second IJ denied this motion, stating:\n\n            Your client has admitted to us that he was\n            lying to the Immigration Judge at the last\n            hearing. So I'm finding your motion here less\n            than convincing where . . . you seem to be\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             complaining that the Judge was impugning your\n             client's credibility at the last hearing\n             unfairly, when, in fact, it turns out that\n             your client was lying to the Judge.\n\nThe IJ went on to find that, since Mehilli offered little proof\n\nother than his own testimony as to his arrival date, and since he\n\nwas not credible given his false testimony under oath, he had not\n\nproved that he arrived in the United States within a year before\n\nfiling his asylum application; this failure rendered him ineligible\n\nfor asylum.\n\n             The IJ stated that despite this ruling, he would hear\n\nMehilli's testimony as to the merits of all three claims for\n\nrelief.2     Mehilli testified as follows: He became a member of\n\nAlbania's Democratic Party in 1992 and played an active role in the\n\nparty.      Beginning in 1993, he owned a bakery in Tirana, the\n\nAlbanian capital.           In 1997, the rival Socialist Party came to\n\npower,     and    Mehilli    began   to    feel   pressure   from   government\n\nofficials.       In February 1997, members of the Socialist Party came\n\nto Mehilli's bakery and told him to close it down; they told him\n\nthey were closing bakeries like his because they wanted to \"take\n\nthe Democratic Party off the power.\"                Mehilli refused.      When\n\nSocialist officials started paying return visits to bakeries,\n\nasking them why they had not closed as ordered, Mehilli moved to a\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ noted that this would permit him to make an alternative\nfinding as to asylum, which would be necessary should the\ndetermination of ineligibility be reversed on appeal.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fnew space elsewhere in Tirana; the bakery occupied the first floor,\n\nwhile Mehilli and his family lived upstairs.      The bakery kept\n\nrunning even after Mehilli left Albania, and Mehilli was still\n\nreceiving money from its operation, even up to the time of the\n\nhearing.\n\n           In the summer of 2000, Mehilli testified, he received a\n\nletter purporting to levy a $20,000 fine against his bakery; the\n\nletter stated that if Mehilli did not pay, he would be killed.    He\n\noffered no evidence as to who might have sent the letter.   However,\n\nhe testified that several days later, he went to pick up his voting\n\ncard and discovered that his and his wife's names were misspelled\n\non their cards; at this point, he testified, he realized the\n\nincidents were connected -- Socialists had altered his card so he\n\ncould not vote, and the fine was being levied for political\n\nreasons.   He admitted on cross-examination, however, that many\n\nvoters experienced problems with the voter registration lists.\n\n           Several days after the voting card incident, Mehilli\n\ntestified, police officers came to his home at 5 a.m. and searched\n\nit.   He testified that the officers pushed him against a wall and\n\nsaid, \"we came to pick up the guns that you have illegally, because\n\nyou're a member of the Democratic Party, you have guns.\"    Finally,\n\nMehilli testified that in November 2000, unknown assailants tried\n\nto kidnap his younger son.   He stated that one day, as his wife,\n\nher brother, and his son were leaving the brother's home, three\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fpeople \"tried to grab\" his wife and take her son from her arms.               He\n\ncould not identify the assailants; he said they must have been\n\nSocialists because the kidnapping attempt \"was a continuance . . .\n\nof their actions\" against him.\n\n            Mehilli's wife, Sonila, also testified.                  As to the\n\nattempted kidnapping, she testified that an armed man tried to grab\n\nher son and she pushed him away; as she did so, her brother opened\n\nfire, frightening the man off.       She stated that she did not fall to\n\nthe ground at any time during the incident.               As to the search,\n\nSonila Mehilli said she saw an officer push her husband, and that\n\nno one else was pushed.\n\nB. The IJ's Decision and Subsequent Appeals\n\n            The second IJ's oral decision of September 5, 2003\n\nrejected    Mehilli's   application      on   numerous    grounds.      The   IJ\n\nreaffirmed his finding that Mehilli was time-barred from seeking\n\nasylum.     He noted that Mehilli's application was dated June 23,\n\n2001, and that on the application Mehilli wrote that he had entered\n\nthe United States on December 5, 2000.           However, he also noted that\n\nMehilli admitted testifying falsely under oath to the initial IJ.\n\nThe   IJ   found,   based   on   these   facts    and   his   observations    of\n\nMehilli's demeanor, that Mehilli was not credible.              Since Mehilli\n\nhad relied largely3 on his own testimony to prove his date of\n\n\n3\n   Mehilli also relied implicitly on several Albanian documents he\nsubmitted, one of which appeared to be dated December 2000; his\nclaim (though never made clear on the record) seemed to be that the\n\n                                     -7-\n\fentry, the IJ found that Mehilli had not established an arrival\n\ndate and thus had not established that his application was filed\n\nwithin one year of arrival.4   The IJ also rejected Mehilli's claim\n\nthat he should be exempted from the deadline due to extraordinary\n\ncircumstances -- specifically, ineffective assistance of counsel --\n\nbecause Mehilli had not complied with the regulatory requirements\n\nfor making such a claim.\n\n          Nonetheless, the IJ proceeded, in the alternative, to\n\nconsider Mehilli's asylum claim, and other claims for relief, on\n\ntheir merits.5   The IJ pointed to a number of inconsistencies in\n\nMehilli's story.   These included, inter alia, (1) that Mehilli's\n\n\ndocuments' existence demonstrated that he was still in Albania in\nlate 2000. However, the IJ explicitly found that the documents\nwere \"not genuine\"; he noted that the documents were not properly\nauthenticated and that someone apparently had attempted to alter\none of the documents by writing over the printed date with a pen.\n4\n   The IJ found Mehilli's explanation for his false testimony --\nthat he had been told not to reveal the existence of the \"Marko\nBrezar\" documents -- not credible.\n5\n     An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing\neligibility by proving he or she is a \"refugee\" -- that is, by\nproving past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\npersecution \"on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"      8 U.S.C.\nยง 1101(a)(42)(A).   \"[I]n order to establish refugee status, an\nalien must support his claim of persecution through credible\ntestimony.\" Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.\n2005). Because withholding of removal places a higher burden of\nproof on the applicant than does asylum, failure to carry the\nburden for asylum necessarily dooms a withholding claim.      See,\ne.g., Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.\n2005). As to CAT protection, an applicant must show that he or she\n\"more likely than not . . . would be tortured if removed.\"       8\nC.F.R. ยง 208.16(c)(2).\n\n                                -8-\n\ftestimony as to the search was at sharp variance with affidavits in\n\nwhich he said twenty soldiers tore his house apart and pushed him,\n\nhis wife, and his children; and (2) that his wife's testimony that\n\nshe never fell during the kidnapping attempt contradicted Mehilli's\n\nstatement in an affidavit that she was pushed to the ground.                  Based\n\non the inconsistencies and on Mehilli's initial false testimony,\n\nthe IJ again found Mehilli not credible.\n\n           Further, the IJ found that even assuming Mehilli was\n\ncredible, Mehilli had not proved persecution.                  He found that the\n\nharms Mehilli described were not serious enough to constitute past\n\npersecution,      and   that    even    if    they    were,    Mehilli     had    not\n\nestablished a nexus with a protected ground.                 As to fear of future\n\npersecution, the IJ found that Mehilli had offered no proof; he\n\nnoted that Mehilli's family continued to live safely in Albania and\n\nthat his bakery continued to operate without apparent problems. As\n\nto withholding of removal and CAT protection, the IJ found that\n\nMehilli's inability to meet the burden for asylum doomed his\n\nwithholding    claim    and    that    Mehilli    had   failed      to   adduce   any\n\nevidence of torture.\n\n           Mehilli appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ's\n\nfindings had been erroneous and that his consideration of Mehilli's\n\nfalse testimony constituted a denial of fundamental fairness.                     On\n\nDecember   17,    2004,   the   BIA    affirmed      using    its   \"adoption     and\n\naffirmance\"      procedure.      It    noted     that   Mehilli's        fundamental\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\ffairness argument was meritless because the IJ did not err in\n\nconsidering Mehilli's \"admittedly false testimony.\"\n\n          Mehilli did not seek judicial review of that decision.\n\nInstead, he moved for reconsideration.   On February 24, 2005, the\n\nBIA denied the motion.   Mehilli timely petitioned for review of\n\nthis denial.\n\n                               II.\n\n          On appeal, Mehilli makes two primary arguments.   First,\n\nhe says the BIA should have reconsidered his case because the\n\nsecond IJ improperly characterized his false testimony before the\n\ninitial IJ as perjury; he argues that that characterization \"so\n\nimpermissibly burdened the evaluation of [his] credibility and the\n\nauthentication of his documents so as to implicate fundamental\n\nfairness principles.\"6    Second, he argues that the IJ relied\n\nheavily on State Department reports concerning improving conditions\n\nin Albania and that this reliance \"precluded discrete consideration\n\nof the Petitioners' particular circumstances of persecution.\"   The\n\n\n\n6\n   Mehilli also argues that he was denied fundamental fairness\nbecause the IJ incorrectly found that his documents had to meet the\nauthentication requirements of 8 C.F.R. ยง 287.6(b), which applies\nto documents from nations not signatory to the Hague Convention on\nAbolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public\nDocuments, Oct. 5, 1961, 33 U.S.T. 883, 527 U.N.T.S. 189.\nMehilli's argument is that while it is true that Albania was not a\nsignatory at the time of his hearings before the IJ, \"in practice\"\nthe U.S. Embassy in Tirana treated Albania as if it were. This\nargument has no merit: 8 C.F.R. ยง 287.6 contains no such exception\nfor Albanian documents, and Mehilli presents no evidence that such\nan exception exists.\n\n                               -10-\n\fgovernment, meanwhile, argues that under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(3),\n\nthis court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the BIA's\n\nrefusal to reconsider its decision that Mehilli's asylum claim was\n\ntime-barred; as to the other relief, the government argues there\n\nwas no abuse of discretion in denying reconsideration.\n\nA. Jurisdiction Over Denial of Motion to Reconsider as to Asylum\n\n          Two jurisdiction-limiting statutes are at play.      The\n\nfirst, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(3), enacted in 1996,7 provides that \"[n]o\n\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the\n\nAttorney General under paragraph (2).\"    This limitation refers,\n\ninter alia, to determinations as to whether the applicant complied\n\nwith the one-year filing deadline for asylum, id. ยง 1158(a)(2)(B),\n\nand as to whether extraordinary circumstances excuse an alien's\n\nbelated filing, id. ยง 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n          The second provision was added in 2005.   As part of the\n\nREAL ID Act, Congress reframed the limits on jurisdiction to\n\nprovide an exception:\n\n          Nothing in subparagraph (B) or ยฉ, or in any\n          other provision of [the Immigration and\n          Nationality Act] (other than this section)\n          which limits or eliminates judicial review,\n          shall be construed as precluding review of\n          constitutional claims or questions of law\n          raised upon a petition for review filed with\n          an appropriate court of appeals in accordance\n          with this section.\n\n\n\n7\n  See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\nof 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, ยง 604, 110 Stat. 3009-691.\n\n                               -11-\n\fREAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, ยง 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119\n\nStat. 231-310 (codified at 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(a)(2)(D)); see also Sena\n\nv. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (citing\n\nยง 106(a)(1)(A)(iii) and concluding that the court had jurisdiction\n\nbecause constitutional and legal questions were presented).\n\n              These provisions present two questions.               The first is\n\nwhether a denial of reconsideration -- as opposed to the initial\n\nBIA decision on appeal from the IJ -- is a decision \"under\n\nparagraph (2)\" of ยง 1158(a) such as                   to strip this court of\n\njurisdiction.         Second,    if     we   answer     that   question   in     the\n\naffirmative, we must examine whether jurisdiction has been restored\n\nby ยง 1252(a)(2)(D).\n\n              1. Section 1158(a)(3) and Motions for Reconsideration\n\n              As to the first question, we hold that Mehilli has not\n\ngained    a   right   to     judicial    review    of    the   BIA's    timeliness\n\ndetermination that he would not have had on a petition from an\n\ninitial   rejection     by    waiting    and   then     attacking   a   denial    of\n\nreconsideration of the same issue.             Recognition of jurisdiction in\n\nthese circumstances would circumvent both the purposes of the\n\njurisdictional limitation and the purposes of reconsideration.\n\nThis is also the conclusion reached by other circuit courts that\n\nhave addressed the issue under related statutory provisions.                     See\n\nRodriguez v. Ashcroft, 253 F.3d 797, 800 (5th Cir. 2001) (\"[I]f we\n\nare divested of jurisdiction to review an original determination by\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fthe Board . . . we must also be divested of jurisdiction to review\n\nthe Board's denial of a motion to reopen [on the same grounds.]\");\n\nsee also Mariuta v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 361, 364-65 (2d Cir. 2005)\n\n(where   an   order   denying   a   motion   to   reopen   is   based   on   an\n\nevaluation of the right to the underlying relief sought, the order\n\nis \"under\" the statute controlling the underlying relief); Durant\n\nv. U.S. INS, 393 F.3d 113, 115 (2d Cir. 2004) (orders of removal\n\nand denials of motions to reopen \"are sufficiently connected\" that\n\npermitting review of the latter when the INA bars review of the\n\nformer \"would provide an improper backdoor method of challenging a\n\nremoval order\"); Pilch v. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d 585, 587 (7th Cir.\n\n2003) (applying an INA jurisdictional bar to denial of a motion to\n\nreopen where petitioners' \"principal claim\" rested on a decision\n\nentrusted to the discretion of the Attorney General).8           This leaves\n\n\n8\n  The government suggests in its brief that the Ninth Circuit took\na contrary position in Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 520\n(9th Cir. 2004).     It is true that Medina-Morales held that a\njudicial review bar imposed by the INA โ- specifically, 8 U.S.C.\nยง 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) -- did not apply to review of a BIA denial of a\nmotion to reopen. 371 F.3d at 527. Nonetheless, we doubt Medina-\nMorales is in conflict. There, petitioner initially applied for\nadjustment of status, then abandoned the claim, and later moved to\nreopen to reassert it. Id. at 524. The BIA denied his motion to\nreopen. Id. The Ninth Circuit concluded that it had jurisdiction\ndespite the general statutory bar on review of adjustment-of-status\ndeterminations. It reasoned that since petitioner had abandoned\nhis adjustment-of-status claim, the IJ had never ruled on\nadjustment of status at all. Id. at 527. Therefore, the denial of\nreopening was not a decision \"under\" the adjustment-of-status\nprovision, but instead a decision \"under\" the provision that had\nprovided grounds for petitioner's removal -- a provision over which\nthe court had jurisdiction. Id. Medina-Morales thus is compatible\nwith the proposition that when an order denying reconsideration\n\n                                    -13-\n\fthe question of the effect of the REAL ID Act's redefinition of the\n\njurisdictional limitation.\n\n              2. The Effect of Section 1252(a)(2)(D)\n\n              The relevant provision, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(a)(2)(D),9 states\n\nin relevant part that \"[n]othing in subparagraph (B) or ยฉ, or in\n\nany other provision of [the INA] (other than this section) which\n\nlimits   or    eliminates     judicial   review,      shall    be   construed   as\n\nprecluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law.\"\n\nUnder    the     terms   of     this     limited      jurisdictional        grant,\n\n\"discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside\n\nthe jurisdiction of the courts of appeals,\" Vasile v. Gonzales, 417\n\nF.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir. 2005), and BIA findings as to timeliness\n\nand changed circumstances are usually factual determinations, see\n\nChacon-Botero v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.\n\n2005); Ramadan v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\nHere the untimeliness finding was a factual one, based on Mehilli's\n\nlack of credibility.\n\n              Mehilli,   however,      makes   what    he     purports    to be a\n\nconstitutional argument as to the timeliness finding.                    He argues\n\nthat (1) the second IJ's characterization of Mehilli's false\n\n\nengages a previous decision \"under\" a given provision, the order is\nalso a decision \"under\" that underlying provision.\n9\n   The subsection took effect immediately upon enactment in May\n2005 and \"appl[ies] to cases in which the final administrative\norder of removal . . . was issued before, on, or after the date of\nthe enactment.\" REAL ID Act ยง 106(b).\n\n                                       -14-\n\fstatements before the first IJ as \"perjury\" was incorrect because\n\nMehilli withdrew the false statements, and therefore they did not\n\nconstitute   perjury        as    a    legal      matter,    and   (2)     the   perjury\n\ncharacterization       so        infected      the    second       IJ's     credibility\n\ndetermination as to render the decision as to timeliness, and the\n\nproceedings in general, fundamentally unfair and a violation of due\n\nprocess requirements.\n\n           The argument fails to bring Mehilli's asylum claim within\n\nthe REAL ID Act exception.                 A claim would at least have to be\n\ncolorable for the exception to apply.                     As the Ninth Circuit has\n\nsaid in a related context:\n\n           [A] petitioner may not create the jurisdiction\n           that Congress chose to remove simply by\n           cloaking an . . . argument in constitutional\n           garb. . . . [T]o invoke our jurisdiction, a\n           petitioner must allege at least a colorable\n           constitutional violation. To be colorable in\n           this context, the alleged violation need not\n           be substantial, but the claim must have some\n           possible validity.\n\nTorres-Aguilar    v.    INS,       246     F.3d    1267,    1271   (9th     Cir.   2001)\n\n(citations omitted) (quoting Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 F.3d\n\n1133, 1135 n.3 (9th Cir. 2000); and United States v. Sarkisian, 197\n\nF.3d 966, 983 (9th Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nTorres-Aguilar noted that any other outcome \"would allow [aliens]\n\nto circumvent clear congressional intent to eliminate judicial\n\nreview.\"   Id.   We do not have to decide now how strong a showing of\n\na   constitutional     claim          is   needed    to     give   us     jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\fMehilli's argument is not even colorable: a routine credibility\n\nfinding by an IJ reasonably based on false statements by an\n\napplicant      cannot    possibly    raise    a   due      process     \"fundamental\n\nfairness\" argument.        The argument is frivolous.10\n\n            Further, to the extent Mehilli's brief may be read as\n\narguing (1) that, as to credibility, the IJ incorrectly weighed the\n\nevidence, failed to explicitly consider certain evidence, or simply\n\nreached the wrong outcome, and (2) that that purported error\n\nconstituted a due process violation, Mehilli still fails to state\n\na    colorable     constitutional       claim        within      the     ambit     of\n\nยง 1252(a)(2)(D).        As we have held, such arguments are not properly\n\nviewed as constitutional challenges at all, but instead as simple\n\nclaims   that     substantial      evidence    did    not     support    the     IJ's\n\ncredibility finding.        See Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st\n\nCir.   2001)    (stating    that    petitioner's        argument     that    the   IJ\n\n\"improperly      overlooked     evidence\"     and     in    so   doing      violated\n\npetitioner's due process rights \"is, in our view, just a variation\n\non a substantial evidence challenge, and so we apply the usual\n\nsubstantial evidence standard\"); see also Kalitani v. Ashcroft, 340\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Kalitani's [due process] argument boils\n\ndown to an assertion that the IJ should have believed her. But the\n\n\n\n10\n   The argument would still fail for this reason even if it had\nbeen presented on a direct petition for review. Mehilli gains no\nfurther rights to review by making the argument on a motion for\nreconsideration.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fIJ was not compelled to believe her, and substantial evidence . .\n\n. supports his decision not to do so.\").\n\nB. Withholding of Removal and CAT Protection\n\n           There is no question that we have jurisdiction over the\n\ndenial of reconsideration as it relates to the withholding of\n\nremoval and CAT claims.      We review BIA decisions on motions to\n\nreconsider solely for abuse of discretion.          Hossain v. Ashcroft,\n\n381 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 2004).      \"In the reconsideration context,\n\nwe will find an abuse of discretion if the denial was made without\n\na 'rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis' (such as race).\"\n\nZhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 293 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Nascimento\n\nv. INS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n           In its denial of reconsideration, the BIA stated that it\n\nwas \"not persuaded\" that the BIA relied too heavily on country\n\ncondition reports about Albania prepared by the State Department.\n\nIt also stated that (1) the IJ properly found that Mehilli was not\n\ncredible, (2) the IJ properly found that even if Mehilli were\n\ncredible the incidents he described did not constitute persecution,\n\n(3) it saw \"no basis\" to disturb its finding that Mehilli's hearing\n\nwas fundamentally fair, and (4) Mehilli had demonstrated no error\n\nof fact or law in the BIA's prior decision.\n\n           There was no abuse of discretion.        In the end, Mehilli's\n\nown   testimony   was   supportably   found   not   credible.    His   two\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\farguments on reconsideration -- fundamental fairness and over-\n\nreliance on country condition reports -- do not undercut that\n\nfinding.   That ends the matter.    See Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d\n\n89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"The IJ's well documented finding that\n\nSettenda   failed   to   support   his    application   for   asylum   and\n\nwithholding with credible testimony dooms his claim on appeal.\").\n\n                                   III.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f",

Mehilli's Application and Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli, a native of Albania, arrived in the United States on a date which is the subject of some dispute. Mehilli applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on June 23, 2001; in that application, he stated that he entered the United States on December 5, 2000. He later changed that date of entry, as we explain below. On January 14, 2002, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> instituted removal proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2003, Mehilli appeared before an initial Immigration Judge. He testified that he left Albania in late November of 2000 and traveled to Athens, then Milan, and finally Los Angeles, arriving on December 5, 2000. Mehilli told the initial IJ that he entered the United States using a false passport bearing the name Fatmir Gjata. The initial IJ immediately asked the government to check whether a Fatmir Gjata entered the country on that date; the government ran a computer check and found no matches. When this was relayed to Mehilli, he said, \"I don't believe it, because I came, that's the way I came from Albania . . . that's the name.\" He added: \"I cannot lie.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli later appeared before a second IJ on three different dates in 2003 to offer further testimony. At the first of these hearings, the IJ said he would \"start the case de novo\" and would take testimony even on issues covered by the initial IJ, because he needed to make credibility determinations himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli then testified to a version of events that differed substantially from both his earlier testimony and his asylum application: he stated that he had traveled from Athens to Milan using the name Fatmir Gjata, but that he had then traveled from Milan to Los Angeles with a Slovenian passport bearing the name Marko Brezar. He also stated that he arrived on May 4, 2001, not December 5, 2000. Mehilli submitted as evidence a passport bearing the name Marko Brezar; he also submitted a plane ticket bearing the same name, which he said he had used to fly to Los Angeles. Asked why he was changing his testimony, he testified that \"the person that gave me these passports and tickets\" told him \"not to show the name and date that I arrived here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same hearing, the second IJ addressed Mehilli's motion for a new trial, in which he argued that the initial IJ had behaved improperly by discounting Mehilli's credibility and trying to impeach his testimony on peripheral issues. The second IJ denied this motion, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Your client has admitted to us that he was lying to the Immigration Judge at the last hearing. So I'm finding your motion here less than convincing where . . . you seem to be complaining that the Judge was impugning your client's credibility at the last hearing unfairly, when, in fact, it turns out that your client was lying to the Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ went on to find that, since Mehilli offered little proof other than his own testimony as to his arrival date, and since he was not credible given his false testimony under oath, he had not proved that he arrived in the United States within a year before filing his asylum application; this failure rendered him ineligible for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ stated that despite this ruling, he would hear Mehilli's testimony as to the merits of all three claims for relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mehilli testified as follows: He became a member of Albania's Democratic Party in 1992 and played an active role in the party. Beginning in 1993, he owned a bakery in Tirana, the Albanian capital. In 1997, the rival Socialist Party came to power, and Mehilli began to feel pressure from government officials. In February 1997, members of the Socialist Party came to Mehilli's bakery and told him to close it down; they told him they were closing bakeries like his because they wanted to \"take the Democratic Party off the power.\" Mehilli refused. When Socialist officials started paying return visits to bakeries, asking them why they had not closed as ordered, Mehilli moved to a new space elsewhere in Tirana; the bakery occupied the first floor, while Mehilli and his family lived upstairs. The bakery kept running even after Mehilli left Albania, and Mehilli was still receiving money from its operation, even up to the time of the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 2000, Mehilli testified, he received a letter purporting to levy a $20,000 fine against his bakery; the letter stated that if Mehilli did not pay, he would be killed. He offered no evidence as to who might have sent the letter. However, he testified that several days later, he went to pick up his voting card and discovered that his and his wife's names were misspelled on their cards; at this point, he testified, he realized the incidents were connected &#8212; Socialists had altered his card so he could not vote, and the fine was being levied for political reasons. He admitted on cross-examination, however, that many voters experienced problems with the voter registration lists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days after the voting card incident, Mehilli testified, police officers came to his home at 5 a.m. and searched it. He testified that the officers pushed him against a wall and said, \"we came to pick up the guns that you have illegally, because you're a member of the Democratic Party, you have guns.\" Finally, Mehilli testified that in November 2000, unknown assailants tried to kidnap his younger son. He stated that one day, as his wife, her brother, and his son were leaving the brother's home, three people \"tried to grab\" his wife and take her son from her arms. He could not identify the assailants; he said they must have been Socialists because the kidnapping attempt \"was a continuance . . . of their actions\" against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli's wife, Sonila, also testified. As to the attempted kidnapping, she testified that an armed man tried to grab her son and she pushed him away; as she did so, her brother opened fire, frightening the man off. She stated that she did not fall to the ground at any time during the incident. As to the search, Sonila Mehilli said she saw an officer push her husband, and that no one else was pushed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The IJ's Decision and Subsequent Appeals</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second IJ's oral decision of September 5, 2003 rejected Mehilli's application on numerous grounds. The IJ reaffirmed his finding that Mehilli was time-barred from seeking asylum. He noted that Mehilli's application was dated June 23, 2001, and that on the application Mehilli wrote that he had entered the United States on December 5, 2000. However, he also noted that Mehilli admitted testifying falsely under oath to the initial IJ. The IJ found, based on these facts and his observations of Mehilli's demeanor, that Mehilli was not credible. Since Mehilli had relied largely<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on his own testimony to prove his date of entry, the IJ found that Mehilli had not established an arrival date and thus had not established that his application was filed within one year of arrival.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The IJ also rejected Mehilli's claim that he should be exempted from the deadline due to extraordinary circumstances &#8212; specifically, ineffective assistance of counsel &#8212; because Mehilli had not complied with the regulatory requirements for making such a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the IJ proceeded, in the alternative, to consider Mehilli's asylum claim, and other claims for relief, on their merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The IJ pointed to a number of inconsistencies in Mehilli's story. These included, inter alia, (1) that Mehilli's testimony as to the search was at sharp variance with affidavits in which he said twenty soldiers tore his house apart and pushed him, his wife, and his children; and (2) that his wife's testimony that she never fell during the kidnapping attempt contradicted Mehilli's statement in an affidavit that she was pushed to the ground. Based on the inconsistencies and on Mehilli's initial false testimony, the IJ again found Mehilli not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the IJ found that even assuming Mehilli was credible, Mehilli had not proved persecution. He found that the harms Mehilli described were not serious enough to constitute past persecution, and that even if they were, Mehilli had not established a nexus with a protected ground. As to fear of future persecution, the IJ found that Mehilli had offered no proof; he noted that Mehilli's family continued to live safely in Albania and that his bakery continued to operate without apparent problems. As to withholding of removal and CAT protection, the IJ found that Mehilli's inability to meet the burden for asylum doomed his withholding claim and that Mehilli had failed to adduce any evidence of torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ's findings had been erroneous and that his consideration of Mehilli's false testimony constituted a denial of fundamental fairness. On December 17, 2004, the BIA affirmed using its \"adoption and affirmance\" procedure. It noted that Mehilli's fundamental fairness argument was meritless because the IJ did not err in considering Mehilli's \"admittedly false testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli did not seek judicial review of that decision. Instead, he moved for reconsideration. On February 24, 2005, the BIA denied the motion. Mehilli timely petitioned for review of this denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mehilli makes two primary arguments. First, he says the BIA should have reconsidered his case because the second IJ improperly characterized his false testimony before the initial IJ as perjury; he argues that that characterization \"so impermissibly burdened the evaluation of [his] credibility and the authentication of his documents so as to implicate fundamental fairness principles.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Second, he argues that the IJ relied heavily on State Department reports concerning improving conditions in Albania and that this reliance \"precluded discrete consideration of the Petitioners' particular circumstances of persecution.\" The government, meanwhile, argues that under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3), this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the BIA's refusal to reconsider its decision that Mehilli's asylum claim was time-barred; as to the other relief, the government argues there was no abuse of discretion in denying reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The first, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3), enacted in 1996,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> provides that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\" This limitation refers, inter alia, to determinations as to whether the applicant complied with the one-year filing deadline for asylum, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B), and as to whether extraordinary circumstances excuse an alien's belated filing, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second provision was added in 2005.

The first is whether a denial of reconsideration &#8212; as opposed to the initial BIA decision on appeal from the IJ &#8212; is a decision \"under paragraph (2)\" of &#167; 1158(a) such as to strip this court of jurisdiction. Second, if we answer that question in the affirmative, we must examine whether jurisdiction has been restored by &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Section 1158(a)(3) and Motions for Reconsideration</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first question, we hold that Mehilli has not gained a right to judicial review of the BIA's timeliness determination that he would not have had on a petition from an initial rejection by waiting and then attacking a denial of reconsideration of the same issue. Recognition of jurisdiction in these circumstances would circumvent both the purposes of the jurisdictional limitation and the purposes of reconsideration. This is also the conclusion reached by other circuit courts that have addressed the issue under related statutory provisions. <i>See Rodriguez v. Ashcroft,</i> 253 F.3d 797, 800 (5th Cir.2001) (\"[I]f we are divested of jurisdiction to review an original determination by the Board. . . we must also be divested of jurisdiction to review the Board's denial of a motion to reopen [on the same grounds.]\"); <i>see also Mariuta v.

Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.2005), and BIA findings as to timeliness and changed circumstances are usually factual determinations, <i>see Chacon Botero v.

He argues that (1) the second IJ's characterization of Mehilli's false statements before the first IJ as \"perjury\" was incorrect because Mehilli withdrew the false statements, and therefore they did not constitute perjury as a legal matter, and (2) the perjury characterization so infected the second IJ's credibility determination as to render the decision as to timeliness, and the proceedings in general, fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument fails to bring Mehilli's asylum claim within the REAL ID Act exception. A claim would at least have to be colorable for the exception to apply. As the Ninth Circuit has said in a related context:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an . . . argument in constitutional garb. . . .

Mehilli's argument is not even colorable: a routine credibility finding by an IJ reasonably based on false statements by an applicant cannot possibly raise a due process \"fundamental fairness\" argument. The argument is frivolous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, to the extent Mehilli's brief may be read as arguing (1) that, as to credibility, the IJ incorrectly weighed the evidence, failed to explicitly consider certain evidence, or simply reached the wrong outcome, and (2) that that purported error constituted a due process violation, Mehilli still fails to state a colorable constitutional claim within the ambit of &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D). As we have held, such arguments are not properly viewed as constitutional challenges at all, but instead as simple claims that substantial evidence did not support the IJ's credibility finding. <i>See Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that petitioner's argument that the IJ \"improperly overlooked evidence\" and in so doing violated petitioner's due process rights \"is, in our view, just a variation on a substantial evidence challenge, and so we apply the usual substantial evidence standard\"); <i>see also Kalitani v. Ashcroft,</i> 340 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Kalitani's [due process] argument boils down to an assertion that the IJ should have believed her.

We review BIA decisions on motions to reconsider solely for abuse of discretion. <i>Hossain v. Ashcroft,</i> 381 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.2004). \"In the reconsideration context, we will find an abuse of discretion if the denial was made without a `rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis' (such as race).\" <i>Zhang v.

It also stated that (1) the IJ properly found that Mehilli was not credible, (2) the IJ properly found that even if Mehilli were credible the incidents he described did not constitute persecution, (3) it saw \"no basis\" to disturb its finding that Mehilli's hearing was fundamentally fair, and (4) Mehilli had demonstrated no error of fact or law in the BIA's prior decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion. In the end, Mehilli's own testimony was supportably found not credible. His two arguments on reconsideration &#8212; fundamental fairness and over-reliance on country condition reports &#8212; do not undercut that finding. That ends the matter. <i>See Settenda v.

Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir.2005). Because withholding of removal places a higher burden of proof on the applicant than does asylum, failure to carry the burden for asylum necessarily dooms a withholding claim. <i>See, e.g., Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2005).

Mehilli's argument is that while it is true that Albania was not a signatory at the time of his hearings before the IJ, \"in practice\" the U.S. Embassy in Tirana treated Albania as if it were. This argument has no merit: 8 C.F.R. &#167; 287.6 contains no such exception for Albanian documents, and Mehilli presents no evidence that such an exception exists</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> <i>See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996</i> (IIRIRA), Pub.L.

It is true that <i>Medina-Morales</i> held that a judicial review bar imposed by the INA &#8212; specifically, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) &#8212; did not apply to review of a BIA denial of a motion to reopen. 371 F.3d at 527. Nonetheless, we doubt <i>Medina-Morales</i> is in conflict. There, petitioner initially applied for adjustment of status, then abandoned the claim, and later moved to reopen to reassert it. <i>Id.</i> at 524. The BIA denied his motion to reopen. <i>Id.</i> The Ninth Circuit concluded that it had jurisdiction despite the general statutory bar on review of adjustment-of-status determinations. It reasoned that since petitioner had abandoned his adjustment-of-status claim, the IJ <i>had never ruled on adjustment of status at all. Id.</i> at 527. Therefore, the denial of reopening was not a decision \"under\" the adjustment-of-status provision, but instead a decision \"under\" the provision that had provided grounds for petitioner's removal &#8212; a provision over which the court had jurisdiction. <i>Id.

Mehilli applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief on June 23, 2001; in that application, he stated that he entered the United States on December 5, 2000. He later changed that date of entry, as we explain below. On January 14, 2002, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> instituted removal proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2003, Mehilli appeared before an initial Immigration Judge. He testified that he left Albania in late November of 2000 and traveled to Athens, then Milan, and finally Los Angeles, arriving on December 5, 2000. Mehilli told the initial IJ that he entered the United States using a false passport bearing the name Fatmir Gjata. The initial IJ immediately asked the government to check whether a Fatmir Gjata entered the country on that date; the government ran a computer check and found no matches. When this was relayed to Mehilli, he said, \"I don't believe it, because I came, that's the way I came from Albania . . . that's the name.\" He added: \"I cannot lie.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli later appeared before a second IJ on three different dates in 2003 to offer further testimony.

He also stated that he arrived on May 4, 2001, not December 5, 2000. Mehilli submitted as evidence a passport bearing the name Marko Brezar; he also submitted a plane ticket bearing the same name, which he said he had used to fly to Los Angeles. Asked why he was changing his testimony, he testified that \"the person that gave me these passports and tickets\" told him \"not to show the name and date that I arrived here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same hearing, the second IJ addressed Mehilli's motion for a new trial, in which he argued that the initial IJ had behaved improperly by discounting Mehilli's credibility and trying to impeach his testimony on peripheral issues.

So I'm finding your motion here less than convincing where . . . you seem to be complaining that the Judge was impugning your client's credibility at the last hearing unfairly, when, in fact, it turns out that your client was lying to the Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ went on to find that, since Mehilli offered little proof other than his own testimony as to his arrival date, and since he was not credible given his false testimony under oath, he had not proved that he arrived in the United States within a year before filing his asylum application; this failure rendered him ineligible for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ stated that despite this ruling, he would hear Mehilli's testimony as to the merits of all three claims for relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mehilli testified as follows: He became a member of Albania's Democratic Party in 1992 and played an active role in the party. Beginning in 1993, he owned a bakery in Tirana, the Albanian capital. In 1997, the rival Socialist Party came to power, and Mehilli began to feel pressure from government officials. In February 1997, members of the Socialist Party came to Mehilli's bakery and told him to close it down; they told him they were closing bakeries like his because they wanted to \"take the Democratic Party off the power.\" Mehilli refused. When Socialist officials started paying return visits to bakeries, asking them why they had not closed as ordered, Mehilli moved to a new space elsewhere in Tirana; the bakery occupied the first floor, while Mehilli and his family lived upstairs. The bakery kept running even after Mehilli left Albania, and Mehilli was still receiving money from its operation, even up to the time of the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 2000, Mehilli testified, he received a letter purporting to levy a $20,000 fine against his bakery; the letter stated that if Mehilli did not pay, he would be killed. He offered no evidence as to who might have sent the letter. However, he testified that several days later, he went to pick up his voting card and discovered that his and his wife's names were misspelled on their cards; at this point, he testified, he realized the incidents were connected &#8212; Socialists had altered his card so he could not vote, and the fine was being levied for political reasons. He admitted on cross-examination, however, that many voters experienced problems with the voter registration lists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days after the voting card incident, Mehilli testified, police officers came to his home at 5 a.m. and searched it. He testified that the officers pushed him against a wall and said, \"we came to pick up the guns that you have illegally, because you're a member of the Democratic Party, you have guns.\" Finally, Mehilli testified that in November 2000, unknown assailants tried to kidnap his younger son. He stated that one day, as his wife, her brother, and his son were leaving the brother's home, three people \"tried to grab\" his wife and take her son from her arms. He could not identify the assailants; he said they must have been Socialists because the kidnapping attempt \"was a continuance . . . of their actions\" against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli's wife, Sonila, also testified. As to the attempted kidnapping, she testified that an armed man tried to grab her son and she pushed him away; as she did so, her brother opened fire, frightening the man off. She stated that she did not fall to the ground at any time during the incident. As to the search, Sonila Mehilli said she saw an officer push her husband, and that no one else was pushed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The IJ's Decision and Subsequent Appeals</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second IJ's oral decision of September 5, 2003 rejected Mehilli's application on numerous grounds. The IJ reaffirmed his finding that Mehilli was time-barred from seeking asylum. He noted that Mehilli's application was dated June 23, 2001, and that on the application Mehilli wrote that he had entered the United States on December 5, 2000. However, he also noted that Mehilli admitted testifying falsely under oath to the initial IJ. The IJ found, based on these facts and his observations of Mehilli's demeanor, that Mehilli was not credible. Since Mehilli had relied largely<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> on his own testimony to prove his date of entry, the IJ found that Mehilli had not established an arrival date and thus had not established that his application was filed within one year of arrival.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The IJ also rejected Mehilli's claim that he should be exempted from the deadline due to extraordinary circumstances &#8212; specifically, ineffective assistance of counsel &#8212; because Mehilli had not complied with the regulatory requirements for making such a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the IJ proceeded, in the alternative, to consider Mehilli's asylum claim, and other claims for relief, on their merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The IJ pointed to a number of inconsistencies in Mehilli's story. These included, inter alia, (1) that Mehilli's testimony as to the search was at sharp variance with affidavits in which he said twenty soldiers tore his house apart and pushed him, his wife, and his children; and (2) that his wife's testimony that she never fell during the kidnapping attempt contradicted Mehilli's statement in an affidavit that she was pushed to the ground. Based on the inconsistencies and on Mehilli's initial false testimony, the IJ again found Mehilli not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the IJ found that even assuming Mehilli was credible, Mehilli had not proved persecution. He found that the harms Mehilli described were not serious enough to constitute past persecution, and that even if they were, Mehilli had not established a nexus with a protected ground. As to fear of future persecution, the IJ found that Mehilli had offered no proof; he noted that Mehilli's family continued to live safely in Albania and that his bakery continued to operate without apparent problems. As to withholding of removal and CAT protection, the IJ found that Mehilli's inability to meet the burden for asylum doomed his withholding claim and that Mehilli had failed to adduce any evidence of torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ's findings had been erroneous and that his consideration of Mehilli's false testimony constituted a denial of fundamental fairness. On December 17, 2004, the BIA affirmed using its \"adoption and affirmance\" procedure. It noted that Mehilli's fundamental fairness argument was meritless because the IJ did not err in considering Mehilli's \"admittedly false testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mehilli did not seek judicial review of that decision. Instead, he moved for reconsideration. On February 24, 2005, the BIA denied the motion. Mehilli timely petitioned for review of this denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mehilli makes two primary arguments. First, he says the BIA should have reconsidered his case because the second IJ improperly characterized his false testimony before the initial IJ as perjury; he argues that that characterization \"so impermissibly burdened the evaluation of [his] credibility and the authentication of his documents so as to implicate fundamental fairness principles.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Second, he argues that the IJ relied heavily on State Department reports concerning improving conditions in Albania and that this reliance \"precluded discrete consideration of the Petitioners' particular circumstances of persecution.\" The government, meanwhile, argues that under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3), this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the BIA's refusal to reconsider its decision that Mehilli's asylum claim was time-barred; as to the other relief, the government argues there was no abuse of discretion in denying reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The first, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(3), enacted in 1996,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> provides that \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\" This limitation refers, inter alia, to determinations as to whether the applicant complied with the one-year filing deadline for asylum, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B), and as to whether extraordinary circumstances excuse an alien's belated filing, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second provision was added in 2005.

The first is whether a denial of reconsideration &#8212; as opposed to the initial BIA decision on appeal from the IJ &#8212; is a decision \"under paragraph (2)\" of &#167; 1158(a) such as to strip this court of jurisdiction. Second, if we answer that question in the affirmative, we must examine whether jurisdiction has been restored by &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Section 1158(a)(3) and Motions for Reconsideration</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first question, we hold that Mehilli has not gained a right to judicial review of the BIA's timeliness determination that he would not have had on a petition from an initial rejection by waiting and then attacking a denial of reconsideration of the same issue. Recognition of jurisdiction in these circumstances would circumvent both the purposes of the jurisdictional limitation and the purposes of reconsideration.

However, the IJ explicitly found that the documents were \"not genuine\"; he noted that the documents were not properly authenticated and that someone apparently had attempted to alter one of the documents by writing over the printed date with a pen</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The IJ found Mehilli's explanation for his false testimony &#8212; that he had been told not to reveal the existence of the \"Marko Brezar\" documents &#8212; not credible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing eligibility by proving he or she is a \"refugee\" &#8212; that is, by proving past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution \"on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). \"[I]n order to establish refugee status, an alien must support his claim of persecution through credible testimony.\"<i>Nikijuluw v.

Because withholding of removal places a higher burden of proof on the applicant than does asylum, failure to carry the burden for asylum necessarily dooms a withholding claim. <i>See, e.g., Palma-Mazariegos v.

Mehilli's argument is that while it is true that Albania was not a signatory at the time of his hearings before the IJ, \"in practice\" the U.S. Embassy in Tirana treated Albania as if it were. This argument has no merit: 8 C.F.R. &#167; 287.6 contains no such exception for Albanian documents, and Mehilli presents no evidence that such an exception exists</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> <i>See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996</i> (IIRIRA), Pub.L.

Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786527\"><a href=\"/opinion/786527/dennis-medina-morales-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2004). It is true that <i>Medina-Morales</i> held that a judicial review bar imposed by the INA &#8212; specifically, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) &#8212; did not apply to review of a BIA denial of a motion to reopen. 371 F.3d at 527. Nonetheless, we doubt <i>Medina-Morales</i> is in conflict. There, petitioner initially applied for adjustment of status, then abandoned the claim, and later moved to reopen to reassert it. <i>Id.</i> at 524. The BIA denied his motion to reopen. <i>Id.</i> The Ninth Circuit concluded that it had jurisdiction despite the general statutory bar on review of adjustment-of-status determinations. It reasoned that since petitioner had abandoned his adjustment-of-status claim, the IJ <i>had never ruled on adjustment of status at all. Id.</i> at 527. Therefore, the denial of reopening was not a decision \"under\" the adjustment-of-status provision, but instead a decision \"under\" the provision that had provided grounds for petitioner's removal &#8212; a provision over which the court had jurisdiction. <i>Id. Medina-Morales</i> thus is compatible with the proposition that when an order denying reconsideration engages a previous decision \"under\" a given provision, the order is also a decision \"under\" that underlying provision.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The subsection took effect immediately upon enactment in May 2005 and \"appl[ies] to cases in which the final administrative order of removal . . . was issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment.\" REAL ID Act &#167; 106(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The argument would still fail for this reason even if it had been presented on a direct petition for review.
