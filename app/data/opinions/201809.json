We have substituted him for John Ashcroft,\nprevious holder of that office, as the respondent. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 43(c)92).\n\f           Per Curiam. Harjiadi Hendra Jaya, a citizen of Indonesia\n\nof Chinese ethnicity, seeks judicial review of a decision of an\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\"), adopted by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\"), which dismissed his asylum application as untimely\n\nand denied his application for withholding of removal on the\n\nmerits.   For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition.\n\nA.   Dismissal of Asylum Application\n\n           An alien who has applied for asylum must \"demonstrate[]\n\nby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been\n\nfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the\n\nUnited States.\"1   8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).        Otherwise, the alien\n\nmust \"demonstrate[] to the satisfaction of the Attorney General\n\neither [1] the existence of changed circumstances which materially\n\naffect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or [2] extraordinary\n\ncircumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\" Id.\n\n§ 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n           Here,   it   is   undisputed   that   Jaya   filed   his   asylum\n\napplication more than one year after his arrival in the United\n\nStates.   And the IJ and the BIA both found that Jaya's proffered\n\nreasons for delay did not fall into either of these two exceptions.\n\nThis court is powerless to review that determination, Sharari v.\n\nGonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n      1\n      No such time limit applies to applications for withholding of\nremoval or relief under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f1158(a)(3) and collecting cases).\n\nB.   Denial of Withholding of Removal\n\n            Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an otherwise\n\ndeportable alien may avoid removal by showing that the alien's life\n\nor freedom would, more likely than not, be threatened in the\n\ndestination    country   because   of    the   alien's   race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.2   8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407,\n\n429-30 (1984).    An alien can make this showing in one of two ways.\n\nIf the alien demonstrates past persecution on one of the protected\n\ngrounds, a rebuttable presumption arises that the alien's life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened in the future on that basis, and the\n\nburden shifts to the INS3 to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the alien's life or freedom would not be threatened\n\nin the future, either because of improved country conditions or\n\nbecause the alien could reasonably avoid the threat by relocating\n\nto another part of the country.    8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1); see Silva\n\nv. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).         If the alien cannot\n\n\n      2\n      This is a more stringent standard than that applicable to\nasylum claims. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987).\n      3\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). 6 U.S.C. § 291(a), as amended by the Homeland Security\nAct, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2005.       See United\nStates v. Watson, 386 F.3d 304, 306 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).        Any\nreferences to INS after the effective date of the Homeland Security\nAct should be understood as references to BICE.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fshow past persecution, then the burden remains on the alien to show\n\nthat it is more likely than not that the alien's life or freedom\n\nwould be threatened in the future.             8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); see\n\nSilva, 394 F.3d at 4.\n\n            Where, as here, the BIA adopts the reasoning of the IJ,\n\nwe review the decision of the IJ.            Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365,\n\n373 (1st Cir. 2003).        We review the IJ's factual findings under the\n\ndeferential      substantial     evidence     test,    under     which   the   IJ's\n\ndetermination must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe     compelled     to    conclude    to    the      contrary.\"         8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B); see Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).        In applying the substantial evidence standard, we\n\nreview the IJ’s decision based on the entire record, not merely the\n\nevidence that supports the IJ’s conclusions.                  Gailius v. INS, 147\n\nF.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 1998).          We review the IJ's legal conclusions\n\nde novo, affording some deference to her interpretation of the\n\napplicable statutes.          INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425\n\n(1999).\n\n            Here, the IJ did not clearly decide whether Jaya had been\n\npersecuted in the past on account of a protected ground: his\n\nChinese ethnicity. Although the IJ stated that it \"does not appear\n\nthat    [Jaya]     w[as]   particularly     targeted     on    account   of    race\"\n\n(emphasis added),          she went on to say that \"even if I find that\n\n[he] was targeted because of his ethnicity and/or race . . ., [he]\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fstill has not been able to meet the burden [of showing] . . . that\n\nit is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be\n\nthreatened on account of that ground or grounds.\"                 Similarly,\n\nwithout considering past persecution, the BIA \"agree[d] that [Jaya]\n\nfailed to meet his burden of establishing that it is more likely\n\nthan not that he will be persecuted . . . upon his return to\n\nIndonesia.\"\n\n           To the extent that the IJ and BIA continued to place the\n\nburden on Jaya, without first determining whether or not he had\n\nproven past persecution on account of a protected factor, they\n\nerred.   Cf.   Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 22 (1st\n\nCir.   2004)   (identifying   such    error   in   the   asylum    context).\n\nHowever, any such error was harmless because, even assuming that\n\npast persecution was established and the presumption of future\n\nthreats to Jaya's life or freedom was therefore triggered, any such\n\npresumption was overcome by evidence of changed circumstances. See\n\nYatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           In concluding that Jaya's life and liberty would not\n\nlikely be threatened if he returned to Indonesia, the IJ found that\n\nJaya continued to live in Indonesia with his parents for two more\n\nyears after the May 1998 riots, on which his claim of past\n\npersecution is primarily based, and that his parents have continued\n\nto live there without incident.            Those facts are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.           The 2002 State Department\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fReport of Human Rights Practices contained in the administrative\n\nrecord further supports the IJ's conclusion of no future threat to\n\nJaya's life or liberty on account of his Chinese ethnicity.          That\n\nreport makes no mention of recent violence against ethnic Chinese,\n\nmuch less establishes a pattern or practice of such persecution, as\n\nJaya argues.      Although the report describes discrimination against\n\npeople of Chinese descent, discrimination, standing alone, does not\n\nconstitute persecution. Sharari, 407 F.3d at 475. Thus, even with\n\nthe presumption of future persecution, the evidence in the record\n\nplainly demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nconditions in Indonesia have so changed since 1998 that Jaya's life\n\nor liberty would not likely be threatened on account of his Chinese\n\nethnicity    if    he   were   forced     to   return.4   See   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(b)(1).\n\n            Accordingly, we deny the petition. However, in so doing,\n\nwe remind the IJ and BIA of their responsibility to make precise\n\njustifications for their decisions under the applicable legal\n\nstandards.     See Yatskin, 225 F.3d at 10.\n\n            The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Jaya has asked us to take judicial notice that the 1998 riots\ntargeted the ethnic Chinese. However, that purported fact concerns\nonly past persecution, which we are assuming here. Therefore, we\nneed not decide whether that is a fact or whether the purported\nfact is judicially noticeable.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f-7-\n\f",

The 2002 State Department\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fReport of Human Rights Practices contained in the administrative\n\nrecord further supports the IJ's conclusion of no future threat to\n\nJaya's life or liberty on account of his Chinese ethnicity.          That\n\nreport makes no mention of recent violence against ethnic Chinese,\n\nmuch less establishes a pattern or practice of such persecution, as\n\nJaya argues.      Although the report describes discrimination against\n\npeople of Chinese descent, discrimination, standing alone, does not\n\nconstitute persecution. Sharari, 407 F.3d at 475. Thus, even with\n\nthe presumption of future persecution, the evidence in the record\n\nplainly demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\n\nconditions in Indonesia have so changed since 1998 that Jaya's life\n\nor liberty would not likely be threatened on account of his Chinese\n\nethnicity    if    he   were   forced     to   return.4   See   8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(b)(1).\n\n            Accordingly, we deny the petition. However, in so doing,\n\nwe remind the IJ and BIA of their responsibility to make precise\n\njustifications for their decisions under the applicable legal\n\nstandards.     See Yatskin, 225 F.3d at 10.\n\n            The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Jaya has asked us to take judicial notice that the 1998 riots\ntargeted the ethnic Chinese. However, that purported fact concerns\nonly past persecution, which we are assuming here. Therefore, we\nneed not decide whether that is a fact or whether the purported\nfact is judicially noticeable.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f-7-\n\f</pre>",
