William G. Young, U.S. District Court]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     James W. Rosseel for appellant.\n     David M. Lieber, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Thomas\nF. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        November 5, 2004\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.   Richard Allison was convicted in\n\nstate court of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme\n\natrocity or cruelty.    He was also convicted of armed robbery and\n\nperjury.    The murder victim, Thomas Moran, was a friend, whom\n\nAllison and two others shot in the face, stabbed seventy-nine\n\ntimes, and left lying in a school baseball field. Massachusetts v.\n\nAllison, 751 N.E.2d 868, 877-78 (Mass. 2001).   The motive seems to\n\nhave been their intoxicated irritation with stupid comments the\n\nvictim had made, critical of them.      The evidence at trial was\n\nstrong, a state jury convicted all three defendants, and Allison\n\nwas sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment.\n\n           Allison moved for state post-conviction relief, arguing\n\nhis trial lawyer, Thomas Amoroso, had not provided effective\n\nassistance of counsel because he had conflicting interests and that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to establish a joint venture in the\n\nmurder.    Both these claims are now raised before us.\n\n            We turn first to the ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim.     The supposed conflict came from two factors.      First,\n\nAmoroso had a separate practice but shared office space with the\n\nlawyers for Allison's two co-defendants, Sullivan and Hardy, men\n\nwhose interests were at cross purposes with Allison's, as each\n\npointed the finger at the others.     Second, Amoroso's $30,000 fee\n\nwas to be paid from the proceeds of an assignment of a personal\n\ninjury claim of the sister of co-defendant Hardy.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f              The same state judge who presided over the trial heard\n\nthe   claim    that   Amoroso   did    not,    because   of   these   purported\n\nconflicts, provide effective assistance of counsel.                   The judge\n\nheard   witnesses     over   several    days    of   hearings   and   issued   a\n\nthoughtful and thorough opinion. The court first heard evidence on\n\nwhether there was an actual conflict of interest; if that were\n\nproven, it said it would grant a new trial without a showing of\n\nprejudice in adherence to a Massachusetts state law rule. If there\n\nwas no actual conflict but only a potential conflict, then the\n\ncourt would hear, as it did, the issue of whether there was\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n              The trial judge concluded that as a matter of fact and\n\nlaw there was no actual conflict and that the defendant had failed\n\nto show adverse effects from any potential conflict.                  As to the\n\npotential conflict, the judge specifically found:\n\n              Even assuming a potential conflict of interest, Allison\n              has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that such\n              a conflict materially prejudiced his defense. There is\n              nothing in the record to suggest that Amoroso had divided\n              loyalties either as a result of the office sharing\n              arrangement or as a result of the fee agreement. Nor is\n              there evidence that he was influenced to either act or\n              refrain from acting in any way because of his association\n              with either [of the lawyers for the co-defendants]. To\n              the   extent   that  Allison   complains   of   strategic\n              deficiencies at trial by counsel, he has not demonstrated\n              that they were motivated by a desire to benefit co-\n              defendants Hardy and Sullivan. Accordingly, this Court\n              concludes that Allison was not denied effective\n              assistance of trial counsel due to a potential conflict\n              of interest which prejudiced his defense, and is not\n              entitled to a new trial on that basis.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (S.J.C.) affirmed this\n\ndetermination.       Allison, 751 N.E.2d at 893-94.\n\n            Allison then turned to federal court, filing a habeas\n\ncorpus    petition    under   28    U.S.C.   ยง    2254,    alleging    the   state\n\nconviction violated his federal constitutional rights under the\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel.1               The federal district court\n\nrejected the habeas petition as unfounded.                Allison v. Ficco, 284\n\nF.Supp.2d 182, 191 (D. Mass. 2003).              So do we.\n\n            Because the state courts squarely addressed the federal\n\nconstitutional issue we engage in deferential, and not de novo,\n\nreview.    Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).               When\n\na claim is adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,\n\nthe petitioner must show that the decision of the state courts was\n\neither \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof the United States; or . . . that [the decision] was based on an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented    in   the   State      court   proceeding[s].\"        28   U.S.C.   ยง\n\n2254(d)(1),(2).      Allison can do neither.\n\n            The habeas petition is based on a misapprehension of what\n\nthe Supreme Court has decided in the area of putative conflicts of\n\n\n\n     1\n      Allison raised two other grounds in his habeas petition\nbefore the district court. One is not before us, and the other,\nthe sufficiency of the evidence for joint venture murder, is\ndiscussed below.\n\n                                       -4-\n\finterest of criminal defense counsel. Allison works backwards from\n\nthe language in Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348 (1980), and\n\nMickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 171 (2002), and argues that if\n\nthere is any effect at all on counsel's performance, then there is\n\nan actual conflict of interest and he need not show prejudice in\n\nthe sense of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).\n\nThere are two problems:       this is not an accurate statement of law,\n\nand even if it were, the state court found there was no such\n\nadverse effect.\n\n            The general rule for showing ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel under Strickland requires a showing of prejudice to make\n\nout a claim of ineffective assistance. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n\n694 (requiring a defendant alleging ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel to show a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent\").\n\n            In    Mickens,   the    Supreme   Court   addressed      under   what\n\ncircumstances a trial judge's failure at the time of trial to\n\ninquire    into   defense    counsel's   conflict     of     interest     requires\n\nreversal without the usual showing that the conflict prejudiced the\n\ndefense.     Mickens, 535 U.S. at 166-67.                  The Mickens inquiry\n\nconcerned exceptions to the general rule of showing prejudice. One\n\nexception is the situation found in Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S.\n\n475   (1978),     where   counsel   objects   but     is    forced   to   jointly\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\frepresent     two       defendants    with   conflicting       interests      at   trial\n\nwithout any inquiry from the district court.                   The Court held that\n\nthe defendant need not show that his counsel actively represented\n\nthose conflicting interests, nor that the conflict detrimentally\n\naffected    his     counsel's    representation         of   him    or     resulted   in\n\nprejudice.     Id. at 490-91.\n\n            In Sullivan, however, where defendant had not objected to\n\nthe   joint    representation          of    co-defendants         with     conflicting\n\ninterests, the Court forged a standard that falls midway between\n\nStrickland and Holloway. Once the defendant proves that \"an actual\n\nconflict      of    interest         adversely       affected\"      his      attorney's\n\nrepresentation of him, prejudice will be presumed.                        Sullivan, 446\n\nU.S. at 348.        Allison has failed to make the required threshold\n\nshowing.      Indeed, Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776 (1987), made it\n\nclear that an actual conflict of interest will not be inferred\n\nmerely from law partners' representation of co-defendants with\n\nantagonistic defenses, even where the partners discussed each\n\nother's cases, shared common research, or otherwise collaborated to\n\nan extent short of sharing their clients' confidences.                       Here, the\n\nS.J.C. reasonably found, as a matter of fact, that the Amoroso\n\noffice-sharing          arrangement    was    even    less   conducive       to    actual\n\nconflict than the Burger law firm.                    Hence it follows that the\n\nS.J.C.'s decision is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable\n\napplication        of     established       Supreme    Court       precedent.\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f            We go a bit further.     We see no prejudice or adverse\n\neffects that Allison has suffered from the potential conflict.     He\n\nseems to suggest the evidence could be read to conclude that the\n\nlawyer's supposed conflict led to bad advice to Allison not to\n\ntestify, and/or the conflicts somehow affected counsel's advice to\n\nAllison on whether to plead guilty.        There is not a shred of\n\nevidence to support either contention and the record reads to the\n\ncontrary.    Allison had very good reason not to take the stand.   He\n\nhad been indicted for perjury before the grand jury.     As a result,\n\nif he had testified, whatever he said might well have landed him in\n\ntrouble.    Allison also posits some prejudice from the fact that he\n\nwas visited by an investigator for a co-defendant and asked whether\n\nhe was cooperating with the government.     Allison then informed his\n\nlawyer of the conversation and asked him to tell defense counsel\n\nthat he was not cooperating.        We see no prejudice, and this\n\nevidence undercuts the notion that his lawyer's purported conflict\n\ncaused him not to cooperate.\n\n            In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the petitioner is\n\n\"in custody pursuant to the judgement of a [s]tate court, a\n\ndetermination of a factual issue made by a [s]tate court shall be\n\npresumed to be correct.\"    28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(e)(1).    The defendant\n\n\"must clear a high hurdle before a federal court will set aside any\n\nof the state court's factual findings.\"     Mastracchio v. Vose, 274\n\nF.3d 590, 598 (1st Cir. 2001).     Allison does not seriously attempt\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fan argument that the state court's factual findings concerning the\n\nalleged adverse effects are wrong.        There being neither an actual\n\nconflict nor any adverse effects from a potential conflict, the\n\ndecision of the S.J.C. to deny relief to petitioner is hardly\n\nunreasonable.\n\n             Petitioner's second claim, based on the insufficiency of\n\nevidence to establish a joint venture, also fails.        Allison argues\n\nthat   the   S.J.C.'s   finding   of   sufficient   evidence   to   convict\n\npetitioner of murder in the course of a joint venture was an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law which\n\nrequires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of a\n\ncrime.     See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 313-14 (1979).        He\n\ncontends that evidence presented at trial conclusively established\n\nthat it was impossible for Hardy, Sullivan, and him to make a prior\n\nagreement to murder the victim and it was unreasonable for the\n\nS.J.C. to ignore this evidence in determining that a rational juror\n\ncould find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a joint\n\nventure.\n\n             The S.J.C. noted that a joint venture may be found if\n\nthere is evidence from which a rational juror could have concluded\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\n\n             (1) present at the scene of the   crime, (2) with knowledge\n             that another intends to commit    the crime or with intent\n             to commit a crime, and (3) by     agreement is willing and\n             available to help the other if    necessary.\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fMassachusetts v. Allison, 751 N.E.2d 868, 878-79 (Mass. 2001)\n\n(quoting     Commonwealth    v.     Bianco,        446   N.E.2d         1041    (Mass.\n\n1983)(internal quotations omitted)).              Viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most     favorable    to   the    Commonwealth        and    relying      on   the\n\ntestimony of one witness, the S.J.C. found that \"[a] rational juror\n\ncould have concluded that the defendant\" and two of his co-\n\ndefendants \"discussed a plan to kill Moran.\"                 Id. at 879.\n\n            The   S.J.C.    further       noted,      \"[i]n       any    event,      an\n\nanticipatory compact is not necessary for joint venture liability,\n\nas long as 'at the climactic moments the parties consciously acted\n\ntogether in carrying out the criminal endeavor.'\"                       Id. (quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Fidler, 503 N.E.2d 1302, 1307 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1987)). The S.J.C. held that the eyewitness testimony that Allison\n\nand   his   co-defendants    were      \"crouched     over    the    victim      making\n\nstabbing    gestures   is   sufficient       to    establish      the    defendant's\n\nliability for the murder both individually and as joint venturer.\"\n\nId. at 879.\n\n            Allison does not argue that the S.J.C. made an error of\n\nlaw when it stated the elements of a joint venture and determined\n\nthat an     anticipatory    compact     is   not    necessary      to    find    joint\n\nventure.    The S.J.C.'s determination, based upon the eyewitness's\n\ntestimony that Allison along with the others crouched over the\n\nvictim and made stabbing motions, is more than reasonable and\n\nsufficient to establish a joint venture on its own.\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fThe denial of the petition for habeas corpus is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                     -10-\n\f",

He was also convicted of armed robbery and perjury. The murder victim, Thomas Moran, was a friend, whom Allison and two others shot in the face, stabbed seventy-nine times, and left lying in a school baseball field. <i>Massachusetts v. Allison,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></span>, 877-78 (2001). The motive seems to have been their intoxicated irritation with stupid comments the victim had made, critical of them. The evidence at trial was strong, a state jury convicted all three defendants, and Allison was sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allison moved for state post-conviction relief, arguing his trial lawyer, Thomas Amoroso, had not provided effective assistance of counsel because he had conflicting interests and that the evidence was insufficient to establish a joint venture in the murder. Both these claims are now raised before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The supposed conflict came from two factors. First, Amoroso had a separate practice but shared office space with the lawyers for Allison's two co-defendants, Sullivan and Hardy, men whose interests were at cross purposes with Allison's, as each pointed the finger at the others. Second, Amoroso's $30,000 fee was to be paid from the proceeds of an assignment of a personal injury claim of the sister of co-defendant Hardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same state judge who presided over the trial heard the claim that Amoroso did not, because of these purported conflicts, provide effective assistance of counsel. The judge heard witnesses over several days of hearings and issued a thoughtful and thorough opinion. The court first heard evidence on whether there was an actual conflict of interest; if that were proven, it said it would grant a new trial without a showing of prejudice in adherence to a Massachusetts state law rule. If there was no actual conflict but only a potential conflict, then the court would hear, as it did, the issue of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge concluded that as a matter of fact and law there was no actual conflict and that the defendant had failed to show adverse effects from any potential conflict. As to the potential conflict, the judge specifically found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming a potential conflict of interest, Allison has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that such a conflict materially prejudiced his defense. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Amoroso had divided loyalties either as a result of the office sharing arrangement or as a result of the fee agreement. Nor is there evidence that he was influenced to either act or refrain from acting in any way because of his association with either [of the lawyers for the co-defendants]. To the extent that Allison complains of strategic deficiencies at trial by counsel, he has not demonstrated that they were motivated by a desire to benefit co-defendants Hardy and Sullivan. Accordingly, this Court concludes that Allison was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel due to a potential conflict of interest which prejudiced his defense, and is not entitled to a new trial on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (S.J.C.) affirmed this determination. <i>Allison,</i> 751 N.E.2d at 893-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allison then turned to federal court, filing a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, alleging the state conviction violated his federal constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The federal district court rejected the habeas petition as unfounded. <i>Allison v.

The defendant \"must clear a high hurdle before a federal court will set aside any of the state court's factual findings.\" <i>Mastracchio v.

Allison does not seriously attempt an argument that the state court's factual findings concerning the alleged adverse effects are wrong. There being neither an actual conflict nor any adverse effects from a potential conflict, the decision of the S.J.C. to deny relief to petitioner is hardly unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's second claim, based on the insufficiency of evidence to establish a joint venture, also fails. Allison argues that the S.J.C.'s finding of sufficient evidence to convict petitioner of murder in the course of a joint venture was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of a crime. <i>See Jackson v.

He contends that evidence presented at trial conclusively established that it was impossible for Hardy, Sullivan, and him to make a prior agreement to murder the victim and it was unreasonable for the S.J.C. to ignore this evidence in determining that a rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a joint venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The S.J.C. noted that a joint venture may be found if there is evidence from which a rational juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Massachusetts v.
