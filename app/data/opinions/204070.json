Two issues are presented in the\n\naftermath of a prior appeal in a civil rights case that has become\n\nmoot   due   to    legislative     action.      The   first   is   whether   the\n\nunderlying injunctive order the plaintiffs obtained in the district\n\ncourt should be vacated on remand, given the reason for mootness of\n\nthe appeal.       The second is whether plaintiffs would, under these\n\ncircumstances, remain entitled to the award of attorney's fees in\n\nthe now moot case and, if so, whether the fees the district court\n\nawarded were reasonable.          We vacate the judgment and remand to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to dismiss the action, and we\n\naffirm the district court's award of attorney's fees.\n\n             Plaintiffs, a class of Puerto Rican residents who only\n\nspeak English, sued members of the State Electoral Commission of\n\nPuerto Rico (Commission) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the\n\nCommission's      decision   to    print    ballots   in   the   November    2008\n\nelections solely in Spanish.         The federal district court of Puerto\n\nRico found for the plaintiffs on the merits and granted them a\n\npermanent injunction in August 2008, which compelled the Commission\n\nto print bilingual ballots in the November 2008 election.                    The\n\ndistrict court later awarded plaintiffs attorney's fees under 42\n\nU.S.C § 1988 in the sum of $67,550.34, less than the amount\n\nrequested of $122,988.75.           Defendant Ramon Gomez-Colon, who was\n\nPresident of the Commission at the time, appealed from both the\n\nunderlying judgment and the award of attorney's fees.               Plaintiffs\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhave cross-appealed from the diminution of their requested award,\n\nand the appeals were consolidated.\n\n            While these cases were pending on appeal, Puerto Rico\n\npassed legislation requiring the use of bilingual ballots in all\n\nfuture elections, and the governor signed the legislation, which is\n\nin effect.     Both parties agree this has mooted the underlying\n\njudgment.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            Plaintiffs and appellees, Sylvia Diffenderfer and Robert\n\nMcCarroll, are longtime Puerto Rico residents and registered voters\n\nwho speak and read only English.       On August 19, 2008, plaintiffs\n\nfiled a putative class action suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the\n\nfederal district court of Puerto Rico.     They sued the President of\n\nthe Commission and the four Commissioners in their individual and\n\nofficial capacities, arguing that the Commission's administrative\n\ndecision to issue ballots for the November 2008 Puerto Rican\n\nelections only in Spanish discriminated against and effectively\n\ndisenfranchised voters who only speak English.\n\n            On August 27, 2008, the district court granted plaintiffs\n\na permanent injunction directing the Commission to immediately\n\nbegin printing bilingual ballots for use in the November 2008\n\nelections.    In a written opinion issued September 2, 2008, the\n\ndistrict court held that this relief was warranted on the grounds\n\nthat the Commission's balloting policy violated the Voting Rights\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAct, the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.    See Diffenderfer v. Gomez-Colon, 587 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 338 (D.P.R. 2008).    On September 5, 2008, Ramon Gomez-\n\nColon, the President of the Commission, filed a notice of appeal.1\n\nIn the meantime, the Commission complied with the injunction and\n\nused bilingual ballots in the November 2008 elections.\n\n          In April 2009, the district court awarded Diffenderfer\n\nand McCarroll attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 because they\n\nhad prevailed before the district court on the merits of the § 1983\n\naction. Based on the \"lodestar\" method, the district court awarded\n\na total of $67,550.34 in attorney's fees and litigation costs. The\n\nplaintiffs had requested $122,988.75.   This amount was reduced by\n\nthe court to account for duplicative and excessive hours and to\n\nadjust for plaintiffs' practice of billing by the quarter-hour,\n\nwhich the district court found had produced an inflated number of\n\nbillable hours.   This fee was awarded only against Gomez-Colon in\n\nhis official capacity as the President of the Commission.      See\n\nDiffenderfer v. Gomez-Colon, 606 F. Supp. 2d 222, 225-30 (D.P.R.\n\n2009) (initial order and judgment); 2009 WL 1140219 at *2 (D.P.R.\n\n2009) (revised order and judgment).2    Gomez-Colon appealed this\n\n\n     1\n          Walter Velez-Rodriguez, who was Secretary of the\nCommission at the time, was originally a co-appellant. His appeal\nwas voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 42(b) on\nFebruary 5, 2009.\n     2\n          The district court made an initial award of attorney's\nfees on April 1, 2009 and issued an amended order and judgment on\n\n                                -4-\n\faward on April 30, 2009, and Diffenderfer and McCarroll cross-\n\nappealed on May 7, 2009.\n\n           While these appeals were pending before this court,\n\nPuerto Rico enacted Law No. 90, which mandates that bilingual\n\nballots will be used in all future Puerto Rican elections.               Both\n\nparties agree that Law No. 90 mooted the appeal of the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the merits.\n\n           The    parties   disagree,   however,    as   to   the   proper\n\ndisposition of that appeal and the effect this would have upon the\n\nappeal of the attorney's fees award.         Diffenderfer and McCarroll\n\nargue that we should leave the district court's judgment on the\n\nmerits   intact   because   Gomez-Colon's    voluntary   actions    in    not\n\nseeking a stay pending appeal had rendered the case moot even\n\nbefore Puerto Rico passed Law No. 90.       They further argue that they\n\nare still entitled to attorney's fees for costs incurred in the\n\ndistrict court litigation, even if we were to vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment, because, inter alia, they obtained a favorable,\n\nmaterial alteration in the legal relationship between the parties\n\n\n\nApril 24, 2009. The first order awarded $65,992.00 in attorney's\nfees against three of the four Commissioners, in addition to Gomez-\nColon.   After this initial judgment issued on April 1, 2009,\nDiffenderfer and McCarroll asked for reconsideration of the\ncalculations and for inclusion of litigation costs. In a revised\norder on April 24, 2009, the district court accepted plaintiffs'\narguments in part and revised the attorney's fee figure upwards to\n$67,550.34. It also imposed attorney's fees only upon Gomez-Colon\nin his official capacity, since, as President of the Commission, he\nwas the only one able to represent the Commission as a whole.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbefore the case became moot. Finally, they argue that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in reducing plaintiffs' award of\n\nattorney's fees because of plaintiffs' practice of billing in\n\nquarter-hour increments and request that the award of attorney's\n\nfees be adjusted upwards to $82,490.            Their claim for attorney's\n\nfees is limited to their work before the district court.\n\n           Gomez-Colon instead urges us to vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the grounds that vacatur is the general rule\n\nwhen a case becomes moot on appeal through happenstance, for\n\ninstance due to intervening legislation like Law No. 90.                Gomez-\n\nColon further argues that vacation of the underlying judgment would\n\nnecessarily require reversal of the district court's disposition of\n\nattorney's fees.        Plaintiffs, he asserts, cannot be considered\n\n\"prevailing parties\" in the district court if the district court's\n\njudgment is vacated, and the district court's award of attorney's\n\nfees   should    therefore    be    reversed.    He    does   not   argue    that\n\nplaintiffs      were   not   otherwise   prevailing     parties     before   the\n\ndistrict court or that the fees awarded were not reasonable.\n\n           Gomez-Colon       also    filed   motions    to    substitute     his\n\nsuccessor as the President of the Commission as the appellant and\n\nto consolidate the appeals of the district court's judgment on the\n\nmerits and its award of attorney's fees.          We granted the motion to\n\nconsolidate but reserved judgment on the question of substitution\n\nof parties.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f                                   II.\n\n           The first issue is the appropriate disposition of the\n\nappeal   of   the   district   court's   judgment   on   the   merits   of\n\nplaintiffs' § 1983 action.      Both parties contend, and we agree,\n\nthat Law No. 90 mooted that appeal.          Under that statute, the\n\nCommission must use bilingual ballots now that Puerto Rico has made\n\nbilingual ballots mandatory.      Because we can no longer issue any\n\njudicial remedy capable of affecting the parties' rights, the case\n\nno longer presents a live \"case or controversy\" under Article III,\n\nand we lack jurisdiction to decide its merits. See City of Erie v.\n\nPap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 287 (2000); Horizon Bank & Trust Co. v.\n\nMassachusetts, 391 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2004).          We hold that the\n\ndistrict court's judgment should be vacated because it was rendered\n\nmoot by an independent, intervening act of legislation.\n\n           As a general rule, federal courts of appeals vacate the\n\njudgment below when a civil case becomes moot during the pendency\n\nof an appeal.   Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S.\n\n43, 71 (1997); see also Rusco Steel Co. v. Atkinson-Kiewit, J/V, 98\n\nF.3d 1333 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam).         Vacatur, an equitable\n\nremedy, is ordinarily granted unless the losing party appealing the\n\njudgment was responsible for making the case unreviewable, for\n\ninstance by failing to appeal or by entering into a settlement.\n\nSee U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 24-\n\n25 (1994); Shelby v. Superformance Int'l, Inc., 435 F.3d 42, 46\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f(1st Cir. 2008).         In such cases, vacatur is inappropriate because\n\nit was within that party's power to keep the controversy live and\n\nthe judgment is therefore unreviewable only by choice.                    Bancorp,\n\n513 U.S. at 25.      When the losing party's voluntary action causes\n\nthe case to become moot, a presumption against vacatur applies, and\n\nvacatur   is     appropriate     only   when   it   would    serve   the    public\n\ninterest.      Id. at 25-28.\n\n            In contrast, \"[v]acatur is in order when mootness occurs\n\nthrough     happenstance--circumstances          not   attributable        to    the\n\nparties.\"        Arizonans    for   Official     English,    520   U.S.    at    71.\n\nVacatur, unlike a reversal of the district court's judgment on the\n\nmerits, does not reflect upon the underlying merits of the parties'\n\nclaims, which the court no longer has jurisdiction to determine.\n\nIt is instead a remedy designed to prevent unfairness to the losing\n\nparty, who would otherwise have to continue complying with an\n\nadverse judgment. Bancorp at 25; see also Kerkhof v. MCI WorldCom,\n\nInc., 282 F.3d 44, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that \"vacatur\n\nis generally appropriate\" when mootness results from intervening\n\nevents outside the losing party's control).\n\n            We    hold    that   this   action   by    the   legislature        is   a\n\ncircumstance not attributable to the Commission as an individual\n\nadministrative entity.           All circuits to address this issue have\n\nheld that such legislation is generally considered an intervening,\n\nindependent event and not voluntary action, particularly when the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fgovernmental entity taking the appeal, as here, is not part of the\n\nlegislative branch.          See, e.g., Khodara Envtl., Inc. v. Beckman,\n\n237 F.3d 186, 194-95 (3rd Cir. 2001); Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.\n\nPaige, 211 F.3d 112, 121 (4th Cir. 2000); Nat'l Black Police Ass'n\n\nv. Dist. Ct. of Columbia, 108 F.3d 346, 351-53 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n               Diffenderfer and McCarroll essentially ask us to ignore\n\nthe fact that an intervening event mooted the case and deprived\n\nthis court of jurisdiction over the merits of the appeal.                  They\n\nargue that we should instead wade into a separate, hotly contested\n\npossible issue in the underlying case which has been rendered moot-\n\n-the issue of whether the case would have been moot anyway.\n\nSpecifically, they claim that the case was rendered moot by the\n\npassage of the November 2008 Puerto Rican elections and that Gomez-\n\nColon's failure to seek a stay of the district court's injunction\n\nin September 2008 was a voluntary decision not to preserve the case\n\nfor appeal.        We can find no basis for doing so.        See, e.g., Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Nathan R., 199 F.3d 377, 381 (7th Cir. 2000) (declining to\n\naddress       possibility     of    earlier     mootness     when   subsequent,\n\nintervening event made it impossible to grant any judicial remedy\n\nthat       would   affect   the   parties'    rights   and   vacating   judgment\n\nbelow).3\n\n\n       3\n          This is not a case where the initial mootness arguably\noccurred during proceedings before the district court and the later\nmootness occurred while the case was on appeal, thereby raising\nquestions regarding the legal effect of ancillary judgments. Cf.\nIn re Scruggs, 392 F.3d 124, 128-30 (5th Cir. 2004) (evaluating\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           We accordingly vacate the district court's judgment and\n\nremand it with instructions to dismiss the action.\n\n                                      III.\n\n           We turn to Gomez-Colon's appeal and plaintiffs' cross-\n\nappeal of the district court's award of attorney's fees.\n\nA.         Gomez-Colon's Appeal From the Attorney's Fees Award\n\n           We review a district court's award of attorney's fees\n\nunder § 1988 for an abuse of discretion, in deference to the\n\ndistrict court's superior ability to calibrate such awards to the\n\nnuances of the case.         See Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto\n\nRico, 247 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           It    is   true   that     a    party's   interest      in   recouping\n\nattorney's fees does not create a stake in the outcome sufficient\n\nto resuscitate an otherwise moot controversy. Lewis v. Cont'l Bank\n\nCorp., 494 U.S. 472, 480 (1990). However, even when federal courts\n\nlack   jurisdiction    to    decide       the   merits   of   an   appeal,   \"the\n\nexpiration of the underlying cause of action does not moot a\n\ncontroversy over attorney's fees already incurred.\"                In re Savage\n\nIndus., Inc., 43 F.3d 714, 719 n.6 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting\n\nAnderson v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 3 F.3d 1383,\n\n1385 (10th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also\n\n\n\nwhether case     was already moot prior to decisive intervening event\nof mootness     when date of mootness determined whether Bankruptcy\nCourt order      remained in place or whether district court had\njurisdiction     to reverse that order).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fUnited States v. Ford, 650 F.2d 1141, 1143-44 (9th Cir. 1981)\n\n(\"[T]he question of attorney's fees is ancillary to the underlying\n\naction and survives independently under the Court's equitable\n\njurisdiction.\").\n\n          Under § 1988, when a plaintiff successfully pursues a\n\ncivil rights action under § 1983, \"the court, in its discretion,\n\nmay allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as\n\npart of the costs.\"   42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).   Generally speaking, a\n\n\"prevailing party\" is \"one who has been awarded some relief by the\n\ncourt,\" meaning a \"judicially sanctioned change in the legal\n\nrelationship of the parties.\"   Buckhannon Bd. and Care Home, Inc.\n\nv. W. Va. Dep't of Health and Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603, 605\n\n(2001); see also Aronov v. Napolitano, 562 F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (en banc).   A plaintiff who receives a favorable judgment on\n\nthe merits of a claim is the classic example of a \"prevailing\n\nparty.\"   See, e.g., Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1992);\n\nDe Jesus Nazario v. Morris Rodriguez, 554 F.3d 196, 199-200 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).\n\n          Gomez-Colon's lone argument on appeal is that vacatur of\n\nthis judgment means that plaintiffs are no longer \"prevailing\n\nparties\" at any stage of the litigation.4    Vacatur of a moot case\n\n\n     4\n          Gomez-Colon also asserts that under Local Rule 54(a),\nplaintiffs prematurely filed their claim for attorney's fees before\nthe district court. He suggests that plaintiffs should have waited\nto apply for fees until after the disposition of this appeal. But\nGomez-Colon never made this argument before the district court when\n\n                                -11-\n\fmeans that the initial, favorable judgment plaintiffs obtained from\n\nthe district court is no longer binding law.         This, Gomez-Colon\n\nclaims, makes it identical in effect to a reversal of the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the merits.      When a federal court of appeals\n\nreverses a district court's judgment on the merits in a civil\n\nrights case, it is well established that plaintiffs are no longer\n\n\"prevailing parties\" entitled to attorney's fees for litigation\n\nbefore the district court.       See, e.g., Globe Newspaper Co. v.\n\nBeacon Hill Architectural Comm'n, 100 F.3d 175, 195 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); see also Greenville Women's Clinic v. Bryant, 222 F.3d 157,\n\n175 (4th Cir. 2000); Clark v. Twp. of Falls, 890 F.2d 625, 626-27\n\n(3d Cir. 1989). Gomez-Colon argues that the same rule should apply\n\nto judgments vacated as moot.\n\n           We   reject   this   argument,   which   misunderstands   the\n\ndifference between reversal on the merits and vacatur of a moot\n\ncase.   Reversal on the merits deprives a plaintiff of \"prevailing\n\nparty\" status because it repudiates the favorable change in the\n\nparties' legal relationship effectuated by the district court's\n\njudgment and holds that the plaintiff was never legally entitled to\n\nsuch relief.    In contrast, in the mootness context, a \"prevailing\n\nparty\" is a party who managed to obtain a favorable, material\n\nalteration in the legal relationship between the parties prior to\n\n\nit assessed attorney's fees, even though Gomez-Colon had, at that\ntime, already filed a notice of appeal of the underlying judgment.\nWe therefore consider this argument waived.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fthe intervening act of mootness.    See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605;\n\nsee also Grano v. Barry, 783 F.2d 1104, 1108 (D.C. Cir. 1986).\n\nCourts of appeals apply this test by looking only to what relief\n\nthe district court granted and not to whether the case was rightly\n\ndecided.    See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Marina Point Dev.\n\nCo., 566 F.3d 794, 805-06 (9th Cir. 2009) (collecting cases).\n\n            Thus, a plaintiff cannot be a \"prevailing party\" when his\n\nlawsuit prompted a favorable legislative outcome but had produced\n\nno judicial decision at the time the legislation mooted the case.\n\nSee Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605.        Similarly, a party is not a\n\n\"prevailing party\" at the appeals stage, entitled to attorney's\n\nfees for the cost of appellate litigation, if the case becomes moot\n\npending appeal.   See Lewis, 494 U.S. at 483.   But the Supreme Court\n\nhas explicitly left open the question presented in this case,\n\nobserving that \"[w]hether [a plaintiff] can be deemed a 'prevailing\n\nparty' in the District Court, even though its judgment was mooted\n\nafter being rendered but before the losing party could challenge\n\nits validity on appeal, is a question of some difficulty.\"     Id.\n\n            We agree the question is difficult, but we must decide\n\nit.   Numerous circuits have held both before and after Lewis that\n\nan award of fees is within the discretion of the district court.\n\nWe agree.     When plaintiffs clearly succeeded in obtaining the\n\nrelief sought before the district court and an intervening event\n\nrendered the case moot on appeal, plaintiffs are still \"prevailing\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fparties\" for the purposes of attorney's fees for the district court\n\nlitigation.    See, e.g., UFO Chuting of Haw., Inc. v. Smith, 508\n\nF.3d 1189, 1197 & n.8 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that when a party\n\nsuccessfully obtains an injunction before a district court prior to\n\nan intervening act of mootness, that party remains the \"prevailing\n\nparty,\" and that this conclusion is consistent with Lewis); Dahlem\n\nv. Bd. of Educ., 901 F.2d 1508, 1512-13 (10th Cir. 1990) (listing\n\ncases and holding that \"[w]e are in accord with the courts which\n\nhave held that a party which achieves the objective of its suit by\n\nmeans of an injunction issued by the district court is a prevailing\n\nparty in that court, notwithstanding the fact that the case becomes\n\nmoot . . . while the order is on appeal\") (footnote omitted);\n\nPalmer v. City of Chicago, 806 F.2d 1316, 1321 (7th Cir. 1986)\n\n(assuming   though      not   holding    that   plaintiffs   are   \"prevailing\n\nparties\" \"if after some relief has been obtained the case becomes\n\nmoot,\" unless the plaintiffs caused the mootness); Grano, 783 F.2d\n\nat 1109 (\"The mootness of the subsequent appeal of that holding\n\nfollowing the actual election and the passage of the initiative,\n\nemphasizes, rather than detracts from, the practical substance of\n\ntheir victory.\").\n\n            We hold that Diffenderfer and McCarroll were \"prevailing\n\nparties\" entitled to attorney's fees for the costs of the district\n\ncourt litigation notwithstanding the subsequent mootness. They not\n\nonly   obtained   the    injunctive      relief   they   sought.    They   also\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fobtained the desired practical outcome of their suit through the\n\noperation of that injunction: the Commission in fact distributed\n\nbilingual ballots in the November 2008 elections.5      Plaintiffs were\n\n\"prevailing parties\" in this litigation at the district court\n\nbefore Law No. 90 made the appeal moot.\n\n           We recognize that the defendant did not have the chance\n\nto seek to reverse the court's injunction on appeal on the ground\n\nthat it was based on an error of law.            In the end, this is a\n\nquestion   of   what   Congress   would   have     intended   under   the\n\ncircumstances. Congress's overarching purposes in enacting § 1988,\n\nthe Supreme Court has held, were \"to ensure 'effective access to\n\nthe judicial process' for persons with civil rights grievances,\"\n\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983) (quoting H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 94-1558, at 1 (1976)), and to \"encourag[e] the enforcement of\n\nfederal law through lawsuits filed by private persons,\" Missouri v.\n\nJenkins by Agyei, 491 U.S. 274, 283 n.6 (1989) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   The award of attorney's fees serves this purpose\n\n\n     5\n          We reject Diffenderfer and McCarroll's alternate theory,\nthat they were prevailing parties under § 1988 because their\nlawsuit formed the impetus for Law No. 90 and therefore provided\nthem with the real-world change their lawsuit was designed to\nachieve.   The Supreme Court squarely rejected this \"catalyst\ntheory\" of \"prevailing party\" status in Buckhannon. 532 U.S. at\n605.   Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74 (2007), did not alter that\nconclusion; it was concerned with the question of whether a\npreliminary injunction that was dissolved by a subsequent final\ndecision in the same case was enough to create \"prevailing party\"\nstatus, and its \"consistency\" with the majority and dissenting\nopinions in Buckhannon did not challenge the validity of the\nmajority's holding. Id. at 82 n.3.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fbecause it corrects a defect Congress identified in the market:\n\n\"[T]he private market for legal services failed to provide many\n\nvictims of civil rights violations with effective access to the\n\njudicial process\" because \"[t]hese victims ordinarily cannot afford\n\nto purchase legal services at the rates set out by the private\n\nmarket\" and because the amount of damages in most civil rights\n\nsuits is ordinarily too low to otherwise cover the cost of a\n\nlawyer.    City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 576-77 (1986).\n\n            To hold that mootness of a case pending appeal inherently\n\ndeprives plaintiffs of their status as \"prevailing parties\" would\n\ndetract from § 1988's purposes.           Such a rule could result in\n\ndisincentives for attorneys to bring civil rights actions when an\n\nevent outside the parties' control might moot the case after the\n\ndistrict   court   rendered   a   favorable   judgment   but   before   the\n\njudgment could be affirmed on appeal.         Cf. Jenkins by Agyei, 491\n\nU.S. at 283 n.6 (interpreting § 1988 to include an adjustment for\n\na delay in payment to calculate fees because the potential hardship\n\ninvolved in a contrary rule \"could well deter otherwise willing\n\nattorneys from accepting complex civil rights cases that might\n\noffer great benefit to society at large\" and \"this result would\n\nwork to defeat Congress' purpose in enacting § 1988\").                  Our\n\nsolution is our best view of what Congress, in designing the civil\n\nrights attorney's fees scheme, would intend.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fB.            Diffenderfer and McCarroll's Cross-Appeal\n\n              On cross-appeal, Diffenderfer and McCarroll reiterate\n\ntheir claim that the district court erroneously reduced their award\n\nwhen it imposed an across-the-board fee reduction to account for\n\nplaintiffs' practice of billing in quarter-hour increments.6               They\n\nargue that this reduction was an abuse of discretion, because\n\nbilling by the quarter-hour is common practice in the Puerto Rican\n\nlegal community.\n\n              Because we review such claims for an abuse of discretion,\n\nwe generally do not disturb a district court's calculation of an\n\naward.      See Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 292-93.            This\n\ncase is no different.      Plaintiffs misconstrue the district court's\n\nreasoning: the reduction was not imposed because the district court\n\nfound billing in quarter-hour increments per se unreasonable, but\n\nbecause it found that plaintiffs had billed fifty or more menial\n\nitems in quarter-hour increments when the actual task would have\n\ntaken a negligible amount of time. See Diffenderfer, 606 F.Supp.2d\n\nat   229.      The   district   court    explained   that   it   imposed   this\n\nreduction pursuant to its duty to ensure that the ultimate fee was\n\nreasonable. Its conclusions on this and other reductions were well\n\nwithin the boundaries of existing precedents, and we find no abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n\n      6\n          Plaintiffs do not appeal the district court's across-the-\nboard reduction for excessive and duplicative billing practices.\n\n                                        -17-\n\f                                    IV.\n\n           Finally, we turn to Gomez-Colon's motion for substitution\n\nof parties.   Gomez-Colon is no longer President of the Commission\n\nand seeks to substitute Hector J. Conty-Perez, the new President,\n\nas appellant.      Substitution is automatic where, as here, the\n\ndistrict   court   imposed   fees   against   Gomez-Colon   only   in   his\n\nofficial capacity.    See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n25(d).\n\n           Appellant Gomez-Colon's motion to substitute parties is\n\nhereby granted.    The district court's judgment in Diffenderfer v.\n\nGomez-Colon, 587 F. Supp. 2d 338 (D.P.R. 2008), is vacated, and we\n\nremand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the\n\naction. We affirm the district court's award of attorney's fees in\n\nthe district court.      No costs are awarded on these appeals.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

Two issues are presented in the\n\naftermath of a prior appeal in a civil rights case that has become\n\nmoot   due   to    legislative     action.      The   first   is   whether   the\n\nunderlying injunctive order the plaintiffs obtained in the district\n\ncourt should be vacated on remand, given the reason for mootness of\n\nthe appeal.       The second is whether plaintiffs would, under these\n\ncircumstances, remain entitled to the award of attorney's fees in\n\nthe now moot case and, if so, whether the fees the district court\n\nawarded were reasonable.          We vacate the judgment and remand to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to dismiss the action, and we\n\naffirm the district court's award of attorney's fees.\n\n             Plaintiffs, a class of Puerto Rican residents who only\n\nspeak English, sued members of the State Electoral Commission of\n\nPuerto Rico (Commission) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the\n\nCommission's      decision   to    print    ballots   in   the   November    2008\n\nelections solely in Spanish.         The federal district court of Puerto\n\nRico found for the plaintiffs on the merits and granted them a\n\npermanent injunction in August 2008, which compelled the Commission\n\nto print bilingual ballots in the November 2008 election.                    The\n\ndistrict court later awarded plaintiffs attorney's fees under 42\n\nU.S.C § 1988 in the sum of $67,550.34, less than the amount\n\nrequested of $122,988.75.           Defendant Ramon Gomez-Colon, who was\n\nPresident of the Commission at the time, appealed from both the\n\nunderlying judgment and the award of attorney's fees.               Plaintiffs\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhave cross-appealed from the diminution of their requested award,\n\nand the appeals were consolidated.\n\n            While these cases were pending on appeal, Puerto Rico\n\npassed legislation requiring the use of bilingual ballots in all\n\nfuture elections, and the governor signed the legislation, which is\n\nin effect.     Both parties agree this has mooted the underlying\n\njudgment.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            Plaintiffs and appellees, Sylvia Diffenderfer and Robert\n\nMcCarroll, are longtime Puerto Rico residents and registered voters\n\nwho speak and read only English.       On August 19, 2008, plaintiffs\n\nfiled a putative class action suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the\n\nfederal district court of Puerto Rico.     They sued the President of\n\nthe Commission and the four Commissioners in their individual and\n\nofficial capacities, arguing that the Commission's administrative\n\ndecision to issue ballots for the November 2008 Puerto Rican\n\nelections only in Spanish discriminated against and effectively\n\ndisenfranchised voters who only speak English.\n\n            On August 27, 2008, the district court granted plaintiffs\n\na permanent injunction directing the Commission to immediately\n\nbegin printing bilingual ballots for use in the November 2008\n\nelections.    In a written opinion issued September 2, 2008, the\n\ndistrict court held that this relief was warranted on the grounds\n\nthat the Commission's balloting policy violated the Voting Rights\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAct, the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.    See Diffenderfer v. Gomez-Colon, 587 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 338 (D.P.R. 2008).    On September 5, 2008, Ramon Gomez-\n\nColon, the President of the Commission, filed a notice of appeal.1\n\nIn the meantime, the Commission complied with the injunction and\n\nused bilingual ballots in the November 2008 elections.\n\n          In April 2009, the district court awarded Diffenderfer\n\nand McCarroll attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 because they\n\nhad prevailed before the district court on the merits of the § 1983\n\naction. Based on the \"lodestar\" method, the district court awarded\n\na total of $67,550.34 in attorney's fees and litigation costs. The\n\nplaintiffs had requested $122,988.75.   This amount was reduced by\n\nthe court to account for duplicative and excessive hours and to\n\nadjust for plaintiffs' practice of billing by the quarter-hour,\n\nwhich the district court found had produced an inflated number of\n\nbillable hours.   This fee was awarded only against Gomez-Colon in\n\nhis official capacity as the President of the Commission.      See\n\nDiffenderfer v.

His appeal\nwas voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 42(b) on\nFebruary 5, 2009.\n     2\n          The district court made an initial award of attorney's\nfees on April 1, 2009 and issued an amended order and judgment on\n\n                                -4-\n\faward on April 30, 2009, and Diffenderfer and McCarroll cross-\n\nappealed on May 7, 2009.\n\n           While these appeals were pending before this court,\n\nPuerto Rico enacted Law No. 90, which mandates that bilingual\n\nballots will be used in all future Puerto Rican elections.               Both\n\nparties agree that Law No. 90 mooted the appeal of the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the merits.\n\n           The    parties   disagree,   however,    as   to   the   proper\n\ndisposition of that appeal and the effect this would have upon the\n\nappeal of the attorney's fees award.         Diffenderfer and McCarroll\n\nargue that we should leave the district court's judgment on the\n\nmerits   intact   because   Gomez-Colon's    voluntary   actions    in    not\n\nseeking a stay pending appeal had rendered the case moot even\n\nbefore Puerto Rico passed Law No. 90.       They further argue that they\n\nare still entitled to attorney's fees for costs incurred in the\n\ndistrict court litigation, even if we were to vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment, because, inter alia, they obtained a favorable,\n\nmaterial alteration in the legal relationship between the parties\n\n\n\nApril 24, 2009. The first order awarded $65,992.00 in attorney's\nfees against three of the four Commissioners, in addition to Gomez-\nColon.   After this initial judgment issued on April 1, 2009,\nDiffenderfer and McCarroll asked for reconsideration of the\ncalculations and for inclusion of litigation costs. In a revised\norder on April 24, 2009, the district court accepted plaintiffs'\narguments in part and revised the attorney's fee figure upwards to\n$67,550.34. It also imposed attorney's fees only upon Gomez-Colon\nin his official capacity, since, as President of the Commission, he\nwas the only one able to represent the Commission as a whole.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fbefore the case became moot. Finally, they argue that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in reducing plaintiffs' award of\n\nattorney's fees because of plaintiffs' practice of billing in\n\nquarter-hour increments and request that the award of attorney's\n\nfees be adjusted upwards to $82,490.            Their claim for attorney's\n\nfees is limited to their work before the district court.\n\n           Gomez-Colon instead urges us to vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the grounds that vacatur is the general rule\n\nwhen a case becomes moot on appeal through happenstance, for\n\ninstance due to intervening legislation like Law No. 90.                Gomez-\n\nColon further argues that vacation of the underlying judgment would\n\nnecessarily require reversal of the district court's disposition of\n\nattorney's fees.        Plaintiffs, he asserts, cannot be considered\n\n\"prevailing parties\" in the district court if the district court's\n\njudgment is vacated, and the district court's award of attorney's\n\nfees   should    therefore    be    reversed.    He    does   not   argue    that\n\nplaintiffs      were   not   otherwise   prevailing     parties     before   the\n\ndistrict court or that the fees awarded were not reasonable.\n\n           Gomez-Colon       also    filed   motions    to    substitute     his\n\nsuccessor as the President of the Commission as the appellant and\n\nto consolidate the appeals of the district court's judgment on the\n\nmerits and its award of attorney's fees.          We granted the motion to\n\nconsolidate but reserved judgment on the question of substitution\n\nof parties.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f                                   II.\n\n           The first issue is the appropriate disposition of the\n\nappeal   of   the   district   court's   judgment   on   the   merits   of\n\nplaintiffs' § 1983 action.      Both parties contend, and we agree,\n\nthat Law No. 90 mooted that appeal.          Under that statute, the\n\nCommission must use bilingual ballots now that Puerto Rico has made\n\nbilingual ballots mandatory.      Because we can no longer issue any\n\njudicial remedy capable of affecting the parties' rights, the case\n\nno longer presents a live \"case or controversy\" under Article III,\n\nand we lack jurisdiction to decide its merits.

He suggests that plaintiffs should have waited\nto apply for fees until after the disposition of this appeal. But\nGomez-Colon never made this argument before the district court when\n\n                                -11-\n\fmeans that the initial, favorable judgment plaintiffs obtained from\n\nthe district court is no longer binding law.         This, Gomez-Colon\n\nclaims, makes it identical in effect to a reversal of the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the merits.      When a federal court of appeals\n\nreverses a district court's judgment on the merits in a civil\n\nrights case, it is well established that plaintiffs are no longer\n\n\"prevailing parties\" entitled to attorney's fees for litigation\n\nbefore the district court.

Gomez-Colon argues that the same rule should apply\n\nto judgments vacated as moot.\n\n           We   reject   this   argument,   which   misunderstands   the\n\ndifference between reversal on the merits and vacatur of a moot\n\ncase.   Reversal on the merits deprives a plaintiff of \"prevailing\n\nparty\" status because it repudiates the favorable change in the\n\nparties' legal relationship effectuated by the district court's\n\njudgment and holds that the plaintiff was never legally entitled to\n\nsuch relief.    In contrast, in the mootness context, a \"prevailing\n\nparty\" is a party who managed to obtain a favorable, material\n\nalteration in the legal relationship between the parties prior to\n\n\nit assessed attorney's fees, even though Gomez-Colon had, at that\ntime, already filed a notice of appeal of the underlying judgment.\nWe therefore consider this argument waived.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fthe intervening act of mootness.

Similarly, a party is not a\n\n\"prevailing party\" at the appeals stage, entitled to attorney's\n\nfees for the cost of appellate litigation, if the case becomes moot\n\npending appeal.   See Lewis, 494 U.S. at 483.   But the Supreme Court\n\nhas explicitly left open the question presented in this case,\n\nobserving that \"[w]hether [a plaintiff] can be deemed a 'prevailing\n\nparty' in the District Court, even though its judgment was mooted\n\nafter being rendered but before the losing party could challenge\n\nits validity on appeal, is a question of some difficulty.\"     Id.\n\n            We agree the question is difficult, but we must decide\n\nit.   Numerous circuits have held both before and after Lewis that\n\nan award of fees is within the discretion of the district court.\n\nWe agree.     When plaintiffs clearly succeeded in obtaining the\n\nrelief sought before the district court and an intervening event\n\nrendered the case moot on appeal, plaintiffs are still \"prevailing\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fparties\" for the purposes of attorney's fees for the district court\n\nlitigation.

Such a rule could result in\n\ndisincentives for attorneys to bring civil rights actions when an\n\nevent outside the parties' control might moot the case after the\n\ndistrict   court   rendered   a   favorable   judgment   but   before   the\n\njudgment could be affirmed on appeal.         Cf. Jenkins by Agyei, 491\n\nU.S. at 283 n.6 (interpreting § 1988 to include an adjustment for\n\na delay in payment to calculate fees because the potential hardship\n\ninvolved in a contrary rule \"could well deter otherwise willing\n\nattorneys from accepting complex civil rights cases that might\n\noffer great benefit to society at large\" and \"this result would\n\nwork to defeat Congress' purpose in enacting § 1988\").                  Our\n\nsolution is our best view of what Congress, in designing the civil\n\nrights attorney's fees scheme, would intend.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fB.            Diffenderfer and McCarroll's Cross-Appeal\n\n              On cross-appeal, Diffenderfer and McCarroll reiterate\n\ntheir claim that the district court erroneously reduced their award\n\nwhen it imposed an across-the-board fee reduction to account for\n\nplaintiffs' practice of billing in quarter-hour increments.6               They\n\nargue that this reduction was an abuse of discretion, because\n\nbilling by the quarter-hour is common practice in the Puerto Rican\n\nlegal community.\n\n              Because we review such claims for an abuse of discretion,\n\nwe generally do not disturb a district court's calculation of an\n\naward.      See Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 292-93.            This\n\ncase is no different.      Plaintiffs misconstrue the district court's\n\nreasoning: the reduction was not imposed because the district court\n\nfound billing in quarter-hour increments per se unreasonable, but\n\nbecause it found that plaintiffs had billed fifty or more menial\n\nitems in quarter-hour increments when the actual task would have\n\ntaken a negligible amount of time. See Diffenderfer, 606 F.Supp.2d\n\nat   229.      The   district   court    explained   that   it   imposed   this\n\nreduction pursuant to its duty to ensure that the ultimate fee was\n\nreasonable. Its conclusions on this and other reductions were well\n\nwithin the boundaries of existing precedents, and we find no abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n\n      6\n          Plaintiffs do not appeal the district court's across-the-\nboard reduction for excessive and duplicative billing practices.\n\n                                        -17-\n\f                                    IV.\n\n           Finally, we turn to Gomez-Colon's motion for substitution\n\nof parties.   Gomez-Colon is no longer President of the Commission\n\nand seeks to substitute Hector J. Conty-Perez, the new President,\n\nas appellant.      Substitution is automatic where, as here, the\n\ndistrict   court   imposed   fees   against   Gomez-Colon   only   in   his\n\nofficial capacity.    See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n25(d).\n\n           Appellant Gomez-Colon's motion to substitute parties is\n\nhereby granted.    The district court's judgment in Diffenderfer v.\n\nGomez-Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1751573\"><a href=\"/opinion/1751573/diffenderfer-v-gomez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.P.R. 2008), is vacated, and we\n\nremand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the\n\naction. We affirm the district court's award of attorney's fees in\n\nthe district court.      No costs are awarded on these appeals.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f</pre>",
