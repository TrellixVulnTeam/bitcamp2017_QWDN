Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Sean J. Cleary for appellee.\n\n     Mark J. Albano, with whom Dalsey, Ferrara & Albano was on the\nbrief, for appellants.\n\n\n\n                             June 27, 2005\n\n\n\n     *\n        Of the    Tenth    Circuit    Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            BALDOCK, Senior Circuit Judge.          The sole issue before us\n\non appeal is whether the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act\n\n(FEGLIA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 8701-8716, preempts a state law claim for the\n\nimposition of a constructive trust upon the proceeds of a federal\n\ngroup life insurance policy.          We hold that it does.\n\n            The facts are not in dispute.           Decedent Albert Zaldivar\n\nwas an employee of the United States Postal Service.                   A state\n\ndivorce decree from his first marriage (originally entered in New\n\nYork and subsequently ratified in New Hampshire) directed decedent\n\nto name his three children, Appellants Sandra L. Zaldivar, Daniel\n\nC.E. Zaldivar, and Thomas A. Zaldivar, as beneficiaries of his\n\nfederal group life insurance policy.            Notwithstanding the decree,\n\ndecedent named his second wife, Appellee Beverly Zaldivar, as sole\n\nbeneficiary of the policy once his children reached adulthood.\n\n            Upon decedent’s death in June 2001, the policy issuer,\n\nMetropolitan      Life   Insurance    Company   (MetLife),      initiated   this\n\ninterpleader action in federal district court. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n22.      The district court permitted disbursement of the policy\n\nproceeds to Beverly.         Thereafter, the children moved the court,\n\npursuant to state law, to impose a constructive trust on the\n\nproceeds.     The court denied the motion and entered judgment in\n\nfavor of Beverly, holding FEGLIA preempted the children’s state law\n\nclaim.\n\n            The   district    court    issued   a   thorough,    well-reasoned\n\nopinion.    Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Zaldivar, 337 F. Supp. 2d\n\n343 (D. Mass. 2004).       To support its holding that FEGLIA preempted\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe state law claim, the court relied on FEGLIA’s (1) language and\n\nscheme, (2) the overwhelming weight of federal court authority\n\nholding FEGLIA’s provisions preempt state law, and (3) a 1998\n\namendment to FEGLIA allowing domestic relations orders to alter\n\nFEGLIA’s benefit distribution scheme under specified circumstances.\n\nId. at 346-48.\n\n            We have carefully reviewed the record, the applicable\n\nlaw, and the parties’ briefs, and conclude the district court\n\nreached the correct result.       We have repeatedly opined that “when\n\na   lower   court   accurately    takes   the   measure    of   a   case   and\n\narticulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a\n\nreviewing court to write at length.”            Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-\n\nIrish, 300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing cases).              Thus, we\n\naffirm the district court’s judgment for substantially the reasons\n\nset forth in its opinion.        We add only these brief comments.\n\n            The Supreme Court’s decision in Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454\n\nU.S. 46 (1981), dictates the outcome of this case.          In Ridgway, the\n\nissue was whether a serviceman’s beneficiary designation under a\n\npolicy governed by the Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance Act\n\n(SGLIA), 38 U.S.C. §§ 1965-1979, prevailed over a constructive\n\ntrust (based on a divorce decree) which a state court imposed upon\n\nthe policy proceeds.     Like FEGLIA, SGLIA establishes a specified\n\n“order of precedence” for policy beneficiaries.           Subsection (a) of\n\nboth 5 U.S.C. § 8705 and 38 U.S.C. § 1970 provides that policy\n\nproceeds shall first be paid to the insured’s properly designated\n\nbeneficiary.     Because the applicable language of FEGLIA and SGLIA\n\n                                    -5-\n\fare very similar, a case construing the latter, such as Ridgway, is\n\nhighly persuasive, if not binding, in construing the former.     See\n\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.    Christ, 979 F.2d 575, 580-82 (7th\n\nCir. 1992); see also Prudential Ins. Co. v. Hinkel, 121 F.3d 364,\n\n367 (8th Cir. 1997); Brewer v. Zawrotny, 978 F.2d 1204, 1206 n.2\n\n(10th Cir. 1992).\n\n          The Court in Ridgway concluded that Congress, in enacting\n\nSGLIA, “spoke[] with force and clarity in directing that the\n\nproceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.”     Ridgway,\n\n454 U.S. at 56 (internal quotations omitted).     Thus, we are bound\n\nto conclude the state divorce decree directing the decedent to\n\ndesignate his children as beneficiaries under his life insurance\n\npolicy conflicted with the decedent’s right under FEGLIA to name\n\nthe beneficiary, and must give way.   See Christ, 979 F.2d at 582.\n\n          Finally, we note the children could have avoided today’s\n\nresult if they had complied with the 1998 amendment to FEGLIA prior\n\nto decedent’s death in 2001.    See Pub. L. No.   105-205, § 1, 112\n\nStat. 683 (July 22, 1998). Cognizant of the possible inequities in\n\ncases such as this, Congress created an exception to the insured’s\n\nunfettered right to name the beneficiary of his or her choosing\n\nunder § 8705(a). Subsection (a) is now subject to § 8705(e).\n\nSubsection (e) provides that domestic decrees may alter the order\n\nof precedence set forth in subsection (a) if “received, before the\n\ndate of the covered employee’s death,” by the appropriate agency or\n\noffice. As the district court explained: “To alter the designation\n\nof a beneficiary in this case by imposing a constructive trust\n\n                                -6-\n\fwould   directly   contradict   the    language   of   §   8705(e)   that\n\nspecifically mandates the conditions that must be met for a court\n\ndivorce decree to be given effect.”      Zaldivar, 337 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n348.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n          Each party shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

Thus, we are bound to conclude the state divorce decree directing the decedent to designate his children as beneficiaries under his life insurance policy conflicted with the decedent's right under FEGLIA to name the beneficiary, and must give way. <i>See Christ,</i> 979 F.2d at 582.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note the children could have avoided today's result if they had complied with the 1998 amendment to FEGLIA prior to decedent's death in 2001. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 105-205, &#167; 1, 112 Stat. 683 (July 22, 1998). Cognizant of the possible inequities in cases such as this, Congress created an exception to the insured's unfettered right to name the beneficiary of his or her choosing under &#167; 8705(a). Subsection (a) is now subject to &#167; 8705(e). Subsection (e) provides that domestic decrees may alter the order of precedence set forth in subsection (a) <i>if</i> \"received, before the date of the covered employee's death,\" by the appropriate agency or office. As the district court explained: \"To alter the designation of a beneficiary in this case by imposing a constructive trust would directly contradict the language of &#167; 8705(e) that specifically mandates the conditions that must be met for a court divorce decree to be given effect.\" <i>Zaldivar,</i> 337 F.Supp.2d at 348.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each party shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
