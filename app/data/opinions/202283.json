Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                 Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n\n                and Stafford,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     James L.

Roberto García (\"García\")\n\nappeals his conviction for illegal re-entry into the United States\n\nby a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.                 We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n              On February 28, 2002, Seth Plumb (\"Plumb\"), a special\n\nagent with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n(\"ICE\"), arrested García in Quincy, Massachusetts.                    As an ICE\n\nspecial agent, Plumb was responsible for locating people who\n\nentered the United States illegally.            Plumb took García to the ICE\n\nOffice, where, during the booking process, García’s photograph and\n\nfingerprints were taken.\n\n              As a result of his encounter with García, Plumb reviewed\n\nthe   Alien    Registration   File   of    an    individual    named    \"Roberto\n\nGarcía,\" assigned Alien Registration Number 876 586 529.                    That\n\nAlien Registration File contained a number of documents, all with\n\nthe same Alien Registration Number, revealing that \"Roberto García\"\n\nwas a native and citizen of Colombia who had entered the United\n\nStates illegally and had been deported in 1999 from the United\n\nStates to his native country.              Among other things, the file\n\ncontained a Warrant for Deportation, dated December 13, 1999, which\n\nincluded a photograph of \"Roberto García\" along with a print of his\n\nright index finger.         Trained in fingerprint comparison, Plumb\n\ncompared the fingerprints obtained from García during the 2002\n\nbooking   process    with   the   fingerprint     on   the    1999   Warrant   of\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fDeportation. Plumb concluded that the fingerprints belonged to the\n\nsame person.     Plumb also recognized the man in the photograph as\n\nthe man he arrested in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\n            García was indicted on March 27, 2002, in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts on one\n\ncount of illegal re-entry by a deported alien in violation of 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326.    He was convicted on November 4, 2003, after a two\n\nday trial during which the government called three witnesses:\n\nPlumb, Erik Carpenter (\"Carpenter\") (a forensic examiner for the\n\nLatent Print Unit of the FBI’s Laboratory), and Joanne Sassone\n\n(\"Sassone\") (the Records and Information Services Officer for the\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Service of the Department\n\nof Homeland Security).     On March 17, 2004, García was sentenced to\n\n30 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, with judgment\n\nentered the following day.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            In challenging his conviction, García first argues that\n\nthe   district   court   erred   in   admitting    certain   documents   and\n\ntestimony at trial.      He then argues that there was insufficient\n\nevidence for a jury to convict him.         We are not convinced by either\n\nargument.\n\n                         A. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n             In general, we review a district court's decision to\n\nadmit evidence for abuse of discretion.           United States v. Flemmi,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f402 F.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir. 2005).                 Where no objection was made to\n\nthe admission of evidence at trial, we review evidentiary issues\n\nfor plain error.       Id.   To establish plain error, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate   that     an    error    occurred       which   was   obvious,   which\n\naffected his substantial rights, and which seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Delgado-Hernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 19-20 (1st. Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n1.   García’s Affidavit\n\n           Roberto García’s Alien Registration File included an\n\naffidavit,    dated    October       27,    1999,    containing    the   following\n\nstatement, handwritten in English:\n\n                      My true [and] complete name is\n                      Roberto García. I was born on\n                      May 10, 1969 in Colombia and I\n                      am a citizen of Colombia.      I\n                      entered the U.S. from Mexico in\n                      1989 illegally.     I did not\n                      present myself for inspection\n                      because I did not have a Visa.\n\nThe handwritten statement was signed: \"Roberto G.\"                  The affidavit\n\nindicated that, while an interpreter was not used, the affiant\n\nappeared before a Spanish-speaking officer of what was then the\n\nUnited States Immigration and Naturalization Service1 (\"INS\"),\n\nthat the affiant was advised of his Miranda rights in Spanish, and\n\n\n\n      1\n      The INS has since become ICE, the Bureau of Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthat       the   affiant   willingly   made   the   above    sworn     statement.\n\nFollowing        the   signed   handwritten   statement     was   a   typewritten\n\nstatement indicating that the \"foregoing statement\" had been read\n\nto the affiant, that the answers made therein were true and\n\ncorrect, and that the affidavit was a full, true, and correct\n\nrecord of the affiant’s interrogation by the INS officer.                     The\n\ntypewritten statement was signed: \"Robert G.\"\n\n                 Before trial began, García moved in limine to exclude the\n\naffidavit, arguing that the affidavit was untrustworthy because it\n\nwas prepared in English and allegedly signed by García, who speaks\n\nonly Spanish.           The district court rejected García’s argument,\n\nexplaining that (1) while the affidavit was written in English, it\n\nwas interpreted into Spanish by the INS officer; (2) the affidavit\n\nindicated that García was advised of his rights; and 3) García’s\n\nsignature appeared on the affidavit.           The district court noted not\n\nonly that the signature on the affidavit appeared to be the same as\n\nthe signature on a waiver-of-presence form2 signed by García in\n\nopen court that very day, but also that García did not challenge\n\nthe signature and did not proffer that the affidavit had not been\n\ninterpreted for him in Spanish.\n\n                 At trial, the affidavit was introduced through Sassone,\n\nwho testified that Roberto García’s Alien Registration File was\n\n\n       2\n      García voluntarily absented himself from the courtroom after\njury selection, signing a waiver-of-presence form before he left\nthe courtroom.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fmaintained in the regular course of business.                 Sassone identified\n\nthe various documents contained in the Alien Registration File,\n\nincluding the 1999 affidavit, but she admitted that she had no\n\npersonal knowledge about the events that triggered the preparation\n\nof those documents.       García objected to admission of the affidavit\n\non hearsay and lack-of-authentication grounds.\n\n            The district court overruled García’s hearsay objection,\n\nfinding that the affidavit was an admission of a party opponent.\n\nThe    district   court   again   noted       that   García    had   adopted   the\n\nstatements contained in the affidavit as his own and had offered\n\nnothing to challenge the representation that the affidavit was\n\nexplained in Spanish.\n\n            The district court also overruled García’s objection to\n\nadmission of the affidavit on authentication grounds. According to\n\nGarcía, because Sassone had no personal knowledge about García’s\n\n1999   deportation   and    was   not    present     when   the   affidavit    was\n\ncreated, she could not establish that the document was, in fact,\n\nsigned by García.         The district court was unpersuaded, having\n\nitself seen the obvious similarities in the signature placed on the\n\nwaiver-of-presence form signed by García in open court and the\n\nmultiple signatures found on various documents in Roberto García’s\n\nAlien Registration File.\n\n            García now contends that the district court committed\n\nreversible error by admitting the affidavit signed by \"Roberto G.\"\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fWe find no merit to such contention.           Indeed, García has pointed to\n\nnothing in the record that casts doubt upon the district court’s\n\nfindings that (1) the statements contained within the affidavit\n\nwere translated into Spanish for García’s benefit, (2) García\n\nheard, understood, and acquiesced in those statements, and (3)\n\nGarcía twice signed the affidavit, thereby signaling his adoption\n\nof the affidavit as his own.            See McQueeney v. Wilmington Trust\n\nCo., 779 F.2d 916, 930 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding that a seaman's\n\nsignature   on   Sea   Service   records       prepared    by   others   was   \"an\n\nunequivocal adoption of the contents therein\").                     Given these\n\nfindings,   we   cannot   say    that    the    district    court    abused    its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the affidavit as a non-hearsay admission of\n\nalienage by a party opponent.\n\n            García’s authentication argument is equally unavailing.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a), \"[t]he requirement of\n\nauthentication . . . as a condition precedent to admissibility is\n\nsatisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the\n\nmatter in question is what its proponent claims.\"                   If the trial\n\ncourt determines that there is sufficient evidence to allow a\n\nreasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to\n\nbe, the evidence may be admitted subject to the factfinder’s\n\nassessing what weight will be given to the evidence. United States\n\nv. Alicea-Cardoza, 132 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997).                   There is no\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fsingle way, moreover, to authenticate evidence.             As this court has\n\nrecognized on more than one occasion:\n\n            [T]he direct testimony of a custodian or a\n            percipient witness is not a sine qua non to\n            the authentication of a writing. Thus, a\n            document's appearance, contents, substance,\n            internal   patterns,  or  other   distinctive\n            characteristics, taken in conjunction with\n            circumstances,   can,  in  cumulation,   even\n            without direct testimony, provide sufficient\n            indicia of reliability to permit a finding\n            that it is authentic.\n\nE.g., United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 167 (1st Cir.              1994)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 514\n\nU.S. 1084, 115 S. Ct. 1797, 131 L. Ed. 2d 724 (1995); United States\n\nv. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Here, given the absence of any evidence to refute what\n\nthe   affidavit,     on   its   face,    revealed,   we    find   no   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion on the part of the district court in admitting the\n\naffidavit.     The    content    of     the   affidavit,   the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding its creation, and its location in an Alien Registration\n\nFile containing not only García’s photograph but also several\n\nexamples of his signature (a signature that appeared to be the same\n\nas the signature placed on the waiver-of-presence form signed by\n\nGarcía in the presence of the district court) all support the\n\ndistrict court’s decision to admit the affidavit as an authentic\n\ndocument.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f2.   1999 Fingerprint Card\n\n            During    trial,      García   objected    to     the   admission    of\n\nGovernment’s      Exhibit   12,    a   fingerprint     card    that   was   signed\n\n\"Roberto G.\" on the front and stamped \"USINS, Pittsburgh, PA\" on\n\nthe back.      Although it was included in Roberto García’s Alien\n\nRegistration File, the card was otherwise lacking a date, an Alien\n\nRegistration Number, and such identifying information as a date of\n\nbirth, social security number, height, weight, and FBI number.\n\nGarcía objected that the card was untrustworthy because its only\n\nauthentication was the purported signature of \"Roberto G.\"\n\n            The   district     court   overruled      García’s      objection   and\n\nadmitted the fingerprint card, again noting that the signature on\n\nthe card appeared to be the same as the signature on the affidavit.\n\nIndeed, the similarity in signatures was not the only factor\n\nsupporting the district court’s ruling.            The fingerprint card was\n\ncontained in an Alien Registration File that included a photograph\n\nof García.     In addition, the stamp appearing on the back of the\n\ncard, \"USINS, Pittsburgh, PA,\" was consistent with other documents\n\nin the file indicating that the Roberto García whose photograph was\n\nin the file had been in INS custody in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\n\nafter he was encountered, but before he was deported, in 1999.\n\nThere was thus sufficient evidence before the district court to\n\nwarrant a reasonable person in believing that Government’s Exhibit\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f12 was what it purported to be: namely, a card containing the\n\nfingerprints of García.\n\n3.   Warrant of Deportation\n\n           The Warrant of Deportation, commanding any INS officer to\n\ntake custody of Roberto García and to remove him from the United\n\nStates, was introduced through Sassone.      She testified that a\n\nWarrant of Deportation, when complete with an alien’s photograph\n\nand fingerprint, reveals that an INS official witnessed the alien’s\n\ndeparture from the United States on a given date.   As explained by\n\nSassone, the Warrant of Deportation contained in Roberto García’s\n\nAlien Registration File, complete with photograph and fingerprint,\n\nrevealed that Roberto García was actually placed on a plane in\n\nNewark, New Jersey, on December 13, 1999, for deportation out of\n\nthe United States.    Sassone further explained that, had Roberto\n\nGarcía been granted permission to re-enter the United States\n\nsubsequently, such permission would be reflected not only in his\n\nAlien Registration File but also in the INS’s computer indices.\n\nSassone testified that she found no evidence, either in the Alien\n\nRegistration File or the agency’s computer indices, that permission\n\nto re-enter had ever been granted to Roberto García.\n\n           Relying on Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.\n\nCt. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), García contends on appeal that\n\nthe district court violated his confrontation rights by admitting\n\nthe 1999 Warrant of Deportation when the officer who signed the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fwarrant was not made available for cross-examination.                           Because\n\nGarcía   did   not    object     to     the    admission       of    the     Warrant   of\n\nDeportation at trial, we review for plain error.\n\n           In Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68, the Supreme Court held that\n\nthe Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of out-of-court\n\nstatements that are testimonial in nature unless the declarant is\n\nunavailable     and      the   defendant       had      a   prior     opportunity       to\n\ncross-examine the declarant concerning the statements.                           García\n\nargues that the Warrant of Deportation admitted in this case falls\n\nwithin the \"core class\" of testimonial statements described by the\n\nSupreme Court in Crawford.\n\n           At least three circuit courts have rejected the very\n\nargument   being      made     here    by     García.        In     United    States    v.\n\nValdez-Maltos, 443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir. 2006), the Fifth Circuit\n\nheld that warrants of deportation do not constitute testimonial\n\nhearsay under Crawford.               The Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have\n\nlikewise   held    that      defendants       have   no     right    to    confront    and\n\ncross-examine      the     agents      who     routinely      record       warrants     of\n\ndeportation because warrants of deportation are \"non-testimonial\"\n\nand, therefore, not subject to the confrontation clause.                               See\n\nUnited States v. Bahena-Cardenas, 411 F.3d 1067, 1074-75 (9th Cir.\n\n2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1652, 164 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2006);\n\nUnited States v. Cantellano, 430 F.3d 1142, 1145 (11th Cir. 2005),\n\ncert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1604, 164 L. Ed. 2d 325 (2006); see also\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fUnited States v. Rueda-Rivera, 396 F.3d 678, 680 (5th Cir. 2005)\n\n(stating generally that documents in a defendant's immigration file\n\nare analogous to non-testimonial business records); United States\n\nv. Quezada, 754 F.2d 1190, 1194-95 (5th Cir. 1985) (holding that a\n\nwarrant   of    deportation   contained   in    an   alien's   INS    file   was\n\nreliable and admissible because the official preparing the warrant\n\nhad no motivation to do anything other than \"mechanically register\n\nan unambiguous factual matter\").\n\n            Because we find no reason to disagree with the Fifth,\n\nNinth,    and   Eleventh   Circuits,   we      conclude   that   García      has\n\nestablished no error at all, much less plain error, with regard to\n\nthe admission of the 1999 Warrant of Deportation.\n\n4.   Plumb’s Identification of García\n\n            At trial, Agent Plumb testified, without objection, that\n\nhe recognized the person whose picture appeared on the 1999 Warrant\n\nof Deportation as the same person he encountered in 2002 under the\n\nname \"Roberto García.\"        Plumb also testified that he recognized\n\nthis person as the individual--referring to García--who was in the\n\ncourtroom during jury selection earlier that morning.                García now\n\ncontends that the district court committed plain error by admitting\n\nPlumb’s opinion testimony regarding the identity of the person in\n\nthe photograph on the Warrant of Deportation. According to García,\n\nPlumb’s testimony was improper because it was based on Plumb’s one-\n\ntime \"scant exposure\" to García.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           Although Plumb encountered García only once, it was not\n\na fleeting encounter. In fact, Plumb encountered García in Quincy,\n\nMassachusetts, transported García from Quincy to Boston, booked\n\nGarcía into the ICE system, filled in García’s fingerprint card,\n\nand served García with several documents.          There is nothing in the\n\nrecord to suggest that Plumb was unable to fully observe García\n\nduring the 2002 arrest and booking, that Plumb did not remember\n\nGarcía, or that Plumb had any difficulty in identifying García,\n\neither in person or by photograph.             Under the circumstances, we\n\nfind no plain error in the district court’s decision to admit\n\nPlumb’s identification testimony.\n\n5.   Plumb’s Expert Testimony on Fingerprint Comparison\n\n           García   contends     that    the   district   court      abused   its\n\ndiscretion in permitting Agent Plumb to testify--over García’s\n\nobjection--as an expert with respect to fingerprint comparison.\n\nGarcía maintains that Plumb’s purported expertise was inadequate in\n\nthat it rested on a mere two days of training.            We disagree.\n\n           In    essence,    Plumb   testified     that   his      training     in\n\nfingerprint comparison began with a 16-hour course taught by a\n\nrepresentative      of   the     Massachusetts       Bureau     of     Criminal\n\nInvestigations.      Plumb     further   explained    that    he     received    a\n\ncertification in fingerprint comparison after he completed the 16-\n\nhour course, that he conducted more than 80 fingerprint comparisons\n\nover the course of the next two years, that his comparisons were\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fsometimes verified by another INS officer or by the Federal Bureau\n\nof Investigation, that the results of his comparisons had never\n\ndiffered from those of the person verifying his comparisons, and\n\nthat he had testified as a fingerprint expert in federal court on\n\nseveral occasions.\n\n           This court may reverse the district court’s decision\n\nregarding expert testimony only if the ruling \"was so wide of the\n\nmark as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\"             Macaulay v. Anas,\n\n321 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Valle,\n\n72 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that the trial court\n\nhas   discretion   to   admit    or   reject    expert    testimony   and   its\n\ndetermination is reviewable only for an abuse of that discretion).\n\nHere, there was no abuse of discretion.           To be sure, some experts\n\nare more qualified than others, and Plumb--in his capacity as a law\n\nenforcement officer--may not have had the same expertise as someone\n\nwhose   sole   occupation   is   to   compare    latent    prints.    Plumb’s\n\ntraining and experience were sufficient, however, to permit the\n\ndistrict court, in its discretion, to admit Plumb’s testimony.               It\n\nwas up to the jury to weigh that testimony, given what the jurors\n\nheard on direct and cross-examination about Plumb’s training and\n\nexperience.\n\n                   B. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n           This court reviews sufficiency of the evidence claims de\n\nnovo.   United States v. Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 480 (1st\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fCir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 639, 163 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2005).                   The\n\ncourt must determine \"whether the evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government--a perspective that requires us to draw\n\nevery reasonable inference and resolve credibility conflicts in a\n\nmanner consistent with the verdict--would permit a rational trier\n\nof fact to find each element of                  the crime charged beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"        United States v. Patel, 370 F.3d 108, 111 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n             To convict a defendant of a section 1326 violation, the\n\ngovernment must prove that (1) the defendant is an alien; (2) he\n\nwas arrested and deported; and (3) he thereafter entered, or\n\nattempted to enter, the United States without the express consent\n\nof   the   Attorney      General    of    the    United    States   to   apply   for\n\nreadmission to the United States since the time of his previous\n\narrest and deportation.            United States v. Cabral, 252 F.3d 520,\n\n522-23     (1st   Cir.    2001).         Here,    García    maintains    that    the\n\ngovernment’s \"paltry evidence\" was insufficient to prove, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, that the person who was deported in 1999 was\n\nGarcía.       According     to     García,      the   probative     value   of   the\n\ngovernment’s evidence was \"virtually nil\" for the same reasons that\n\nthe evidence--including the affidavit, the Warrant of Deportation,\n\nand the identification testimony--was purportedly inadmissible. We\n\nare not persuaded.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f           To the contrary, we find that the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial--all properly admissible--was more than ample to establish,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, all three elements of the section 1326\n\ncharge against García.     The signed statement admitting alienage,\n\nthe   Warrant   of   Deportation--with     photograph   and    fingerprint--\n\nindicating that García was seen departing the United States in\n\n1999, Plumb’s testimony regarding his 2002 encounter of García,\n\nPlumb’s   testimony    regarding    García’s     identity,    and   Sassone’s\n\ntestimony regarding the absence of evidence establishing that\n\nGarcía had permission to re-enter the United States, could lead a\n\nrational trier of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n\nGarcía was guilty as charged.       That the government failed to call\n\nany witness who personally saw García sign the affidavit or depart\n\nfrom the United States does not lead us to think otherwise.                See\n\nUnited States v. Melendez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(explaining that \"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the\n\nother criteria of admissibility, is just as appropriate as direct\n\nevidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the [fact\n\nfinder] deems it should be given\") (quoting United States v.\n\nGamache, 156 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n                                    III.\n\n           Having     concluded    that    the   evidence     was   not   only\n\nadmissible but also sufficient to establish García’s guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, we AFFIRM the judgment in this case.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 2002, Seth Plumb (\"Plumb\"), a special agent with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), arrested Garc&#237;a in Quincy, Massachusetts. As an ICE special agent, Plumb was responsible for locating people who entered the United States illegally. Plumb took Garc&#237;a to the ICE Office, where, during the booking process, Garc&#237;a's photograph and fingerprints were taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of his encounter with Garc&#237;a, Plumb reviewed the Alien Registration File of an individual named \"Roberto Garc&#237;a,\" assigned Alien Registration Number 876 586 529. That Alien Registration File contained a number of documents, all with the same Alien Registration Number, revealing that \"Roberto Garc&#237;a\" was a native and citizen of Colombia who had entered the United States illegally and had been deported in 1999 from the United States to his native country. Among other things, the file contained a Warrant for Deportation, dated December 13, 1999, which included a photograph of \"Roberto Garc&#237;a\" along with a print of his right index finger. Trained in fingerprint comparison, Plumb compared the fingerprints obtained from Garc&#237;a during the 2002 booking process with the fingerprint on the 1999 Warrant of Deportation. Plumb concluded that the fingerprints belonged to the same person. Plumb also recognized the man in the photograph as the man he arrested in Quincy, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a was indicted on March 27, 2002, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on one count of illegal re-entry by a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326. He was convicted on November 4, 2003, after a two day trial during which the government called three witnesses: Plumb, Erik Carpenter (\"Carpenter\") (a forensic examiner for the Latent Print Unit of the FBI's Laboratory), and Joanne Sassone (\"Sassone\") (the Records and Information Services Officer for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service of the Department of Homeland Security). On March 17, 2004, Garc&#237;a was sentenced to 30 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, with judgment entered the following day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging his conviction, Garc&#237;a first argues that the district court erred in admitting certain documents and testimony at trial. He then argues that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to convict him. We are not convinced by either argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, we review a district court's decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir.2005). Where no objection was made to the admission of evidence at trial, we review evidentiary issues for plain error. <i>Id.</i> To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that an error occurred which was obvious, which affected his substantial rights, and which seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Delgado-Hernandez,</i> 420 F.3d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Garc&#237;a's Affidavit</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File included an affidavit, dated October 27, 1999, containing the following statement, handwritten in English:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My true [and] complete name is Roberto Garc&#237;a. I was born on May 10, 1969 in Colombia and I am a citizen of Colombia. I entered the U.S. from Mexico in 1989 illegally. I did not present myself for inspection because I did not have a Visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The handwritten statement was signed: \"Roberto G.\" The affidavit indicated that, while an interpreter was not used, the affiant appeared before a Spanish-speaking officer of what was then the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (\"INS\"), that the affiant was advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights in Spanish, and that the affiant willingly made the above sworn statement. Following the signed handwritten statement was a typewritten statement indicating that the \"foregoing statement\" had been read to the affiant, that the answers made therein were true and correct, and that the affidavit was a full, true, and correct record of the affiant's interrogation by the INS officer. The typewritten statement was signed: \"Robert G.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial began, Garc&#237;a moved in limine to exclude the affidavit, arguing that the affidavit was untrustworthy because it was prepared in English and allegedly signed by Garc&#237;a, who speaks only Spanish. The district court rejected Garc&#237;a's argument, explaining that (1) while the affidavit was written in English, it was interpreted into Spanish by the INS officer; (2) the affidavit indicated that Garc&#237;a was advised of his rights; and (3) Garc&#237;a's signature appeared on the affidavit. The district court noted not only that the signature on the affidavit appeared to be the same as the signature on a waiver-of-presence form<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> signed by Garc&#237;a in open court that very day, but also that Garc&#237;a did not challenge the signature and did not proffer that the affidavit had not been interpreted for him in Spanish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the affidavit was introduced through Sassone, who testified that Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File was maintained in the regular course of business. Sassone identified the various documents contained in the Alien Registration File, including the 1999 affidavit, but she admitted that she had no personal knowledge about the events that triggered the preparation of those documents. Garc&#237;a objected to admission of the affidavit on hearsay and lack-of-authentication grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled Garc&#237;a's hearsay objection, finding that the affidavit was an admission of a party opponent. The district court again noted that Garc&#237;a had adopted the statements contained in the affidavit as his own and had offered nothing to challenge the representation that the affidavit was explained in Spanish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also overruled Garc&#237;a's objection to admission of the affidavit on authentication grounds. According to Garc&#237;a, because Sassone had no personal knowledge about Garc&#237;a's 1999 deportation and was not present when the affidavit was created, she could not establish that the document was, in fact, signed by Garc&#237;a. The district court was unpersuaded, having itself seen the obvious similarities in the signature placed on the waiver-of-presence form signed by Garc&#237;a in open court and the multiple signatures found on various documents in Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a now contends that the district court committed reversible error by admitting the affidavit signed by \"Roberto G.\" We find no merit to such contention. Indeed, Garc&#237;a has pointed to nothing in the record that casts doubt upon the district court's findings that (1) the statements contained within the affidavit were translated into Spanish for Garc&#237;a's benefit, (2) Garc&#237;a heard, understood, and acquiesced in those statements, and (3) Garc&#237;a twice signed the affidavit, thereby signaling his adoption of the affidavit as his own. <i>See McQueeney v. Wilmington Trust Co.,</i> 779 F.2d 916, 930 (3d Cir.1985) (holding that a seaman's signature on Sea Service records prepared by others was \"an unequivocal adoption of the contents therein\"). Given these findings, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the affidavit as a non-hearsay admission of alienage by a party opponent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a's authentication argument is equally unavailing. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a), \"[t]he requirement of authentication ... as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" If the trial court determines that there is sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to be, the evidence may be admitted subject to the factfinder's assessing what weight will be given to the evidence. <i>United States v. Alicea-Cardoza,</i> 132 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997). There is no single way, moreover, to authenticate evidence. As this court has recognized on more than one occasion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he direct testimony of a custodian or a percipient witness is not a <i>sine qua non</i> to the authentication of a writing. Thus, a document's appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances, can, in cumulation, even without direct testimony, provide sufficient indicia of reliability to permit a finding that it is authentic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>E.g., United States v. Holmquist,</i> 36 F.3d 154, 167 (1st Cir.1994) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), <i>cert. denied,</i> 514 U.S. 1084, 115 S.Ct. 1797, 131 L.Ed.2d 724 (1995); <i>United States v. Paulino,</i> 13 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, given the absence of any evidence to refute what the affidavit, on its face, revealed, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in admitting the affidavit. The content of the affidavit, the circumstances surrounding its creation, and its location in an Alien Registration File containing not only Garc&#237;a's photograph but also several examples of his signature (a signature that appeared to be the same as the signature placed on the waiver-of-presence form signed by Garc&#237;a in the presence of the district court) all support the district court's decision to admit the affidavit as an authentic document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>1999 Fingerprint Card</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, Garc&#237;a objected to the admission of Government's Exhibit 12, a fingerprint card that was signed \"Roberto G.\" on the front and stamped \"USINS, Pittsburgh, PA\" on the back. Although it was included in Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File, the card was otherwise lacking a date, an Alien Registration Number, and such identifying information as a date of birth, social security number, height, weight, and FBI number. Garc&#237;a objected that the card was untrustworthy because its only authentication was the purported signature of \"Roberto G.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled Garc&#237;a's objection and admitted the fingerprint card, again noting that the signature on the card appeared to be the same as the signature on the affidavit. Indeed, the similarity in signatures was not the only factor supporting the district court's ruling. The fingerprint card was contained in an Alien Registration File that included a photograph of Garc&#237;a. In addition, the stamp appearing on the back of the card, \"USINS, Pittsburgh, PA,\" was consistent with other documents in the file indicating that the Roberto Garc&#237;a whose photograph was in the file had been in INS custody in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after he was encountered, but before he was deported, in 1999. There was thus sufficient evidence before the district court to warrant a reasonable person in believing that Government's Exhibit 12 was what it purported to be: namely, a card containing the fingerprints of Garc&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Warrant of Deportation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Warrant of Deportation, commanding any INS officer to take custody of Roberto Garc&#237;a and to remove him from the United States, was introduced through Sassone. She testified that a Warrant of Deportation, when complete with an alien's photograph and fingerprint, reveals that an INS official witnessed the alien's departure from the United States on a given date. As explained by Sassone, the Warrant of Deportation contained in Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File, complete with photograph and fingerprint, revealed that Roberto Garc&#237;a was actually placed on a plane in Newark, New Jersey, on December 13, 1999, for deportation out of the United States. Sassone further explained that, had Roberto Garc&#237;a been granted permission to re-enter the United States subsequently, such permission would be reflected not only in his Alien Registration File but also in the INS's computer indices. Sassone testified that she found no evidence, either in the Alien Registration File or the agency's computer indices, that permission to re-enter had ever been granted to Roberto Garc&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), Garc&#237;a contends on appeal that the district court violated his confrontation rights by admitting the 1999 Warrant of Deportation when the officer who signed the warrant was not made available for cross-examination. Because Garc&#237;a did not object to the admission of the Warrant of Deportation at trial, we review for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of out-of-court statements that are testimonial in nature unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant concerning the statements. Garc&#237;a argues that the Warrant of Deportation admitted in this case falls within the \"core class\" of testimonial statements described by the Supreme Court in <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least three circuit courts have rejected the very argument being made here by Garc&#237;a. In <i>United States v. Valdez-Maltos,</i> 443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.2006), the Fifth Circuit held that warrants of deportation do not constitute testimonial hearsay under <i>Crawford.</i> The Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have likewise held that defendants have no right to confront and cross-examine the agents who routinely record warrants of deportation because warrants of deportation are \"non-testimonial\" and, therefore, not subject to the confrontation clause. <i>See United States v.

Garc&#237;a now contends that the district court committed plain error by admitting Plumb's opinion testimony regarding the identity of the person in the photograph on the Warrant of Deportation. According to Garc&#237;a, Plumb's testimony was improper because it was based on Plumb's one-time \"scant exposure\" to Garc&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Plumb encountered Garc&#237;a only once, it was not a fleeting encounter. In fact, Plumb encountered Garc&#237;a in Quincy, Massachusetts, transported Garc&#237;a from Quincy to Boston, booked Garc&#237;a into the ICE system, filled in Garc&#237;a's fingerprint card, and served Garc&#237;a with several documents. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Plumb was unable to fully observe Garc&#237;a during the 2002 arrest and booking, that Plumb did not remember Garc&#237;a, or that Plumb had any difficulty in identifying Garc&#237;a, either in person or by photograph. Under the circumstances, we find no plain error in the district court's decision to admit Plumb's identification testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>Plumb's Expert Testimony on Fingerprint Comparison</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting Agent Plumb to testify&#8212;over Garc&#237;a's objection&#8212;as an expert with respect to fingerprint comparison. Garc&#237;a maintains that Plumb's purported expertise was inadequate in that it rested on a mere two days of training. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Plumb testified that his training in fingerprint comparison began with a 16-hour course taught by a representative of the Massachusetts Bureau of Criminal Investigations. Plumb further explained that he received a certification in fingerprint comparison after he completed the 16-hour course, that he conducted more than 80 fingerprint comparisons over the course of the next two years, that his comparisons were sometimes verified by another INS officer or by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that the results of his comparisons had never differed from those of the person verifying his comparisons, and that he had testified as a fingerprint expert in federal court on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court may reverse the district court's decision regarding expert testimony only if the ruling \"was so wide of the mark as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> 321 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v. Valle,</i> 72 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir.1995) (explaining that the trial court has discretion to admit or reject expert testimony and its determination is reviewable only for an abuse of that discretion). Here, there was no abuse of discretion. To be sure, some experts are more qualified than others, and Plumb&#8212;in his capacity as a law enforcement officer&#8212;may not have had the same expertise as someone whose sole occupation is to compare latent prints. Plumb's training and experience were sufficient, however, to permit the district court, in its discretion, to admit Plumb's testimony. It was up to the jury to weigh that testimony, given what the jurors heard on direct and cross-examination about Plumb's training and experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court reviews sufficiency of the evidence claims <i>de novo.

The court must determine \"whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government&#8212;a perspective that requires us to draw every reasonable inference and resolve credibility conflicts in a manner consistent with the verdict&#8212;would permit a rational trier of fact to find each element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Patel,</i> 370 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To convict a defendant of a section 1326 violation, the government must prove that (1) the defendant is an alien; (2) he was arrested and deported; and (3) he thereafter entered, or attempted to enter, the United States without the express consent of the Attorney General of the United States to apply for readmission to the United States since the time of his previous arrest and deportation. <i>United States v. Cabral,</i> 252 F.3d 520, 522-23 (1st Cir. 2001). Here, Garc&#237;a maintains that the government's \"paltry evidence\" was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person who was deported in 1999 was Garc&#237;a. According to Garc&#237;a, the probative value of the government's evidence was \"virtually nil\" for the same reasons that the evidence&#8212;including the affidavit, the Warrant of Deportation, and the identification testimony&#8212;was purportedly inadmissible. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, we find that the evidence adduced at trial&#8212;all properly admissible&#8212;was more than ample to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, all three elements of the section 1326 charge against Garc&#237;a. The signed statement admitting alienage, the Warrant of Deportation&#8212;with photograph and fingerprint&#8212; indicating that Garc&#237;a was seen departing the United States in 1999, Plumb's testimony regarding his 2002 encounter of Garc&#237;a, Plumb's testimony regarding Garc&#237;a's identity, and Sassone's testimony regarding the absence of evidence establishing that Garc&#237;a had permission to re-enter the United States, could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Garc&#237;a was guilty as charged. That the government failed to call any witness who personally saw Garc&#237;a sign the affidavit or depart from the United States does not lead us to think otherwise. <i>See United States v. Melendez-Torres,</i> 420 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (explaining that \"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the [fact finder] deems it should be given\") (quoting <i>United States v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 2002, Seth Plumb (\"Plumb\"), a special agent with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), arrested Garc&#237;a in Quincy, Massachusetts. As an ICE special agent, Plumb was responsible for locating people who entered the United States illegally. Plumb took Garc&#237;a to the ICE Office, where, during the booking process, Garc&#237;a's photograph and fingerprints were taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of his encounter with Garc&#237;a, Plumb reviewed the Alien Registration File of an individual named \"Roberto Garc&#237;a,\" assigned Alien Registration Number 876 586 529. That Alien Registration File contained a number of documents, all with the same Alien Registration Number, revealing that \"Roberto Garc&#237;a\" was a native and citizen of Colombia who had entered the United States illegally and had been deported in 1999 from the United States to his native country. Among other things, the file contained a Warrant for Deportation, dated December 13, 1999, which included a photograph of \"Roberto Garc&#237;a\" along with a print of his right index finger. Trained in fingerprint comparison, Plumb compared the fingerprints obtained from Garc&#237;a during the 2002 booking process with the fingerprint on the 1999 Warrant of Deportation. Plumb concluded that the fingerprints belonged to the same person. Plumb also recognized the man in the photograph as the man he arrested in Quincy, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a was indicted on March 27, 2002, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on one count of illegal re-entry by a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326. He was convicted on November 4, 2003, after a two day trial during which the government called three witnesses: Plumb, Erik Carpenter (\"Carpenter\") (a forensic examiner for the Latent Print Unit of the FBI's Laboratory), and Joanne Sassone (\"Sassone\") (the Records and Information Services Officer for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service of the Department of Homeland Security). On March 17, 2004, Garc&#237;a was sentenced to 30 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, with judgment entered the following day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging his conviction, Garc&#237;a first argues that the district court erred in admitting certain documents and testimony at trial.

Where no objection was made to the admission of evidence at trial, we review evidentiary issues for plain error. <i>Id.</i> To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that an error occurred which was obvious, which affected his substantial rights, and which seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v.

I was born on May 10, 1969 in Colombia and I am a citizen of Colombia. I entered the U.S. from Mexico in 1989 illegally. I did not present myself for inspection because I did not have a Visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The handwritten statement was signed: \"Roberto G.\" The affidavit indicated that, while an interpreter was not used, the affiant appeared before a Spanish-speaking officer of what was then the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (\"INS\"), that the affiant was advised of his <i>Miranda</i> rights in Spanish, and that the affiant willingly made the above sworn statement. Following the signed handwritten statement was a typewritten statement indicating that the \"foregoing statement\" had been read to the affiant, that the answers made therein were true and correct, and that the affidavit was a full, true, and correct record of the affiant's interrogation by the INS officer. The typewritten statement was signed: \"Robert G.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial began, Garc&#237;a moved in limine to exclude the affidavit, arguing that the affidavit was untrustworthy because it was prepared in English and allegedly signed by Garc&#237;a, who speaks only Spanish. The district court rejected Garc&#237;a's argument, explaining that (1) while the affidavit was written in English, it was interpreted into Spanish by the INS officer; (2) the affidavit indicated that Garc&#237;a was advised of his rights; and (3) Garc&#237;a's signature appeared on the affidavit. The district court noted not only that the signature on the affidavit appeared to be the same as the signature on a waiver-of-presence form<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> signed by Garc&#237;a in open court that very day, but also that Garc&#237;a did not challenge the signature and did not proffer that the affidavit had not been interpreted for him in Spanish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the affidavit was introduced through Sassone, who testified that Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File was maintained in the regular course of business. Sassone identified the various documents contained in the Alien Registration File, including the 1999 affidavit, but she admitted that she had no personal knowledge about the events that triggered the preparation of those documents. Garc&#237;a objected to admission of the affidavit on hearsay and lack-of-authentication grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled Garc&#237;a's hearsay objection, finding that the affidavit was an admission of a party opponent. The district court again noted that Garc&#237;a had adopted the statements contained in the affidavit as his own and had offered nothing to challenge the representation that the affidavit was explained in Spanish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also overruled Garc&#237;a's objection to admission of the affidavit on authentication grounds. According to Garc&#237;a, because Sassone had no personal knowledge about Garc&#237;a's 1999 deportation and was not present when the affidavit was created, she could not establish that the document was, in fact, signed by Garc&#237;a. The district court was unpersuaded, having itself seen the obvious similarities in the signature placed on the waiver-of-presence form signed by Garc&#237;a in open court and the multiple signatures found on various documents in Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a now contends that the district court committed reversible error by admitting the affidavit signed by \"Roberto G.\" We find no merit to such contention. Indeed, Garc&#237;a has pointed to nothing in the record that casts doubt upon the district court's findings that (1) the statements contained within the affidavit were translated into Spanish for Garc&#237;a's benefit, (2) Garc&#237;a heard, understood, and acquiesced in those statements, and (3) Garc&#237;a twice signed the affidavit, thereby signaling his adoption of the affidavit as his own. <i>See McQueeney v.

Given these findings, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the affidavit as a non-hearsay admission of alienage by a party opponent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a's authentication argument is equally unavailing. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a), \"[t]he requirement of authentication ... as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" If the trial court determines that there is sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to be, the evidence may be admitted subject to the factfinder's assessing what weight will be given to the evidence. <i>United States v.

The content of the affidavit, the circumstances surrounding its creation, and its location in an Alien Registration File containing not only Garc&#237;a's photograph but also several examples of his signature (a signature that appeared to be the same as the signature placed on the waiver-of-presence form signed by Garc&#237;a in the presence of the district court) all support the district court's decision to admit the affidavit as an authentic document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>1999 Fingerprint Card</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, Garc&#237;a objected to the admission of Government's Exhibit 12, a fingerprint card that was signed \"Roberto G.\" on the front and stamped \"USINS, Pittsburgh, PA\" on the back. Although it was included in Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File, the card was otherwise lacking a date, an Alien Registration Number, and such identifying information as a date of birth, social security number, height, weight, and FBI number. Garc&#237;a objected that the card was untrustworthy because its only authentication was the purported signature of \"Roberto G.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled Garc&#237;a's objection and admitted the fingerprint card, again noting that the signature on the card appeared to be the same as the signature on the affidavit. Indeed, the similarity in signatures was not the only factor supporting the district court's ruling. The fingerprint card was contained in an Alien Registration File that included a photograph of Garc&#237;a. In addition, the stamp appearing on the back of the card, \"USINS, Pittsburgh, PA,\" was consistent with other documents in the file indicating that the Roberto Garc&#237;a whose photograph was in the file had been in INS custody in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after he was encountered, but before he was deported, in 1999. There was thus sufficient evidence before the district court to warrant a reasonable person in believing that Government's Exhibit 12 was what it purported to be: namely, a card containing the fingerprints of Garc&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Warrant of Deportation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Warrant of Deportation, commanding any INS officer to take custody of Roberto Garc&#237;a and to remove him from the United States, was introduced through Sassone. She testified that a Warrant of Deportation, when complete with an alien's photograph and fingerprint, reveals that an INS official witnessed the alien's departure from the United States on a given date. As explained by Sassone, the Warrant of Deportation contained in Roberto Garc&#237;a's Alien Registration File, complete with photograph and fingerprint, revealed that Roberto Garc&#237;a was actually placed on a plane in Newark, New Jersey, on December 13, 1999, for deportation out of the United States. Sassone further explained that, had Roberto Garc&#237;a been granted permission to re-enter the United States subsequently, such permission would be reflected not only in his Alien Registration File but also in the INS's computer indices. Sassone testified that she found no evidence, either in the Alien Registration File or the agency's computer indices, that permission to re-enter had ever been granted to Roberto Garc&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>Crawford v.

Garc&#237;a now contends that the district court committed plain error by admitting Plumb's opinion testimony regarding the identity of the person in the photograph on the Warrant of Deportation. According to Garc&#237;a, Plumb's testimony was improper because it was based on Plumb's one-time \"scant exposure\" to Garc&#237;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Plumb encountered Garc&#237;a only once, it was not a fleeting encounter. In fact, Plumb encountered Garc&#237;a in Quincy, Massachusetts, transported Garc&#237;a from Quincy to Boston, booked Garc&#237;a into the ICE system, filled in Garc&#237;a's fingerprint card, and served Garc&#237;a with several documents. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Plumb was unable to fully observe Garc&#237;a during the 2002 arrest and booking, that Plumb did not remember Garc&#237;a, or that Plumb had any difficulty in identifying Garc&#237;a, either in person or by photograph. Under the circumstances, we find no plain error in the district court's decision to admit Plumb's identification testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>Plumb's Expert Testimony on Fingerprint Comparison</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garc&#237;a contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting Agent Plumb to testify&#8212;over Garc&#237;a's objection&#8212;as an expert with respect to fingerprint comparison. Garc&#237;a maintains that Plumb's purported expertise was inadequate in that it rested on a mere two days of training. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Plumb testified that his training in fingerprint comparison began with a 16-hour course taught by a representative of the Massachusetts Bureau of Criminal Investigations. Plumb further explained that he received a certification in fingerprint comparison after he completed the 16-hour course, that he conducted more than 80 fingerprint comparisons over the course of the next two years, that his comparisons were sometimes verified by another INS officer or by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that the results of his comparisons had never differed from those of the person verifying his comparisons, and that he had testified as a fingerprint expert in federal court on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court may reverse the district court's decision regarding expert testimony only if the ruling \"was so wide of the mark as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200359\"><a href=\"/opinion/200359/macaulay-v-anas/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v.

Here, there was no abuse of discretion. To be sure, some experts are more qualified than others, and Plumb&#8212;in his capacity as a law enforcement officer&#8212;may not have had the same expertise as someone whose sole occupation is to compare latent prints. Plumb's training and experience were sufficient, however, to permit the district court, in its discretion, to admit Plumb's testimony. It was up to the jury to weigh that testimony, given what the jurors heard on direct and cross-examination about Plumb's training and experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court reviews sufficiency of the evidence claims <i>de novo.

The court must determine \"whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government&#8212;a perspective that requires us to draw every reasonable inference and resolve credibility conflicts in a manner consistent with the verdict&#8212;would permit a rational trier of fact to find each element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v.

Here, Garc&#237;a maintains that the government's \"paltry evidence\" was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person who was deported in 1999 was Garc&#237;a. According to Garc&#237;a, the probative value of the government's evidence was \"virtually nil\" for the same reasons that the evidence&#8212;including the affidavit, the Warrant of Deportation, and the identification testimony&#8212;was purportedly inadmissible. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, we find that the evidence adduced at trial&#8212;all properly admissible&#8212;was more than ample to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, all three elements of the section 1326 charge against Garc&#237;a. The signed statement admitting alienage, the Warrant of Deportation&#8212;with photograph and fingerprint&#8212; indicating that Garc&#237;a was seen departing the United States in 1999, Plumb's testimony regarding his 2002 encounter of Garc&#237;a, Plumb's testimony regarding Garc&#237;a's identity, and Sassone's testimony regarding the absence of evidence establishing that Garc&#237;a had permission to re-enter the United States, could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Garc&#237;a was guilty as charged. That the government failed to call any witness who personally saw Garc&#237;a sign the affidavit or depart from the United States does not lead us to think otherwise. <i>See United States v.
