Defendant-appellant Ramón Pineda appeals the\n\ndistrict court's acceptance of his guilty plea at his Rule 11\n\nhearing, and the denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his\n\nprior deportation.           After careful review of the briefs and record\n\nin this case, we affirm.\n\n                                   I.   The Facts\n\n              The district court found the pertinent facts to be as\n\nfollows.       Pineda, a citizen of El Salvador, immigrated to the\n\nUnited States in 1980.           In 1989, he married an American citizen and\n\ntook steps to regularize his immigration status.                      His residency\n\nstatus was revoked in 1992 because his then-estranged wife failed\n\nto attend an Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") marital\n\ninterview.       On November 5, 1993, the INS served Pineda with an\n\nOrder    to    Show     Cause.      The    ensuing     deportation      proceedings\n\nculminated on July 22, 1994, when an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found\n\nPineda deportable and ineligible for discretionary relief under\n\n§   212(c).       The   IJ    granted     Pineda   a   forty-five     day   stay   of\n\ndeportation to permit him to file an asylum claim.                    This stay was\n\nextended twice, but Pineda never filed an asylum claim.\n\n              In September 1994, after the expiration of the initial\n\nforty-five day stay, Pineda was incarcerated on a state rape\n\ncharge.       On March 2, 1995, the IJ ruled that Pineda's failure to\n\nfile    the    asylum    claim    constituted      a   waiver   and    abandonment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fConsequently, he ordered Pineda deported and, on June 17, 1996,\n\nPineda was deported to El Salvador.\n\n            Pineda    re-entered    the    United     States     illegally   in\n\nSeptember of 1996 and was arrested on another state charge in 1997.\n\nWhile in state custody, Pineda was indicted for one count of\n\nunlawful reentry to the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326.     On August 2, 2000, Pineda filed a motion to suppress\n\nevidence of his prior deportation on due process grounds.                 While\n\nthe suppression motion was pending, the indictment was superseded\n\nby   one   charging    illegal   entry    by   an   aggravated    felon   after\n\ndeportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.\n\n            On January 9, 2001, the district court denied Pineda's\n\nmotion to suppress evidence of his prior deportation.               First, the\n\ndistrict court held that although Pineda was not orally advised of\n\nhis right to appeal the deportation order at the March 2, 1995\n\nhearing, the fact that he received written notice of that right\n\nsatisfied the requirements of both INS regulations and due process\n\nin this case.        The district court rejected the claim that oral\n\ncolloquy regarding appeal rights is mandatory, holding that such\n\ninquiry is only required when \"the IJ is seeking to extract a\n\nwaiver of an alien's right of appeal,\" which did not occur in the\n\npresent case.\n\n            Second, the district court held that although Pineda was\n\nnever advised -- pursuant to Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fConsular Relations, April 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261,\n\n1967 WL 18349 (ratified November 24, 1969) (\"Vienna Convention\") --\n\nof the right of an arrested alien to contact consular officials\n\nfrom his native country, such a failure does not constitute grounds\n\nfor suppression because \"there is no general exclusionary rule for\n\ninternational law violations,\" and because the Vienna Convention\n\nprovides no specific judicial remedy for a violation and confers no\n\nprivate right of action for redress of a violation.                    Cf. United\n\nStates v. Li, 206 F.3d 56 (2000) (en banc).\n\n           Third,     the    district      court    found     that,   contrary   to\n\nPineda's claim, Pineda was not deported in absentia.                       Pineda\n\nreceived a deportation hearing on July 22, 1994, at which he was\n\nwarned that     unless      he   filed   an    asylum   application     within   an\n\nallotted period of time, the IJ would issue a deportation order\n\nwithout further hearing.          Thus, the district court concluded that\n\nwhen the IJ issued the deportation order on March 2, 1995, the IJ\n\nsimply \"did what he told Pineda that he would do\" and lawfully\n\nissued the final order in accordance with INS regulations.                 Having\n\nfound no fundamental flaw in the deportation proceedings, the\n\ndistrict court denied the motion to suppress.\n\n           On April 17, 2001, Pineda, pursuant to a plea agreement,\n\nentered a conditional plea of guilty to the charge of illegal\n\nreentry by an aggravated felon after deportation. Pursuant to Rule\n\n11(a)(2)   of   the   Federal      Rules      of   Criminal   Procedure,   Pineda\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\freserved his right to appeal the district court's denial of the\n\nmotion to suppress.        Following the plea colloquy, the district\n\ncourt found that the defendant understood the nature of the charge\n\nand that his plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.                  On\n\nAugust   21,   2001,    Pineda   was   sentenced    to   seventy   months   of\n\nimprisonment, two years of supervised relief, and a $100.00 special\n\nassessment, but he was not fined.\n\n                           II.   The Guilty Plea\n\n           We review the acceptance of the guilty plea for plain\n\nerror because Pineda did not seek to withdraw his plea in the\n\ndistrict court.    See United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 122 S. Ct.\n\n1043, 1046 (2002); United States v. Gandía-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).       We consider the totality of the circumstances to\n\ndetermine whether such plain error exists and to determine whether\n\nthe guilty plea is voluntary, intelligent, and knowing within the\n\nframework of Rule 11.      United States v. Hernández-Wilson, 186 F.3d\n\n1, 12 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 3\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           In order to be acceptable, a guilty plea must be found to\n\ncomport with the three core concerns of Rule 11: (1) the absence of\n\ncoercion; (2) the defendant's understanding of the nature of the\n\ncharges against him; and (3) the defendant's understanding of the\n\nconsequences of his guilty plea.             United States v. Isom, 85 F.3d\n\n831, 835 (1st Cir. 1996); Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           The thrust of Pineda's argument is that the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy was inadequate as evidenced by Pineda's ambivalent answers\n\nand questions to the judge.    After careful consideration of the\n\narguments presented by the parties in their briefs and at oral\n\nargument and review of the record, we find that each of the three\n\ncore Rule 11 concerns have been met and affirm the district court's\n\nacceptance of the guilty plea as voluntary, intelligent, and\n\nknowing.   We briefly address each of the Rule 11 concerns.\n\n           First, the district court properly found an absence of\n\ncoercion because Pineda ultimately responded unequivocally that he\n\nhad not been coerced, and further because Pineda's responses\n\nprovided no grounds for believing his guilty plea was indeed\n\ncoerced.\n\n           Second, the district court correctly found that Pineda\n\nunderstood the charges against him.   We agree with the government\n\nthat the source of any seeming confusion on Pineda's part arose\n\nfrom the fact that Pineda wanted to properly preserve his right to\n\nappeal the ruling on the motion to suppress because he believed his\n\ndeportation proceeding violated due process.    Pineda nonetheless\n\nunderstood the charges against him and ultimately admitted that he\n\nhad committed the offense conduct described by the government. See\n\nCotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 6 (holding that when the government sets\n\nforth the elements of the offense and the defendant's conduct, a\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fdefendant's admission that the allegations are true suffices to\n\nshow he understands the charges).\n\n            Finally, the district court correctly found that Pineda\n\nunderstood the consequences of his guilty plea.             In response to\n\nPineda's questions, the court thoroughly explained the consequences\n\nof pleading guilty.        Once again, Pineda's main concern was his\n\nability to appeal the deportation issue, which the court explained\n\nto him would be possible.\n\n\n\n                     III.    The Motion to Suppress\n\n            The   motion    to   suppress   evidence   of   Pineda's   prior\n\ndeportation presents a mixed question of law and fact, and the\n\nultimate determination of constitutionality is subject to de novo\n\nreview. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996); United\n\nStates v. Goldman, 41 F.3d 785, 787 (1st Cir. 1994).           Any related\n\nfindings of fact, however, are subject to clear error review.\n\nUnited States v. Martínez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 726 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            Pineda argues that his prior deportation is fundamentally\n\nflawed because he was: (1) not properly notified of his right to\n\nappeal; (2) improperly deported in absentia; and (3) not notified\n\nof his right to contact the consulate of his home country of El\n\nSalvador.    After careful consideration of the arguments presented\n\nand review of the record, we agree with the reasoning presented in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe district court's memorandum and affirm the denial of the motion\n\nto suppress.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

United States v. Isom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196807\"><a href=\"/opinion/196807/united-states-v-isom/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835 (1st Cir. 1996); Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           The thrust of Pineda's argument is that the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy was inadequate as evidenced by Pineda's ambivalent answers\n\nand questions to the judge.    After careful consideration of the\n\narguments presented by the parties in their briefs and at oral\n\nargument and review of the record, we find that each of the three\n\ncore Rule 11 concerns have been met and affirm the district court's\n\nacceptance of the guilty plea as voluntary, intelligent, and\n\nknowing.   We briefly address each of the Rule 11 concerns.\n\n           First, the district court properly found an absence of\n\ncoercion because Pineda ultimately responded unequivocally that he\n\nhad not been coerced, and further because Pineda's responses\n\nprovided no grounds for believing his guilty plea was indeed\n\ncoerced.\n\n           Second, the district court correctly found that Pineda\n\nunderstood the charges against him.   We agree with the government\n\nthat the source of any seeming confusion on Pineda's part arose\n\nfrom the fact that Pineda wanted to properly preserve his right to\n\nappeal the ruling on the motion to suppress because he believed his\n\ndeportation proceeding violated due process.    Pineda nonetheless\n\nunderstood the charges against him and ultimately admitted that he\n\nhad committed the offense conduct described by the government. See\n\nCotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 6 (holding that when the government sets\n\nforth the elements of the offense and the defendant's conduct, a\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fdefendant's admission that the allegations are true suffices to\n\nshow he understands the charges).\n\n            Finally, the district court correctly found that Pineda\n\nunderstood the consequences of his guilty plea.             In response to\n\nPineda's questions, the court thoroughly explained the consequences\n\nof pleading guilty.        Once again, Pineda's main concern was his\n\nability to appeal the deportation issue, which the court explained\n\nto him would be possible.\n\n\n\n                     III.    The Motion to Suppress\n\n            The   motion    to   suppress   evidence   of   Pineda's   prior\n\ndeportation presents a mixed question of law and fact, and the\n\nultimate determination of constitutionality is subject to de novo\n\nreview.
