Plaintiffs Esther Dávila-Rivera,\n\nRafael Velez-Rivera, and the Conjugal Partnership Velez-Davila\n\n(collectively, “Dávila”) appeal the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to Defendants Caribbean Refrescos, Inc. (“CRI”),\n\nand ABC Insurance Company on her claim under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12182 et seq.              In\n\naddition, Dávila appeals the district court’s decisions to strike\n\nher response to CRI’s motion for summary judgment and to dismiss\n\nwithout prejudice her Commonwealth law claims.              For the reasons\n\ndiscussed hereafter, the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nis AFFIRMED.\n\n                            I.     BACKGROUND\n\n     Dávila was employed by CRI from 1974 until 2002, most recently\n\nas an Administrative Assistant II in the Finance Department.             In\n\n2000, she underwent corrective therapies for carpal tunnel syndrome\n\n(“CTS”).   In   June   of   that    year,   Dávila   told    her   immediate\n\nsupervisor, José Martínez, that she needed to have corrective\n\nsurgery for her CTS.    At that time, Martinez did not express any\n\nobjection to the forthcoming surgery; however, he instructed her to\n\ninform him of the date in advance.        This surgery was ultimately set\n\nfor December 14, 2000, and Dávila informed Martínez of the date\n\nthrough a vacation request made in December.            This request was\n\napproved, although she alleges that he balked at granting the\n\nrequest and initially ordered her to change the date of her\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fsurgery.\n\n     Dávila completed the rehabilitation treatment on January 18,\n\n2001, and her doctor, Dr. Angel Pérez Toro, stated that she could\n\nreturn to work on January 22, 2001.      Dr. Pérez Toro completed a\n\nmedical questionnaire on functional capacity for CRI, asserting\n\nthat Dávila could perform both fine and heavy hand manipulation and\n\nthat she could lift, push, or haul up to five pounds.    When Dávila\n\nreturned to work, she also was evaluated by a CRI physician, Dr.\n\nCarlos A. Canales Quintero, who concluded that Dávila could lift up\n\nto ten pounds.   The weight restriction therefore was relaxed from\n\nfive pounds to ten pounds.\n\n     Upon her return, Martínez assigned Dávila to digitally scan\n\ndocuments.   Although she asserts that she told him that the work\n\nwas repetitive and would affect her CTS, she was not reassigned.\n\nTwo days later, Daisy Meléndez, a CRI company nurse, noted that\n\nDávila’s right hand was swollen.      Dr. Canales recommended a hand\n\nbrace, and, in a follow-up visit, noted the swelling had gone away.\n\n     Dávila contends that working conditions at CRI caused her to\n\nsuffer from depression.   On February 27, 2001, CRI referred her to\n\nthe State Insurance Fund to receive medical treatment for her\n\ndepression and other emotional conditions.       She was placed on\n\nshort-term disability leave with a one-year reserve period. Dávila\n\nalso requested long-term disability leave benefits from NATLSCO,\n\nthe company managing CRI’s disability plan.        This request was\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fdenied in November 2001. On February 27, 2002, CRI notified Dávila\n\nthat    her   reserve   period   had    ended     and,   therefore,    that   her\n\nemployment had been terminated.\n\n       In October 2002, Dávila filed a complaint in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for Puerto Rico alleging, inter alia, that CRI\n\nterminated her employment and failed to reasonably accommodate her\n\nCTS and emotional depression conditions in violation of the ADA.\n\nCRI moved for summary judgment in October 2003.             In December 2003,\n\nDávila filed her opposition to this motion (“First Opposition”).\n\nThe First Opposition was accompanied by a 43-page brief that\n\nexceeded the 25-page limit established by Local Rule 7.1(e) and the\n\ndistrict court’s order.          When CRI moved to strike, the court\n\ngranted Dávila “the opportunity to re-file [the Opposition], after\n\npruning it into a twenty five page document.”             Dávila subsequently\n\nfiled    a    revised   opposition     (“Second    Opposition”),      which   was\n\nslightly less than 25 full pages.         CRI again moved to strike on the\n\nground that this Second Opposition violated Local Rule 7.1(e). The\n\nmagistrate judge compared the First and Second Oppositions and\n\nrecommended that the Second Opposition be stricken and CRI’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment be treated as unopposed.             This recommendation\n\nwas adopted by the district court. The magistrate judge noted that\n\nthe two documents were textually virtually identical, with the only\n\nchanges being the removal of footnotes and several paragraphs. She\n\ndetermined, in part from this textual analysis, that Dávila’s\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fSecond Opposition was printed in a font smaller than allowed by\n\nRule 7.1(e).\n\n     In August 2004, the district court granted CRI’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, dismissing with prejudice Dávila’s ADA claim and\n\nher other federal claims. In addition, the court dismissed without\n\nprejudice her Commonwealth law claims. Dávila appeals the district\n\ncourt’s decision to strike the Second Opposition, its grant of\n\nsummary judgment to CRI on her ADA claim, and its dismissal of the\n\nCommonwealth law claims.\n\n                               II.    DISCUSSION\n\nLocal Rule Violation\n\n     While this court reviews deferentially a district court’s\n\nrefusal to forgive a local rule violation, see Crowley v. L.L.\n\nBean, Inc., 361 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal citation\n\nomitted), we need not rule on this matter because even taking into\n\naccount   the   evidentiary     materials       highlighted   in   the   Second\n\nOpposition, Dávila’s claims fail.1\n\nSummary Judgment\n\n     We   review   de   novo    a    district    court’s   entry   of    summary\n\njudgment, viewing the entire record in the light most favorable to\n\nthe party opposing summary judgment.            See Dávila-Pérez v. Lockheed\n\nMartin Corp., 202 F.3d 464, 466 (1st Cir. 2000).              All reasonable\n\n     1\n      In all events, Dávila conceded at oral argument that she was\nnot prejudiced by the district court’s decision to strike her\nSecond Opposition.\n\n                                       -5-\n\finferences are made in favor of the non-moving party.           Id.   Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only if “there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact” and “the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.”     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n      Dávila appeals the grant of summary judgment only as to her\n\nADA   claims.      Because   the   district   court   ordered   the    Second\n\nOpposition stricken from the record, CRI’s motion for summary\n\njudgment was unopposed.        However, the district court is “still\n\nobliged to consider the motion on its merits, in light of the\n\nrecord as constituted, in order to determine whether judgment would\n\nbe legally appropriate.” Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 358\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n      “The   ADA   prohibits   discrimination    in   employment      against\n\nqualified persons with a disability.”         Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294\n\nF.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing 42 U.S.C. §12112(a)).             Three\n\nalternative definitions of “disability” are provided: an individual\n\nis considered to be disabled if (1) she has “a physical or mental\n\nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of [her] major\n\nlife activities,” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); (2) she has “a record of\n\nsuch an impairment,” id. § 12102(2)(B); or (3) she is “regarded as\n\nhaving such an impairment,” id. § 12102(2)(C).\n\n      “Major life activities” are “activities that are ‘of central\n\nimportance to daily life.’”         Carroll, 294 F.3d at 238 (quoting\n\nToyota Motor Mfg. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002)).                 The\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcourts have recognized various “major life activities,” including\n\nthe performance of manual tasks, Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at\n\n198; lifting, Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2002); and sleeping, Calero-Cerezo v. DOJ, 355 F.3d 6,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 442-\n\n43 (1st Cir. 1998)).         In addition, the Supreme Court and this court\n\nhave assumed, without deciding, that working may be considered a\n\nmajor life activity.          See id. (citing Sutton v. United Airlines,\n\nInc.,   527    U.S.   471,     492   (1999)).      We    also   have   noted    that\n\nconcentrating     “may    be    reasonably      subsumed   within      the   broader\n\ncontext   of    working        and   learning.”         Whitney   v.    Greenberg,\n\nRosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, 258 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n     Dávila must show that her impairment substantially limits a\n\nmajor life activity.         Therefore, she must demonstrate either that\n\nshe is unable to perform a major life activity that an average\n\nperson in the general population can perform or that she is\n\nsignificantly restricted in the performance of a particular major\n\nlife activity as compared to an average person in the general\n\npopulation.     See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1).              “To be substantially\n\nlimiting, ‘[t]he impairment’s impact must . . . be permanent or\n\nlong-term.’”     Carroll, 294 F.3d at 238 (quoting Toyota Motor Mfg.,\n\n534 U.S. at 198).\n\n     Dávila bears the burden of showing that she has a qualified\n\ndisability.     See Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 20.                She claims two\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fimpairments, CTS and severe depression. CTS has been recognized as\n\na physical impairment. See, e.g., Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. 199.\n\nIn addition, “[t]his circuit has recognized depression as a mental\n\nimpairment that may constitute, at least in some circumstances, a\n\ndisability under federal law.”            Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 20.\n\n     In   her    Amended      Complaint,    Dávila   asserted      that    her CTS\n\n“limited her writing and computer activities.”                    She asserts on\n\nappeal    that   her    CTS    impaired    her    major    life   activities    of\n\nperforming manual tasks and lifting.              Although she points to the\n\nJanuary 2001 lifting restriction imposed by Dr. Pérez Toro and\n\nmodified by Dr. Canales, this restriction is insufficient to\n\ndemonstrate a substantial limitation, as it was in effect only from\n\nJanuary    22,   2001    to    February     12,    2001,    for    three    weeks.\n\nFurthermore, the same form indicated that, at that time, she was\n\nable to engage in fine and thick hand manipulation.                 Thus, Dávila\n\nhas failed to demonstrate that she was substantially limited in the\n\nperformance of manual tasks or lifting.\n\n     In her Amended Complaint, Dávila asserted that her depression\n\nprevented her from working.               She asserts on appeal that her\n\ndepression additionally impaired her major life activities of\n\nsleeping and concentrating.         First, we note that she has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that her depression substantially limited the major\n\nlife activity of working.          The Supreme Court has observed that\n\n“[w]hen the major life activity under consideration is that of\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fworking, the statutory phrase ‘substantially limits’ requires . .\n\n. that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class\n\nof jobs.”    Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 200 (quoting Sutton, 527\n\nU.S. at 491).     Dávila has failed to make such an offering.                In\n\naddition, she alleges, but has failed to demonstrate, that her\n\ndepression    substantially     limited     her     ability   to     sleep   or\n\nconcentrate. No evidence was introduced that would demonstrate she\n\nwas substantially restricted or that the limitations were permanent\n\nor long-term.\n\n     As a result, Dávila’s ADA claim fails.           She has not produced\n\nsufficient    evidence   to   demonstrate    that    she   had   a   qualified\n\ndisability.     Consequently, we need not address the remaining\n\ngrounds upon which the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nwas based.    See Carroll, 294 F.3d at 238.\n\nSupplemental Jurisdiction\n\n     This court reviews a district court’s refusal to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion.                   Pejepscot\n\nIndus. Park, Inc. v. Maine Cent. R. Co., 215 F.3d 195, 200 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     Jurisdiction in this case is based upon Dávila’s\n\nfederal claims; she therefore requested that the district court\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the non-federal claims.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).        Supplemental jurisdiction exists when\n\n“the relationship between [the federal] claim and the state claim\n\npermits the conclusion that the entire action before the court\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fcomprises but one constitutional ‘case.’”              Rodriguez v. Doral\n\nMortg. Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1175 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United\n\nMine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966)).\n\n      When the foundational federal question claims are dismissed,\n\nthe   district    court   may   reassess   its    jurisdiction       over   the\n\nsupplemental claims.      See 28 U.S.C.    § 1367(c)(3); see also Roche\n\nv. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 256-57 (1st\n\nCir.1996).     Ordinarily this assessment will “weigh strongly in\n\nfavor of declining jurisdiction over state law claims where the\n\nfoundational federal claims have been dismissed at an early stage\n\nin the litigation.” Camelio v. American Fed’n, 137 F.3d 666, 672\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).      Original jurisdiction in this case rested upon\n\nthe ADA and other federal claims. Thus, because the district court\n\nproperly    granted   summary   judgment   on    the   ADA   claim    and   the\n\ndismissal of the other federal claims has not been appealed, we\n\nfind that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndeclining    supplemental   jurisdiction    over   the   Commonwealth       law\n\nclaims.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Dr. Canales recommended a hand\n\nbrace, and, in a follow-up visit, noted the swelling had gone away.\n\n     Dávila contends that working conditions at CRI caused her to\n\nsuffer from depression.   On February 27, 2001, CRI referred her to\n\nthe State Insurance Fund to receive medical treatment for her\n\ndepression and other emotional conditions.       She was placed on\n\nshort-term disability leave with a one-year reserve period. Dávila\n\nalso requested long-term disability leave benefits from NATLSCO,\n\nthe company managing CRI’s disability plan.        This request was\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fdenied in November 2001. On February 27, 2002, CRI notified Dávila\n\nthat    her   reserve   period   had    ended     and,   therefore,    that   her\n\nemployment had been terminated.\n\n       In October 2002, Dávila filed a complaint in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for Puerto Rico alleging, inter alia, that CRI\n\nterminated her employment and failed to reasonably accommodate her\n\nCTS and emotional depression conditions in violation of the ADA.\n\nCRI moved for summary judgment in October 2003.             In December 2003,\n\nDávila filed her opposition to this motion (“First Opposition”).\n\nThe First Opposition was accompanied by a 43-page brief that\n\nexceeded the 25-page limit established by Local Rule 7.1(e) and the\n\ndistrict court’s order.          When CRI moved to strike, the court\n\ngranted Dávila “the opportunity to re-file [the Opposition], after\n\npruning it into a twenty five page document.”             Dávila subsequently\n\nfiled    a    revised   opposition     (“Second    Opposition”),      which   was\n\nslightly less than 25 full pages.         CRI again moved to strike on the\n\nground that this Second Opposition violated Local Rule 7.1(e). The\n\nmagistrate judge compared the First and Second Oppositions and\n\nrecommended that the Second Opposition be stricken and CRI’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment be treated as unopposed.             This recommendation\n\nwas adopted by the district court. The magistrate judge noted that\n\nthe two documents were textually virtually identical, with the only\n\nchanges being the removal of footnotes and several paragraphs. She\n\ndetermined, in part from this textual analysis, that Dávila’s\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fSecond Opposition was printed in a font smaller than allowed by\n\nRule 7.1(e).\n\n     In August 2004, the district court granted CRI’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, dismissing with prejudice Dávila’s ADA claim and\n\nher other federal claims. In addition, the court dismissed without\n\nprejudice her Commonwealth law claims. Dávila appeals the district\n\ncourt’s decision to strike the Second Opposition, its grant of\n\nsummary judgment to CRI on her ADA claim, and its dismissal of the\n\nCommonwealth law claims.\n\n                               II.

Because   the   district   court   ordered   the    Second\n\nOpposition stricken from the record, CRI’s motion for summary\n\njudgment was unopposed.

Therefore, she must demonstrate either that\n\nshe is unable to perform a major life activity that an average\n\nperson in the general population can perform or that she is\n\nsignificantly restricted in the performance of a particular major\n\nlife activity as compared to an average person in the general\n\npopulation.     See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1).              “To be substantially\n\nlimiting, ‘[t]he impairment’s impact must . . . be permanent or\n\nlong-term.’”     Carroll, 294 F.3d at 238 (quoting Toyota Motor Mfg.,\n\n534 U.S. at 198).\n\n     Dávila bears the burden of showing that she has a qualified\n\ndisability.     See Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 20.                She claims two\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fimpairments, CTS and severe depression. CTS has been recognized as\n\na physical impairment. See, e.g., Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. 199.\n\nIn addition, “[t]his circuit has recognized depression as a mental\n\nimpairment that may constitute, at least in some circumstances, a\n\ndisability under federal law.”            Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 20.\n\n     In   her    Amended      Complaint,    Dávila   asserted      that    her CTS\n\n“limited her writing and computer activities.”                    She asserts on\n\nappeal    that   her    CTS    impaired    her    major    life   activities    of\n\nperforming manual tasks and lifting.              Although she points to the\n\nJanuary 2001 lifting restriction imposed by Dr. Pérez Toro and\n\nmodified by Dr. Canales, this restriction is insufficient to\n\ndemonstrate a substantial limitation, as it was in effect only from\n\nJanuary    22,   2001    to    February     12,    2001,    for    three    weeks.\n\nFurthermore, the same form indicated that, at that time, she was\n\nable to engage in fine and thick hand manipulation.                 Thus, Dávila\n\nhas failed to demonstrate that she was substantially limited in the\n\nperformance of manual tasks or lifting.\n\n     In her Amended Complaint, Dávila asserted that her depression\n\nprevented her from working.               She asserts on appeal that her\n\ndepression additionally impaired her major life activities of\n\nsleeping and concentrating.         First, we note that she has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that her depression substantially limited the major\n\nlife activity of working.          The Supreme Court has observed that\n\n“[w]hen the major life activity under consideration is that of\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fworking, the statutory phrase ‘substantially limits’ requires . .\n\n. that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class\n\nof jobs.”    Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 200 (quoting Sutton, 527\n\nU.S. at 491).     Dávila has failed to make such an offering.                In\n\naddition, she alleges, but has failed to demonstrate, that her\n\ndepression    substantially     limited     her     ability   to     sleep   or\n\nconcentrate. No evidence was introduced that would demonstrate she\n\nwas substantially restricted or that the limitations were permanent\n\nor long-term.\n\n     As a result, Dávila’s ADA claim fails.           She has not produced\n\nsufficient    evidence   to   demonstrate    that    she   had   a   qualified\n\ndisability.     Consequently, we need not address the remaining\n\ngrounds upon which the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nwas based.    See Carroll, 294 F.3d at 238.\n\nSupplemental Jurisdiction\n\n     This court reviews a district court’s refusal to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion.

Jurisdiction in this case is based upon Dávila’s\n\nfederal claims; she therefore requested that the district court\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over the non-federal claims.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).        Supplemental jurisdiction exists when\n\n“the relationship between [the federal] claim and the state claim\n\npermits the conclusion that the entire action before the court\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fcomprises but one constitutional ‘case.’”              Rodriguez v.

Original jurisdiction in this case rested upon\n\nthe ADA and other federal claims. Thus, because the district court\n\nproperly    granted   summary   judgment   on    the   ADA   claim    and   the\n\ndismissal of the other federal claims has not been appealed, we\n\nfind that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndeclining    supplemental   jurisdiction    over   the   Commonwealth       law\n\nclaims.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f</pre>",
