F. Dennis Saylor IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Howard, Selya and Thompson,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Charles A.

This bankruptcy appeal stands at\n\nthe intersection of state and federal law.               The issue presented\n\nconcerns the interplay between a state statute placing temporal\n\nlimitations on the enforcement of stale mortgages and the automatic\n\nstay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court ruled\n\nthat the mortgagee's unqualified right to extend the limitations\n\nperiod by performing an essentially ministerial act (recording of\n\nan extension) rendered the tolling provision associated with the\n\nautomatic stay inapposite and the mortgage obsolete.                       Shamus\n\nHoldings, LLC v. LBM Fin., LLC (In re Shamus Holdings, LLC), 409\n\nB.R. 598, 606 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2009).              At the first level of\n\nappellate    review,   the   district      court   saw    the    matter     quite\n\ndifferently; it ruled that the mortgage remained in force for the\n\nduration of the automatic stay.       LBM Fin. LLC v. Shamus Holdings,\n\nInc., No. 1:09-cv-11668, 2010 WL 4181137, at *2 (D. Mass. Sept. 28,\n\n2010). After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's\n\ndecision.\n\n            The   relevant   facts   are    not    now   in     dispute.     The\n\nencumbered property is a condominium unit in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nOn May 9, 2003, the owner, Foundry Realty, LLC, executed and\n\ndelivered a second mortgage to the appellee, LBM Financial, LLC.\n\nThe mortgage, which secured the due performance of a guaranty, had\n\na stated term of four months.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           Foundry subsequently granted a separate mortgage on the\n\nproperty to Pine Banks Nominee Trust (PBNT).          Matters did not go\n\nwell, and Foundry foundered; it defaulted on the obligations\n\nunderlying   this   separate   mortgage.       PBNT    foreclosed,   took\n\npossession of the mortgaged property, and transferred it to Steven\n\nRoss, as trustee of Beach Street Realty Trust.         The transfer was,\n\nof course, subject to LBM's senior mortgage.\n\n           In 2007, LBM — the guaranty underlying its mortgage still\n\nunsatisfied — noticed a public foreclosure sale of the property.\n\nA few days before the date of the scheduled sale, Ross incorporated\n\nthe appellant, Shamus Holdings, LLC, and conveyed the property to\n\nShamus for nominal consideration.       Shamus wasted no time in filing\n\na voluntary Chapter 11 petition, see 11 U.S.C. § 301, on July 25,\n\n2007.   This filing triggered the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay,\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362(a), and halted the anticipated foreclosure sale.\n\n           This brings us to the Obsolete Mortgages Statute, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 260, § 33.       The statute requires the holder of a\n\nmortgage, on pain of forfeiture, to take action to enforce it\n\nwithin five years after the end of the mortgage's stated term.\n\nHere, the statute required LBM to take action to enforce its\n\nmortgage by September 9, 2008.    This deadline had not arrived when\n\nShamus instituted the bankruptcy proceeding.\n\n           Under ordinary circumstances, the Bankruptcy Code tolls\n\nthe running of the limitations period from the filing date until\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe automatic stay is either lifted or dissolved.            See 11 U.S.C. §\n\n108(c).    In Shamus's view, however, the Obsolete Mortgages Statute\n\nalters    this   calculus    by   allowing   a   mortgagee    to   extend   the\n\nlimitations period through the simple expedient of recording a\n\nnotice of extension.        Shamus theorizes that LBM's failure to avail\n\nitself of this procedure within the five-year period removes this\n\ncase from the mine run and converts the automatic stay into a dead\n\nletter.\n\n            Marching under this banner, Shamus initiated an adversary\n\nproceeding in the bankruptcy court, seeking to discharge the\n\nmortgage as time-barred.          The bankruptcy court bought into the\n\ntheory and held that LBM's failure to record an extension and its\n\nattendant delay in enforcing its rights rendered the mortgage null\n\nand void.   In re Shamus Holdings, 409 B.R. at 606.          LBM appealed to\n\nthe district court, see 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1), which rejected\n\nShamus's theory and reversed the bankruptcy court's decision.                LBM\n\nFin., 2010 WL 4181137, at *1.        The court reasoned that, regardless\n\nof LBM's ability to extend the duration of the mortgage enforcement\n\nperiod, the automatic stay preserved its rights.             Id. at *4.     This\n\nfurther appeal ensued.\n\n            The standard of review is familiar.        \"We cede no special\n\ndeference to the district court's initial review of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's decision,\" focusing instead on the bankruptcy court's\n\ndecision.   HSBC Bank USA v. Branch (In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.),\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f364 F.3d 355, 361 (1st Cir. 2004).             We review its findings of fact\n\nfor clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.                 Brandt v.\n\nRepco Printers & Lithog., Inc. (In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 132\n\nF.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).            This case turns on a question of\n\nlaw: whether the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, 11\n\nU.S.C.   §   362(a),      and   its   concomitant    tolling   provision,   id.\n\n§ 108(c), combine to preserve LBM's right to enforce the mortgage\n\nnotwithstanding LBM's eschewal of a readily available extension\n\nprovided     by   the    Obsolete     Mortgages   Statute.     Answering    this\n\nquestion requires an understanding of the interplay between various\n\nstate and federal statutes.\n\n             The principles that guide this inquiry are well settled.\n\nStatutory interpretation starts — and often ends — with the text of\n\nthe statute.      Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 496 F.3d\n\n1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007); Sullivan v. Town of Brookline, 758 N.E.2d\n\n110, 115 (Mass. 2001). Unless specially defined, the legislature's\n\nwords are generally deemed to carry their plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning.     Boivin v. Black, 225 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2000); Cohen\n\nv. Comm'r of Div. of Med. Assist., 668 N.E.2d 769, 774 (Mass.\n\n1996).   When that meaning produces a plausible result, the inquiry\n\ntypically ends.         Plumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 369\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); Cohen, 668 N.E.2d at 774.            Even so, plain meaning\n\nis not invariably the be all and end all of statutory construction.\n\nIf a plain-meaning interpretation produces outcomes \"that are\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\feither absurd or antithetical to [the legislature's] discernible\n\nintent,\" an inquiring court must continue its search.    Stornawaye\n\nFin. Corp. v. Hill (In re Hill), 562 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2009);\n\naccord Sullivan, 758 N.E.2d at 115.\n\n           Against this backdrop, we turn to the Obsolete Mortgages\n\nStatute.   It provides in pertinent part:\n\n           A power of sale in any mortgage of real estate\n           shall not be exercised and an entry shall not\n           be made nor possession taken nor proceeding\n           begun for foreclosure of any such mortgage\n           after the expiration of . . . , in the case of\n           a mortgage in which the term or maturity date\n           of the mortgage is stated, 5 years from the\n           expiration of the term or from the maturity\n           date, unless an extension of the mortgage, or\n           an acknowledgment or affidavit that the\n           mortgage is not satisfied, is recorded before\n           the expiration of such period.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 33.        The Massachusetts legislature\n\ndesigned this law to streamline conveyancing and make it easier to\n\nclear titles blemished by outdated mortgages. See Town of Pembroke\n\nv. Gummerus, No. 311622, 2008 WL 2726524, at *9 (Mass. Land Ct.\n\nJuly 15, 2008).\n\n           Here, however, the Obsolete Mortgages Statute does not\n\noperate in a vacuum.   Shamus's bankruptcy petition triggered the\n\nautomatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), which \"gives debtors breathing\n\nroom by stopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting\n\ntheir resumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy\n\ncourt or dissolved by operation of law.\"    229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship\n\nv. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot. (In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship),\n\n                                -6-\n\f262 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2001).    The automatic stay prevents \"the\n\ncommencement or continuation . . . of a judicial, administrative,\n\nor other action or proceeding against the debtor.\"      11 U.S.C. §\n\n362(a)(1).\n\n           Another statute within the Bankruptcy Code is implicated\n\nhere.   That statute, 11 U.S.C. § 108(c), is a tolling provision; it\n\nextends state statutes of limitations for creditors who are barred\n\nby the automatic stay from taking timely action against the debtor.\n\nSee Young v. United States (In re Young), 233 F.3d 56, 59 n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).   It provides in pertinent part:\n\n           [I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law . . . fixes\n           a period for commencing or continuing a civil\n           action in a court other than a bankruptcy\n           court on a claim against the debtor, . . . and\n           such period has not expired before the date of\n           the filing of the petition, then such period\n           does not expire until the later of —\n           (1) the end of such period, including any\n           suspension of such period occurring on or\n           after the commencement of the case; or\n           (2) 30 days after notice of the termination or\n           expiration of the stay under section 362 . . .\n           of this title . . . with respect to such\n           claim.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 108(c).\n\n           Our task is to synthesize this mix of state and federal\n\nlaws in order to determine whether, on the facts at hand, LBM's\n\nmortgage remains in force despite LBM's failure to record the\n\nextension permitted under the Obsolete Mortgages Statute.\n\n           We begin with the obvious: the Obsolete Mortgages Statute\n\nis nonbankruptcy law that applies to LBM's mortgage. It is equally\n\n                                 -7-\n\fas obvious that LBM neither commenced a judicial enforcement action\n\nnor recorded an extension of the mortgage by the fifth anniversary\n\nof the expiration of the mortgage term (September 9, 2008).              Based\n\non these facts, Shamus strives to convince us that section 108(c)\n\nis   inapposite   because,    in    light    of   the   availability    of   an\n\nextension, it cannot be said that the Obsolete Mortgages Statute\n\n\"fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action\" by a\n\ncreditor against a debtor.         We are not persuaded.\n\n           Shamus's    thesis   overlooks      that,    under    Massachusetts\n\nmortgage law, a mortgagee has a choice of remedies.                  When the\n\nmortgagor defaults, Massachusetts law gives the mortgagee two\n\ngeneral options: it may either enforce the mortgage within the\n\nperiod provided by law or extend the duration of the enforcement\n\nperiod by recording an extension.           This choice is the mortgagee's\n\n— and the mortgagee's alone.\n\n           Where, as here, the mortgagee chooses the former option,\n\nthat   option   may   be   administered      through    either    judicial   or\n\nnonjudicial means.     See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §§ 1-14.             Once\n\nagain, the choice is the mortgagee's — and the mortgagee's alone.\n\n           Here, the bankruptcy occurred before the expiration of\n\nthe limitations period and, at that time, LBM had the right to\n\npursue judicial foreclosure.         Id. § 1.     Its ability to exercise\n\nthat right was frustrated by the automatic stay.                    That stay\n\nprevented LBM, then and thereafter, from exercising its right to\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fforeclose by commencement of a court action within the limitations\n\nperiod fixed by the Obsolete Mortgages Statute. See Perry v. Blum,\n\n629 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2010) (explaining that the automatic stay\n\nmust be lifted to allow foreclosure to proceed).\n\n                 The bottom line is that this case falls squarely within\n\nthe maw of 11 U.S.C. § 108(c).             That tolling provision preserves\n\nLBM's option to commence a judicial foreclosure action until after\n\nthe lifting of the automatic stay.               See Spirtos v. Moreno (In re\n\nSpirtos), 221 F.3d 1079, 1080-81 (9th Cir. 2000); Morton v. Nat'l\n\nBank of N.Y.C. (In re Morton), 866 F.2d 561, 565-66 (2d Cir. 1989);\n\nLBM Fin., LLC v. 201 Forest St., LLC (In re 201 Forest St., LLC),\n\n422 B.R. 888, 895 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                 In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Shamus\n\ninsists that, because both the Bankruptcy Code and state law\n\npermitted LBM to file an extension of the limitations period as of\n\nright,      it    cannot   invoke   the   automatic      stay.        The   extension\n\nprocedure, Shamus says, fits into the exception to the automatic\n\nstay       for   acts   \"to    perfect,   or    to   maintain    or   continue   the\n\nperfection of, an interest in property.\"                11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(3).\n\n                 We need not dwell upon the applicability vel non of this\n\nexception; whether or not it covers the filing of an extension is\n\nbeside the point.1            The choice of which route to take to protect\n\n\n       1\n       For the sake of completeness, we note that it is unclear\nwhether section 362(b)(3) does, in fact, apply.   See In re 201\nForest St., 422 B.R. at 893 & n.7. Given our conclusion that the\n\n                                          -9-\n\fits rights was, as we have said, up to the mortgagee (LBM).\n\nNeither the case law nor the language of section 362(b)(3) itself\n\nsuggests that the action it contemplates is mandatory rather than\n\npermissive.     It clearly is not.      See Toranto v. Dzikowski, 380 B.R.\n\n96, 100 (S.D. Fla. 2007).\n\n              Lacking any relevant authority for the proposition that\n\nthe ready availability of an extension trumps the automatic stay,\n\nShamus falls back on the Obsolete Mortgages Statute itself. Shamus\n\nargues that the statute requires a mortgagee to record an extension\n\neven   when    the   mortgagee    has   commenced   a   timely   enforcement\n\nproceeding but has not concluded it within the five-year period.\n\nThis is sheer persiflage.        The statute identifies the commencement\n\nof foreclosure proceedings, not their completion, as the action\n\nthat   must    be    taken   within   the    limitations   period   to   avoid\n\nnullification of the mortgage.          See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 33\n\n(\"A power of sale in any mortgage of real estate shall not be\n\nexercised . . . nor possession taken nor proceeding begun for\n\nforeclosure . . . .\").\n\n              To recapitulate, LBM was not under any legal compulsion\n\nto choose the option of obtaining an extension but, rather, was\n\nfree to choose the option of judicial foreclosure.           See Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 244, § 1; see also In re Morton, 866 F.2d at 567.                The\n\n\n\nstatute is permissive, see text infra, we need not probe this point\nmore deeply.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fexercise of the latter option was temporarily blocked by the\n\noperation of the automatic stay.             That LBM may have been able to\n\nextend the limitations period by the performance of a ministerial\n\nact unhindered by the automatic stay is immaterial.                      See In re\n\nSpirtos, 221 F.3d at 1081.         Thus, as the district court correctly\n\nheld, section 108(c) extends the time within which LBM could act to\n\nenforce the mortgage.\n\n            There    is    one   loose    end.       Shamus   contends     that   the\n\nObsolete     Mortgages      Statute   must       control,     regardless    of    the\n\nautomatic stay, because rights in real property devolve from, and\n\nare defined by, state law.         This contention misconceives the role\n\nof state law in federal bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n            \"Creditors' entitlements in bankruptcy arise in the first\n\ninstance from the underlying substantive law creating the debtor's\n\nobligation, subject to any qualifying or contrary provisions of the\n\nBankruptcy Code.\"         Raleigh v. Ill. Dep't of Rev., 530 U.S. 15, 20\n\n(2000).    Consequently, when federal bankruptcy law supplies a rule\n\nthat speaks directly to the right at issue, that rule controls.\n\nSee Jafari v. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC (In re Jafari), 569 F.3d 644, 648\n\n(7th Cir. 2009).      So it is here: while Massachusetts law defines\n\nthe parties' rights and obligations under the mortgage (including\n\nthe duration of the limitations period), section 108(c) of the\n\nBankruptcy    Code   speaks      directly       to   the   enlargement     of    state\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\flimitations periods.    See Jinks v. Richland Cnty., 538 U.S. 456,\n\n461 & n.1 (2003).    Accordingly, section 108(c) controls here.\n\n            We need go no further.   We hold that 11 U.S.C. § 108(c)\n\ntolls the limitations period set by the Massachusetts Obsolete\n\nMortgages Statute, thereby enlarging the time within which LBM can\n\nbring a judicial foreclosure action until after the termination or\n\nexpiration of the automatic stay.2     It follows inexorably that the\n\ndistrict court did not err in ruling that LBM's mortgage remains in\n\nforce.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       We take no view as to how long LBM will have, after the\nlifting of the automatic stay, to commence a judicial enforcement\naction.

The issue presented concerns the interplay between a state statute placing temporal limitations on the enforcement of stale mortgages and the automatic stay provisions of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court ruled that the mortgagee's unqualified right to extend the limitations period by performing an essentially ministerial act (recording of an extension) rendered the tolling provision associated with the automatic stay inapposite and the mortgage obsolete. <i>Shamus Holdings, LLC v. LBM Fin., LLC</i> (<i>In re Shamus Holdings, LLC</i>), 409 B.R. 598, 606 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2009). At the first level of appellate review, the district court saw the matter quite differently; it ruled that the mortgage remained in force for the duration of the automatic stay. <i>LBM Fin. LLC v. Shamus Holdings, Inc.,</i> No. 1:09-cv-11668, 2010 WL 4181137, at *2 (D.Mass. Sept. 28, 2010). After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's decision.</p>\n<p>The relevant facts are not now in dispute. The encumbered property is a condominium unit in Boston, Massachusetts. On May 9, 2003, the owner, Foundry Realty, LLC, executed and delivered a second mortgage to the appellee, LBM Financial, LLC. The mortgage, which secured the due performance of a guaranty, had a stated term of four months.</p>\n<p>Foundry subsequently granted a separate mortgage on the property to Pine Banks Nominee Trust (PBNT). Matters did not go well, and Foundry foundered; it defaulted on the obligations underlying this separate mortgage. PBNT foreclosed, took possession of the mortgaged property, and transferred it to Steven Ross, as trustee of Beach Street Realty Trust. The transfer was, of course, subject to LBM's senior mortgage.</p>\n<p>In 2007, LBMthe guaranty underlying its mortgage still unsatisfiednoticed a public foreclosure sale of the property. A few days before the date of the scheduled sale, Ross incorporated the appellant, Shamus Holdings, LLC, and conveyed the property to Shamus for nominal consideration. Shamus wasted no time in filing a voluntary Chapter 11 petition, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. § 301, on July 25, 2007. This filing triggered the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), and halted the anticipated foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the Obsolete Mortgages Statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 33. The statute requires the holder of a mortgage, on pain of forfeiture, to take action to enforce it within five years after the end of the mortgage's stated term. Here, the statute required LBM to take action to enforce its mortgage by September 9, 2008. This deadline had not arrived when Shamus instituted the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p>Under ordinary circumstances, the Bankruptcy Code tolls the running of the limitations period from the filing date until the automatic stay is either lifted or dissolved. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 108(c). In Shamus's view, however, the Obsolete Mortgages Statute alters this calculus by allowing a mortgagee to extend the limitations period through the simple expedient of recording a notice of extension. Shamus theorizes that LBM's failure to avail itself of this procedure within the five-year period removes this case from the mine run and converts the automatic stay into a dead letter.</p>\n<p>Marching under this banner, Shamus initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court, seeking to discharge the mortgage as time-barred. The bankruptcy court bought into the theory and held that LBM's failure to record an extension and its attendant delay in enforcing its rights rendered the mortgage null and void. <i>In re Shamus Holdings,</i> 409 B.R. at 606. LBM appealed to the district court, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1), which rejected Shamus's theory and reversed the bankruptcy court's decision. <i>LBM Fin.,</i> 2010 WL <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> 4181137, at *1. The court reasoned that, regardless of LBM's ability to extend the duration of the mortgage enforcement period, the automatic stay preserved its rights. <i>Id.</i> at *4. This further appeal ensued.</p>\n<p>The standard of review is familiar. \"We cede no special deference to the district court's initial review of the bankruptcy court's decision,\" focusing instead on the bankruptcy court's decision. <i>HSBC Bank USA v. Branch</i> (<i>In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.</i>), 364 F.3d 355, 361 (1st Cir. 2004). We review its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <i>Brandt v. Repco Printers &amp; Lithog., Inc.</i> (<i>In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.</i>), 132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir.1997). This case turns on a question of law: whether the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), and its concomitant tolling provision, <i>id.</i> § 108(c), combine to preserve LBM's right to enforce the mortgage notwithstanding LBM's eschewal of a readily available extension provided by the Obsolete Mortgages Statute. Answering this question requires an understanding of the interplay between various state and federal statutes.</p>\n<p>The principles that guide this inquiry are well settled. Statutory interpretation startsand often endswith the text of the statute. <i>Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Sullivan v. Town of Brookline,</i> 435 Mass. 353, 758 N.E.2d 110, 115 (2001). Unless specially defined, the legislature's words are generally deemed to carry their plain and ordinary meaning. <i>Boivin v. Black,</i> 225 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Cohen v. Comm'r of Div. of Med. Assist.,</i> 423 Mass. 399, 668 N.E.2d 769, 774 (1996). When that meaning produces a plausible result, the inquiry typically ends. <i>Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 364, 369 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Cohen,</i> 668 N.E.2d at 774. Even so, plain meaning is not invariably the be all and end all of statutory construction. If a plain-meaning interpretation produces outcomes \"that are either absurd or antithetical to [the legislature's] discernible intent,\" an inquiring court must continue its search. <i>Stornawaye Fin. Corp. v. Hill</i> (<i>In re Hill</i>), 562 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2009); <i>accord </i><i>Sullivan,</i> 758 N.E.2d at 115.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, we turn to the Obsolete Mortgages Statute. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>A power of sale in any mortgage of real estate shall not be exercised and an entry shall not be made nor possession taken nor proceeding begun for foreclosure of any such mortgage after the expiration of ..., in the case of a mortgage in which the term or maturity date of the mortgage is stated, 5 years from the expiration of the term or from the maturity date, unless an extension of the mortgage, or an acknowledgment or affidavit that the mortgage is not satisfied, is recorded before the expiration of such period.</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 33. The Massachusetts legislature designed this law to streamline conveyancing and make it easier to clear titles blemished by outdated mortgages. <i>See Town of Pembroke v. Gummerus,</i> No. 311622, 2008 WL 2726524, at *9 (Mass.Land Ct. July 15, 2008).</p>\n<p>Here, however, the Obsolete Mortgages Statute does not operate in a vacuum. Shamus's bankruptcy petition triggered the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), which \"gives debtors breathing room by stopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting their resumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court or dissolved by operation of law.\" <i>229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot.</i> (<i>In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship</i>), 262 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2001). The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> automatic stay prevents \"the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1).</p>\n<p>Another statute within the Bankruptcy Code is implicated here. That statute, 11 U.S.C. § 108(c), is a tolling provision; it extends state statutes of limitations for creditors who are barred by the automatic stay from taking timely action against the debtor. <i>See </i><i>Young v. United States</i> (<i>In re Young</i>), 233 F.3d 56, 59 n. 3 (1st Cir.2000). It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law ... fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action in a court other than a bankruptcy court on a claim against the debtor, ... and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the later of</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under section 362 ... of this title ... with respect to such claim.</blockquote>\n<p>11 U.S.C. § 108(c).</p>\n<p>Our task is to synthesize this mix of state and federal laws in order to determine whether, on the facts at hand, LBM's mortgage remains in force despite LBM's failure to record the extension permitted under the Obsolete Mortgages Statute.</p>\n<p>We begin with the obvious: the Obsolete Mortgages Statute is nonbankruptcy law that applies to LBM's mortgage. It is equally as obvious that LBM neither commenced a judicial enforcement action nor recorded an extension of the mortgage by the fifth anniversary of the expiration of the mortgage term (September 9, 2008). Based on these facts, Shamus strives to convince us that section 108(c) is inapposite because, in light of the availability of an extension, it cannot be said that the Obsolete Mortgages Statute \"fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action\" by a creditor against a debtor. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>Shamus's thesis overlooks that, under Massachusetts mortgage law, a mortgagee has a choice of remedies. When the mortgagor defaults, Massachusetts law gives the mortgagee two general options: it may either enforce the mortgage within the period provided by law or extend the duration of the enforcement period by recording an extension. This choice is the mortgagee'sand the mortgagee's alone.</p>\n<p>Where, as here, the mortgagee chooses the former option, that option may be administered through either judicial or nonjudicial means. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §§ 1-14. Once again, the choice is the mortgagee'sand the mortgagee's alone.</p>\n<p>Here, the bankruptcy occurred before the expiration of the limitations period and, at that time, LBM had the right to pursue judicial foreclosure. <i>Id.</i> § 1. Its ability to exercise that right was frustrated by the automatic stay. That stay prevented LBM, then and thereafter, from exercising its right to foreclose by commencement of a court action within the limitations period fixed by the Obsolete Mortgages Statute. <i>See </i><i>Perry v. Blum,</i> 629 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2010) (explaining that the automatic stay must be lifted to allow foreclosure to proceed).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that this case falls squarely within the maw of 11 U.S.C. § 108(c). That tolling provision preserves LBM's option to commence a judicial foreclosure action until after the lifting of the automatic stay. <i>See </i><i>Spirtos v. Moreno</i> (<i>In re Spirtos</i>), 221 F.3d 1079, 1080-81 (9th <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> Cir.2000); <i>Morton v. Nat'l Bank of N.Y.C.</i> (<i>In re Morton</i>), 866 F.2d 561, 565-66 (2d Cir.1989); <i>LBM Fin., LLC v. 201 Forest St., LLC</i> (<i>In re 201 Forest St., LLC</i>), 422 B.R. 888, 895 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Shamus insists that, because both the Bankruptcy Code and state law permitted LBM to file an extension of the limitations period as of right, it cannot invoke the automatic stay. The extension procedure, Shamus says, fits into the exception to the automatic stay for acts \"to perfect, or to maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in property.\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(3).</p>\n<p>We need not dwell upon the applicability vel non of this exception; whether or not it covers the filing of an extension is beside the point.<sup>[1]</sup> The choice of which route to take to protect its rights was, as we have said, up to the mortgagee (LBM). Neither the case law nor the language of section 362(b)(3) itself suggests that the action it contemplates is mandatory rather than permissive. It clearly is not. <i>See </i><i>Toranto v. Dzikowski,</i> 380 B.R. 96, 100 (S.D.Fla. 2007).</p>\n<p>Lacking any relevant authority for the proposition that the ready availability of an extension trumps the automatic stay, Shamus falls back on the Obsolete Mortgages Statute itself. Shamus argues that the statute <i>requires</i> a mortgagee to record an extension even when the mortgagee has commenced a timely enforcement proceeding but has not concluded it within the five-year period. This is sheer persiflage. The statute identifies the commencement of foreclosure proceedings, not their completion, as the action that must be taken within the limitations period to avoid nullification of the mortgage. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen.Laws ch. 260, § 33 (\"A power of sale in any mortgage of real estate shall not be exercised ... nor possession taken nor proceeding begun for foreclosure....\").</p>\n<p>To recapitulate, LBM was not under any legal compulsion to choose the option of obtaining an extension but, rather, was free to choose the option of judicial foreclosure. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, § 1; <i>see also </i><i>In re Morton,</i> 866 F.2d at 567. The exercise of the latter option was temporarily blocked by the operation of the automatic stay. That LBM may have been able to extend the limitations period by the performance of a ministerial act unhindered by the automatic stay is immaterial. <i>See </i><i>In re Spirtos,</i> 221 F.3d at 1081. Thus, as the district court correctly held, section 108(c) extends the time within which LBM could act to enforce the mortgage.</p>\n<p>There is one loose end. Shamus contends that the Obsolete Mortgages Statute must control, regardless of the automatic stay, because rights in real property devolve from, and are defined by, state law. This contention misconceives the role of state law in federal bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>\"Creditors' entitlements in bankruptcy arise in the first instance from the underlying substantive law creating the debtor's obligation, subject to any qualifying or contrary provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\" <i>Raleigh v. Ill. Dep't of Rev.,</i> 530 U.S. 15, 20, 120 S.Ct. 1951, 147 L.Ed.2d 13 (2000). Consequently, when federal bankruptcy law supplies a rule that speaks directly to the right at issue, that rule controls. <i>See </i><i>Jafari v. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC</i> (<i>In re Jafari</i>), 569 F.3d 644, 648 (7th Cir.2009). So it is here: while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> Massachusetts law defines the parties' rights and obligations under the mortgage (including the duration of the limitations period), section 108(c) of the Bankruptcy Code speaks directly to the enlargement of state limitations periods. <i>See </i><i>Jinks v. Richland Cnty.,</i> 538 U.S. 456, 461 &amp; n. 1, 123 S.Ct. 1667, 155 L.Ed.2d 631 (2003). Accordingly, section 108(c) controls here.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. We hold that 11 U.S.C. § 108(c) tolls the limitations period set by the Massachusetts Obsolete Mortgages Statute, thereby enlarging the time within which LBM can bring a judicial foreclosure action until after the termination or expiration of the automatic stay.<sup>[2]</sup> It follows inexorably that the district court did not err in ruling that LBM's mortgage remains in force.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For the sake of completeness, we note that it is unclear whether section 362(b)(3) does, in fact, apply. <i>See </i><i>In re 201 Forest St.,</i> 422 B.R. at 893 &amp; n. 7. Given our conclusion that the statute is permissive, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not probe this point more deeply.</p>\n<p>[2]  We take no view as to how long LBM will have, after the lifting of the automatic stay, to commence a judicial enforcement action. <i>Compare</i> 11 U.S.C. § 108(c) (extending creditor's right to enforce until \"30 days after notice\" of expiration of automatic stay unless limitations period itself is longer), <i>with </i><i>In re Morton,</i> 866 F.2d at 566 (holding that section 108(c) also extends time within which creditor may renew limitations period).</p>\n\n</div>",

July 15, 2008).</p>\n<p>Here, however, the Obsolete Mortgages Statute does not operate in a vacuum. Shamus's bankruptcy petition triggered the automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), which \"gives debtors breathing room by stopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting their resumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court or dissolved by operation of law.\" <i>229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship v. Mass. Dep't of Envtl. Prot.</i> (<i>In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199568\"><a href=\"/opinion/199568/229-main-street-v-massachusetts-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2001). The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> automatic stay prevents \"the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1).</p>\n<p>Another statute within the Bankruptcy Code is implicated here. That statute, 11 U.S.C. § 108(c), is a tolling provision; it extends state statutes of limitations for creditors who are barred by the automatic stay from taking timely action against the debtor. <i>See </i><i>Young v. United States</i> (<i>In re Young</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199169\"><a href=\"/opinion/199169/young-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 59 n. 3 (1st Cir.2000). It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]f applicable nonbankruptcy law ... fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action in a court other than a bankruptcy court on a claim against the debtor, ... and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, then such period does not expire until the later of</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) 30 days after notice of the termination or expiration of the stay under section 362 ... of this title ... with respect to such claim.</blockquote>\n<p>11 U.S.C. § 108(c).</p>\n<p>Our task is to synthesize this mix of state and federal laws in order to determine whether, on the facts at hand, LBM's mortgage remains in force despite LBM's failure to record the extension permitted under the Obsolete Mortgages Statute.</p>\n<p>We begin with the obvious: the Obsolete Mortgages Statute is nonbankruptcy law that applies to LBM's mortgage. It is equally as obvious that LBM neither commenced a judicial enforcement action nor recorded an extension of the mortgage by the fifth anniversary of the expiration of the mortgage term (September 9, 2008). Based on these facts, Shamus strives to convince us that section 108(c) is inapposite because, in light of the availability of an extension, it cannot be said that the Obsolete Mortgages Statute \"fixes a period for commencing or continuing a civil action\" by a creditor against a debtor. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>Shamus's thesis overlooks that, under Massachusetts mortgage law, a mortgagee has a choice of remedies. When the mortgagor defaults, Massachusetts law gives the mortgagee two general options: it may either enforce the mortgage within the period provided by law or extend the duration of the enforcement period by recording an extension. This choice is the mortgagee'sand the mortgagee's alone.</p>\n<p>Where, as here, the mortgagee chooses the former option, that option may be administered through either judicial or nonjudicial means. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, §§ 1-14. Once again, the choice is the mortgagee'sand the mortgagee's alone.</p>\n<p>Here, the bankruptcy occurred before the expiration of the limitations period and, at that time, LBM had the right to pursue judicial foreclosure. <i>Id.</i> § 1. Its ability to exercise that right was frustrated by the automatic stay. That stay prevented LBM, then and thereafter, from exercising its right to foreclose by commencement of a court action within the limitations period fixed by the Obsolete Mortgages Statute. <i>See </i><i>Perry v. Blum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"176414\"><a href=\"/opinion/176414/perry-v-blum/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2010) (explaining that the automatic stay must be lifted to allow foreclosure to proceed).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that this case falls squarely within the maw of 11 U.S.C. § 108(c). That tolling provision preserves LBM's option to commence a judicial foreclosure action until after the lifting of the automatic stay. <i>See </i><i>Spirtos v. Moreno</i> (<i>In re Spirtos</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769812\"><a href=\"/opinion/769812/in-re-basil-n-spirtos-debtor-thelma-v-spirtos-v-irene-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span>, 1080-81 (9th <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> Cir.2000); <i>Morton v. Nat'l Bank of N.Y.C.</i> (<i>In re Morton</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517602\"><a href=\"/opinion/517602/in-re-joan-morton-debtor-joan-morton-v-national-bank-of-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 565-66 (2d Cir.1989); <i>LBM Fin., LLC v. 201 Forest St., LLC</i> (<i>In re 201 Forest St., LLC</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1980851\"><a href=\"/opinion/1980851/in-re-201-forest-street-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 895 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Shamus insists that, because both the Bankruptcy Code and state law permitted LBM to file an extension of the limitations period as of right, it cannot invoke the automatic stay. The extension procedure, Shamus says, fits into the exception to the automatic stay for acts \"to perfect, or to maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in property.\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(3).</p>\n<p>We need not dwell upon the applicability vel non of this exception; whether or not it covers the filing of an extension is beside the point.<sup>[1]</sup> The choice of which route to take to protect its rights was, as we have said, up to the mortgagee (LBM). Neither the case law nor the language of section 362(b)(3) itself suggests that the action it contemplates is mandatory rather than permissive. It clearly is not. <i>See </i><i>Toranto v. Dzikowski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1860096\"><a href=\"/opinion/1860096/toranto-v-dzikowski/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 100 (S.D.Fla. 2007).</p>\n<p>Lacking any relevant authority for the proposition that the ready availability of an extension trumps the automatic stay, Shamus falls back on the Obsolete Mortgages Statute itself. Shamus argues that the statute <i>requires</i> a mortgagee to record an extension even when the mortgagee has commenced a timely enforcement proceeding but has not concluded it within the five-year period. This is sheer persiflage. The statute identifies the commencement of foreclosure proceedings, not their completion, as the action that must be taken within the limitations period to avoid nullification of the mortgage. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen.Laws ch. 260, § 33 (\"A power of sale in any mortgage of real estate shall not be exercised ... nor possession taken nor proceeding begun for foreclosure....\").</p>\n<p>To recapitulate, LBM was not under any legal compulsion to choose the option of obtaining an extension but, rather, was free to choose the option of judicial foreclosure. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, § 1; <i>see also </i><i>In re Morton,</i> 866 F.2d at 567. The exercise of the latter option was temporarily blocked by the operation of the automatic stay. That LBM may have been able to extend the limitations period by the performance of a ministerial act unhindered by the automatic stay is immaterial. <i>See </i><i>In re Spirtos,</i> 221 F.3d at 1081. Thus, as the district court correctly held, section 108(c) extends the time within which LBM could act to enforce the mortgage.</p>\n<p>There is one loose end. Shamus contends that the Obsolete Mortgages Statute must control, regardless of the automatic stay, because rights in real property devolve from, and are defined by, state law. This contention misconceives the role of state law in federal bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>\"Creditors' entitlements in bankruptcy arise in the first instance from the underlying substantive law creating the debtor's obligation, subject to any qualifying or contrary provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\" <i>Raleigh v. Ill. Dep't of Rev.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087664/raleigh-v-illinois-dept-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087664/raleigh-v-illinois-dept-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087664\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087664/raleigh-v-illinois-dept-of-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span> (2000). Consequently, when federal bankruptcy law supplies a rule that speaks directly to the right at issue, that rule controls. <i>See </i><i>Jafari v. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC</i> (<i>In re Jafari</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1237090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1237090/in-re-jafari/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 648 (7th Cir.2009). So it is here: while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> Massachusetts law defines the parties' rights and obligations under the mortgage (including the duration of the limitations period), section 108(c) of the Bankruptcy Code speaks directly to the enlargement of state limitations periods. <i>See </i><i>Jinks v. Richland Cnty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127912\"><a href=\"/opinion/127912/jinks-v-richland-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 461 &amp; n. 1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127912\"><a href=\"/opinion/127912/jinks-v-richland-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span> (2003). Accordingly, section 108(c) controls here.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. We hold that 11 U.S.C. § 108(c) tolls the limitations period set by the Massachusetts Obsolete Mortgages Statute, thereby enlarging the time within which LBM can bring a judicial foreclosure action until after the termination or expiration of the automatic stay.<sup>[2]</sup> It follows inexorably that the district court did not err in ruling that LBM's mortgage remains in force.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For the sake of completeness, we note that it is unclear whether section 362(b)(3) does, in fact, apply. <i>See </i><i>In re 201 Forest St.,</i> 422 B.R. at 893 &amp; n. 7. Given our conclusion that the statute is permissive, <i>see</i> text <i>infra,</i> we need not probe this point more deeply.</p>\n<p>[2]  We take no view as to how long LBM will have, after the lifting of the automatic stay, to commence a judicial enforcement action. <i>Compare</i> 11 U.S.C. § 108(c) (extending creditor's right to enforce until \"30 days after notice\" of expiration of automatic stay unless limitations period itself is longer), <i>with </i><i>In re Morton,</i> 866 F.2d at 566 (holding that section 108(c) also extends time within which creditor may renew limitations period).</p>\n\n</div>",
