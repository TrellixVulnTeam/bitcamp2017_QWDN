Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n             Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter K. Levitt, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States\nAttorney, and Cynthia W. Lie, Assistant U.S. Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n     Syrie    D.   Fried,    Attorney,      Federal   Defender    Office,   for\nappellant.\n\n\n                               August 30, 2002\n\f            PER CURIAM. Respondent Michael B. Thompson was scheduled\n\nto   be   released   from    the   Federal    Medical   Center   at   Devens,\n\nMassachusetts on December 23, 2000, after serving a three-year\n\nsentence for illegally possessing a firearm.            On December 22, the\n\nUnited States petitioned the district court to stay Thompson's\n\ndischarge, citing the respondent's deteriorating mental condition\n\nand the belief of the staff at the medical center that Thompson\n\nwould pose a substantial risk of harm to other persons or property\n\nif he were released.        Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4246, the district\n\ncourt conducted a hearing to assess Thompson's mental condition and\nthe risks posed by his release.        At the conclusion of the hearing,\n\nthe court agreed that Thompson should remain in the government's\ncustody, and ordered the Attorney General to \"make all reasonable\nefforts\" to arrange treatment for Thompson at a facility in Maine,\n\nwhere respondent is domiciled. United States v. Thompson, C.A. No.\n\n00-MC-10516-MLW, Order at 1 (D. Mass. March 19, 2001).\n            Thompson challenges the district court's order on three\n\ngrounds.    First, he claims that the court erroneously construed 18\nU.S.C. § 4246 to require only an initial certification that no\nsuitable arrangement for treating the respondent in Maine was\n\navailable.     Thompson      argues   that    the   statute   obligates   the\ngovernment to prove the absence of suitable treatment options in\nMaine at the commitment hearing.            In a second related challenge,\n\nThompson argues that his due process rights were violated by the\ndistrict court's exclusion of evidence that he offered challenging\n\nthe factual basis for this particular certification by the medical\n\n                                      -2-\n\fcenter.    Finally, respondent claims that the district court erred\n\nin   finding    by    clear   and    convincing   evidence    that   Thompson's\n\ndischarge would present a substantial risk to persons or property,\nas required by 18 U.S.C. § 4246(d).               For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we reject respondent's challenges and affirm the decision of\n\nthe district court.\n            Thompson points to two pieces of legislative history to\n\nsupport his first claim of error; favorable language in the statute\n\nthat preceded the current version of 18 U.S.C. § 4246, see 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 4243, 4247 (prior to 1984 amendment), and a House report\n\npurporting to construe section 4246 after its most recent amendment\n\nin 1984.       H.R.Rep. No. 98-1030, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n3182, 3433.       However, this circuit has previously noted that the\nlanguage of section 4246 unequivocally limits the scope of the\n\ncommitment hearing to two questions: 1) Whether the person in\n\ncustody is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect, and\n2) Whether the existence of a mental disease or defect creates a\n\nsubstantial risk that the person will injure other persons or\n\nproperty if released.         United States v. Ecker, 78 F.3d 726, 728 n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).        As the district court observed in its thorough\n\nand well-reasoned decision, we do not employ legislative history as\n\nan aid in interpreting a statutory provision that is unambiguous on\n\nits face.      Id. at 730.\n\n            Our      resolution     of   Thompson's    statutory   challenge   is\n\ndispositive of his due process claims.                Because 18 U.S.C. § 4246\n\ndenied Thompson the right to litigate the issue of alternative\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fplacement, he suffered no due process injury from the district\n\ncourt's exclusion of evidence proffered in support of an argument\n\nthat could not be advanced at the commitment hearing.\n            Turning    to    Thompson's        third   claim,    we   find   after\n\nreviewing the record that the district court's assessment of the\n\nrisks   presented     by    respondent's       conceded    mental     illness   was\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence.               The three doctors who\n\ntestified at the commitment hearing, including respondent's own\n\nmedical    expert,    agreed      that   in    his   present    mental   condition\n\nThompson    satisfied       the   statutory      requirements     for    continued\n\ndetention.\n\n            Accordingly, the decision of the district court is\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f",
