David Faulkingham is charged with\n\npossession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute\n\nheroin. On the day of his arrest he made inculpatory statements to\n\nagents of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA). The agents did\n\nnot give the required warning under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.\n\n436 (1966), before Faulkingham made the statements.               Faulkingham's\n\nown statements were thus ordered suppressed under Miranda.                     His\n\nstatements, however, also led to the discovery of derivative\n\nevidence that was important to the government's case against him.\n\nThat derivative evidence was testimony by a coconspirator and the\ndrugs themselves, and it is the subject of this appeal.\n\n             Faulkingham argued, and the district court agreed, that\nthe \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, common to Fourth\nAmendment    jurisprudence,    should       also   apply    to   the   derivative\n\nevidence, given the facts of this particular Miranda violation\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment.       United States v. Faulkingham, 156 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 60 (D. Me. 2001).            In the end, the court granted the\n\nmotion to suppress, believing that \"suppression of the derivative\nevidence . . . will serve to remind law enforcement that even in\n'the excitement of the moment' law enforcement retains an important\n\nduty   to    inform   an    individual      taken    into     custody    of    his\nconstitutional rights.\"       Id. at 72.\n\n             Individuals in custody should, of course, be informed of\n\ntheir rights.      But we disagree that in this case the concerns that\nanimate     the   Fifth   Amendment    require      the    suppression    of   the\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fderivative evidence, as opposed to the suppression of Faulkingham's\n\nown unwarned statements.\n\n                                           I.\n             We outline the facts in this case as found by the\n\nmagistrate      judge     and     adopted       by    the   district         judge,   and\n\nsupplemented from the record.              On July 28, 2000, Mark Leonard, an\nagent   of   the    MDEA,   received        information        from    a     confidential\n\ninformant that Faulkingham was a drug dealer who lived on Route 102\n\nin   Tremont,    Maine,     and    drove    a     tan   Lincoln       Town    Car.    The\n\nconfidential       informant      also     told      Leonard    that       Faulkingham's\n\ndriver's license was suspended, a fact that Leonard confirmed later\n\nthat day.\n\n             On August 1, Leonard and another MDEA agent, Robert\nHutchings, set off for Tremont to follow up on the information\n\nLeonard received from the confidential informant.                          On their way,\n\nthe agents obtained a 1996 jail photograph of Faulkingham from the\nHancock County Sheriff's Department.\n\n             When the agents reached the residence, they observed it\n\nfrom their car, which was parked in a driveway not far away.                           At\n\napproximately 3:15 p.m., the agents saw a tan Lincoln Town Car\n\nleaving the driveway of the residence. They followed the Town Car,\n\nuntil it slowed down to a stop.             Leonard and Hutchings thought the\n\ndriver of the Town Car matched the person in the photograph of\n\nFaulkingham.\n\n             Hutchings approached the car, showed his identification\n\nshield, said he was an MDEA agent, and told the driver to \"shut\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f[his] car off, and get out of the car.\"                   Faulkingham identified\n\nhimself.     Hutchings conducted a patdown search and found cash,\n\nheroin, and a syringe on Faulkingham.                   Hutchings then arrested\nFaulkingham for operating his vehicle after suspension of his\n\nlicense, handcuffed him, and seated him in the back seat of the\n\nagents' car.       Hutchings said to Faulkingham: \"[J]ust sit here.                 I\ndon't want you to say anything to me at this point.                      I have some\n\npaperwork we're going to have to do.                   I have some paperwork I'm\n\ngoing to have to read to you.\"               Hutchings also told Faulkingham\n\nthat he was \"seek[ing] [his] cooperation.\"                Among the paperwork to\n\nwhich Hutchings referred was a form containing the Miranda warning,\n\nwhich, if signed, would confirm that Faulkingham had received the\n\nwarning.\n            Hutchings stored the evidence from the patdown search in\n\nthe trunk of the car.        When he returned to Faulkingham, he did not\n\ngive him the Miranda warning, even though, as the magistrate judge\n\nnoted, \"Hutchings understood that he had a suspect in custody that\n\nhe intended to interrogate.\"              United States v. Faulkingham, No.\n\nCRIM 01-04-B-S, 2001 WL 586667, at *2 (D. Me. May 29, 2001).\n\nFaulkingham told Hutchings that he would be sick in about two hours\n\nfrom heroin withdrawal. Hutchings explained to Faulkingham that if\n\nhe   got   sick,    the    agents    would      \"get    him    medical   attention.\"\n\nFaulkingham did not then show physical signs of being under the\n\ninfluence    of    any    drugs,    and   the    agents       \"kept   checking   with\"\n\nFaulkingham throughout the process to see how he was feeling.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f            In the meantime, agent Leonard dealt with the two other\n\npassengers in the Town Car.            After confirming that there were no\n\nwarrants for the passengers, he told them they could leave, and\nthey left the scene on foot.\n\n            Faulkingham told Hutchings that if he was going to\n\ncooperate, then the two passengers who were walking away would pose\na problem.       One of the passengers, Faulkingham said, was the\n\nroommate of his supplier, and as soon as he returned to his home\n\n\"the heroin      will    either   be   flushed    or   hidden   or   something.\"\n\nFaulkingham also asked the agents what type of deal he could get if\n\nhe decided to cooperate.          The agents explained that they were not\n\nauthorized to make any deals, but would pass on information about\n\nhis cooperation to the prosecutor, who could work out a deal with\nFaulkingham's attorney.\n\n            Leonard and Hutchings searched Faulkingham's car, but\n\nfound no other significant evidence. While they were searching the\ncar, Faulkingham's wife, who happened to drive by the scene,\n\nstopped in her red pickup truck.              She was dismayed when Hutchings\n\ntold her of Faulkingham's arrest and said Faulkingham had recently\n\ncompleted    a    drug    rehabilitation         program.       Hutchings      gave\n\nFaulkingham's wife permission to speak with him.                     Faulkingham\n\napologized to her, and asked her to get some bail money and to call\n\nhis attorney.\n\n            As   the     agents    were   finishing     up   their    search    of\n\nFaulkingham's car, Faulkingham got the agents' attention, and when\n\nthey walked up to their car, he told them that if he was going to\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcooperate and be helpful to them, he would have to be on the phone\n\nwith his supplier by 3:30 p.m. Hutchings and Leonard both realized\n\nthat       it   was   already   3:28   p.m.    Leonard   called   the   agents'\nsupervisor, Peter Arno, to get instructions on how to proceed.\n\nArno gave the agents permission to have Faulkingham contact his\n\nsupplier and record the phone call.\n                Faulkingham asked the agents to leave the roadside so\n\nthat he would not be seen.             After releasing Faulkingham from the\n\nhandcuffs, Hutchings drove the agents' car, with Faulkingham in it,\n\nto a marina about a mile away.            Leonard followed them in the Town\n\nCar. At the marina, Faulkingham made a few attempts to contact his\n\nsupplier, but he failed because of bad reception. Faulkingham also\n\nsuspected that his supplier did not answer the phone because he did\nnot recognize the caller ID number, or because the supplier's\n\nroommate had already informed the supplier of Faulkingham's arrest.\n\nThe agents asked Faulkingham how he was feeling to be sure he was\nnot yet sick.         Faulkingham continued to appear normal.\n\n                Because Faulkingham could not reach his supplier from the\n\nmarina, he persuaded the agents to go to his house and make the\n\nphone call from there.          When they arrived at Faulkingham's house,\n\nhe did make contact with Mark Power, who he said was his supplier.1\nFaulkingham told Power that he had been stopped by the police just\n\nfor \"a driving thing,\" and had been released by the police.                  He\n\n       1\n          Power, who later cooperated with the government and\nbecame a witness against Faulkingham, denied this and claimed that\nFaulkingham himself was the supplier. In deciding the motion to\nsuppress, the district court had no need to resolve this conflict,\nand neither do we.\n\n                                         -6-\n\falso told Power that he should come over to the Faulkingham\n\nresidence with the heroin in order to hide it because MDEA agents\n\nwere in the area.      Eventually, Power arrived at the residence.\nAfter   being    confronted    by   the      agents,    Power   also   agreed   to\n\ncooperate, and drugs were seized from Power's residence.\n\n           Throughout the agents' contact with Faulkingham, they did\nnot administer the Miranda warning to him.                   At the suppression\n\nhearing, they conceded that they should have but had not done so.\n\nThey explained that lack of time and the rapid pace of the events\n\non the day of the arrest were the reasons for their omission.\n\n                                       II.\n\n           Faulkingham,       Power,    and     another      coconspirator   were\n\nindicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin and\npossessing heroin with the intent to distribute it, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. § 846, and 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n           Faulkingham filed a motion to suppress the statements he\nmade to the MDEA agents while in their custody, Mark Power's\n\ntestimony, and the heroin to which Power's statements led the\n\nagents.   The magistrate judge's decision recommended the motion as\n\nto Faulkingham's statements be granted because the agents did not\n\ngive him the Miranda warning, but that the motion as to Power's\n\nstatements and the physical evidence be denied, because the \"fruit\n\nof the poisonous tree\" doctrine does not apply to the Miranda\n\nexclusionary rule.     Faulkingham, 2001 WL 586667, at *5-7.\n\n           The    district    court    modified        the   magistrate   judge's\n\nrecommended decision by applying the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\"\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdoctrine to this Miranda violation, and suppressing not only\n\nFaulkingham's custodial statements, but the derivative evidence of\n\nPower's statements and the drugs. Faulkingham, 156 F. Supp. 2d 60.\nThe district court appropriately rejected any per se application of\n\nthe \"fruits\" doctrine to the Miranda violation, and made case-\n\nspecific factual findings.        Id. at 70.   It found that the Miranda\n\nviolation was not a technical one, and that it followed from that\n\nviolation that Faulkingham did not knowingly and intelligently\n\nunderstand that he was waiving his privilege against compulsory\n\nself-incrimination.       Id. at 70-71.    The court found that all the\n\nderivative evidence at issue was obtained through Faulkingham's\n\nunwarned statements, and that the derivative evidence would not\n\notherwise have been inevitably discovered.             Id. at 71.      The\ndistrict court agreed with the magistrate judge's factual findings\n\nthat there were no coercive official tactics by the police and that\n\nFaulkingham's statements were voluntary.         Id. at 67-68.    The court\ndid   not   find   that     the   agents   had    deliberately    violated\n\nFaulkingham's Miranda rights. Id. at 66. It stated, however, that\n\ntheir failure to give the warning was \"negligent, at best.\"            Id.\n\nIt then reasoned that \"Faulkingham's statements were coerced by the\n\nlack of a Miranda warning.\"         Id. at 67.    It concluded that the\n\ndeterrence rationale for Miranda dictated the suppression of both\n\nFaulkingham's statements and the derivative evidence.            Id. at 71-\n\n72.\n\n            The government now appeals from the suppression order.\n\nIt argues that the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine does not\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fapply to Miranda violations.          The government also argues that this\n\ncourt's opinion in United States v. Byram, 145 F.3d 405 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), on which the district court based its decision, does not\napply to this case, and that even if the factors considered by the\n\ncourt in Byram were to be used here,2 the derivative evidence\n\nshould not be suppressed.\n                                       III.\n\n            On an appeal of a disposition of a motion to suppress,\n\n\"we accept the district court's findings of fact unless clearly\n\nerroneous and evaluate its legal conclusions de novo.\"                           United\n\nStates v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001).                        Thus, we must\n\ndetermine   anew    whether     the   evidence    obtained         as    a    result   of\n\nFaulkingham's unwarned statements should be suppressed under the\nfruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\n\n            The requirement that a confession must be voluntary in\n\norder to be admitted into evidence rests on two constitutional\nbases: \"the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and\n\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" United States\n\nv.   Dickerson,    530   U.S.   428,    433    (2000).        It    is       clear   that\n\nFaulkingham's      statements    to    the    agents   were    not       obtained      in\n\n\n      2\n          The district court in this case misapprehended Byram as\nsetting down a hard and fast test that fruits evidence must be\nsuppressed when \"[f]irst the Miranda violation [is] 'not merely\ntechnical.' Second, there [is] 'a substantial nexus between the\nviolation and the second statement.'     Third . . . 'the second\nstatement is not itself preceded by an adequate Miranda warning.'\"\nFaulkingham, 156 F. Supp. 2d at 69. (quoting Byram, 145 F.3d at\n410). This language from Byram is appropriately read as an attempt\nto identify and evaluate the competing interests presented in the\nspecific facts of that case, and not as creating a rigid test.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fviolation of the Due Process Clause, because an examination of \"the\n\ntotality   of    all    the    surrounding       circumstances     --    both   the\n\ncharacteristics        of     the   accused      and     the   details    of    the\ninterrogation,\" Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 226-27\n\n(1973), shows that Faulkingham expressed a willingness to cooperate\n\nwith the MDEA agents, and spoke freely to them about his supplier,\nwithout even being formally questioned by the agents.\n\n           It is also clear, however, that Faulkingham's statements\n\nwere obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment because he was\n\nnot given a Miranda warning.              As the district court correctly\n\ndecided,   his   statements         to   the    agents    should   therefore    be\n\nsuppressed. The question here is whether the reasons for mandating\n\na Miranda warning to offset the impact of an inherently coercive\ncustodial interrogation on an individual's Fifth Amendment rights\n\nnot to incriminate himself, Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 434-35, should\n\nalso lead to the suppression of derivative evidence, the leads to\nwhich are obtained from the statements of a defendant during an\n\nunwarned interrogation.             In other words, should the evidence\nderived from Faulkingham's statements, or fruits evidence, also be\n\nsuppressed because the agents violated the Miranda rule?                         In\n\nconsidering this question, it is important to keep in mind the\n\n\"twin rationales\" for Miranda: trustworthiness and deterrence.\n\nOregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 308 (1985).\n\n           In Elstad, the Supreme Court reversed the suppression of\n\nderivative evidence in the form of a later warned and voluntary\n\nstatement, after the initial statement was given without a Miranda\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fwarning, and was itself suppressed.        470 U.S. at 317-18.          The Court\n\nrejected the    application    of    the   fruit    of    the    poisonous   tree\n\nanalysis to determine whether the second statement should be\nsuppressed.    Instead, it focused on \"whether . . . the second\n\nstatement was . . . voluntarily made,\" and concluded that because\n\nit was voluntary, it was admissible in evidence.                Id. at 318.\n\n            After the Supreme Court's decision in Elstad, several\n\ncircuits adopted a flat rule that a Miranda violation may never\n\nlead to suppression of derivative evidence.                See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Sterling, 283 F.3d 216, 218-19 (4th Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. DeSumma, 272 F.3d 176, 179-81 (3d Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Sandoval, 894 F.2d 1043, 1047-48 (9th Cir.\n\n1990); United States v. Sangineto-Miranda, 859 F.2d 1501, 1517-18\n(6th Cir. 1988).\n\n            By contrast, this court has expressed the tentative view,\n\nin the absence of further guidance from the Supreme Court, that\nElstad \"does not wholly bar the door to excluding evidence derived\n\nfrom a Miranda violation -- at least where the Miranda violation is\n\nnot merely technical, where there is a substantial nexus between\n\nthe violation and the [fruits evidence], and where the [fruits\n\nevidence, in Byram a second statement made in open court,] is not\n\nitself preceded by an adequate Miranda warning.\"                Byram, 145 F.3d\n\nat 409-10.\n\n            There are at least three categories of evidence that may\n\nbe derivative fruits of an un-Mirandized confession: physical\n\nevidence,    statements   by   a    witness   who    is    not    the   unwarned\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdefendant, and later statements by the defendant himself after an\n\ninitial unwarned statement.     Our decision in Byram and the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Elstad involved the third category -- further\nstatements by the defendant. This case involves, instead, only the\n\nfirst two categories -- physical evidence and statements of another\n\nwitness.\n           It is entirely plausible to think that the admissibility\n\nof these three different categories of evidence derived from un-\n\nMirandized custodial statements should be analyzed in different\n\nways.3     Nonetheless,   the   Supreme   Court   thus   far   has   not\n\ndifferentiated in its analysis between the three categories of\n\nderivative evidence and, to the contrary, has used broad language,\n\ndiscouraging the use of the fruits doctrine following a Miranda\n\nviolation, whatever the nature of the derivative evidence. Elstad,\n\n470 U.S. at 307 (\"[T]he Miranda presumption . . . does not require\n\nthat the statements and their fruits be discarded as inherently\ntainted.\").   In deciding that the fruits doctrine did not apply to\n\nthe Miranda violations on the facts of Elstad, the Court had to\n\ndistinguish a violation of the Miranda rule from violations of\n\n\n     3\n          For example, it is arguable that further statements by a\ndefendant himself should be most easily suppressed as the\ndeterrence value of suppression is then high compared to the other\ntwo categories, and even later statements by a defendant may\ninvolve trustworthiness concerns. (But there is a counter-argument\nthat there is an intermediating opportunity for a later statement\nto be voluntary. Cf. Elstad, 470 U.S. at 347 & n.29 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting)). The limited role played by the distinction between\nthe categories of evidence here is to underline the lack of\ndeterrence value and absence of trustworthiness concerns about\nphysical evidence and statements of a third party, which are the\nsubject of the suppression order here.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fdifferent clauses of the Constitution to which the fruits doctrine\n\ndoes apply.\n\n               The most common application of the fruit of the poisonous\ntree       doctrine   is   as    a   remedy   for   violations    of   the   Fourth\n\nAmendment, which protects against unlawful arrests and searches.\n\nThe Supreme Court first articulated the fruits doctrine in a case\nwhere the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.                   Wong\n\nSun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963); see also Taylor v.\n\nAlabama, 457 U.S. 687, 689-93 (1982); Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S.\n\n200, 216-19 (1979).             The Court has also applied the doctrine to\n\nsome violations of the Fifth Amendment, Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S.\n\n431, 442 & n.3 (1984) (citing Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S.\n\n52, 79 (1964), which stated that the doctrine applied to the fruits\nof compelled in-court testimony), and to violations of the Sixth\n\nAmendment under the Massiah doctrine,4 id. at 442 (citing United\n\nStates v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967), which applied the fruits\ndoctrine to       courtroom       identifications     resulting   from   pretrial\n\nidentifications at which no defense counsel was present, id. at\n\n239-42).      Perhaps for that reason, Elstad discussed the particular\n\nFifth Amendment concerns protected by the Miranda rule.\n\n               Elstad drew a distinction between Fourth Amendment rights\n\nand Fifth Amendment rights, the latter being those that implicate\n\n\n       4\n          The Massiah doctrine guarantees the defendant's right to\ncounsel once a criminal proceeding has been initiated, and forbids\nthe government from \"'deliberately elicit[ing]' statements from the\ndefendant, in the absence of counsel and without a proper waiver.\"\nUnited States v. Labare, 191 F.3d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing\nMassiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964)).\n\n                                         -13-\n\fMiranda warnings, and said that \"a procedural Miranda violation\n\ndiffers in significant respects from violations of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.\"             Elstad, 470 U.S. at 306.              Elstad stated that the\npurpose of the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment is \"to\n\ndeter unreasonable searches, no matter how probative their fruits.\"\n\nId.        The    Fourth      Amendment     is    specifically       concerned         with   an\nindividual's privacy and security and so with the methodology that\n\nlaw enforcement officers use in their searches.                         Bustamonte, 412\n\nU.S.       at    242.        By   contrast,      Elstad     reasoned   that       the    Fifth\n\nAmendment, by its terms, \"is not concerned with non-testimonial\n\nevidence.          Nor       is   it   concerned     with    moral   and    psychological\n\npressures to confess emanating from sources other than official\n\ncoercion.\"         470 U.S. at 304-05 (citations omitted).                      Instead, the\nFifth Amendment is meant to safeguard the trustworthiness of\n\ntestimony at trial and the fairness of the trial.                               Id. at 308;\n\nBustamonte, 412 U.S. at 242.                  Once the un-Mirandized inculpatory\nstatements of the defendant are themselves suppressed, the role of\n\ndeterrence under the Fifth Amendment becomes less primary.                              As the\nCourt      stated       in    Bustamonte,     \"[t]he      guarantees       of    the    Fourth\n\nAmendment stand 'as a protection of quite different constitutional\n\nvalues'\" from those protected by the Fifth Amendment.                            412 U.S. at\n\n242 (quoting Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406,\n\n416 (1966)).5\n\n       5\n          In fact, the requirement that a Miranda warning be\nadministered by the police is often seen as a safe (though not\nimpregnable) harbor for the police, benefitting the police, perhaps\nmore than the defendant. R.A. Leo, Questioning the Relevance of\nMiranda in the Twenty-First Century, 99 Mich. L. Rev. 1000, 1021-22\n\n                                              -14-\n\f             Faulkingham argues that Elstad's continuing vitality has\n\nbeen called into question by Dickerson, which reaffirmed the status\n\nof Miranda's warning requirement as a constitutional rule binding\non the federal and state governments.             Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 438-\n\n41.    It is one thing, Faulkingham says, to decline to suppress\n\nevidence that is the fruit of a Miranda violation when there was a\ndoubt as to whether Miranda was a constitutionally grounded rule or\n\nwas merely a prophylactic procedure, as it was described in Elstad,\n\n470 U.S. at 306, and Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 444 (1974).\n\nIt is another, he argues, to fail to use the fruits doctrine now\n\nthat we know from Dickerson that Miranda is constitutionally\n\ngrounded.\n\n             We   agree   in    part    with    Faulkingham:     Dickerson     does\nstrengthen his claim.          But Dickerson does not itself win the day\n\nfor him.     Dickerson cited Elstad, without overruling it, stating\n\nthat   its   \"decision    in     that    case    --   refusing    to   apply    the\ntraditional 'fruits' doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases\n\n-- does not prove that Miranda is a nonconstitutional decision, but\n\nsimply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the\n\nFourth Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation under\n\n\n(2001) (\"By creating the opportunity for police to read suspects\ntheir constitutional rights and by allowing police to obtain a\nsigned waiver form that signifies consensual and non-coercive\ninterrogation, Miranda has helped the police shield themselves from\nevidentiary challenges. . . .\"); see also Dickerson, 530 U.S. at\n444 (noting that the Miranda rule is beneficial to law enforcement\nofficers because it is relatively easy \"to apply in a consistent\nmanner\").   As Dickerson notes, \"Miranda has become embedded in\nroutine police practice to the point where the warnings have become\npart of our national culture.\" 530 U.S. at 443.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fthe Fifth Amendment.\"          Id. at 440.         The various differences in\n\npurpose behind the Fourth and Fifth amendments, articulated in\n\nElstad, continue unchanged by Dickerson, and those differences\naffect the remedial options appropriate for violations of the two\n\ndistinct constitutional amendments, and, more specifically, for\n\nviolations of the Miranda rule.\n\n            Unlike some other circuits, we are unwilling, at least\n\nuntil the Supreme Court addresses the issue, to say that the\n\ninterest of      deterrence        may   never    lead   to   the   suppression    of\n\nderivative evidence from a Miranda violation. In Byram, this court\n\nsuppressed     both    the    original      unwarned     statements     and     later\n\nstatements made at trial.           The court considered the circumstances\n\nsurrounding both the original confession and the later statement.\nByram, 145 F.3d at 410.        Between the two statements, Byram was kept\n\nin jail without ready access to counsel, subpoenaed, given no new\n\nwarning, and deliberately asked questions by the prosecutor to\nelicit the same self-incriminating statements he had given earlier.\n\nId. at 410; cf. United States v. Esquilin, 208 F.3d 315, 318-21\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (suppressing the first un-Mirandized statement, but\n\nadmitting      the    post-Miranda        statements      after     examining     the\n\ncircumstances surrounding those statements and whether they were\n\nvoluntary); Tankleff v. Senkowski, 135 F.3d 235, 244-45 (2d Cir.\n\n1998) (after considering the \"totality of the circumstances,\" the\n\ncourt did not suppress the second statement because the defendant\n\nwas   warned    between      the    first   and    second     statements   and    the\n\nstatement was voluntary).\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f             But deterrence weighs less heavily on the Fifth Amendment\n\nlegal scale, which balances the value of the derivative evidence to\n\nthe truth seeking process against the protection of the defendant's\nFifth Amendment rights, once the defendant's own statements are\n\nsuppressed.     The balance, to the extent the Supreme Court's case\n\nlaw   may   permit    balancing,   necessarily    involves    weighing   the\nreliability of the unwarned derivative evidence against the need\n\nfor deterrence.      Here, the derivative evidence is itself reliable.\n\nFurther, the defendant's own statements were not coerced and were\n\nnot unreliable in the classic sense of involuntariness.                  See\n\nDickerson, 530 U.S. at 432-33 (stating that before Miranda, \"the\n\nlaw governing the admission of confessions\" was concerned with the\n\nunreliability of coerced confessions); Elstad, 470 U.S. at 304\n(same).     Where, as here, negligence is the reason that the police\n\nfailed to give a Miranda warning, the role of deterrence is weaker\n\nthan in a case, such as Byram, where the apparent reason the police\nfailed to give a warning was their intention to manipulate the\n\ndefendant into giving them information.\n             Faulkingham's    claim,   taking     all   the    surrounding\n\ncircumstances into account, simply does not tip the balance toward\n\na strong need for deterrence.      Faulkingham's statement was not the\n\nresult of \"coercive official tactics.\"          Faulkingham, 156 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 67 (internal quotations marks omitted) (quoting Byram, 145\n\nF.3d at 407).        There was no deliberate misconduct by the MDEA\n\nagents here.      There was no misleading or manipulation by the\n\ngovernment, as was true in Byram.          The findings of the magistrate\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fjudge and the trial judge give us no reason to think that the\n\nagents deliberately failed to give the warning in order to get to\n\nthe physical evidence or that they did so to get to another witness\nwho might or might not incriminate Faulkingham.                       The agents'\n\nnegligence resulted in the suppression of Faulkingham's confession,\n\nitself a detriment to the agents, who conceded at the suppression\nhearing that they did not administer the Miranda warning, and that\n\nthey should have done so.\n\n           In fact, Faulkingham himself started talking without much\n\nquestioning.     Agent Hutchings requested Faulkingham's cooperation,\n\nbut   Faulkingham,      on   his   own,   began   to     give   the     agents   the\n\ninformation about Mark Power. When Faulkingham told the agents the\n\ncrucial information that he must make the call to Power in the next\nfew   minutes,    the    agents    were    not    even    in    their    car     with\n\nFaulkingham.     They were in the process of searching Faulkingham's\n\ncar, and Faulkingham got their attention because he wanted to speak\nto them.\n\n           The facts of this case also do not raise any of the\n\nconcerns that are typically raised under other constitutional\n\nprovisions that do trigger the fruits doctrine: there is no Fourth\n\nAmendment violation and no violation of the right to counsel.                      In\n\naddition, there is nothing to shock the conscience of the court and\n\nno fundamental unfairness.           We do not say what the appropriate\n\nremedy would be if the facts surrounding the Miranda violation\n\ninvolved some of these other concerns or a very strong need for\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fdeterrence.     Perhaps the Supreme Court will address those facts\n\nbefore we need to do so.\n\n          We do hold, on the facts here, that Faulkingham's far\nweaker argument for recognition of a deterrence interest for\n\nsuppression   of    derivative   evidence   arising   from   a   negligent\n\nviolation of his Miranda rights is insufficient to carry the day.\n\n         Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the suppression\n\nmotion and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with\n\nthis opinion.      So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

On the day of his arrest he made inculpatory statements to agents of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA). The agents did not give the required warning under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), before Faulkingham made the statements. Faulkingham's own statements were thus ordered suppressed under <i>Miranda.</i> His statements, however, also led to the discovery of derivative evidence that was important to the government's case against him. That derivative evidence was testimony by a coconspirator and the drugs themselves, and it is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham argued, and the district court agreed, that the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, common to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, should also apply to the derivative evidence, given the facts of this particular <i>Miranda</i> violation under the Fifth Amendment. <i>United States v. Faulkingham,</i> 156 F.Supp.2d 60 (D.Me.2001). In the end, the court granted the motion to suppress, believing that \"suppression of the derivative evidence ... will serve to remind law enforcement that even in `the excitement of the moment' law enforcement retains an important duty to inform an individual taken into custody of his constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Individuals in custody should, of course, be informed of their rights. But we disagree that in this case the concerns that animate the Fifth Amendment require the suppression of the derivative evidence, as opposed to the suppression of Faulkingham's own unwarned statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We outline the facts in this case as found by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district judge, and supplemented from the record. On July 28, 2000, Mark Leonard, an agent of the MDEA, received information from a confidential informant that Faulkingham was a drug dealer who lived on Route 102 in Tremont, Maine, and drove a tan Lincoln Town Car. The confidential informant also told Leonard that Faulkingham's driver's license was suspended, a fact that Leonard confirmed later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, Leonard and another MDEA agent, Robert Hutchings, set off for Tremont to follow up on the information Leonard received from the confidential informant. On their way, the agents obtained a 1996 jail photograph of Faulkingham from the Hancock County Sheriff's Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the agents reached the residence, they observed it from their car, which was parked in a driveway not far away. At approximately 3:15 p.m., the agents saw a tan Lincoln Town Car leaving the driveway of the residence. They followed the Town Car, until it slowed down to a stop. Leonard and Hutchings thought the driver of the Town Car matched the person in the photograph of Faulkingham.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hutchings approached the car, showed his identification shield, said he was an MDEA agent, and told the driver to \"shut [his] car off, and get out of the car.\" Faulkingham identified himself. Hutchings conducted a patdown search and found cash, heroin, and a syringe on Faulkingham. Hutchings then arrested Faulkingham for operating his vehicle after suspension of his license, handcuffed him, and seated him in the back seat of the agents' car. Hutchings said to Faulkingham: \"[J]ust sit here. I don't want you to say anything to me at this point. I have some paperwork we're going to have to do. I have some paperwork I'm going to have to read to you.\" Hutchings also told Faulkingham that he was \"seek[ing][his] cooperation.\" Among the paperwork to which Hutchings referred was a form containing the <i>Miranda</i> warning, which, if signed, would confirm that Faulkingham had received the warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hutchings stored the evidence from the patdown search in the trunk of the car. When he returned to Faulkingham, he did not give him the <i>Miranda</i> warning, even though, as the magistrate judge noted, \"Hutchings understood that he had a suspect in custody that he intended to interrogate.\" <i>United States v. Faulkingham,</i> No. CRIM 01-04-B-S, 2001 WL 586667, at *2 (D.Me. May 29, 2001). Faulkingham told Hutchings that he would be sick in about two hours from heroin withdrawal. Hutchings explained to Faulkingham that if he got sick, the agents would \"get him medical attention.\" Faulkingham did not then show physical signs of being under the influence of any drugs, and the agents \"kept checking with\" Faulkingham throughout the process to see how he was feeling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, agent Leonard dealt with the two other passengers in the Town Car. After confirming that there were no warrants for the passengers, he told them they could leave, and they left the scene on foot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham told Hutchings that if he was going to cooperate, then the two passengers who were walking away would pose a problem. One of the passengers, Faulkingham said, was the roommate of his supplier, and as soon as he returned to his home \"the heroin will either be flushed or hidden or something.\" Faulkingham also asked the agents what type of deal he could get if he decided to cooperate. The agents explained that they were not authorized to make any deals, but would pass on information about his cooperation to the prosecutor, who could work out a deal with Faulkingham's attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leonard and Hutchings searched Faulkingham's car, but found no other significant evidence. While they were searching the car, Faulkingham's wife, who happened to drive by the scene, stopped in her red pickup truck. She was dismayed when Hutchings told her of Faulkingham's arrest and said Faulkingham had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program. Hutchings gave Faulkingham's wife permission to speak with him. Faulkingham apologized to her, and asked her to get some bail money and to call his attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the agents were finishing up their search of Faulkingham's car, Faulkingham got the agents' attention, and when they walked up to their car, he told them that if he was going to cooperate and be helpful to them, he would have to be on the phone with his supplier by 3:30 p.m. Hutchings and Leonard both realized that it was already 3:28 p.m. Leonard called the agents' supervisor, Peter Arno, to get instructions on how to proceed. Arno gave the agents permission to have Faulkingham contact his supplier and record the phone call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham asked the agents to leave the roadside so that he would not be seen. After releasing Faulkingham from the handcuffs, Hutchings drove the agents' car, with Faulkingham in it, to a marina about a mile away. Leonard followed them in the Town Car. At the marina, Faulkingham made a few attempts to contact his supplier, but he failed because of bad reception. Faulkingham also suspected that his supplier did not answer the phone because he did not recognize the caller ID number, or because the supplier's roommate had already informed the supplier of Faulkingham's arrest. The agents asked Faulkingham how he was feeling to be sure he was not yet sick.

When they arrived at Faulkingham's house, he did make contact with Mark Power, who he said was his supplier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Faulkingham told Power that he had been stopped by the police just for \"a driving thing,\" and had been released by the police. He also told Power that he should come over to the Faulkingham residence with the heroin in order to hide it because MDEA agents were in the area. Eventually, Power arrived at the residence. After being confronted by the agents, Power also agreed to cooperate, and drugs were seized from Power's residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the agents' contact with Faulkingham, they did not administer the <i>Miranda</i> warning to him.

They explained that lack of time and the rapid pace of the events on the day of the arrest were the reasons for their omission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham, Power, and another coconspirator were indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin and possessing heroin with the intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to the MDEA agents while in their custody, Mark Power's testimony, and the heroin to which Power's statements led the agents. The magistrate judge's decision recommended the motion as to Faulkingham's statements be granted because the agents did not give him the <i>Miranda</i> warning, but that the motion as to Power's statements and the physical evidence be denied, because the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine does not apply to the <i>Miranda</i> exclusionary rule. <i>Faulkingham,</i> 2001 WL 586667, at *5-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court modified the magistrate judge's recommended decision by applying the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine to this <i>Miranda</i> violation, and suppressing not only Faulkingham's custodial statements, but the derivative evidence of Power's statements and the drugs. <i>Faulkingham,</i> 156 F.Supp.2d 60. The district court appropriately rejected any per se application of the \"fruits\" doctrine to the <i>Miranda</i> violation, and made case-specific factual findings. <i>Id.</i> at 70. It found that the <i>Miranda</i> violation was not a technical one, and that it followed from that violation that Faulkingham did not knowingly and intelligently understand that he was waiving his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 70-71. The court found that all the derivative evidence at issue was obtained through Faulkingham's unwarned statements, and that the derivative evidence would not otherwise have been inevitably discovered. <i>Id.</i> at 71. The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's factual findings that there were no coercive official tactics by the police and that Faulkingham's statements were voluntary. <i>Id.</i> at 67-68. The court did not find that the agents had deliberately violated Faulkingham's <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>Id.</i> at 66. It stated, however, that their failure to give the warning was \"negligent, at best.\" <i>Id.</i> It then reasoned that \"Faulkingham's statements were coerced by the lack of a <i>Miranda</i> warning.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67. It concluded that the deterrence rationale for <i>Miranda</i> dictated the suppression of both Faulkingham's statements and the derivative evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government now appeals from the suppression order. It argues that the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine does not apply to <i>Miranda</i> violations. The government also argues that this court's opinion in <i>United States v. Byram,</i> 145 F.3d 405 (1st Cir.1998), on which the district court based its decision, does not apply to this case, and that even if the factors considered by the court in <i>Byram</i> were to be used here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the derivative evidence should not be suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal of a disposition of a motion to suppress, \"we accept the district court's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous and evaluate its legal conclusions de novo.\" <i>United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, we must determine anew whether the evidence obtained as a result of Faulkingham's unwarned statements should be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that a confession must be voluntary in order to be admitted into evidence rests on two constitutional bases: \"the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Dickerson v. United States,</i> 530 U.S. 428, 433, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000). It is clear that Faulkingham's statements to the agents were not obtained in violation of the Due Process Clause, because an examination of \"the totality of all the surrounding circumstances &#8212; both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation,\" <i>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. 218, 226-27, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), shows that Faulkingham expressed a willingness to cooperate with the MDEA agents, and spoke freely to them about his supplier, without even being formally questioned by the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also clear, however, that Faulkingham's statements were obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment because he was not given a <i>Miranda</i> warning. As the district court correctly decided, his statements to the agents should therefore be suppressed. The question here is whether the reasons for mandating a <i>Miranda</i> warning to offset the impact of an inherently coercive custodial interrogation on an individual's Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate himself, <i>Dickerson,</i> 530 U.S. at 434-35, 120 S.Ct. 2326, should also lead to the suppression of derivative evidence, the leads to which are obtained from the statements of a defendant during an unwarned interrogation. In other words, should the evidence derived from Faulkingham's statements, or fruits evidence, also be suppressed because the agents violated the <i>Miranda</i> rule? In considering this question, it is important to keep in mind the \"twin rationales\" for <i>Miranda:</i> trustworthiness and deterrence. <i>Oregon v. Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. 298, 308, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Elstad,</i> the Supreme Court reversed the suppression of derivative evidence in the form of a later warned and voluntary statement, after the initial statement was given without a <i>Miranda</i> warning, and was itself suppressed. 470 U.S. at 317-18, 105 S.Ct. 1285. The Court rejected the application of the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis to determine whether the second statement should be suppressed. Instead, it focused on \"whether ... the second statement was ... voluntarily made,\" and concluded that because it was voluntary, it was admissible in evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Elstad,</i> several circuits adopted a flat rule that a <i>Miranda</i> violation may never lead to suppression of derivative evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sterling,</i> 283 F.3d 216, 218-19 (4th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. DeSumma,</i> 272 F.3d 176, 179-81 (3d Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Sandoval,</i> 894 F.2d 1043, 1047-48 (9th Cir. 1990); <i>United States v. Sangineto-Miranda,</i> 859 F.2d 1501, 1517-18 (6th Cir. 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, this court has expressed the tentative view, in the absence of further guidance from the Supreme Court, that <i>Elstad</i> \"does not wholly bar the door to excluding evidence derived from a <i>Miranda</i> violation &#8212; at least where the <i>Miranda</i> violation is not merely technical, where there is a substantial nexus between the violation and the [fruits evidence], and where the [fruits evidence, in <i>Byram</i> a second statement made in open court,] is not itself preceded by an adequate <i>Miranda</i> warning.\" <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 409-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least three categories of evidence that may be derivative fruits of an un-<i>Mirandized</i> confession: physical evidence, statements by a witness who is not the unwarned defendant, and later statements by the defendant himself after an initial unwarned statement. Our decision in <i>Byram</i> and the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Elstad</i> involved the third category &#8212; further statements by the defendant. This case involves, instead, only the first two categories &#8212; physical evidence and statements of another witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is entirely plausible to think that the admissibility of these three different categories of evidence derived from un-<i>Mirandized</i> custodial statements should be analyzed in different ways.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Nonetheless, the Supreme Court thus far has not differentiated in its analysis between the three categories of derivative evidence and, to the contrary, has used broad language, discouraging the use of the fruits doctrine following a <i>Miranda</i> violation, whatever the nature of the derivative evidence. <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 307, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (\"[T]he <i>Miranda</i> presumption ... does not require that the statements and their fruits be discarded as inherently tainted.\"). In deciding that the fruits doctrine did not apply to the <i>Miranda</i> violations on the facts of <i>Elstad,</i> the Court had to distinguish a violation of the <i>Miranda</i> rule from violations of different clauses of the Constitution to which the fruits doctrine does apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most common application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is as a remedy for violations of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful arrests and searches. The Supreme Court first articulated the fruits doctrine in a case where the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated. <i>Wong Sun v. United States,</i> 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); <i>see also Taylor v. Alabama,</i> 457 U.S. 687, 689-93, 102 S.Ct. 2664, 73 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982); <i>Dunaway v. New York,</i> 442 U.S. 200, 216-19, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979). The Court has also applied the doctrine to some violations of the Fifth Amendment, <i>Nix v. Williams,</i> 467 U.S. 431, 442 &amp; n. 3, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984) (citing <i>Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n,</i> 378 U.S. 52, 79, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964), which stated that the doctrine applied to the fruits of compelled in-court testimony), and to violations of the Sixth Amendment under the <i>Massiah</i> doctrine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>id.</i> at 442, 104 S.Ct. 2501 (citing <i>United States v. Wade,</i> 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), which applied the fruits doctrine to courtroom identifications resulting from pretrial identifications at which no defense counsel was present, <i>id.</i> at 239-42, 87 S.Ct. 1926). Perhaps for that reason, <i>Elstad</i> discussed the particular Fifth Amendment concerns protected by the <i>Miranda</i> rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Elstad</i> drew a distinction between Fourth Amendment rights and Fifth Amendment rights, the latter being those that implicate <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and said that \"a procedural <i>Miranda</i> violation differs in significant respects from violations of the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 306, 105 S.Ct. 1285. <i>Elstad</i> stated that the purpose of the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment is \"to deter unreasonable searches, no matter how probative their fruits.\" <i>Id.</i> The Fourth Amendment is specifically concerned with an individual's privacy and security and so with the methodology that law enforcement officers use in their searches. <i>Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. at 242, 93 S.Ct. 2041. By contrast, <i>Elstad</i> reasoned that the Fifth Amendment, by its terms, \"is not concerned with non-testimonial evidence. Nor is it concerned with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.\" 470 U.S. at 304-05, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (citations omitted). Instead, the Fifth Amendment is meant to safeguard the trustworthiness of testimony at trial and the fairness of the trial. <i>Id.</i> at 308, 105 S.Ct. 1285; <i>Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. at 242, 93 S.Ct. 2041. Once the un-<i>Mirandized</i> inculpatory statements of the defendant are themselves suppressed, the role of deterrence under the Fifth Amendment becomes less primary. As the Court stated in <i>Bustamonte,</i> \"[t]he guarantees of the Fourth Amendment stand `as a protection of quite different constitutional values'\" from those protected by the Fifth Amendment. 412 U.S. at 242, 93 S.Ct. 2041 (quoting <i>Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott,</i> 382 U.S. 406, 416, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham argues that <i>Elstad's</i> continuing vitality has been called into question by <i>Dickerson,</i> which reaffirmed the status of <i>Miranda'</i>s warning requirement as a constitutional rule binding on the federal and state governments. <i>Dickerson,</i> 530 U.S. at 438-41, 120 S.Ct. 2326. It is one thing, Faulkingham says, to decline to suppress evidence that is the fruit of a <i>Miranda</i> violation when there was a doubt as to whether <i>Miranda</i> was a constitutionally grounded rule or was merely a prophylactic procedure, as it was described in <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 306, 105 S.Ct. 1285, and <i>Michigan v. Tucker,</i> 417 U.S. 433, 444, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974). It is another, he argues, to fail to use the fruits doctrine now that we know from <i>Dickerson</i> that <i>Miranda</i> is constitutionally grounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree in part with Faulkingham: <i>Dickerson</i> does strengthen his claim. But <i>Dickerson</i> does not itself win the day for him. <i>Dickerson</i> cited <i>Elstad,</i> without overruling it, stating that its \"decision in that case &#8212; refusing to apply the traditional `fruits' doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases &#8212; does not prove that <i>Miranda</i> is a nonconstitutional decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation under the Fifth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 440, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The various differences in purpose behind the Fourth and Fifth amendments, articulated in <i>Elstad,</i> continue unchanged by <i>Dickerson,</i> and those differences affect the remedial options appropriate for violations of the two distinct constitutional amendments, and, more specifically, for violations of the <i>Miranda</i> rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike some other circuits, we are unwilling, at least until the Supreme Court addresses the issue, to say that the interest of deterrence may never lead to the suppression of derivative evidence from a <i>Miranda</i> violation. In <i>Byram,</i> this court suppressed both the original unwarned statements and later statements made at trial. The court considered the circumstances surrounding both the original confession and the later statement. <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 410. Between the two statements, Byram was kept in jail without ready access to counsel, subpoenaed, given no new warning, and deliberately asked questions by the prosecutor to elicit the same self-incriminating statements he had given earlier. <i>Id.</i> at 410; <i>cf. United States v. Esquilin,</i> 208 F.3d 315, 318-21 (1st Cir.2000) (suppressing the first un-<i>Mirandized</i> statement, but admitting the post-<i>Miranda</i> statements after examining the circumstances surrounding those statements and whether they were voluntary); <i>Tankleff v. Senkowski,</i> 135 F.3d 235, 244-45 (2d Cir.1998) (after considering the \"totality of the circumstances,\" the court did not suppress the second statement because the defendant was warned between the first and second statements and the statement was voluntary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But deterrence weighs less heavily on the Fifth Amendment legal scale, which balances the value of the derivative evidence to the truth seeking process against the protection of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, once the defendant's own statements are suppressed. The balance, to the extent the Supreme Court's case law may permit balancing, necessarily involves weighing the reliability of the unwarned derivative evidence against the need for deterrence. Here, the derivative evidence is itself reliable. Further, the defendant's own statements were not coerced and were not unreliable in the classic sense of involuntariness. <i>See Dickerson,</i> 530 U.S. at 432-33, 120 S.Ct. 2326 (stating that before <i>Miranda,</i> \"the law governing the admission of confessions\" was concerned with the unreliability of coerced confessions); <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 304, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (same). Where, as here, negligence is the reason that the police failed to give a <i>Miranda</i> warning, the role of deterrence is weaker than in a case, such as <i>Byram,</i> where the apparent reason the police failed to give a warning was their intention to manipulate the defendant into giving them information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham's claim, taking all the surrounding circumstances into account, simply does not tip the balance toward a strong need for deterrence. Faulkingham's statement was not the result of \"coercive official tactics.\" <i>Faulkingham,</i> 156 F.Supp.2d at 67 (internal quotations marks omitted) (quoting <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 407). There was no deliberate misconduct by the MDEA agents here. There was no misleading or manipulation by the government, as was true in <i>Byram.</i> The findings of the magistrate judge and the trial judge give us no reason to think that the agents deliberately failed to give the warning in order to get to the physical evidence or that they did so to get to another witness who might or might not incriminate Faulkingham. The agents' negligence resulted in the suppression of Faulkingham's confession, itself a detriment to the agents, who conceded at the suppression hearing that they did not administer the <i>Miranda</i> warning, and that they should have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Faulkingham himself started talking without much questioning. Agent Hutchings requested Faulkingham's cooperation, but Faulkingham, on his own, began to give the agents the information about Mark Power. When Faulkingham told the agents the crucial information that he must make the call to Power in the next few minutes, the agents were not even in their car with Faulkingham. They were in the process of searching Faulkingham's car, and Faulkingham got their attention because he wanted to speak to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case also do not raise any of the concerns that are typically raised under other constitutional provisions that do trigger the fruits doctrine: there is no Fourth Amendment violation and no violation of the right to counsel. In addition, there is nothing to shock the conscience of the court and no fundamental unfairness. We do not say what the appropriate remedy would be if the facts surrounding the <i>Miranda</i> violation involved some of these other concerns or a very strong need for deterrence. Perhaps the Supreme Court will address those facts before we need to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do hold, on the facts here, that Faulkingham's far weaker argument for recognition of a deterrence interest for suppression of derivative evidence arising from a negligent violation of his <i>Miranda</i> rights is insufficient to carry the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the suppression motion and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Power, who later cooperated with the government and became a witness against Faulkingham, denied this and claimed that Faulkingham himself was the supplier.

Third ... `the second statement is not itself preceded by an adequate <i>Miranda</i> warning.'\" <i>Faulkingham,</i> 156 F.Supp.2d at 69. (quoting <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 410). This language from <i>Byram</i> is appropriately read as an attempt to identify and evaluate the competing interests presented in the specific facts of that case, and not as creating a rigid test.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For example, it is arguable that further statements by a defendant himself should be most easily suppressed as the deterrence value of suppression is then high compared to the other two categories, and even later statements by a defendant may involve trustworthiness concerns. (But there is a counter-argument that there is an intermediating opportunity for a later statement to be voluntary<i>Cf. Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 347 &amp; n. 29, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (Brennan, J., dissenting)). The limited role played by the distinction between the categories of evidence here is to underline the lack of deterrence value and absence of trustworthiness concerns about physical evidence and statements of a third party, which are the subject of the suppression order here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The<i>Massiah</i> doctrine guarantees the defendant's right to counsel once a criminal proceeding has been initiated, and forbids the government from \"`deliberately elicit[ing]' statements from the defendant, in the absence of counsel and without a proper waiver.\" <i>United States v.

On the day of his arrest he made inculpatory statements to agents of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (MDEA). The agents did not give the required warning under <i>Miranda v.

Faulkingham's own statements were thus ordered suppressed under <i>Miranda.</i> His statements, however, also led to the discovery of derivative evidence that was important to the government's case against him. That derivative evidence was testimony by a coconspirator and the drugs themselves, and it is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham argued, and the district court agreed, that the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, common to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, should also apply to the derivative evidence, given the facts of this particular <i>Miranda</i> violation under the Fifth Amendment. <i>United States v. Faulkingham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318226/united-states-v-faulkingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span> (D.Me.2001). In the end, the court granted the motion to suppress, believing that \"suppression of the derivative evidence ... will serve to remind law enforcement that even in `the excitement of the moment' law enforcement retains an important duty to inform an individual taken into custody of his constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Individuals in custody should, of course, be informed of their rights. But we disagree that in this case the concerns that animate the Fifth Amendment require the suppression of the derivative evidence, as opposed to the suppression of Faulkingham's own unwarned statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We outline the facts in this case as found by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district judge, and supplemented from the record. On July 28, 2000, Mark Leonard, an agent of the MDEA, received information from a confidential informant that Faulkingham was a drug dealer who lived on Route 102 in Tremont, Maine, and drove a tan Lincoln Town Car. The confidential informant also told Leonard that Faulkingham's driver's license was suspended, a fact that Leonard confirmed later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, Leonard and another MDEA agent, Robert Hutchings, set off for Tremont to follow up on the information Leonard received from the confidential informant. On their way, the agents obtained a 1996 jail photograph of Faulkingham from the Hancock County Sheriff's Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the agents reached the residence, they observed it from their car, which was parked in a driveway not far away. At approximately 3:15 p.m., the agents saw a tan Lincoln Town Car leaving the driveway of the residence. They followed the Town Car, until it slowed down to a stop. Leonard and Hutchings thought the driver of the Town Car matched the person in the photograph of Faulkingham.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hutchings approached the car, showed his identification shield, said he was an MDEA agent, and told the driver to \"shut [his] car off, and get out of the car.\" Faulkingham identified himself. Hutchings conducted a patdown search and found cash, heroin, and a syringe on Faulkingham. Hutchings then arrested Faulkingham for operating his vehicle after suspension of his license, handcuffed him, and seated him in the back seat of the agents' car. Hutchings said to Faulkingham: \"[J]ust sit here. I don't want you to say anything to me at this point. I have some paperwork we're going to have to do. I have some paperwork I'm going to have to read to you.\" Hutchings also told Faulkingham that he was \"seek[ing][his] cooperation.\" Among the paperwork to which Hutchings referred was a form containing the <i>Miranda</i> warning, which, if signed, would confirm that Faulkingham had received the warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hutchings stored the evidence from the patdown search in the trunk of the car. When he returned to Faulkingham, he did not give him the <i>Miranda</i> warning, even though, as the magistrate judge noted, \"Hutchings understood that he had a suspect in custody that he intended to interrogate.\" <i>United States v. Faulkingham,</i> No. CRIM 01-04-B-S, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">586667</span></span>, at *2 (D.Me. May 29, 2001). Faulkingham told Hutchings that he would be sick in about two hours from heroin withdrawal. Hutchings explained to Faulkingham that if he got sick, the agents would \"get him medical attention.\" Faulkingham did not then show physical signs of being under the influence of any drugs, and the agents \"kept checking with\" Faulkingham throughout the process to see how he was feeling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, agent Leonard dealt with the two other passengers in the Town Car. After confirming that there were no warrants for the passengers, he told them they could leave, and they left the scene on foot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham told Hutchings that if he was going to cooperate, then the two passengers who were walking away would pose a problem. One of the passengers, Faulkingham said, was the roommate of his supplier, and as soon as he returned to his home \"the heroin will either be flushed or hidden or something.\" Faulkingham also asked the agents what type of deal he could get if he decided to cooperate. The agents explained that they were not authorized to make any deals, but would pass on information about his cooperation to the prosecutor, who could work out a deal with Faulkingham's attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leonard and Hutchings searched Faulkingham's car, but found no other significant evidence. While they were searching the car, Faulkingham's wife, who happened to drive by the scene, stopped in her red pickup truck. She was dismayed when Hutchings told her of Faulkingham's arrest and said Faulkingham had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program. Hutchings gave Faulkingham's wife permission to speak with him. Faulkingham apologized to her, and asked her to get some bail money and to call his attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the agents were finishing up their search of Faulkingham's car, Faulkingham got the agents' attention, and when they walked up to their car, he told them that if he was going to cooperate and be helpful to them, he would have to be on the phone with his supplier by 3:30 p.m. Hutchings and Leonard both realized that it was already 3:28 p.m. Leonard called the agents' supervisor, Peter Arno, to get instructions on how to proceed. Arno gave the agents permission to have Faulkingham contact his supplier and record the phone call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham asked the agents to leave the roadside so that he would not be seen. After releasing Faulkingham from the handcuffs, Hutchings drove the agents' car, with Faulkingham in it, to a marina about a mile away. Leonard followed them in the Town Car. At the marina, Faulkingham made a few attempts to contact his supplier, but he failed because of bad reception. Faulkingham also suspected that his supplier did not answer the phone because he did not recognize the caller ID number, or because the supplier's roommate had already informed the supplier of Faulkingham's arrest. The agents asked Faulkingham how he was feeling to be sure he was not yet sick. Faulkingham continued to appear normal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Faulkingham could not reach his supplier from the marina, he persuaded the agents to go to his house and make the phone call from there. When they arrived at Faulkingham's house, he did make contact with Mark Power, who he said was his supplier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Faulkingham told Power that he had been stopped by the police just for \"a driving thing,\" and had been released by the police. He also told Power that he should come over to the Faulkingham residence with the heroin in order to hide it because MDEA agents were in the area. Eventually, Power arrived at the residence. After being confronted by the agents, Power also agreed to cooperate, and drugs were seized from Power's residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the agents' contact with Faulkingham, they did not administer the <i>Miranda</i> warning to him. At the suppression hearing, they conceded that they should have but had not done so. They explained that lack of time and the rapid pace of the events on the day of the arrest were the reasons for their omission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham, Power, and another coconspirator were indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin and possessing heroin with the intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to the MDEA agents while in their custody, Mark Power's testimony, and the heroin to which Power's statements led the agents. The magistrate judge's decision recommended the motion as to Faulkingham's statements be granted because the agents did not give him the <i>Miranda</i> warning, but that the motion as to Power's statements and the physical evidence be denied, because the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine does not apply to the <i>Miranda</i> exclusionary rule. <i>Faulkingham,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">586667</span></span>, at *5-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court modified the magistrate judge's recommended decision by applying the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine to this <i>Miranda</i> violation, and suppressing not only Faulkingham's custodial statements, but the derivative evidence of Power's statements and the drugs. <i>Faulkingham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2318226/united-states-v-faulkingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court appropriately rejected any per se application of the \"fruits\" doctrine to the <i>Miranda</i> violation, and made case-specific factual findings. <i>Id.</i> at 70. It found that the <i>Miranda</i> violation was not a technical one, and that it followed from that violation that Faulkingham did not knowingly and intelligently understand that he was waiving his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 70-71. The court found that all the derivative evidence at issue was obtained through Faulkingham's unwarned statements, and that the derivative evidence would not otherwise have been inevitably discovered. <i>Id.</i> at 71. The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's factual findings that there were no coercive official tactics by the police and that Faulkingham's statements were voluntary. <i>Id.</i> at 67-68. The court did not find that the agents had deliberately violated Faulkingham's <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>Id.</i> at 66. It stated, however, that their failure to give the warning was \"negligent, at best.\" <i>Id.</i> It then reasoned that \"Faulkingham's statements were coerced by the lack of a <i>Miranda</i> warning.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67. It concluded that the deterrence rationale for <i>Miranda</i> dictated the suppression of both Faulkingham's statements and the derivative evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government now appeals from the suppression order.

Thus, we must determine anew whether the evidence obtained as a result of Faulkingham's unwarned statements should be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that a confession must be voluntary in order to be admitted into evidence rests on two constitutional bases: \"the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Dickerson v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (2000). It is clear that Faulkingham's statements to the agents were not obtained in violation of the Due Process Clause, because an examination of \"the totality of all the surrounding circumstances &#8212; both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation,\" <i>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108800\"><a href=\"/opinion/108800/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 226-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108800\"><a href=\"/opinion/108800/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the district court correctly decided, his statements to the agents should therefore be suppressed. The question here is whether the reasons for mandating a <i>Miranda</i> warning to offset the impact of an inherently coercive custodial interrogation on an individual's Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate himself, <i>Dickerson,</i> 530 U.S. at 434-35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2326</span></a></span>, should also lead to the suppression of derivative evidence, the leads to which are obtained from the statements of a defendant during an unwarned interrogation. In other words, should the evidence derived from Faulkingham's statements, or fruits evidence, also be suppressed because the agents violated the <i>Miranda</i> rule? In considering this question, it is important to keep in mind the \"twin rationales\" for <i>Miranda:</i> trustworthiness and deterrence. <i>Oregon v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2326</span></a></span>. It is one thing, Faulkingham says, to decline to suppress evidence that is the fruit of a <i>Miranda</i> violation when there was a doubt as to whether <i>Miranda</i> was a constitutionally grounded rule or was merely a prophylactic procedure, as it was described in <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 306, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111364\"><a href=\"/opinion/111364/oregon-v-elstad/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span> (1974). It is another, he argues, to fail to use the fruits doctrine now that we know from <i>Dickerson</i> that <i>Miranda</i> is constitutionally grounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree in part with Faulkingham: <i>Dickerson</i> does strengthen his claim. But <i>Dickerson</i> does not itself win the day for him. <i>Dickerson</i> cited <i>Elstad,</i> without overruling it, stating that its \"decision in that case &#8212; refusing to apply the traditional `fruits' doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases &#8212; does not prove that <i>Miranda</i> is a nonconstitutional decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment are different from unwarned interrogation under the Fifth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 440, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>. The various differences in purpose behind the Fourth and Fifth amendments, articulated in <i>Elstad,</i> continue unchanged by <i>Dickerson,</i> and those differences affect the remedial options appropriate for violations of the two distinct constitutional amendments, and, more specifically, for violations of the <i>Miranda</i> rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike some other circuits, we are unwilling, at least until the Supreme Court addresses the issue, to say that the interest of deterrence may never lead to the suppression of derivative evidence from a <i>Miranda</i> violation. In <i>Byram,</i> this court suppressed both the original unwarned statements and later statements made at trial. The court considered the circumstances surrounding both the original confession and the later statement. <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 410. Between the two statements, Byram was kept in jail without ready access to counsel, subpoenaed, given no new warning, and deliberately asked questions by the prosecutor to elicit the same self-incriminating statements he had given earlier. <i>Id.</i> at 410; <i>cf. United States v. Esquilin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198872\"><a href=\"/opinion/198872/united-states-v-esquilin/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 318-21 (1st Cir.2000) (suppressing the first un-<i>Mirandized</i> statement, but admitting the post-<i>Miranda</i> statements after examining the circumstances surrounding those statements and whether they were voluntary); <i>Tankleff v. Senkowski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751346\"><a href=\"/opinion/751346/martin-h-tankleff-v-da-senkowski-superintendent-of-clinton/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 244-45 (2d Cir.1998) (after considering the \"totality of the circumstances,\" the court did not suppress the second statement because the defendant was warned between the first and second statements and the statement was voluntary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But deterrence weighs less heavily on the Fifth Amendment legal scale, which balances the value of the derivative evidence to the truth seeking process against the protection of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, once the defendant's own statements are suppressed. The balance, to the extent the Supreme Court's case law may permit balancing, necessarily involves weighing the reliability of the unwarned derivative evidence against the need for deterrence. Here, the derivative evidence is itself reliable. Further, the defendant's own statements were not coerced and were not unreliable in the classic sense of involuntariness. <i>See Dickerson,</i> 530 U.S. at 432-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2326</span></a></span> (stating that before <i>Miranda,</i> \"the law governing the admission of confessions\" was concerned with the unreliability of coerced confessions); <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 304, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111364\"><a href=\"/opinion/111364/oregon-v-elstad/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span> (same). Where, as here, negligence is the reason that the police failed to give a <i>Miranda</i> warning, the role of deterrence is weaker than in a case, such as <i>Byram,</i> where the apparent reason the police failed to give a warning was their intention to manipulate the defendant into giving them information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faulkingham's claim, taking all the surrounding circumstances into account, simply does not tip the balance toward a strong need for deterrence. Faulkingham's statement was not the result of \"coercive official tactics.\" <i>Faulkingham,</i> 156 F.Supp.2d at 67 (internal quotations marks omitted) (quoting <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 407). There was no deliberate misconduct by the MDEA agents here. There was no misleading or manipulation by the government, as was true in <i>Byram.</i> The findings of the magistrate judge and the trial judge give us no reason to think that the agents deliberately failed to give the warning in order to get to the physical evidence or that they did so to get to another witness who might or might not incriminate Faulkingham. The agents' negligence resulted in the suppression of Faulkingham's confession, itself a detriment to the agents, who conceded at the suppression hearing that they did not administer the <i>Miranda</i> warning, and that they should have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Faulkingham himself started talking without much questioning. Agent Hutchings requested Faulkingham's cooperation, but Faulkingham, on his own, began to give the agents the information about Mark Power. When Faulkingham told the agents the crucial information that he must make the call to Power in the next few minutes, the agents were not even in their car with Faulkingham. They were in the process of searching Faulkingham's car, and Faulkingham got their attention because he wanted to speak to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case also do not raise any of the concerns that are typically raised under other constitutional provisions that do trigger the fruits doctrine: there is no Fourth Amendment violation and no violation of the right to counsel. In addition, there is nothing to shock the conscience of the court and no fundamental unfairness. We do not say what the appropriate remedy would be if the facts surrounding the <i>Miranda</i> violation involved some of these other concerns or a very strong need for deterrence. Perhaps the Supreme Court will address those facts before we need to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do hold, on the facts here, that Faulkingham's far weaker argument for recognition of a deterrence interest for suppression of derivative evidence arising from a negligent violation of his <i>Miranda</i> rights is insufficient to carry the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the suppression motion and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Power, who later cooperated with the government and became a witness against Faulkingham, denied this and claimed that Faulkingham himself was the supplier. In deciding the motion to suppress, the district court had no need to resolve this conflict, and neither do we</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court in this case misapprehended<i>Byram</i> as setting down a hard and fast test that fruits evidence must be suppressed when \"[f]irst the <i>Miranda</i> violation [is] `not merely technical.' Second, there [is] `a substantial nexus between the violation and the second statement.' Third ... `the second statement is not itself preceded by an adequate <i>Miranda</i> warning.'\" <i>Faulkingham,</i> 156 F.Supp.2d at 69. (quoting <i>Byram,</i> 145 F.3d at 410). This language from <i>Byram</i> is appropriately read as an attempt to identify and evaluate the competing interests presented in the specific facts of that case, and not as creating a rigid test.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For example, it is arguable that further statements by a defendant himself should be most easily suppressed as the deterrence value of suppression is then high compared to the other two categories, and even later statements by a defendant may involve trustworthiness concerns. (But there is a counter-argument that there is an intermediating opportunity for a later statement to be voluntary<i>Cf. Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 347 &amp; n. 29, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111364\"><a href=\"/opinion/111364/oregon-v-elstad/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span> (Brennan, J., dissenting)). The limited role played by the distinction between the categories of evidence here is to underline the lack of deterrence value and absence of trustworthiness concerns about physical evidence and statements of a third party, which are the subject of the suppression order here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The<i>Massiah</i> doctrine guarantees the defendant's right to counsel once a criminal proceeding has been initiated, and forbids the government from \"`deliberately elicit[ing]' statements from the defendant, in the absence of counsel and without a proper waiver.\" <i>United States v.
