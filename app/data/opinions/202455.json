Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Torruella and Dyk,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William D. Weinreb, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Frank J. McGee, on brief, for appellee.\n     Judith H. Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nDefender Office, with whom Miriam Conrad, Federal Public Defender,\nDistricts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, was on\nbrief, as amicus curiae in support of appellee.\n\n\n\n                         October 13, 2006\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA,      Circuit   Judge.      On    September     10,   2003,\n\nappellee Michael Malouf (\"Malouf\") was charged in Count One of a\n\ntwo-count indictment with conspiracy to distribute, and to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute, five kilograms or more of cocaine and an\n\nunspecified amount of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841\n\n(a)(1) and 846. Section 841(b)(1)(B) imposes upon a defendant with\n\na prior felony conviction a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\n\nfor offenses involving 500 grams or more of a substance containing\n\ncocaine.    On May 28, 2004, Malouf pled guilty to the indictment,\n\nbut   he   reserved   the    right    to    contest    the   amount   of    drugs\n\nspecifically attributable to him.           At sentencing, the court found\n\nthat the government had proved by a fair preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Malouf was responsible for more than 500 grams of\n\ncocaine.    However, the court found that the government had not\n\nproved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.              Because the district\n\ncourt found that a fact that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence\n\nmust be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge sentenced\n\nMalouf to 60 months' imprisonment.             After careful consideration,\n\nwe reverse.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            In 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\")\n\nundertook an investigation of drug trafficking in the South Shore\n\narea of Massachusetts.       Stephen Nicholson (\"Nicholson\") was one of\n\nthe initial targets of the investigation and he would ultimately be\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fone of Malouf's co-defendants.        Between April 14 and June 13 2002,\n\nthe   government    intercepted    Nicholson's   telephone   calls.   The\n\nwiretap surveillance revealed that Nicholson was selling ounce\n\nquantities of cocaine to various buyers and that Malouf was his\n\nprimary    customer.     The      government   also   conducted   physical\n\nsurveillance of Nicholson and Malouf, among others.\n\n           At the change of plea hearing on May 28, 2004, Malouf\n\npled guilty to the charge of conspiracy to distribute, and to\n\npossess with intent to distribute, five kilograms or more of\n\ncocaine and a quantity of marijuana in violation of §§ 841(a)(1)\n\nand 846.   The government described the minimum applicable penalty\n\nas follows:        \"because the defendant has a prior felony drug\n\nconviction and an 851 information1 has been filed, if he's found\n\naccountable for 500 grams or more of cocaine he'd be subject to a\n\nten-year minimum mandatory sentence and a minimum mandatory eight-\n\nyear term of supervised release.\"          Malouf admitted that he had\n\n\n1\n   21 U.S.C. § 851 provides that, where the government seeks to\nestablish prior convictions for the purpose of increasing the\napplicable criminal penalties for a drug offense under § 841, the\nproper procedure is as follows:\n\n      No person who stands convicted of an offense under this\n      part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason\n      of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or\n      before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States\n      attorney files an information with the court (and serves\n      a copy of such information on the person or counsel for\n      the person) stating in writing the previous convictions\n      to be relied upon.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(1).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fconspired with Nicholson and others to distribute cocaine and\n\nmarijuana, and he agreed that the conspiracy-wide total drug weight\n\nexceeded    500   grams.       However,    he   notified      the   court    of   his\n\nintention    to     contest     the     quantity      of   drugs     specifically\n\nattributable to him at sentencing.\n\n            At the sentencing hearing on December 20, 2004, Malouf's\n\ncounsel again indicated that he intended to contest certain of the\n\nalleged cocaine transactions. The court then directed both parties\n\nto submit memoranda identifying the contested transactions and\n\nestablishing      their     competing   interpretations        of   the     relevant\n\nintercepted telephone calls.\n\n            On January 27, 2005, the government submitted a Corrected\n\nSentencing Memorandum and chart alleging that Malouf participated\n\nin eighteen separate cocaine transactions involving approximately\n\n20.5 ounces (581 grams) of cocaine during, or immediately prior to,\n\nthe   wiretap     period.      Malouf     contested    four    of   the     eighteen\n\ntransactions.      At the sentencing hearing on March 15, 2005, Malouf\n\nfirst contested an alleged two-ounce (56.7-gram) transaction that\n\noccurred two days prior to the April 14, 2002, commencement of the\n\nwiretap period.      Malouf challenged this transaction solely on the\n\nground that it fell outside of the wiretap period.                    Because the\n\ncourt found that Malouf was not challenging the drug quantity or\n\nthe government's interpretation of the telephone calls referring to\n\nthe transaction, the court dismissed Malouf's objection.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            Next, Malouf contested an alleged one-ounce (28.35-gram)\n\ntransaction on April 25 and another on April 27 on the ground that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence that they actually transpired. The\n\ncourt agreed that the evidence was insufficient to prove either\n\ntransaction, resulting in a 56.7-gram reduction of the total drug\n\nquantity attributable to him.\n\n            Finally, Malouf challenged the alleged June 11 one-ounce\n\n(28.35-gram) transaction.           Although Malouf did not contest the\n\ngovernment's interpretation of a telephone conversation on that\n\ndate in which he and Nicholson discussed a cocaine transaction that\n\nwas to take place later that day, he argued that \"there's no\n\nevidence that the meeting ever happened.\" The government urged the\n\ncourt to infer that the meeting took place because there were \"no\n\nother phone calls afterward indicating that it did not take place.\"\n\nBecause   it   was   clear   that    the   applicability   of   the   ten-year\n\nmandatory minimum would turn on the court's determination as to the\n\nJune 11 transaction, the court continued the sentencing hearing and\n\ninvited both parties to provide additional evidence.\n\n            When the sentencing hearing resumed on March 23, 2005,\n\nneither party presented new evidence as to the June 11 transaction.\n\nThe critical issue was whether the appropriate legal standard by\n\nwhich to judge a fact triggering a mandatory minimum sentence was\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt or by a fair preponderance of the\n\nevidence.      The court determined that \"facts which determine a\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmandatory minimum ought to go before a jury,\" or, if both parties\n\nagree to waive a jury trial, the sentencing judge \"stands in the\n\nshoes of the jury, and the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe government objected on the ground that \"there's no right under\n\nthe Sixth Amendment, the due process clause or any other source of\n\nlaw to a jury trial or beyond a reasonable doubt standard with\n\nrespect to any sentencing fact, the determination of which would\n\nresult in a sentence below the statutory maximum.\"   When the court\n\ndismissed the government's objection, the government agreed to\n\nwaive any jury trial right.\n\n          The court determined that although it would find that the\n\nJune 11 transaction had occurred as alleged if the applicable\n\nstandard was a fair preponderance of the evidence, it \"could not\n\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the transaction had in\n\nfact taken place.   As a result, the court declined to hold Malouf\n\naccountable for the one ounce (28.35 grams) he allegedly purchased\n\nin the June 11 transaction.   The court thus concluded that Malouf\n\nwas accountable for a total of only 17.5 ounces (496.125 grams).\n\nBecause the total was less than 500 grams of cocaine, the ten-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence did not apply.    Malouf's base offense\n\nlevel was 26, and the court reduced it to 23 for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility. Malouf's criminal history category was IV, but the\n\ncourt brought it down to III because \"at least two points of the\n\ncriminal history derived from [his] addiction problems.\"       The\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fguidelines sentencing range was 57 to 71 months, and the court\n\nsentenced Malouf to 60 months' imprisonment and a six-year term of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n              On June 14, 2005, the district court issued a written\n\nopinion   addressing     four     separate    issues   pertaining   to   the\n\nsentencing of Malouf.     United States v. Malouf, 377 F. Supp. 2d 315\n\n(D.   Mass.    2005).    Explaining    the    logic    underlying   Malouf's\n\nsentence, the district court asked,\n\n              (1) Do the drug quantities outlined in 21\n              U.S.C. § 841 comprise elements of offenses, or\n              sentencing factors? If the former, the\n              relevant case is Apprendi, a jury trial is\n              required and the standard of proof is beyond a\n              reasonable doubt; if the latter, it is Harris,\n              drug quantity can be determined by a judge,\n              and the standard is a fair preponderance of\n              the evidence. (2) What is the continued\n              efficacy of Harris in the light of the Court's\n              rulings in Blakely and Booker? (3) What is a\n              district court to do when the First Circuit's\n              interpretation of § 841 relies on Supreme\n              Court precedent which predates Blakely and\n              Booker? (4) In the alternative, however the\n              facts are characterized (as sentencing factors\n              or elements), where facts have a significant,\n              indeed determinative impact, does the Due\n              Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment require\n              the application of the beyond a reasonable\n              doubt standard?\n\nId. at 317.\n\n              As to the first issue, the court found that \"§ 841 is an\n\noffense-defining statutory provision, all elements of which must be\n\ntried before the jury.\"         Id. at 328.    As to the second question,\n\nthe district court determined that \"the breadth of the holdings in\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fBooker and Blakely have in fact overruled Harris.\"            Id. at 326.\n\nWith regard to the third issue, although the court acknowledged\n\nthat our decision in United States v. Goodine, 326 F.3d 26 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) required a different result, it determined that Goodine\n\nwas not binding because of its \"reliance on Supreme Court precedent\n\nwhich is crumbling.\"     Id. at 325.    Finally, as to the due process\n\nissue, the court found that quantity must be proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt \"[i]f a substantial sentence hinges on a finding\n\nof a specific quantity\" because in such cases courts \"should have\n\na high degree of confidence in this finding.\"           Id. at 329.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          The government argues on appeal that the district court\n\nerred by refusing to impose on Malouf a ten-year mandatory minimum\n\nsentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(B)(1)(b) despite finding by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that he was accountable for more than\n\n500 grams of cocaine.    The government challenges only the district\n\ncourt's legal determinations, which we review de novo.              Goodine,\n\n326 F.3d at 27.\n\n          A.    Harris\n\n          The   government   first     contests   the    district     court's\n\nconclusion that the Supreme Court's decisions in United States v.\n\nBooker and Blakely v. Washington overruled its earlier opinions in\n\nHarris v. United States and McMillan v. Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                      1.   Relevant Precedent\n\n              We begin with a brief discussion of relevant Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.      In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, the Court sustained\n\na   statute    that   allowed   the   sentencing   judge   to   find,   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, a fact that increased the minimum\n\npenalty for a crime.        477 U.S. 79, 79 (1986).        In McMillan, the\n\nCourt distinguished between offense elements, which must be proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and         sentencing factors, which may be\n\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence.         Id. at 91.   In Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, the Court held that \"any fact that increases the\n\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"              530\n\nU.S. 466, 490 (2000) (emphasis added).          Two years later in Harris,\n\nthe Court held that Apprendi did not apply to facts that increase\n\nthe mandatory minimum sentence and reaffirmed McMillan.            536 U.S.\n\n545, 545 (2002) (emphasis added).           In Blakely v. Washington, the\n\nCourt found unconstitutional a state trial court's imposition of a\n\nsentence that was above the statutory maximum, on the basis of the\n\njudge's finding of fact.        542 U.S. 296, 305 (2004).       The Blakely\n\ncourt held that \"the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes is\n\nthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the\n\nfacts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\"\n\nId. at 303.      Finally, in United States v. Booker, the Court held\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthat the reasoning of Blakely should be applied to the Federal\n\nSentencing Guidelines.          543 U.S. 220, 226-27 (2005).\n\n                     2.    The district court's analysis\n\n          The district court in the case before us reasoned that\n\nBlakely and Booker actually \"broadened Apprendi by requiring that\n\nall facts 'which the law makes essential to the punishment' be\n\nsubject to Sixth Amendment protections.\"            Malouf, 377 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 324.      The judge determined further that Blakely and Booker\n\nevince the Court's movement toward an \"impact test\" that focuses\n\nmore on \"the impact of such facts upon punishment, rather than on\n\nthe formalistic distinctions between sentencing factors and offense\n\nelements.\"     Id.     According to the district court, this \"impact\n\ntest\" approach \"necessarily casts doubt on Harris' distinction\n\nbetween mandatory minimum provisions and statutory maximums.\"               Id.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded, \"[i]n my judgment, the breadth of\n\nthe holdings in Booker and Blakely have in fact overruled Harris.\n\nThe Court has gone from holding that the Sixth Amendment is\n\nimplicated in the determination of facts that increase a statutory\n\nmaximum (Apprendi) to applying the Sixth Amendment to all facts\n\n'essential to the punishment' (Booker and Blakely).\"               Id. at 326\n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n          We    need      not   delve   deeper   into   the   district   court<s\n\nanalysis because, since its opinion issued on June 14, 2005, we\n\nhave had cause to consider the continued vitality of Harris in\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\flight of subsequent Supreme Court case law.                 Approximately ten\n\nmonths after the district court decided Malouf, we decided the case\n\nof United States v. Lizardo, in which we held that \"Booker left\n\nintact the Supreme Court's precedent in Harris, which allowed the\n\nuse of judicially found facts to increase a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence.\"    445 F.3d 73, 90 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           B.    Goodine\n\n           The district court concluded that even if Harris remains\n\ngood law, § 841 \"is an offense-defining statutory provision, all\n\nelements of which must be tried before the jury.\"                Malouf, 377 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 328.         This finding is directly contrary to -- and\n\nforeclosed by -- Goodine in which we held that \"drug quantity for\n\npurposes of § 841 is a sentencing factor that may be determined by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.\"             326 F.3d at 32.        Goodine was\n\ndecided after Apprendi and Harris but before Booker and Blakely.\n\nThe district court found that it was not bound by Goodine because\n\nthat   opinion    was    based   on   Supreme    Court   precedent     \"which   is\n\ncrumbling.\"      Malouf, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 325.            As we have since\n\nheld in Lizardo, we are bound by Goodine.           Lizardo, 445 F.3d at 90.\n\n           We    tarry    here   to   reaffirm    that   there   are    only    two\n\nexceptions to the principle that newly constituted panels are bound\n\nby decisions of prior panels in the same circuit.            As to the first,\n\n\"[a]n existing panel decision may be undermined by controlling\n\nauthority, subsequently announced, such as an opinion of the\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fSupreme Court, an en banc opinion of the circuit court, or a\n\nstatutory overruling.\"        United States v. Guzmán, 419 F.3d 27, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWith regard to the second exception which \"operates in instances\n\nthat fairly may be described as hen's-teeth rare, authority that\n\npostdates the original decision, although not directly controlling,\n\nmay nevertheless offer a compelling reason for believing that the\n\nformer panel, in light of new developments, would change its\n\ncollective mind.\"      Id.   Neither exception applies in this case.     As\n\nwe discussed in the previous section, Harris remains good law after\n\nBlakely and Booker, and there is no other reason for us to\n\ncontravene our own precedent.        Goodine is binding on this circuit\n\nand the district court erred when it concluded otherwise.\n\n           C.     Due Process\n\n           The district court made an alternative finding that even\n\nif drug quantity is a sentencing factor under § 841, it must be\n\nproven   beyond    a   reasonable   doubt   because   of   the   protections\n\nafforded by the due process provision of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nCiting a \"new concern for procedural fairness in the finding of\n\nfacts,\" the district court held that \"[i]f a substantial sentence\n\nhinges on a finding of a specific quantity, then . . . I (and the\n\npublic) should have a high degree of confidence in this finding,\"\n\nand thus the quantity finding must be proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Malouf, 377 F.

The    Court    noted       that\n\n\"sentencing courts have always operated without constitutionally\n\nimposed      burdens      of   proof\"     and    that     the       visible    possession\n\nrequirement, despite triggering a mandatory minimum penalty, did\n\nnot implicate the Due Process Clause because it \"neither alters the\n\nmaximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate\n\noffense calling for a separate penalty.\"                      Id. at 92 n.8, 87-88.\n\nThe same is true here with respect to drug quantity, insofar as it\n\ndetermines the mandatory minimum sentence.\n\n                                          III.\n\n              For   the    foregoing      reasons,       we   reverse       the     district\n\ncourt's decision and remand for sentencing in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n              Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f",

On    September     10,   2003,\n\nappellee Michael Malouf (\"Malouf\") was charged in Count One of a\n\ntwo-count indictment with conspiracy to distribute, and to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute, five kilograms or more of cocaine and an\n\nunspecified amount of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841\n\n(a)(1) and 846. Section 841(b)(1)(B) imposes upon a defendant with\n\na prior felony conviction a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\n\nfor offenses involving 500 grams or more of a substance containing\n\ncocaine.    On May 28, 2004, Malouf pled guilty to the indictment,\n\nbut   he   reserved   the    right    to    contest    the   amount   of    drugs\n\nspecifically attributable to him.           At sentencing, the court found\n\nthat the government had proved by a fair preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Malouf was responsible for more than 500 grams of\n\ncocaine.    However, the court found that the government had not\n\nproved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.              Because the district\n\ncourt found that a fact that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence\n\nmust be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge sentenced\n\nMalouf to 60 months' imprisonment.             After careful consideration,\n\nwe reverse.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            In 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\")\n\nundertook an investigation of drug trafficking in the South Shore\n\narea of Massachusetts.       Stephen Nicholson (\"Nicholson\") was one of\n\nthe initial targets of the investigation and he would ultimately be\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fone of Malouf's co-defendants.        Between April 14 and June 13 2002,\n\nthe   government    intercepted    Nicholson's   telephone   calls.   The\n\nwiretap surveillance revealed that Nicholson was selling ounce\n\nquantities of cocaine to various buyers and that Malouf was his\n\nprimary    customer.     The      government   also   conducted   physical\n\nsurveillance of Nicholson and Malouf, among others.\n\n           At the change of plea hearing on May 28, 2004, Malouf\n\npled guilty to the charge of conspiracy to distribute, and to\n\npossess with intent to distribute, five kilograms or more of\n\ncocaine and a quantity of marijuana in violation of §§ 841(a)(1)\n\nand 846.   The government described the minimum applicable penalty\n\nas follows:        \"because the defendant has a prior felony drug\n\nconviction and an 851 information1 has been filed, if he's found\n\naccountable for 500 grams or more of cocaine he'd be subject to a\n\nten-year minimum mandatory sentence and a minimum mandatory eight-\n\nyear term of supervised release.\"          Malouf admitted that he had\n\n\n1\n   21 U.S.C. § 851 provides that, where the government seeks to\nestablish prior convictions for the purpose of increasing the\napplicable criminal penalties for a drug offense under § 841, the\nproper procedure is as follows:\n\n      No person who stands convicted of an offense under this\n      part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason\n      of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or\n      before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States\n      attorney files an information with the court (and serves\n      a copy of such information on the person or counsel for\n      the person) stating in writing the previous convictions\n      to be relied upon.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(1).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fconspired with Nicholson and others to distribute cocaine and\n\nmarijuana, and he agreed that the conspiracy-wide total drug weight\n\nexceeded    500   grams.       However,    he   notified      the   court    of   his\n\nintention    to     contest     the     quantity      of   drugs     specifically\n\nattributable to him at sentencing.\n\n            At the sentencing hearing on December 20, 2004, Malouf's\n\ncounsel again indicated that he intended to contest certain of the\n\nalleged cocaine transactions. The court then directed both parties\n\nto submit memoranda identifying the contested transactions and\n\nestablishing      their     competing   interpretations        of   the     relevant\n\nintercepted telephone calls.\n\n            On January 27, 2005, the government submitted a Corrected\n\nSentencing Memorandum and chart alleging that Malouf participated\n\nin eighteen separate cocaine transactions involving approximately\n\n20.5 ounces (581 grams) of cocaine during, or immediately prior to,\n\nthe   wiretap     period.      Malouf     contested    four    of   the     eighteen\n\ntransactions.      At the sentencing hearing on March 15, 2005, Malouf\n\nfirst contested an alleged two-ounce (56.7-gram) transaction that\n\noccurred two days prior to the April 14, 2002, commencement of the\n\nwiretap period.      Malouf challenged this transaction solely on the\n\nground that it fell outside of the wiretap period.                    Because the\n\ncourt found that Malouf was not challenging the drug quantity or\n\nthe government's interpretation of the telephone calls referring to\n\nthe transaction, the court dismissed Malouf's objection.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            Next, Malouf contested an alleged one-ounce (28.35-gram)\n\ntransaction on April 25 and another on April 27 on the ground that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence that they actually transpired. The\n\ncourt agreed that the evidence was insufficient to prove either\n\ntransaction, resulting in a 56.7-gram reduction of the total drug\n\nquantity attributable to him.\n\n            Finally, Malouf challenged the alleged June 11 one-ounce\n\n(28.35-gram) transaction.           Although Malouf did not contest the\n\ngovernment's interpretation of a telephone conversation on that\n\ndate in which he and Nicholson discussed a cocaine transaction that\n\nwas to take place later that day, he argued that \"there's no\n\nevidence that the meeting ever happened.\" The government urged the\n\ncourt to infer that the meeting took place because there were \"no\n\nother phone calls afterward indicating that it did not take place.\"\n\nBecause   it   was   clear   that    the   applicability   of   the   ten-year\n\nmandatory minimum would turn on the court's determination as to the\n\nJune 11 transaction, the court continued the sentencing hearing and\n\ninvited both parties to provide additional evidence.\n\n            When the sentencing hearing resumed on March 23, 2005,\n\nneither party presented new evidence as to the June 11 transaction.\n\nThe critical issue was whether the appropriate legal standard by\n\nwhich to judge a fact triggering a mandatory minimum sentence was\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt or by a fair preponderance of the\n\nevidence.      The court determined that \"facts which determine a\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmandatory minimum ought to go before a jury,\" or, if both parties\n\nagree to waive a jury trial, the sentencing judge \"stands in the\n\nshoes of the jury, and the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe government objected on the ground that \"there's no right under\n\nthe Sixth Amendment, the due process clause or any other source of\n\nlaw to a jury trial or beyond a reasonable doubt standard with\n\nrespect to any sentencing fact, the determination of which would\n\nresult in a sentence below the statutory maximum.\"   When the court\n\ndismissed the government's objection, the government agreed to\n\nwaive any jury trial right.\n\n          The court determined that although it would find that the\n\nJune 11 transaction had occurred as alleged if the applicable\n\nstandard was a fair preponderance of the evidence, it \"could not\n\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the transaction had in\n\nfact taken place.   As a result, the court declined to hold Malouf\n\naccountable for the one ounce (28.35 grams) he allegedly purchased\n\nin the June 11 transaction.   The court thus concluded that Malouf\n\nwas accountable for a total of only 17.5 ounces (496.125 grams).\n\nBecause the total was less than 500 grams of cocaine, the ten-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence did not apply.    Malouf's base offense\n\nlevel was 26, and the court reduced it to 23 for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility. Malouf's criminal history category was IV, but the\n\ncourt brought it down to III because \"at least two points of the\n\ncriminal history derived from [his] addiction problems.\"       The\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fguidelines sentencing range was 57 to 71 months, and the court\n\nsentenced Malouf to 60 months' imprisonment and a six-year term of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n              On June 14, 2005, the district court issued a written\n\nopinion   addressing     four     separate    issues   pertaining   to   the\n\nsentencing of Malouf.     United States v. Malouf, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2383963\"><a href=\"/opinion/2383963/united-states-v-malouf/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Explaining    the    logic    underlying   Malouf's\n\nsentence, the district court asked,\n\n              (1) Do the drug quantities outlined in 21\n              U.S.C. § 841 comprise elements of offenses, or\n              sentencing factors? If the former, the\n              relevant case is Apprendi, a jury trial is\n              required and the standard of proof is beyond a\n              reasonable doubt; if the latter, it is Harris,\n              drug quantity can be determined by a judge,\n              and the standard is a fair preponderance of\n              the evidence. (2) What is the continued\n              efficacy of Harris in the light of the Court's\n              rulings in Blakely and Booker? (3) What is a\n              district court to do when the First Circuit's\n              interpretation of § 841 relies on Supreme\n              Court precedent which predates Blakely and\n              Booker? (4) In the alternative, however the\n              facts are characterized (as sentencing factors\n              or elements), where facts have a significant,\n              indeed determinative impact, does the Due\n              Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment require\n              the application of the beyond a reasonable\n              doubt standard?\n\nId. at 317.\n\n              As to the first issue, the court found that \"§ 841 is an\n\noffense-defining statutory provision, all elements of which must be\n\ntried before the jury.\"         Id. at 328.    As to the second question,\n\nthe district court determined that \"the breadth of the holdings in\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fBooker and Blakely have in fact overruled Harris.\"            Id. at 326.\n\nWith regard to the third issue, although the court acknowledged\n\nthat our decision in United States v. Goodine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781604\"><a href=\"/opinion/781604/united-states-v-brian-goodine-aka-dwayne-goodine/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\n\nCir. 2003) required a different result, it determined that Goodine\n\nwas not binding because of its \"reliance on Supreme Court precedent\n\nwhich is crumbling.\"     Id. at 325.    Finally, as to the due process\n\nissue, the court found that quantity must be proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt \"[i]f a substantial sentence hinges on a finding\n\nof a specific quantity\" because in such cases courts \"should have\n\na high degree of confidence in this finding.\"           Id. at 329.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          The government argues on appeal that the district court\n\nerred by refusing to impose on Malouf a ten-year mandatory minimum\n\nsentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(B)(1)(b) despite finding by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that he was accountable for more than\n\n500 grams of cocaine.    The government challenges only the district\n\ncourt's legal determinations, which we review de novo.              Goodine,\n\n326 F.3d at 27.\n\n          A.    Harris\n\n          The   government   first     contests   the    district     court's\n\nconclusion that the Supreme Court's decisions in United States v.\n\nBooker and Blakely v. Washington overruled its earlier opinions in\n\nHarris v. United States and McMillan v. Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                      1.   Relevant Precedent\n\n              We begin with a brief discussion of relevant Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.      In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, the Court sustained\n\na   statute    that   allowed   the   sentencing   judge   to   find,   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, a fact that increased the minimum\n\npenalty for a crime.        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111713\"><a href=\"/opinion/111713/mcmillan-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (1986).        In McMillan, the\n\nCourt distinguished between offense elements, which must be proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and         sentencing factors, which may be\n\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence.         Id. at 91.   In Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, the Court held that \"any fact that increases the\n\npenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"              </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (2000) (emphasis added).          Two years later in Harris,\n\nthe Court held that Apprendi did not apply to facts that increase\n\nthe mandatory minimum sentence and reaffirmed McMillan.            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (2002) (emphasis added).           In Blakely v. Washington, the\n\nCourt found unconstitutional a state trial court's imposition of a\n\nsentence that was above the statutory maximum, on the basis of the\n\njudge's finding of fact.        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 (2004).       The Blakely\n\ncourt held that \"the 'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes is\n\nthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the\n\nfacts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\"\n\nId. at 303.      Finally, in United States v. Booker, the Court held\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthat the reasoning of Blakely should be applied to the Federal\n\nSentencing Guidelines.          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226-27 (2005).\n\n                     2.    The district court's analysis\n\n          The district court in the case before us reasoned that\n\nBlakely and Booker actually \"broadened Apprendi by requiring that\n\nall facts 'which the law makes essential to the punishment' be\n\nsubject to Sixth Amendment protections.\"            Malouf, 377 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 324.      The judge determined further that Blakely and Booker\n\nevince the Court's movement toward an \"impact test\" that focuses\n\nmore on \"the impact of such facts upon punishment, rather than on\n\nthe formalistic distinctions between sentencing factors and offense\n\nelements.\"     Id.     According to the district court, this \"impact\n\ntest\" approach \"necessarily casts doubt on Harris' distinction\n\nbetween mandatory minimum provisions and statutory maximums.\"               Id.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded, \"[i]n my judgment, the breadth of\n\nthe holdings in Booker and Blakely have in fact overruled Harris.\n\nThe Court has gone from holding that the Sixth Amendment is\n\nimplicated in the determination of facts that increase a statutory\n\nmaximum (Apprendi) to applying the Sixth Amendment to all facts\n\n'essential to the punishment' (Booker and Blakely).\"               Id. at 326\n\n(footnote omitted).\n\n          We    need      not   delve   deeper   into   the   district   court<s\n\nanalysis because, since its opinion issued on June 14, 2005, we\n\nhave had cause to consider the continued vitality of Harris in\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\flight of subsequent Supreme Court case law.                 Approximately ten\n\nmonths after the district court decided Malouf, we decided the case\n\nof United States v. Lizardo, in which we held that \"Booker left\n\nintact the Supreme Court's precedent in Harris, which allowed the\n\nuse of judicially found facts to increase a mandatory minimum\n\nsentence.\"    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202178\"><a href=\"/opinion/202178/united-states-v-lizardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           B.    Goodine\n\n           The district court concluded that even if Harris remains\n\ngood law, § 841 \"is an offense-defining statutory provision, all\n\nelements of which must be tried before the jury.\"                Malouf, 377 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 328.         This finding is directly contrary to -- and\n\nforeclosed by -- Goodine in which we held that \"drug quantity for\n\npurposes of § 841 is a sentencing factor that may be determined by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.\"             326 F.3d at 32.        Goodine was\n\ndecided after Apprendi and Harris but before Booker and Blakely.\n\nThe district court found that it was not bound by Goodine because\n\nthat   opinion    was    based   on   Supreme    Court   precedent     \"which   is\n\ncrumbling.\"      Malouf, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 325.            As we have since\n\nheld in Lizardo, we are bound by Goodine.           Lizardo, 445 F.3d at 90.\n\n           We    tarry    here   to   reaffirm    that   there   are    only    two\n\nexceptions to the principle that newly constituted panels are bound\n\nby decisions of prior panels in the same circuit.            As to the first,\n\n\"[a]n existing panel decision may be undermined by controlling\n\nauthority, subsequently announced, such as an opinion of the\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fSupreme Court, an en banc opinion of the circuit court, or a\n\nstatutory overruling.\"        United States v. Guzmán, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201772\"><a href=\"/opinion/201772/united-states-v-guzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWith regard to the second exception which \"operates in instances\n\nthat fairly may be described as hen's-teeth rare, authority that\n\npostdates the original decision, although not directly controlling,\n\nmay nevertheless offer a compelling reason for believing that the\n\nformer panel, in light of new developments, would change its\n\ncollective mind.\"      Id.   Neither exception applies in this case.     As\n\nwe discussed in the previous section, Harris remains good law after\n\nBlakely and Booker, and there is no other reason for us to\n\ncontravene our own precedent.        Goodine is binding on this circuit\n\nand the district court erred when it concluded otherwise.\n\n           C.     Due Process\n\n           The district court made an alternative finding that even\n\nif drug quantity is a sentencing factor under § 841, it must be\n\nproven   beyond    a   reasonable   doubt   because   of   the   protections\n\nafforded by the due process provision of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nCiting a \"new concern for procedural fairness in the finding of\n\nfacts,\" the district court held that \"[i]f a substantial sentence\n\nhinges on a finding of a specific quantity, then . . . I (and the\n\npublic) should have a high degree of confidence in this finding,\"\n\nand thus the quantity finding must be proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Malouf, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 329.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f              The   district       court's      analysis        and    conclusion         are\n\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in McMillan.                             In that\n\ncase, the Court considered the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania\n\nstatute that required a sentencing court to impose a five-year\n\nminimum sentence if it found by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat   the    defendant        \"visibly    possessed      a     firearm\"      during      the\n\ncommission     of   certain      enumerated       offenses.           477    U.S.    at   81.\n\nMcMillan held that due process did not require visible possession\n\nof a firearm to be treated as an element of the offense that must\n\nbe   proved    beyond      a   reasonable       doubt.        The    Court    noted       that\n\n\"sentencing courts have always operated without constitutionally\n\nimposed      burdens      of   proof\"     and    that     the       visible    possession\n\nrequirement, despite triggering a mandatory minimum penalty, did\n\nnot implicate the Due Process Clause because it \"neither alters the\n\nmaximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate\n\noffense calling for a separate penalty.\"                      Id. at 92 n.8, 87-88.\n\nThe same is true here with respect to drug quantity, insofar as it\n\ndetermines the mandatory minimum sentence.\n\n                                          III.\n\n              For   the    foregoing      reasons,       we   reverse       the     district\n\ncourt's decision and remand for sentencing in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n              Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f</pre>",
