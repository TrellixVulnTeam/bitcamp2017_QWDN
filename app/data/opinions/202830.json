In    the     district    court,   the\n\nplaintiffs--all former employees or contractors of the City of\n\nCentral    Falls,     Rhode     Island--made      claims    relating    to   their\n\nemployment with the city.           Thomas Wilson was the Police Chief,\n\nThomas Shannahan was the Director of the Library, Donald D. Twohig\n\n(\"Donald D.\") was the Systems Administrator of the Library, and\n\nDonald    P.   Twohig    (\"Donald     P.\"--Donald        D.'s   father)   was   an\n\nindependent contractor who worked on library projects for over ten\n\nyears.\n\n            Judge Lagueux's opinion on summary judgment contains a\n\ndetailed description of the facts.           Wilson v. Moreau, 440 F. Supp.\n\n2d 81 (D.R.I. 2006). Pertinently, Charles Moreau was elected mayor\n\nin November 2003.       The mayor had earlier stated that, if elected,\n\nhe would fire Wilson.         Once elected, the mayor embarrassed Wilson\n\non several occasions, including, for example, requiring Wilson to\n\nturn in his city-owned vehicle and accept an old, rusted car as a\n\nreplacement. Wilson was suspended with pay and eventually resigned\n\nafter refusing to pursue an investigation into alleged misuse of\n\nlibrary resources.\n\n            During the election, Donald P. donated $100 to Moreau's\n\nopponent and put up lawn signs.           Shannahan had been approached by\n\nMoreau prior to the election, but declined to support either\n\ncandidate for mayor.          Allegedly in response to perceived support\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffor his opponent on the part of library staff, the new mayor began\n\nan investigation into the operations of the library.\n\n          During    this   period,    payment   due   to   Donald   P.   for\n\nrenovation work already completed was delayed for seven weeks. The\n\nmayor also required competitive bidding for all work over $500,\n\nwhich effectively cut off Donald P.'s access to non-bid work.\n\nShannahan announced his resignation on April 12, 2004, effective at\n\nthe end of April.     Donald D. was initially demoted by an interim\n\nlibrarian and later suspended and fired by the newly appointed\n\nlibrary director; he filed a grievance, which was upheld, but he\n\nappears to have found employment elsewhere.\n\n          On April 20, 2004, police detectives and a computer\n\ntechnician went to the library, obtained Donald D.'s password to\n\nthe internal library system and looked through the library's\n\ncomputer files.     The \"raid,\" at Mayor Moreau's direction, was to\n\ndetermine whether library resources had been used to support his\n\nopponent during the election.         According to Donald P., he was\n\nordered to provide the password to his personal Yahoo account, and\n\nhis personal emails were then searched.\n\n          The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in federal court\n\nagainst the mayor, members of his administration, the two police\n\ndetectives involved in the search, and the computer technician and\n\nhis company who     aided the search.       Most of the claims were\n\ndismissed on summary judgment, but several went to trial; of these,\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fseveral were thereafter dismissed on a Rule 50(a) motion, Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 50(a); two remaining claims went to the jury, which\n\nrejected them on the merits.\n\n           On plaintiffs' appeal to this court, we rely primarily\n\non Judge Lagueux's thoughtful and thorough opinion, addressing only\n\nthose issues that have been preserved.           Dismissals on summary\n\njudgment and under Rule 50 are reviewed de novo, taking the\n\nevidence most favorably to the opposing party; in the former case\n\nwe ask whether there is a genuine issue of material fact; in the\n\nlatter, whether a rational jury could find in favor of the party\n\nopposing dismissal.1\n\n           All four plaintiffs brought first amendment claims under\n\nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 360 (1976), asserting that they had\n\nbeen subjected to dismissal for their political affiliation.          This\n\nprotection does not apply to policymaking employees whose political\n\naffiliation is pertinent to their positions.           Id. at 367.     The\n\ndistrict   court   found   that   the   suspensions   imposed   on   Wilson\n\nconstituted an adverse employment action but dismissed Wilson's\n\nclaim on the ground that he held a policy position.       Wilson, 440 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 94-96.\n\n\n     1\n      Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2005); Burton\nv. Town of Littleton, 426 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2005). The district\ncourt said that, in certain respects, the plaintiffs had failed to\ncomply with local specificity requirements for the filing of a\nstatement of disputed facts. We bypass this issue because, taking\nthe plaintiffs' allegations as they stand, the result is no\ndifferent.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            On this appeal, Wilson says that he was not really a\n\npolicy maker: that he was subject to supervision by the public\n\nsafety director (the mayor), had technical expertise, got modest\n\npay (\"57\" per year), had civil service protection under the city\n\ncharter, was not in fact given effective authority by the mayor,\n\nand was treated badly.     But most of these \"facts\"--which we assume\n\narguendo--are    not    highly    relevant,   and   the   core   issue--the\n\nauthority attaching to Wilson's position--is decisive.\n\n            Under the city charter, the police chief was in charge\n\nof the division, and the basic operation and discipline of the\n\npolice was in the chief's hands.       City of Central Falls, Charter,\n\nÂ§ 4-701.    The job description is normally of foremost importance,\n\nJimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 242 (1st Cir.\n\n1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1014 (1987), and a police chief is\n\nordinarily high ranking enough to make or influence policy.               See\n\nGalloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 28-30 (1st Cir. 2004); Flynn v. City\n\nof Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 44-45 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S.\n\n961 (1998).\n\n            Whether Wilson had civil service protection does not\n\nmatter; Wilson's claims under the city charter have not been\n\npreserved   on   this   appeal.    Policymaking     officials    often   have\n\ntechnical expertise as well and often report to a yet higher ranked\n\nofficial.     Flynn, 140 F.3d at 46.       That the mayor may have acted\n\nbadly and out of private motives also does not matter: because\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fWilson is not protected under Elrod v. Burns, he has no first\n\namendment claim.\n\n                Shannahan said he was constructively discharged but the\n\ndistrict court held otherwise, ruling that hostile statements by\n\nthe mayor were not enough.          Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 102.         We\n\nagree that the mayor's criticisms did not constitute \"working\n\nconditions imposed by the employer . . . so onerous, abusive, or\n\nunpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position\n\nwould have felt compelled to resign.\"2               The library \"raid,\" to\n\nwhich Shannahan also points, occurred after he told the city\n\ncouncil that he was resigning.\n\n                Donald P. also claimed violation of his first amendment\n\nrights, pointing to new city bidding and insurance requirements for\n\ncontracts of $500 or more.              The defendants offered a plausible\n\nexplanation for such requirements, which are hardly uncommon;\n\nDonald P. pointed only to proof that he had erected some campaign\n\nsigns for the former mayor and donated a modest amount of money.\n\nThis       is   simply   not   enough    to    establish   that   the   general\n\nrequirements for contractors were political revenge against him.\n\nMercado, 396 F.3d at 51.\n\n\n       2\n      Mercado-Alicea v. Puerto Rico Tourism Co., 396 F.3d 46, 52\n(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Suarez v. Pueblo Intern., Inc., 229 F.3d\n49, 54 (1st Cir. 2000)); see also Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems,\nInc., 333 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2003) (constructive discharge\nrequires \"harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the\njob while seeking redress--the rule save in unusual cases--is\n'intolerable'\").\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            Both Donald P. and Donald D. made state-law defamation\n\nclaims.    Donald P.'s claims centered on statements attributed to\n\nMoreau which concerned Donald P.'s status as a convicted felon and\n\nhis receipt of large payments under non-bid contracts for library\n\nwork.    As to Donald D., the mayor had reportedly said that Donald\n\nD. had deleted some computer files during the library search and\n\nthat he had produced campaign materials at the library.\n\n            But under Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. 418 U.S. 323\n\n(1974), even a \"private\" defamation plaintiff must show actual\n\ninjury unless factual statements were made with knowledge that they\n\nwere false or with reckless disregard for their truth.                    The\n\ndistrict judge found no evidence of either actual injury or the\n\nrequired scienter.       Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 113-14.        On appeal,\n\nDonald D. and Donald P. say that their factual assertions were\n\nignored    but   point    to   no   evidence--as   opposed    to   conclusory\n\nassertions-- to establish either defendant's scienter or their own\n\nactual damages.\n\n            Donald D. and Donald P. also brought state law privacy\n\nclaims.    The district court dismissed those claims because inter\n\nalia    plaintiffs   had   failed    to   set   forth   any   specific   facts\n\ndemonstrating that plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of the\n\nstatute.   Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 115.         This deficiency persists\n\non appeal; the plaintiffs merely assert that a privacy claim could\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fbe based on the same facts alleged with respect to the defamation\n\nclaim.\n\n            Several claims went to trial:     Donald D.'s claim of\n\npatronage firing as against Moreau; Donald P.'s fourth amendment\n\nclaims against the mayor and the police officers; and Donald P.'s\n\nstate law computer crime claims against the mayor and the police\n\nofficers.    After plaintiffs' evidence was submitted, the district\n\njudge granted Moreau's Rule 50(a) motion to dismiss both Donald\n\nD.'s patronage firing claim and Donald P.'s claims under the Fourth\n\nAmendment and state law computer crimes.\n\n            The two remaining claims (Donald P.'s fourth amendment\n\nclaim and computer-law claim against the police detective based on\n\nthe library search) were submitted to the jury, and the jury\n\nreturned verdicts in favor of the police detective. As a predicate\n\nto these latter claims, the jury was asked whether the computer\n\ntechnician who had done the actual searching had in fact searched\n\nDonald P.'s personal e-mail.   Whether there had been a true search\n\nhad been disputed at trial.    The jury answered no.\n\n            On appeal, the plaintiffs say that the claims against\n\nMoreau based on the search should not have been dismissed; they\n\nargue that even if Moreau did not participate in the search he\n\ncould himself have been held liable on a theory of supervisory\n\nliability.   They also state that the judge should have instructed\n\non \"presumed damages\" as to the search.   But since the jury verdict\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\festablished that there had been no search of personal emails, both\n\nissues are moot.\n\n          In the district court, the plaintiffs sought recovery on\n\nother claims, not discussed above, some of which are pursued on\n\nthis appeal; but such claims have not been adequately developed or\n\nare raised only in the plaintiffs' reply brief and in either event\n\nare forfeit.

On appeal, Donald D. and Donald P. say that their factual assertions were ignored but point to no evidence Â as opposed to conclusory assertions Â to establish either defendant's scienter or their own actual damages.</p>\n<p>Donald D. and Donald P. also brought state law privacy claims. The district court dismissed those claims because <i>inter alia</i> plaintiffs had failed to set forth any specific facts demonstrating that plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of the statute. <i>Wilson,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 115. This deficiency persists on appeal; the plaintiffs merely assert that a privacy claim could be based on the same facts alleged with respect to the defamation claim.</p>\n<p>Several claims went to trial: Donald D.'s claim of patronage firing as against Moreau; Donald P.'s fourth amendment claims against the mayor and the police officers; and Donald P.'s state law computer crime claims against the mayor and the police officers. After plaintiffs' evidence was submitted, the district judge granted Moreau's Rule 50(a) motion to dismiss both Donald D.'s patronage firing claim and Donald P.'s claims under the Fourth Amendment and state law computer crimes.</p>\n<p>The two remaining claims (Donald P.'s fourth amendment claim and computer-law claim against the police detective based on the library search) were submitted to the jury, and the jury returned verdicts in favor of the police detective. As a predicate to these latter claims, the jury was asked whether the computer technician who had done the actual searching had in fact searched Donald P.'s personal e-mail. Whether there had been a true search had been disputed at trial. The jury answered no.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs say that the claims against Moreau based on the search should not have been dismissed; they argue that even if Moreau did not participate in the search he could himself have been held liable on a theory of supervisory liability. They also state that the judge should have instructed on \"presumed damages\" as to the search. But since the jury verdict established that there had been no search of personal emails, both issues are moot.</p>\n<p>In the district court, the plaintiffs sought recovery on other claims, not discussed above, some of which are pursued on this appeal; but such claims have not been adequately developed or are raised only in the plaintiffs' reply brief and in either event are forfeit. <i>Mass.

Thomas Wilson was the Police Chief, Thomas Shannahan was the Director of the Library, Donald D. Twohig (\"Donald D.\") was the Systems Administrator of the Library, and Donald P. Twohig (\"Donald P.\" Â Donald D.'s father) was an independent contractor who worked on library projects for over ten years.</p>\n<p>Judge Lagueux's opinion on summary judgment contains a detailed description of the facts. <i>Wilson v. Moreau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562455\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562455/wilson-v-moreau/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span> (D.R.I.2006). Pertinently, Charles Moreau was elected mayor in November 2003. The mayor had earlier stated that, if elected, he would fire Wilson. Once elected, the mayor embarrassed Wilson on several occasions, including, for example, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> requiring Wilson to turn in his city-owned vehicle and accept an old, rusted car as a replacement. Wilson was suspended with pay and eventually resigned after refusing to pursue an investigation into alleged misuse of library resources.</p>\n<p>During the election, Donald P. donated $100 to Moreau's opponent and put up lawn signs. Shannahan had been approached by Moreau prior to the election, but declined to support either candidate for mayor. Allegedly in response to perceived support for his opponent on the part of library staff, the new mayor began an investigation into the operations of the library.</p>\n<p>During this period, payment due to Donald P. for renovation work already completed was delayed for seven weeks. The mayor also required competitive bidding for all work over $500, which effectively cut off Donald P.'s access to non-bid work. Shannahan announced his resignation on April 12, 2004, effective at the end of April. Donald D. was initially demoted by an interim librarian and later suspended and fired by the newly appointed library director; he filed a grievance, which was upheld, but he appears to have found employment elsewhere.</p>\n<p>On April 20, 2004, police detectives and a computer technician went to the library, obtained Donald D.'s password to the internal library system and looked through the library's computer files. The \"raid,\" at Mayor Moreau's direction, was to determine whether library resources had been used to support his opponent during the election. According to Donald P., he was ordered to provide the password to his personal Yahoo account, and his personal emails were then searched.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in federal court against the mayor, members of his administration, the two police detectives involved in the search, and the computer technician and his company who aided the search. Most of the claims were dismissed on summary judgment, but several went to trial; of these, several were thereafter dismissed on a Rule 50(a) motion, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a); two remaining claims went to the jury, which rejected them on the merits.</p>\n<p>On plaintiffs' appeal to this court, we rely primarily on Judge Lagueux's thoughtful and thorough opinion, addressing only those issues that have been preserved. Dismissals on summary judgment and under Rule 50 are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> taking the evidence most favorably to the opposing party; in the former case we ask whether there is a genuine issue of material fact; in the latter, whether a rational jury could find in favor of the party opposing dismissal.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>All four plaintiffs brought first amendment claims under <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 360, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span> (1976), asserting that they had been subjected to dismissal for their political affiliation. This protection does not apply to policymaking employees whose political affiliation is pertinent to their positions. <i>Id.</i> at 367, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2673</span></a></span>. The district court found that the suspensions imposed on Wilson constituted an adverse employment action but dismissed Wilson's claim on the ground that he held a policy position. <i>Wilson,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 94-96.</p>\n<p>On this appeal, Wilson says that he was not really a policy maker: that he was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> subject to supervision by the public safety director (the mayor), had technical expertise, got modest pay (\"57\" per year), had civil service protection under the city charter, was not in fact given effective authority by the mayor, and was treated badly. But most of these \"facts\" Â which we assume <i>arguendo</i> Â are not highly relevant, and the core issue Â the authority attaching to Wilson's position Â is decisive.</p>\n<p>Under the city charter, the police chief was in charge of the division, and the basic operation and discipline of the police was in the chief's hands. City of Central Falls, Charter, Â§ 4-701. The job description is normally of foremost importance, <i>Jimenez Fuentes v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></span> (1998).</p>\n<p>Whether Wilson had civil service protection does not matter; Wilson's claims under the city charter have not been preserved on this appeal. Policymaking officials often have technical expertise as well and often report to a yet higher ranked official. <i>Flynn,</i> 140 F.3d at 46. That the mayor may have acted badly and out of private motives also does not matter: because Wilson is not protected under <i>Elrod v. Burns</i><i>,</i> he has no first amendment claim.</p>\n<p>Shannahan said he was constructively discharged but the district court held otherwise, ruling that hostile statements by the mayor were not enough. <i>Wilson,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d at 102. We agree that the mayor's criticisms did not constitute \"working conditions imposed by the employer . . . so onerous, abusive, or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.\"<sup>[2]</sup> The library \"raid,\" to which Shannahan also points, occurred after he told the city council that he was resigning.</p>\n<p>Donald P. also claimed violation of his first amendment rights, pointing to new city bidding and insurance requirements for contracts of $500 or more. The defendants offered a plausible explanation for such requirements, which are hardly uncommon; Donald P. pointed only to proof that he had erected some campaign signs for the former mayor and donated a modest amount of money. This is simply not enough to establish that the general requirements for contractors were political revenge against him. <i>Mercado,</i> 396 F.3d at 51.</p>\n<p>Both Donald P. and Donald D. made state-law defamation claims. Donald P.'s claims centered on statements attributed to Moreau which concerned Donald P.'s status as a convicted felon and his receipt of large payments under non-bid contracts for library work. As to Donald D., the mayor had reportedly said that Donald D. had deleted some computer files during the library search and that he had produced campaign materials at the library.</p>\n<p>But under <i>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
