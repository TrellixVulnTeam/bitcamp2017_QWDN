Appellant Bradley Donahue\n\nbrought suit in the district court challenging, on equal protection\n\ngrounds, an affirmative action program for the hiring of Boston\n\npolice officers.      The program is the product of a consent decree\n\nentered in 1973.      See Castro v. Beecher, 365 F. Supp. 655 (D. Mass.\n\n1973).   After concluding that Donahue failed to establish standing\n\nto assert his claims, the district court entered judgment adverse\n\nto Donahue on all claims.        For the reasons stated below, we affirm\n\nin part and reverse in part.\n\n                     I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nA.    The selection process\n\n            To be eligible for appointment to the Boston Police\n\nAcademy (\"the Academy\"), a candidate must take a statewide civil\n\nservice examination.1          The examination is administered by the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts Human Resources Division (\"HRD\").\n\nAfter HRD administers the exam, it compiles an \"eligible list\"\n\nsetting forth those people who received a passing score on the\n\nexamination (a score of at least seventy is considered passing).\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the consent decree, HRD assembles\n\nthe    eligible    list   by   alternating   minority   and   non-minority\n\ncandidates.       All individuals on the eligible list are considered\nqualified for appointment to a civil service position.\n\n\n\n1\n   In accordance with the terms of the consent decree, the civil\nservice exam has been validated under the testing guidelines of the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, see 29 C.F.R. pt. 1607\n(1978).\n\n                                     -2-\n\f             The candidates on the eligible list are then divided into\n\nresidents and non-residents of Boston.           Residents, regardless of\n\nscore, are ranked higher than non-residents.             Within the group of\nresidents, candidates with so-called \"statutory preference\" receive\n\nan additional boost on the eligible list.                 The categories of\n\nstatutory preferences include: (1) the children of firefighters or\npolice officers who were killed or sustained injuries that resulted\n\nin death; (2) disabled veterans; (3) veterans; and (4) widows or\n\nwidowed mothers of veterans who were killed in action or died from\n\na service-connected disability incurred in wartime service.                The\n\ncandidates with a statutory preference are all ranked higher than\n\nthose   without   a   statutory   preference.          Candidates   without   a\n\nstatutory preference or the requisite language skills are ranked\naccording to their scores on the civil service examination, subject\n\nto the alternation requirement of the consent decree.\n\n             When the time comes to hire a new class of student\nofficers, the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") requisitions a\n\n\"certification list\" from HRD to fill the positions.                 HRD then\n\ncertifies sufficient names from the eligible list available for\n\nappointment.      Starting from the top of the eligible list, and\n\nmoving down in strict rank order, HRD creates the certification\n\nlist by certifying roughly twice the number of persons requested by\n\nBPD.    Subject to background checks on all candidates on the\n\ncertification list, BPD must select candidates for appointment in\n\norder   of    their   position    on     the   list,     starting   with   the\n\nhighest-ranking person, unless it supplies a reason for bypassing\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fsomeone.    Special certification lists are also created for those\n\ncandidates who qualify for a hiring preference based on their\n\nability     to   speak    Spanish,    Vietnamese,     and    French-Creole.\nTypically, BPD hires one person for every three persons listed on\n\nthe general certification list.\n\n            In addition to this hiring procedure, BPD can hire new\nofficers in three other ways.         The first such mechanism is the\n\nappointment of police officers from a statutorily-created police\n\ncadets program.2    Second, former members of BPD who retired because\n\nof a disability may seek reinstatement to their former positions.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, ยง 8.           And finally, the Massachusetts\n\nCriminal Justice Training Council has promulgated regulations that\n\nallow an appointing authority to recycle former recruit officers\ninto   a   subsequent    Academy   class.     See   550   Code    Mass.   Regs.\n\nยง 3.04(1)(e).\n\nB.   The April 1997 exam\n\n            Donahue, a white male, took the statewide civil service\n\nexamination administered by HRD on April 26, 1997.               He received a\npassing score of ninety-two and was thus placed on the eligible\n\n\n\n2\n  The cadet program is authorized by state statute, see 1984 Mass.\nActs ch. 277, which permits the Boston Police Department to hire up\nto 33 percent of its new officers each year from the program, see\n1979 Mass. Acts ch. 560. The program enables the BPD to recruit\nprospective candidates for entry-level police officer positions\nfrom all areas of Boston by employing police cadets to perform\nadministrative duties while obtaining some basic experience and\ntraining.   Once a person is a cadet for two years, passes the\nstatewide civil service examination, and successfully completes the\nsame screening procedures used to evaluate applicants from the\ncertification list, that person can be appointed to the Academy.\n\n                                     -4-\n\flist.    Donahue does not qualify for a statutory preference, nor\n\ndoes he possess the language skills that would place him on a\n\nspecial certification list. Donahue's name appears at page twenty-\nseven of the eligible list.\n\n            In   response    to   BPD's    requisition,   HRD    provided   a\n\ncertification list containing the names of the top 157 candidates\nwho were eligible for appointment. In addition, HRD provided three\n\nspecial certification lists of persons who qualified for a hiring\n\npreference based on their ability to speak Spanish, Vietnamese, or\n\nFrench-Creole, respectively.         On June 10, 1998, BPD appointed\n\neighty-three people to the Academy, comprised of: (1) thirty-seven\n\nofficers from the general certification list; (2) ten from the\n\nspecial language certification lists; (3) one disability retiree;\n(4) thirty-one cadets; and (5) four officers from a previous\n\nAcademy class.      All thirty-seven officers appointed from the\n\ngeneral certification list qualified for a statutory preference.\nThe last non-minority hired was a veteran whose name appears on\n\npage three of the eligible list.\n\n            Later, BPD decided that it was necessary to appoint\n\nanother class of officers from the same eligible list that was\n\ncreated from the results of the April 1997 exam.             In response to\n\nBPD's requisition, HRD issued a certification list containing 163\n\nnames.   Additional special certification lists were created with\n\nthe names of those candidates with the requisite language skills.\n\nOn May 12, 1999, BPD appointed fifty-six people to the Academy,\n\ncomprised    of:    (1)     thirty-one     officers   from      the   general\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcertification list; (2) four from the language certification lists;\n\n(3) one disability retiree; (4) seventeen cadets; and (5) three\n\nofficers recycled    from   a   previous   class.    Of   the   thirty-one\nofficers appointed from the general certification list, eighteen\n\nhad statutory preferences. The thirteen officers without statutory\n\npreference, all minority candidates, scored higher on the exam than\nDonahue.\n\n           The   lowest-ranking    non-minority     applicant    who   was\n\nappointed to the May 1999 class was an individual whose name\n\nappeared on page four of the eligible list, while Donahue's name\n\nappeared on page twenty-seven.       Since the names on the eligible\n\nlist alternate between minority and non-minority, there were more\n\nthan 580 non-minority names between the lowest-ranking non-minority\nappointee and Donahue.\n\nC.   The May 1999 Exam\n\n           On May 8, 1999, HRD administered another statewide civil\nservice entrance examination. Donahue passed this examination with\n\na score of ninety-six.      On March 5, 2001, consistent with the\nprocedure we have already described, BPD appointed forty-nine new\npolice officers, comprised of thirty-three candidates from the\n\ngeneral certification list and sixteen from the cadet program.\nTwenty-six officers appointed from the general certification list\nqualified for a statutory preference.       The seven without statutory\n\npreferences were all minority candidates certified to the list\npursuant to the alternation requirement of the consent decree.\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fAlthough six of these candidates had exam scores greater than\n\nDonahue's, one minority appointee had a lower exam score.\n\n            The lowest-ranking non-minority applicant appointed was\nan individual whose name appears on page two of the eligible list,\n\nat number ninety-one.         Meanwhile, Donahue's name appears on page\n\nseven of the eligible list, at number 326.           Thus, there were 117\nnon-minority candidates between the last non-minority appointee and\n\nDonahue.\n\nD.   Proceedings in the district court and the April 2001 exam\n\n            Donahue filed his complaint on May 10, 2000, asserting\nclaims of discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n\nUnited States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1981 and 1983.                The\ncomplaint names as defendants the City of Boston, the BPD, and the\nCommissioner of the BPD (collectively, \"appellees\").           Donahue also\n\nasserted claims under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1985 and 1986 against several\nstate officials (collectively, \"state appellees\") based on their\nfailure to comply with certain public record requests.             Donahue's\n\ncomplaint prayed for injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief.\n            After    filing    his   complaint,   Donahue   took   the   civil\nservice examination again on April 26, 2001, receiving a passing\n\nscore of 100.       BPD requisitioned a certification list in order to\nhire police officers from the class of individuals that took that\nexam.      In response, HRD forwarded a certification list dated\n\nSeptember 14, 2001.           Donahue's name does not appear on that\ncertification list.       Appellees contend that, because Donahue had\n\nreached the age of thirty-two when he took the April 2001 exam, he\n\n                                      -7-\n\fwas ineligible for appointment to the Academy under a recent state\n\nstatute which provides that, in any municipality that adopts the\n\nstatute, no person who has reached his thirty-second birthday on\nthe date of the entrance examination shall be eligible to have his\n\nname certified for \"original appointment\" to a municipal police\n\nofficer   position.3   2000   Mass.    Acts   ch.   242   (\"Chapter   242\")\n(codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, ยง 58A).\n\n           On May 30, 2001, appellees moved for summary judgment on\n\nthe ground that Donahue lacks constitutional standing to assert the\n\nclaims set forth in his complaint.      On September 13, 2001, Donahue\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment, claiming that the undisputed\n\nfacts demonstrate that the consent decree is unconstitutional.           On\n\nOctober 30, 2001, Donahue also moved for leave to amend his first\namended complaint to add a claim based on the results of the April\n\n2001 exam and to assert a challenge to the constitutionality of\n\nChapter 242.\n\n\n3\n    The entire text of the statute reads:\n\n           Notwithstanding the provisions of any general\n           or special law to the contrary, in any city,\n           town or district that accepts this section, no\n           person shall be eligible to have his name\n           certified for original appointment to the\n           position of firefighter or police officer if\n           such person has reached his thirty-second\n           birthday   on  the   date   of  the   entrance\n           examination. Any veteran shall be allowed to\n           exceed the maximum age provision of this\n           section by the number of years served on\n           active military duty, but in no case shall\n           said candidate for appointment be credited\n           more than four years of active military duty.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, ยง 58A.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          In a memorandum and order dated December 13, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment.\n\nDonahue v. City of Boston, 183 F. Supp. 2d 202 (D. Mass. 2001).      By\norders entered December 14, 2001, the district court denied as moot\n\nDonahue's motion for summary judgment and his motion to amend the\n\nfirst amended complaint.    Donahue's timely appeal followed.\n\n                            II.   ANALYSIS\n\n          Donahue makes numerous assertions of error on the part of\n\nthe district court. Distilled to their essence, however, Donahue's\n\narguments fall into three basic categories.       First, Donahue argues\nthat the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing\n\nto assert an equal protection claim seeking both prospective and\nretrospective relief.      Second, he argues that the court below\nabused its discretion in denying his motion to amend.        Finally, he\n\nclaims error in the district court's entry of judgment on his\nclaims against the state appellees.          We address these issues\nseparately.\n\nA.   Standing\n\n           The   standing     doctrine       is   grounded     in   the\ncase-or-controversy requirement of Article III.       Allen v. Wright,\n\n468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984).    \"In essence the question of standing is\n\nwhether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the\n\nmerits of the dispute or of particular issues.\"       Warth v. Seldin,\n\n422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).   The \"irreducible constitutional minimum\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fof standing\" contains three requirements.4              Lujan v. Defenders of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).          First, a plaintiff seeking to\n\ninvoke a     federal   court's    jurisdiction     must    show    that   he   has\n\"suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable\n\ninterest.\"     Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 269\n\nF.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. at 560.      The asserted injury must be \"(a) concrete and\n\nparticularized; and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n\nhypothetical.\"    Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560 (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).           Second, the plaintiff must\n\nshow a causal connection between the asserted injury and the\n\nchallenged action of the defendant; this causal connection cannot\n\nbe overly attenuated.     Id. And third, the plaintiff must show that\nit is likely -- rather than merely speculative -- that \"the injury\n\nwill be redressed by a favorable decision.\"              Id. at 561.\n\n           \"[S]tanding       is   gauged    by   the    specific    common-law,\nstatutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\"                  Int'l\n\nPrimate Prot. League v. Adm'rs of Tulane Educ. Fund, 500 U.S. 72,\n\n77   (1991).    That   is,    \"the   standing    inquiry    requires      careful\n\njudicial examination of . . . whether the particular plaintiff is\n\nentitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.\"\n\nAllen, 468 U.S. at 752 (emphasis added).               Thus, a plaintiff must\n\nensure that he establishes standing for each claim and for each\n\n\n4\n   Only the constitutional requirements of standing are at issue\nhere; the elements of prudential standing are not implicated by\nthis case. See generally William A. Fletcher, The Structure of\nStanding, 98 Yale L.J. 221, 251-53 (1988).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fform of relief sought. See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peรฑa, 515\n\nU.S. 200, 210-11 (1995).\n\n            In reaching its determination with respect to standing,\nthe district court did not differentiate between Donahue's claim\n\nfor retrospective relief in the form of damages and his claim for\n\nprospective relief in the form of an injunction and declaratory\njudgment.        Because we perceive crucial analytical differences\n\nbetween the two claims, we scrutinize them independently of one\n\nanother.    Our review of the district court's ruling on standing is\n\nplenary.    Nyer v. Winterthur Int'l, 290 F.3d 456, 459 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n            1.    Damages claim\n\n            Donahue argues that he is entitled to pursue his damages\nclaim because he was denied appointment to the BPD under a facially\n\nrace-conscious hiring policy.     In contrast, appellees argue that\nDonahue lacks standing to assert his claim for damages because he\ncannot demonstrate that he would have been hired under race-neutral\n\ncriteria.    We agree with appellees that Donahue cannot establish\nstanding to claim damages.\n            The Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in Texas v.\n\nLesage, 528 U.S. 18 (1999) (per curiam).        In Lesage, a white\nplaintiff brought an equal protection action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\nfor monetary damages after unsuccessfully applying to a doctoral\n\nprogram at the University of Texas.       Id. at 19.   Although the\nuniversity did not dispute that race was a factor considered at\n\nsome stages of the admissions process, id., the district court\n\n                                  -11-\n\fgranted summary judgment to the university, reasoning that the\n\nplaintiff would have been denied admission even if race had not\n\nbeen a factor in the admissions process,         id. at 20.     Reversing the\ndistrict court, the Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiff's chances\n\nunder a color-blind admissions scheme were irrelevant if he could\n\nprove that his application was treated differently because of race.\nId.     The Supreme Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit, holding\n\nthat the government was entitled to summary judgment on the damages\n\nclaims.     The   Court   stated,    \"[s]imply   put,   where    a   plaintiff\n\nchallenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an\n\nimpermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government\n\nwould    have   made   the   same   decision   regardless,      there   is   no\n\ncognizable injury warranting relief under ยง 1983.\"              Id. at 21.\n            In this case, Donahue's complaint alleged three instances\n\nin which he was passed over for appointment to the Academy.                  The\n\nfirst two instances stemmed from hiring decisions based on the\nresults of the April 1997 exam.         On that exam, roughly 580 non-\n\nminority    applicants    scored    higher   than   Donahue   but    were    not\n\nconsidered for appointment.         Thus, in order for Donahue to have\n\nbeen appointed based on his April 1997 exam scores under an\n\notherwise race-neutral policy, all of these applicants would have\n\nto be considered and rejected.          The situation was similar when\n\nDonahue was passed over for a third time, based on the results of\n\nthe May 1999 exam.        There, roughly 120 non-minority applicants\n\nscored higher than Donahue but were also denied appointment. Under\n\na race-neutral policy, the BPD would have had to consider and\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\freject all       of   these   candidates   before   Donahue   was   offered   a\n\nposition.\n\n            It    is    plain    from    the   undisputed     evidence   that,\nnotwithstanding the race-conscious elements of the consent decree,\n\nDonahue was too far down the list to be even remotely considered\n\nfor hiring in any of the three instances of which he complains.               It\nfollows unavoidably from Lesage that Donahue's damages claim is\n\ntherefore doomed to fail.5\n            This would ordinarily be the end of our inquiry on this\n\nclaim.    However, the fact that this question comes to us as one\n\nframed in terms of Article III standing -- which is, of course,\n\njurisdictional in nature -- adds one significant consideration.\n\nThat is, this Court must resolve questions pertaining to its\nsubject-matter jurisdiction before it may address the merits of a\n\ncase.    See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83,\n\n101-02 (1998); see generally Scott C. Idleman, The Demise of\n\n5\n  Donahue attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that, since\nhe is the only BPD applicant to have filed a lawsuit and other\nunsuccessful non-minority applicants have now forfeited their\nrights, he is essentially the \"next in line\" for an appointment to\nthe BPD. While this argument demonstrates admirable creativity, it\nis not persuasive. A litigant cannot use the fact that he filed\nhis lawsuit to bootstrap an argument against potential standing and\ncausation deficiencies in the very same lawsuit.\n\n    Donahue also argues at some length that appellees are\nimplementing the terms of the consent decree incorrectly by hiring\nnew officers from the cadet program.      It is unclear how this\nallegation bears on Donahue's claim that he was discriminated\nagainst based on his race. To the extent he intimates that the\ncadet program is being operated based on a racial quota system, he\noffers little more than speculation as to the program's supposedly\ndiscriminatory operation. Nor does he contend that he applied for\nthe cadet program but was denied entrance due to unlawful racial\nconsiderations.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fHypothetical Jurisdiction in the Federal Courts, 52 Vand. L. Rev.\n\n235 (1999) (examining the effects of Steel Co.'s prohibition on\n\nexercising     \"hypothetical   jurisdiction\").    We   must   therefore\ndetermine whether Donahue's inability to establish that he would\n\nhave received the benefit he sought under a race-neutral policy\n\nwarrants dismissal based on standing, or, alternatively, whether\nthis deficiency in his case goes only to the ultimate merits of the\n\nclaim.   We hold that, in this case, dismissal for want of standing\n\nwas appropriate.\n\n             By its own terms, the Court's decision in Lesage does not\n\nspecifically address standing.       Nevertheless, we read Lesage as\n\nclarifying the \"injury in fact to a cognizable interest\" that is\n\nrequired to support standing for Donahue's damages claim.6         Save\n\nOur Heritage, 269 F.3d at 55; see also 1 Ronald D. Rotunda & John\n\nE. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law ยง 2.13, at 29 (2002 Supp.)\n\n(suggesting that Lesage is pertinent to evaluating standing for\ndamages claims).      Injury-in-fact is a touchstone of the standing\n\n6\n   It is noteworthy that Donahue did not assert a claim of race\ndiscrimination under Title VII, which makes it unlawful for an\nemployer to consider race as \"a motivating factor for any\nemployment practice, even though other factors also motivated the\npractice.\" 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(m). An employer who violates this\nprovision may still be held liable for declaratory relief, certain\nlimited injunctive relief, and attorney's fees, even though the\nemployer would have taken the same action in the absence of the\nimpermissible motivating factor. Id. ยง 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Congress\nis empowered to create substantive rights and to authorize suit for\ntheir enforcement. Consequently, Congress may define an injury, as\nit did in Title VII, in a way that provides the basis for standing\neven in the absence of other injury to the plaintiff.           See\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 580 (Kennedy, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in the judgment). But as Donahue made no claim\nunder Title VII, we need not consider its implications for his\nstanding to sue.\n\n                                  -14-\n\finquiry, and the Lesage decision states in no uncertain terms that,\n\nunless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he would have received\n\nthe sought-after benefit under race-neutral criteria, \"there is no\ncognizable injury warranting relief under ยง 1983.\" 528 U.S. at 21.\n\nWithout the ability to establish a cognizable injury that would\n\nwarrant the type of relief sought, a plaintiff cannot demonstrate\nthe requisite injury, the causal link between the injury and the\n\ndefendant's conduct, or redressability for the injury.\n\n             A   recent   decision   from   one   of     our   sister   circuits\n\nunderscores the point.       In Aiken v. Hackett, 281 F.3d 516 (6th Cir.\n\n2002), petition for cert. filed, 70 U.S.L.W. 3742 (May 20, 2002)\n\n(No. 01-1707), the Sixth Circuit addressed an equal protection\n\nclaim by several white police officers who sought and were denied\npromotions to the position of sergeant.           The promotion system was\n\ngoverned by a consent decree that required a certain number of\n\nminority candidates to be promoted. Id. at 518.                  Although some\nwhite officers would have received the promotion in the absence of\n\na racial preference, the Aiken plaintiffs were not among them.               As\n\nthe court stated, it was \"beyond debate that . . . [the plaintiffs]\n\nstill would not have been promoted to sergeant,\" as it was their\n\n\"composite       [test]   scores   (not   the   City's    affirmative    action\n\nprogram) [that] kept them from being promoted.\"                   Id. at 519.\n\nAccordingly, the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to\n\nseek retrospective relief, reasoning as follows:\n\n          If the plaintiffs allege that a racial\n          preference cost them some benefit under a\n          government program, those plaintiffs may have\n          alleged an injury in fact. But if those same\n\n                                     -15-\n\f           plaintiffs cannot also allege and show that\n           \"under a race-neutral policy\" they would have\n           received the benefit, those plaintiffs have\n           not alleged an injury in fact because they\n           have not alleged an invasion of some interest\n           that the law protects.\n\nId.\n\n          At least one circuit, however, has concluded that an\n\nequal protection plaintiff who seeks damages in a challenge to an\n\naffirmative action plan need not demonstrate, for purposes of\n\nstanding, that he would have received the sought-after benefit in\n\nthe absence of considerations of race.        See Wooden v. Bd. of\n\nRegents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 247 F.3d 1262, 1279 (11th Cir.\n\n2001).   The Wooden court reasoned that \"the injury in these kinds\nof cases is not the denial of the sought-after benefit, but rather\n\nthe direct exposure to unequal treatment.\"   Id. at 1280.   The court\n\nreasoned further that the plaintiff's inability to show that he\nwould have ultimately obtained the benefit under race-neutral\n\ncriteria under Lesage \"goes less to standing than it does to [his]\n\nability to succeed on the merits of his claim.\"    Id.\n\n          Our analysis hews closer to Aiken than Wooden.    We think\n\nthat Lesage is a clear cue from the Supreme Court that we cannot\n\napply identical standing analyses to claims for damages and claims\n\nfor prospective relief.    It is equally apparent, in light of\n\nLesage, that the \"equal footing\" analysis is applied only in claims\n\nfor the former type of relief.7    Our standing inquiry on the claim\n\n7\n   Although a plaintiff might be able to demonstrate that he was\nprevented from competing on equal footing, it is unclear how such\na plaintiff would satisfy the element of redressability necessary\nto assert a claim for damages.      Lesage plainly dictates that\n\n                                  -16-\n\ffor damages therefore asks whether Donahue can demonstrate that,\n\nunder a race-neutral policy, he would have received the benefit for\n\nwhich he now seeks compensation.\n            To be sure, cases will arise where, because the issues of\n\ncausation       and   injury     are     disputed      and     fact-intensive,       the\n\nplaintiff's inability to demonstrate damages should be treated as\na merit-based question.            See, e.g., Mt. Healthy Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle,    429    U.S.   274,     287    (1977)   (holding       that,    even   if   the\n\ngovernment has considered an impermissible criterion in making a\n\ndecision adverse to the plaintiff, it can defeat liability by\n\nproving as an affirmative defense that it would have made the same\n\ndecision absent the forbidden consideration).                     But in Donahue's\n\ncase, his inability to qualify for hiring on race-neutral grounds\nis so overwhelmingly established that any claim to the contrary\n\nwould be \"wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\"                    Bell v. Hood, 327\n\nU.S. 678, 682-83 (1946).               Where the absence of causation and a\nrelevant injury-in-fact are presented with such clarity, dismissal\n\nfor lack of subject-matter is justified.                 See Steel Co., 523 U.S.\n\nat   89   (holding        that   dismissal       for    lack     of     subject-matter\n\njurisdiction is proper when \"the claim is 'so insubstantial,\n\nimplausible, foreclosed by prior decisions . . . , or otherwise\n\ncompletely       devoid     of   merit     as    not    to     involve     a    federal\n\ncontroversy.'\") (quoting Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,\n\n414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974)); accord Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\n\n\n\ndamages may only be awarded based on a showing that the plaintiff\nwould have received the benefit absent the unlawful discrimination.\n\n                                          -17-\n\fComm'n, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 1759 (2002); Owasso Indep. Sch. Dist. No.\n\nI-011 v. Falvo, 122 S. Ct. 934, 938 (2002).            We therefore affirm\n\nthe ruling of the district court with respect to Donahue's claim\nfor damages.\n\n           2.   Claim for prospective relief\n\n           As we have already noted, standing to assert an equal\n\nprotection   claim   for   prospective   relief   is    viewed   through   a\n\ndifferent prism. The crucial difference between claims for damages\n\nand claims for prospective relief was summarized by the Lesage\n\nCourt in this manner:\n          [A] plaintiff who challenges an ongoing\n          race-conscious      program      and    seeks\n          forward-looking relief need not affirmatively\n          establish that he would receive the benefit in\n          question if race were not considered.      The\n          relevant injury in such cases is \"the\n          inability to compete on an equal footing.\"\n\n528 U.S. at 21 (quoting Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Assoc. Gen.\n\nContractors v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993)); accord\n\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 211; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n\n469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion).      In other words, a plaintiff\nmay establish standing for prospective relief if he has or is\nlikely to be \"expos[ed] to unequal treatment.\" Wooden, 247 F.3d at\n\n1279.   However, because the relief sought is forward-looking, the\nplaintiff must also be able to show that he is \"able and ready\" to\napply for the benefit and that the challenged \"discriminatory\n\npolicy prevents [him] from doing so.\"       Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at\n\n666; see also O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974)\n\n(\"Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a\n\n                                  -18-\n\fpresent case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if\n\nunaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\").\n\n            Notwithstanding the appellees' various arguments to the\ncontrary,   we   think   it   is    plain    that   Donahue   was   denied   the\n\nopportunity to compete on equal footing in the BPD's hiring process\n\non account of his race.            It is not disputed that at least one\nminority candidate -- one with no statutory preference or language\n\nskills -- was appointed to the Academy despite having scored lower\n\nthan Donahue on the May 1999 exam.                  Such evidence makes the\n\nconclusion inescapable: Donahue would likely have been hired based\n\non his May 1999 exam score if he were a minority applicant.\n\nAlthough this is not the same as evidence demonstrating that\n\nDonahue would have received an appointment under race-neutral\ncriteria, it is enough to satisfy a key element of standing to seek\n\nforward-looking relief.\n\n            Appellees assert, however, that Donahue lacks standing\nfor his prospective-relief claims for the additional reason that he\n\nis not \"able and ready\" to apply for future appointment to the BPD.\n\nThey note that Chapter 242 prevents individuals, such as Donahue,\n\nwho are over the age of thirty-two from applying for a position in\n\nthe police or fire department of any city that adopts the law.               See\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, ยง 58A.         Since Donahue can no longer apply\n\nto be a Boston police officer, appellees argue, he would not be\n\nsubject to a future violation of his right to compete for the job\n\non equal footing with all other applicants, regardless of race.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            Donahue responds by arguing first that Chapter 242, by\n\nits own terms, does not apply to him.              The statute states that\n\nthose aged thirty-two or older are not eligible for an \"original\nappointment.\" Id. Donahue contends that, because he has worked as\n\na police officer in another city (Yarmouth, Massachusetts), his\n\nappointment to a position in the BPD would not be \"original\" within\nthe   meaning    of    the   statute.      Appellees       dispute   Donahue's\n\ninterpretation    of    Chapter   242     and   argue   that    an   \"original\n\nappointment\" is the appointment of any person who has not been\n\npreviously appointed to the same position (i.e., a Boston police\n\nofficer).\n\n            Donahue    argues   further    that,   while    Boston   initially\n\naccepted Chapter 242, it has since repealed it.              Appellees assert\nthat this is simply not so.        But, unfortunately, the record does\n\nnot disclose what action, if any, the Boston City Council has taken\n\nwith respect to Chapter 242.\n            Because it is a relatively new statute, we find no\n\nMassachusetts cases that give a definitive interpretation of the\n\nreach of Chapter 242.        And it is difficult to determine on the\n\nrecord and briefs before us whether the statute would pose an\n\nobstacle to Donahue's standing to seek prospective relief.               As a\n\ngeneral matter, \"original appointment\" appears to be a term of art\n\nin the state civil service statutes that denotes any position that\n\nis filled from an eligible list established as the result of a\n\ncompetitive civil service examination. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31,\n\nยง 6; see generally City of Somerville v. Somerville Mun. Employees\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fAss'n, 481 N.E.2d 1176, 1180-81 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985) (noting the\n\ndifferences between \"original\" and \"promotional\" appointments under\n\nthe Massachusetts       civil service laws).           Such a definition appears\nto have been applied to an earlier statute, since repealed, that is\n\nanalogous to Chapter 242.        See Joseph v. Adm'r of the Div. of Pers.\n\nAdmin., 416 N.E.2d 990, 991-92 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981) (rescript\nopinion).\n\n            While these considerations would seem to point in favor\n\nof appellees' interpretation of Chapter 242, the answer is not\n\npellucid.     The parties have not provided us with the factual and\n\nlegal support for a reasoned conclusion, particularly in regards to\n\nthe question of whether Chapter 242 continues to be observed by the\n\nCity of Boston.8        In all events, Donahue's standing to pursue\nprospective    relief    in   the     form   of   an    injunction   against    the\n\noperation of the consent decree requires greater development.                    We\n\ntherefore reverse the district court's ruling insofar as it applies\nto Donahue's prospective-relief claims.\n\nB.   Motion to amend\n\n            Donahue     sought   to    add    a   handful    of   claims   to   his\ncomplaint by way of a motion to amend, which the district court\n\ndenied as moot following the entry of judgment on all of Donahue's\nclaims.   We review the district court's denial of Donahue's motion\n\n\n\n\n8\n   Donahue's claim that the Boston City Council has rescinded its\napproval of Chapter 242 is one that we expect will be backed with\nevidentiary support. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. 11(b)(3).\n\n                                       -21-\n\ffor an abuse of discretion.      Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            First, Donahue attempted to augment his complaint with a\nclaim for damages and injunctive relief based on his failure to be\n\nhired in light of his performance on the April 2001 civil service\n\nexam. As we have already discussed, Donahue scored 100 on the exam\nbut was not considered for employment because of Chapter 242.\n\nAppellees argue that, because Donahue was ineligible to seek future\n\nappointment to the BPD based on his age, the addition of any claim\n\nbased on the April 2001 test results would be futile.                      Donahue\n\nargues that the amendment would not be futile because the terms of\n\nChapter 242 do not apply to him and because the Boston City Council\n\nrescinded Chapter 242.\n            This leads to the second amendment Donahue sought to\n\ninclude     in   his   complaint:     a      claim    that     Chapter     242    is\n\nunconstitutional because its age restriction does not pass scrutiny\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\n\nKimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000) (\"States may\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of age without offending the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment if the age classification in question is rationally\n\nrelated to a legitimate state interest.\").               Appellees argue that\n\nsuch   an   amendment    would   be       futile     because    age   is    not   a\n\nconstitutionally protected class and, as a consequence, similar\n\nrestrictions for police officers have been upheld by other courts.\n\nSee Thomas v. U.S. Postal Inspection Serv., 647 F.2d 1035 (10th\n\nCir. 1981) (upholding an age limit of thirty-four for hiring postal\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\finspectors); Arritt v. Grisell, 567 F.2d 1267 (4th Cir. 1977)\n\n(upholding an age limit of thirty-five for hiring new police\n\nofficers); Sobieralski v. City of South Bend, 479 N.E.2d 98 (Ind.\nCt. App. 1985) (same); Figueroa v. Bronstein, 344 N.E.2d 402 (N.Y.\n\n1976) (per curiam) (same with regard to an age limit of thirty-\n\ntwo); Ridaught v. Div. of Fla. Hwy. Patrol, 314 So. 2d 140 (Fla.\n1975) (same with regard to an age limit of thirty-five); cf. Mass.\n\nBd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (holding that a\n\nMassachusetts statute mandating the retirement of uniformed police\n\nofficers at age fifty survives rational-basis scrutiny).\n\n           Because we remand part of Donahue's case for further\n\nconsideration, we view the motion to amend as no longer moot.\n\nHowever, there may be other reasons, well within the district\ncourt's discretion, for denying Donahue's motion.          Thus, we leave\n\nit to the district court upon remand to determine in the first\n\ninstance whether Donahue's proposed amendments are appropriate.\n\nC.   Claims against state appellees\n\n           Finally, Donahue complains that the district court erred\nin granting summary judgment on his remaining claims. The gravamen\nof these claims is that the state defendants violated 42 U.S.C.\n\nยงยง 1985 and 1986 by withholding certain documents (including copies\nof   the   original   consent   decree)   from   Donahue    in   a   manner\ninconsistent with the Massachusetts Public Records Law, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 66, ยง 10.      The district court's order does not mention\nthese claims, nor is it apparent that the court even considered the\n\nclaims before entering judgment on the entire case.          Nonetheless,\n\n                                  -23-\n\fwe may affirm the district court's judgment on any ground squarely\n\npresented below.     Pure Distribs., Inc. v. Baker, 285 F.3d 150, 156\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n          As an initial matter, Donahue makes only the most half-\n\nhearted attempt to challenge the entry of judgment. Donahue's main\n\nbrief devotes only three sentences to the issue, arguing in essence\nthat the absence of a reason given by the district court for\n\nentering judgment alone warrants reversal.       Our general rule with\n\nregard to such poorly developed arguments is to treat them as\n\nforfeited.   See Beatty v. Michael Bus. Mach. Corp., 172 F.3d 117,\n\n120-21 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999); Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142\n\nF.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Moreover, Donahue has not adduced the sort of evidence\nthat would support a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1985(3) and 1986.9\n\nA claim under ยง 1985(3) requires the plaintiff to show that (1)\n\nsome   class-based     animus   (usually    racial)   lay   behind   the\nconspirators' action, and (2) that the conspiracy was aimed at\n\ninterfering with protected rights.       See Bray v. Alexandria Women's\n\nHealth Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 267-68 (1993).      In this case, Donahue\n\n9\n   Section 1985 has three subsections, each of which sets forth a\ndistinct cause of action.    However, Donahue makes no effort to\nspecify the subsection under which his claim arises. We think the\nfirst two subsections are plainly inapplicable: ยง 1985(1) protects\nfederal officers from those conspiring to prevent (by force,\nintimidation, or threat) the officer from discharging his or her\nduties; and ยง 1985(2) protects parties and witnesses in federal\ncourt from conspiracies to deter them from appearing or testifying.\nSection 1985(3) is broader in its reach and prohibits, in general\nterms, conspiracies to violate civil rights. We therefore assume,\nfor the sake of argument, that Donahue intends to assert a claim\nunder ยงยง 1985(3) and 1986 (the latter extends liability to persons\nwho knowingly fail to prevent conspiracies under the former).\n\n                                  -24-\n\fpoints to no evidence -- direct or indirect -- of class-based\n\nanimus.   Instead, Donahue's claim appears to be nothing more than\n\na thinly disguised attempt to repackage a state-law public records\naction as a claim arising under federal law.      We therefore affirm\n\nthe district court's entry of judgment in favor of the state\n\nappellees.\n\n                           III.   CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district\n\ncourt's judgment with respect to Donahue's claim under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause for prospective equitable relief.       Because the\ncase remains active, the district court should also reevaluate the\n\npropriety of Donahue's motion to amend. In all other respects, the\ndistrict court's judgment is affirmed.         We remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n             Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\f",

The program is the product of a consent decree entered in 1973. <i>See Castro v. Beecher,</i> 365 F.Supp. 655 (D.Mass. 1973). After concluding that Donahue failed to establish standing to assert his claims, the district court entered judgment adverse to Donahue on all claims. For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The selection process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be eligible for appointment to the Boston Police Academy (\"the Academy\"), a candidate must take a statewide civil service examination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The examination is administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Human Resources Division (\"HRD\"). After HRD administers the exam, it compiles an \"eligible list\" setting forth those people who received a passing score on the examination (a score of at least seventy is considered passing). In accordance with the terms of the consent decree, HRD assembles the eligible list by alternating minority and non-minority candidates. All individuals on the eligible list are considered qualified for appointment to a civil service position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The candidates on the eligible list are then divided into residents and non-residents of Boston. Residents, regardless of score, are ranked higher than non-residents. Within the group of residents, candidates with so-called \"statutory preference\" receive an additional boost on the eligible list. The categories of statutory preferences include: (1) the children of firefighters or police officers who were killed or sustained injuries that resulted in death; (2) disabled veterans; (3) veterans; and (4) widows or widowed mothers of veterans who were killed in action or died from a service-connected disability incurred in wartime service. The candidates with a statutory preference are all ranked higher than those without a statutory preference. Candidates without a statutory preference or the requisite language skills are ranked according to their scores on the civil service examination, subject to the alternation requirement of the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the time comes to hire a new class of student officers, the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") requisitions a \"certification list\" from HRD to fill the positions. HRD then certifies sufficient names from the eligible list available for appointment. Starting from the top of the eligible list, and moving down in strict rank order, HRD creates the certification list by certifying roughly twice the number of persons requested by BPD. Subject to background checks on all candidates on the certification list, BPD must select candidates for appointment in order of their position on the list, starting with the highest-ranking person, unless it supplies a reason for bypassing someone. Special certification lists are also created for those candidates who qualify for a hiring preference based on their ability to speak Spanish, Vietnamese, and French-Creole. Typically, BPD hires one person for every three persons listed on the general certification list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this hiring procedure, BPD can hire new officers in three other ways. The first such mechanism is the appointment of police officers from a statutorily-created police cadets program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Second, former members of BPD who retired because of a disability may seek reinstatement to their former positions. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &#167; 8. And finally, the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council has promulgated regulations that allow an appointing authority to recycle former recruit officers into a subsequent Academy class. <i>See</i> 550 Code Mass. Regs. &#167; 3.04(1)(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The April 1997 exam</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue, a white male, took the statewide civil service examination administered by HRD on April 26, 1997. He received a passing score of ninety-two and was thus placed on the eligible list. Donahue does not qualify for a statutory preference, nor does he possess the language skills that would place him on a special certification list. Donahue's name appears at page twenty-seven of the eligible list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to BPD's requisition, HRD provided a certification list containing the names of the top 157 candidates who were eligible for appointment. In addition, HRD provided three special certification lists of persons who qualified for a hiring preference based on their ability to speak Spanish, Vietnamese, or French-Creole, respectively. On June 10, 1998, BPD appointed eighty-three people to the Academy, comprised of: (1) thirty-seven officers from the general certification list; (2) ten from the special language certification lists; (3) one disability retiree; (4) thirty-one cadets; and (5) four officers from a previous Academy class. All thirty-seven officers appointed from the general certification list qualified for a statutory preference. The last non-minority hired was a veteran whose name appears on page three of the eligible list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, BPD decided that it was necessary to appoint another class of officers from the same eligible list that was created from the results of the April 1997 exam. In response to BPD's requisition, HRD issued a certification list containing 163 names. Additional special certification lists were created with the names of those candidates with the requisite language skills. On May 12, 1999, BPD appointed fifty-six people to the Academy, comprised of: (1) thirty-one officers from the general certification list; (2) four from the language certification lists; (3) one disability retiree; (4) seventeen cadets; and (5) three officers recycled from a previous class. Of the thirty-one officers appointed from the general certification list, eighteen had statutory preferences. The thirteen officers without statutory preference, all minority candidates, scored higher on the exam than Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lowest-ranking non-minority applicant who was appointed to the May 1999 class was an individual whose name appeared on page four of the eligible list, while Donahue's name appeared on page twenty-seven. Since the names on the eligible list alternate between minority and non-minority, there were more than 580 non-minority names between the lowest-ranking non-minority appointee and Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The May 1999 Exam</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, 1999, HRD administered another statewide civil service entrance examination. Donahue passed this examination with a score of ninety-six. On March 5, 2001, consistent with the procedure we have already described, BPD appointed forty-nine new police officers, comprised of thirty-three candidates from the general certification list and sixteen from the cadet program. Twenty-six officers appointed from the general certification list qualified for a statutory preference. The seven without statutory preferences were all minority candidates certified to the list pursuant to the alternation requirement of the consent decree. Although six of these candidates had exam scores greater than Donahue's, one minority appointee had a lower exam score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lowest-ranking non-minority applicant appointed was an individual whose name appears on page two of the eligible list, at number ninety-one. Meanwhile, Donahue's name appears on page seven of the eligible list, at number 326. Thus, there were 117 non-minority candidates between the last non-minority appointee and Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Proceedings in the district court and the April 2001 exam</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue filed his complaint on May 10, 2000, asserting claims of discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983. The complaint names as defendants the City of Boston, the BPD, and the Commissioner of the BPD (collectively, \"appellees\"). Donahue also asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985 and 1986 against several state officials (collectively, \"state appellees\") based on their failure to comply with certain public record requests. Donahue's complaint prayed for injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing his complaint, Donahue took the civil service examination again on April 26, 2001, receiving a passing score of 100. BPD requisitioned a certification list in order to hire police officers from the class of individuals that took that exam. In response, HRD forwarded a certification list dated September 14, 2001. Donahue's name does not appear on that certification list. Appellees contend that, because Donahue had reached the age of thirty-two when he took the April 2001 exam, he was ineligible for appointment to the Academy under a recent state statute which provides that, in any municipality that adopts the statute, no person who has reached his thirty-second birthday on the date of the entrance examination shall be eligible to have his name certified for \"original appointment\" to a municipal police officer position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 2000 Mass. Acts ch. 242 (\"Chapter 242\") (codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 58A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, appellees moved for summary judgment on the ground that Donahue lacks constitutional standing to assert the claims set forth in his complaint. On September 13, 2001, Donahue cross-moved for summary judgment, claiming that the undisputed facts demonstrate that the consent decree is unconstitutional. On October 30, 2001, Donahue also moved for leave to amend his first amended complaint to add a claim based on the results of the April 2001 exam and to assert a challenge to the constitutionality of Chapter 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum and order dated December 13, 2001, the district court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. <i>Donahue v. City of Boston,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d 202 (D.Mass.2001). By orders entered December 14, 2001, the district court denied as moot Donahue's motion for summary judgment and his motion to amend the first amended complaint. Donahue's timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue makes numerous assertions of error on the part of the district court. Distilled to their essence, however, Donahue's arguments fall into three basic categories. First, Donahue argues that the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to assert an equal protection claim seeking both prospective and retrospective relief. Second, he argues that the court below abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend. Finally, he claims error in the district court's entry of judgment on his claims against the state appellees. We address these issues separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standing doctrine is grounded in the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III. <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). \"In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.\" <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). The \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\" contains three requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). First, a plaintiff seeking to invoke a federal court's jurisdiction must show that he has \"suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable interest.\" <i>Save Our Heritage, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin.,</i> 269 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130. The asserted injury must be \"(a) concrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the plaintiff must show a causal connection between the asserted injury and the challenged action of the defendant; this causal connection cannot be overly attenuated. <i>Id.</i> And third, the plaintiff must show that it is likely &#8212; rather than merely speculative &#8212; that \"the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" <i>Id.</i> at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[S]tanding is gauged by the specific common-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\" <i>Int'l Primate Prot. League v. Adm'rs of Tulane</i> <i>Educ. Fund,</i> 500 U.S. 72, 77, 111 S.Ct. 1700, 114 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991). That is, \"the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of ... whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the <i>particular claims asserted.</i>\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S. at 752, 104 S.Ct. 3315 (emphasis added). Thus, a plaintiff must ensure that he establishes standing for each claim and for each form of relief sought. <i>See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&#241;a,</i> 515 U.S. 200, 210-11, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its determination with respect to standing, the district court did not differentiate between Donahue's claim for retrospective relief in the form of damages and his claim for prospective relief in the form of an injunction and declaratory judgment. Because we perceive crucial analytical differences between the two claims, we scrutinize them independently of one another. Our review of the district court's ruling on standing is plenary. <i>Nyer v. Winterthur Int'l,</i> 290 F.3d 456, 459 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Damages claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue argues that he is entitled to pursue his damages claim because he was denied appointment to the BPD under a facially race-conscious hiring policy. In contrast, appellees argue that Donahue lacks standing to assert his claim for damages because he cannot demonstrate that he would have been hired under race-neutral criteria. We agree with appellees that Donahue cannot establish standing to claim damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in <i>Texas v. Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. 18, 120 S.Ct. 467, 145 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999) (per curiam). In <i>Lesage,</i> a white plaintiff brought an equal protection action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for monetary damages after unsuccessfully applying to a doctoral program at the University of Texas. <i>Id.</i> at 19, 120 S.Ct. 467. Although the university did not dispute that race was a factor considered at some stages of the admissions process, <i>id.,</i> the district court granted summary judgment to the university, reasoning that the plaintiff would have been denied admission even if race had not been a factor in the admissions process, <i>id.</i> at 20, 120 S.Ct. 467. Reversing the district court, the Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiff's chances under a color-blind admissions scheme were irrelevant if he could prove that his application was treated differently because of race. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court then reversed the Fifth Circuit, holding that the government was entitled to summary judgment on the damages claims. The Court stated, \"[s]imply put, where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under &#167; 1983.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Donahue's complaint alleged three instances in which he was passed over for appointment to the Academy. The first two instances stemmed from hiring decisions based on the results of the April 1997 exam. On that exam, roughly 580 non-minority applicants scored higher than Donahue but were not considered for appointment. Thus, in order for Donahue to have been appointed based on his April 1997 exam scores under an otherwise race-neutral policy, all of these applicants would have to be considered and rejected. The situation was similar when Donahue was passed over for a third time, based on the results of the May 1999 exam. There, roughly 120 non-minority applicants scored higher than Donahue but were also denied appointment. Under a race-neutral policy, the BPD would have had to consider and reject all of these candidates before Donahue was offered a position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is plain from the undisputed evidence that, notwithstanding the race-conscious elements of the consent decree, Donahue was too far down the list to be even remotely considered for hiring in any of the three instances of which he complains. It follows unavoidably from <i>Lesage</i> that Donahue's damages claim is therefore doomed to fail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would ordinarily be the end of our inquiry on this claim. However, the fact that this question comes to us as one framed in terms of Article III standing &#8212; which is, of course, jurisdictional in nature &#8212; adds one significant consideration. That is, this Court must resolve questions pertaining to its subject-matter jurisdiction before it may address the merits of a case. <i>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 101-02, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998); <i>see generally</i> Scott C. Idleman, <i>The Demise of Hypothetical Jurisdiction in the Federal Courts,</i> 52 Vand. L.Rev. 235 (1999) (examining the effects of <i>Steel Co.</i>'s prohibition on exercising \"hypothetical jurisdiction\"). We must therefore determine whether Donahue's inability to establish that he would have received the benefit he sought under a race-neutral policy warrants dismissal based on standing, or, alternatively, whether this deficiency in his case goes only to the ultimate merits of the claim. We hold that, in this case, dismissal for want of standing was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the Court's decision in <i>Lesage</i> does not specifically address standing. Nevertheless, we read <i>Lesage</i> as clarifying the \"injury in fact to a cognizable interest\" that is required to support standing for Donahue's damages claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Save Our Heritage,</i> 269 F.3d at 55; <i>see also</i> 1 Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John E. Nowak, <i>Treatise on Constitutional Law</i> &#167; 2.13, at 29 (2002 Supp.) (suggesting that <i>Lesage</i> is pertinent to evaluating standing for damages claims). Injury-in-fact is a touchstone of the standing inquiry, and the <i>Lesage</i> decision states in no uncertain terms that, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he would have received the sought-after benefit under race-neutral criteria, \"there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under &#167; 1983.\" 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467. Without the ability to establish a cognizable injury that would warrant the type of relief sought, a plaintiff cannot demonstrate the requisite injury, the causal link between the injury and the defendant's conduct, or redressability for the injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent decision from one of our sister circuits underscores the point. In <i>Aiken v. Hackett,</i> 281 F.3d 516 (6th Cir.2002), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> 70 U.S.L.W. 3742 (May 20, 2002) (No. 01-1707), the Sixth Circuit addressed an equal protection claim by several white police officers who sought and were denied promotions to the position of sergeant. The promotion system was governed by a consent decree that required a certain number of minority candidates to be promoted. <i>Id.</i> at 518. Although some white officers would have received the promotion in the absence of a racial preference, the <i>Aiken</i> plaintiffs were not among them. As the court stated, it was \"beyond debate that ... [the plaintiffs] still would not have been promoted to sergeant,\" as it was their \"composite [test] scores (not the City's affirmative action program) [that] kept them from being promoted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 519. Accordingly, the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek retrospective relief, reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the plaintiffs allege that a racial preference cost them some benefit under a government program, those plaintiffs may have alleged an injury in fact. But if those same plaintiffs cannot also allege and show that \"under a race-neutral policy\" they would have received the benefit, those plaintiffs have not alleged an injury in fact because they have not alleged an invasion of some interest that the law protects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least one circuit, however, has concluded that an equal protection plaintiff who seeks damages in a challenge to an affirmative action plan need not demonstrate, for purposes of standing, that he would have received the sought-after benefit in the absence of considerations of race. <i>See Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga.,</i> 247 F.3d 1262, 1279 (11th Cir.2001). The <i>Wooden</i> court reasoned that \"the injury in these kinds of cases is not the denial of the sought-after benefit, but rather the direct exposure to unequal treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1280. The court reasoned further that the plaintiff's inability to show that he would have ultimately obtained the benefit under race-neutral criteria under <i>Lesage</i> \"goes less to standing than it does to [his] ability to succeed on the merits of his claim.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis hews closer to <i>Aiken</i> than <i>Wooden.</i> We think that <i>Lesage</i> is a clear cue from the Supreme Court that we cannot apply identical standing analyses to claims for damages and claims for prospective relief. It is equally apparent, in light of <i>Lesage,</i> that the \"equal footing\" analysis is applied only in claims for the latter type of relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Our standing inquiry on the claim for damages therefore asks whether Donahue can demonstrate that, under a race-neutral policy, he would have received the benefit for which he now seeks compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, cases will arise where, because the issues of causation and injury are disputed and fact-intensive, the plaintiff's inability to demonstrate damages should be treated as a merit-based question. <i>See, e.g., Mt. Healthy Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (holding that, even if the government has considered an impermissible criterion in making a decision adverse to the plaintiff, it can defeat liability by proving as an affirmative defense that it would have made the same decision absent the forbidden consideration). But in Donahue's case, his inability to qualify for hiring on race-neutral grounds is so overwhelmingly established that any claim to the contrary would be \"wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\" <i>Bell v. Hood,</i> 327 U.S. 678, 682-83, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). Where the absence of causation and a relevant injury-in-fact are presented with such clarity, dismissal for lack of subject-matter is justified. <i>See Steel Co.,</i> 523 U.S. at 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003 (holding that dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is proper when \"the claim is `so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions..., or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.'\") (quoting <i>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida,</i> 414 U.S. 661, 666, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974)); <i>accord Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 535 U.S. 635, ___, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 1759, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002); <i>Owasso Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-011 v. Falvo,</i> 534 U.S. 426, 122 S.Ct. 934, 938, 151 L.Ed.2d 896 (2002). We therefore affirm the ruling of the district court with respect to Donahue's claim for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Claim for prospective relief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already noted, standing to assert an equal protection claim for prospective relief is viewed through a different prism. The crucial difference between claims for damages and claims for prospective relief was summarized by the <i>Lesage</i> Court in this manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] plaintiff who challenges an ongoing race-conscious program and seeks forward-looking relief need not affirmatively establish that he would receive the benefit in question if race were not considered. The relevant injury in such cases is \"the inability to compete on an equal footing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">528 U.S. at 21, 120 S.Ct. 467 (quoting <i>Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Assoc. Gen. Contractors v. Jacksonville,</i> 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993)); <i>accord Adarand,</i> 515 U.S. at 211, 115 S.Ct. 2097; <i>Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (plurality opinion). In other words, a plaintiff may establish standing for prospective relief if he has or is likely to be \"expos[ed] to unequal treatment.\" <i>Wooden,</i> 247 F.3d at 1279. However, because the relief sought is forward-looking, the plaintiff must also be able to show that he is \"able and ready\" to apply for the benefit and that the challenged \"discriminatory policy prevents [him] from doing so.\" <i>Jacksonville,</i> 508 U.S. at 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297; <i>see also O'Shea v. Littleton,</i> 414 U.S. 488, 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (\"Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the appellees' various arguments to the contrary, we think it is plain that Donahue was denied the opportunity to compete on equal footing in the BPD's hiring process on account of his race. It is not disputed that at least one minority candidate &#8212; one with no statutory preference or language skills &#8212; was appointed to the Academy despite having scored lower than Donahue on the May 1999 exam. Such evidence makes the conclusion inescapable: Donahue would likely have been hired based on his May 1999 exam score if he were a minority applicant. Although this is not the same as evidence demonstrating that Donahue would have received an appointment under race-neutral criteria, it is enough to satisfy a key element of standing to seek forward-looking relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees assert, however, that Donahue lacks standing for his prospective-relief claims for the additional reason that he is not \"able and ready\" to apply for future appointment to the BPD. They note that Chapter 242 prevents individuals, such as Donahue, who are over the age of thirty-two from applying for a position in the police or fire department of any city that adopts the law. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 58A. Since Donahue can no longer apply to be a Boston police officer, appellees argue, he would not be subject to a future violation of his right to compete for the job on equal footing with all other applicants, regardless of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue responds by arguing first that Chapter 242, by its own terms, does not apply to him. The statute states that those aged thirty-two or older are not eligible for an \"original appointment.\" <i>Id.</i> Donahue contends that, because he has worked as a police officer in another city (Yarmouth, Massachusetts), his appointment to a position in the BPD would not be \"original\" within the meaning of the statute. Appellees dispute Donahue's interpretation of Chapter 242 and argue that an \"original appointment\" is the appointment of any person who has not been previously appointed to the same position (<i>i.e.,</i> a Boston police officer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue argues further that, while Boston initially accepted Chapter 242, it has since repealed it. Appellees assert that this is simply not so. But, unfortunately, the record does not disclose what action, if any, the Boston City Council has taken with respect to Chapter 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it is a relatively new statute, we find no Massachusetts cases that give a definitive interpretation of the reach of Chapter 242. And it is difficult to determine on the record and briefs before us whether the statute would pose an obstacle to Donahue's standing to seek prospective relief. As a general matter, \"original appointment\" appears to be a term of art in the state civil service statutes that denotes any position that is filled from an eligible list established as the result of a competitive civil service examination. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 6; <i>see generally City of Somerville v. Somerville Mun. Employees Ass'n,</i> 20 Mass.App.Ct. 594, 481 N.E.2d 1176, 1180-81 (Mass.App.Ct.1985) (noting the differences between \"original\" and \"promotional\" appointments under the Massachusetts civil service laws). Such a definition appears to have been applied to an earlier statute, since repealed, that is analogous to Chapter 242. <i>See Joseph v. Adm'r of Div. of Pers. Admin.,</i> 11 Mass. App.Ct. 943, 416 N.E.2d 990, 991-92 (Mass.App.Ct.1981) (rescript opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these considerations would seem to point in favor of appellees' interpretation of Chapter 242, the answer is not pellucid. The parties have not provided us with the factual and legal support for a reasoned conclusion, particularly in regards to the question of whether Chapter 242 continues to be observed by the City of Boston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In all events, Donahue's standing to pursue prospective relief in the form of an injunction against the operation of the consent decree requires greater development. We therefore reverse the district court's ruling insofar as it applies to Donahue's prospective-relief claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Motion to amend</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue sought to add a handful of claims to his complaint by way of a motion to amend, which the district court denied as moot following the entry of judgment on all of Donahue's claims. We review the district court's denial of Donahue's motion for an abuse of discretion. <i>Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Donahue attempted to augment his complaint with a claim for damages and injunctive relief based on his failure to be hired in light of his performance on the April 2001 civil service exam. As we have already discussed, Donahue scored 100 on the exam but was not considered for employment because of Chapter 242. Appellees argue that, because Donahue was ineligible to seek future appointment to the BPD based on his age, the addition of any claim based on the April 2001 test results would be futile. Donahue argues that the amendment would not be futile because the terms of Chapter 242 do not apply to him and because the Boston City Council rescinded Chapter 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to the second amendment Donahue sought to include in his complaint: a claim that Chapter 242 is unconstitutional because its age restriction does not pass scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> 528 U.S. 62, 83, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000) (\"States may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the Fourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\"). Appellees argue that such an amendment would be futile because age is not a constitutionally protected class and, as a consequence, similar restrictions for police officers have been upheld by other courts. <i>See Thomas v. U.S. Postal Inspection Serv.,</i> 647 F.2d 1035 (10th Cir.1981) (upholding an age limit of thirty-four for hiring postal inspectors); <i>Arritt v. Grisell,</i> 567 F.2d 1267 (4th Cir.1977) (upholding an age limit of thirty-five for hiring new police officers); <i>Sobieralski v. City of South Bend,</i> 479 N.E.2d 98 (Ind.Ct.App.1985) (same); <i>Figueroa v. Bronstein,</i> 38 N.Y.2d 533, 381 N.Y.S.2d 470, 344 N.E.2d 402 (N.Y.1976) (per curiam) (same with regard to an age limit of thirty-two); <i>Ridaught v. Div. of Fla. Hwy. Patrol,</i> 314 So.2d 140 (Fla.1975) (same with regard to an age limit of thirty-five); <i>cf. Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia,</i> 427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (holding that a Massachusetts statute mandating the retirement of uniformed police officers at age fifty survives rational-basis scrutiny).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we remand part of Donahue's case for further consideration, we view the motion to amend as no longer moot. However, there may be other reasons, well within the district court's discretion, for denying Donahue's motion. Thus, we leave it to the district court upon remand to determine in the first instance whether Donahue's proposed amendments are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Claims against state appellees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Donahue complains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his remaining claims. The gravamen of these claims is that the state defendants violated 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985 and 1986 by withholding certain documents (including copies of the original consent decree) from Donahue in a manner inconsistent with the Massachusetts Public Records Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 66, &#167; 10. The district court's order does not mention these claims, nor is it apparent that the court even considered the claims before entering judgment on the entire case. Nonetheless, we may affirm the district court's judgment on any ground squarely presented below. <i>Pure Distribs., Inc. v. Baker,</i> 285 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, Donahue makes only the most half-hearted attempt to challenge the entry of judgment. Donahue's main brief devotes only three sentences to the issue, arguing in essence that the absence of a reason given by the district court for entering judgment alone warrants reversal. Our general rule with regard to such poorly developed arguments is to treat them as forfeited. <i>See Beatty v. Michael Bus. Mach. Corp.,</i> 172 F.3d 117, 120-21 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Donahue has not adduced the sort of evidence that would support a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985(3) and 1986.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> A claim under &#167; 1985(3) requires the plaintiff to show that (1) some class-based animus (usually racial) lay behind the conspirators' action, and (2) that the conspiracy was aimed at interfering with protected rights. <i>See Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic,</i> 506 U.S. 263, 267-68, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993). In this case, Donahue points to no evidence &#8212; direct or indirect &#8212; of class-based animus. Instead, Donahue's claim appears to be nothing more than a thinly disguised attempt to repackage a state-law public records action as a claim arising under federal law. We therefore affirm the district court's entry of judgment in favor of the state appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district court's judgment with respect to Donahue's claim under the Equal Protection Clause for prospective equitable relief. Because the case remains active, the district court should also reevaluate the propriety of Donahue's motion to amend. In all other respects, the district court's judgment is affirmed. We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In accordance with the terms of the consent decree, the civil service exam has been validated under the testing guidelines of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,<i>see</i> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1607 (1978).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The cadet program is authorized by state statute,<i>see</i> 1984 Mass.

The program enables the BPD to recruit prospective candidates for entry-level police officer positions from all areas of Boston by employing police cadets to perform administrative duties while obtaining some basic experience and training. Once a person is a cadet for two years, passes the statewide civil service examination, and successfully completes the same screening procedures used to evaluate applicants from the certification list, that person can be appointed to the Academy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The entire text of the statute reads:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, in any city, town or district that accepts this section, no person shall be eligible to have his name certified for original appointment to the position of firefighter or police officer if such person has reached his thirty-second birthday on the date of the entrance examination.

While this argument demonstrates admirable creativity, it is not persuasive. A litigant cannot use the fact that he filed his lawsuit to bootstrap an argument against potential standing and causation deficiencies in the very same lawsuit</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Donahue also argues at some length that appellees are implementing the terms of the consent decree incorrectly by hiring new officers from the cadet program. It is unclear how this allegation bears on Donahue's claim that he was discriminated against based on his race. To the extent he intimates that the cadet program is being operated based on a racial quota system, he offers little more than speculation as to the program's supposedly discriminatory operation. Nor does he contend that he applied for the cadet program but was denied entrance due to unlawful racial considerations.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> It is noteworthy that Donahue did not assert a claim of race discrimination under Title VII, which makes it unlawful for an employer to consider race as \"a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(m). An employer who violates this provision may still be held liable for declaratory relief, certain limited injunctive relief, and attorney's fees, even though the employer would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor<i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Congress is empowered to create substantive rights and to authorize suit for their enforcement. Consequently, Congress may define an injury, as it did in Title VII, in a way that provides the basis for standing even in the absence of other injury to the plaintiff. <i>See Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. at 580, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). But as Donahue made no claim under Title VII, we need not consider its implications for his standing to sue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although a plaintiff might be able to demonstrate that he was prevented from competing on equal footing, it is unclear how such a plaintiff would satisfy the element of redressability necessary to assert a claim for damages<i>Lesage</i> plainly dictates that damages may only be awarded based on a showing that the plaintiff would have received the benefit absent the unlawful discrimination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Donahue's claim that the Boston City Council has rescinded its approval of Chapter 242 is one that we expect will be backed with evidentiary support<i>Cf.</i> Fed.

Civ. 11(b)(3).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Section 1985 has three subsections, each of which sets forth a distinct cause of action. However, Donahue makes no effort to specify the subsection under which his claim arises. We think the first two subsections are plainly inapplicable: &#167; 1985(1) protects federal officers from those conspiring to prevent (by force, intimidation, or threat) the officer from discharging his or her duties; and &#167; 1985(2) protects parties and witnesses in federal court from conspiracies to deter them from appearing or testifying. Section 1985(3) is broader in its reach and prohibits, in general terms, conspiracies to violate civil rights. We therefore assume, for the sake of argument, that Donahue intends to assert a claim under &#167;&#167; 1985(3) and 1986 (the latter extends liability to persons who knowingly fail to prevent conspiracies under the former)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The program is the product of a consent decree entered in 1973. <i>See Castro v.

After concluding that Donahue failed to establish standing to assert his claims, the district court entered judgment adverse to Donahue on all claims. For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The selection process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be eligible for appointment to the Boston Police Academy (\"the Academy\"), a candidate must take a statewide civil service examination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The examination is administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Human Resources Division (\"HRD\"). After HRD administers the exam, it compiles an \"eligible list\" setting forth those people who received a passing score on the examination (a score of at least seventy is considered passing). In accordance with the terms of the consent decree, HRD assembles the eligible list by alternating minority and non-minority candidates. All individuals on the eligible list are considered qualified for appointment to a civil service position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The candidates on the eligible list are then divided into residents and non-residents of Boston. Residents, regardless of score, are ranked higher than non-residents. Within the group of residents, candidates with so-called \"statutory preference\" receive an additional boost on the eligible list. The categories of statutory preferences include: (1) the children of firefighters or police officers who were killed or sustained injuries that resulted in death; (2) disabled veterans; (3) veterans; and (4) widows or widowed mothers of veterans who were killed in action or died from a service-connected disability incurred in wartime service. The candidates with a statutory preference are all ranked higher than those without a statutory preference. Candidates without a statutory preference or the requisite language skills are ranked according to their scores on the civil service examination, subject to the alternation requirement of the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the time comes to hire a new class of student officers, the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") requisitions a \"certification list\" from HRD to fill the positions. HRD then certifies sufficient names from the eligible list available for appointment. Starting from the top of the eligible list, and moving down in strict rank order, HRD creates the certification list by certifying roughly twice the number of persons requested by BPD. Subject to background checks on all candidates on the certification list, BPD must select candidates for appointment in order of their position on the list, starting with the highest-ranking person, unless it supplies a reason for bypassing someone. Special certification lists are also created for those candidates who qualify for a hiring preference based on their ability to speak Spanish, Vietnamese, and French-Creole. Typically, BPD hires one person for every three persons listed on the general certification list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this hiring procedure, BPD can hire new officers in three other ways. The first such mechanism is the appointment of police officers from a statutorily-created police cadets program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Second, former members of BPD who retired because of a disability may seek reinstatement to their former positions. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &#167; 8. And finally, the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council has promulgated regulations that allow an appointing authority to recycle former recruit officers into a subsequent Academy class. <i>See</i> 550 Code Mass.

The April 1997 exam</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue, a white male, took the statewide civil service examination administered by HRD on April 26, 1997. He received a passing score of ninety-two and was thus placed on the eligible list. Donahue does not qualify for a statutory preference, nor does he possess the language skills that would place him on a special certification list. Donahue's name appears at page twenty-seven of the eligible list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to BPD's requisition, HRD provided a certification list containing the names of the top 157 candidates who were eligible for appointment. In addition, HRD provided three special certification lists of persons who qualified for a hiring preference based on their ability to speak Spanish, Vietnamese, or French-Creole, respectively. On June 10, 1998, BPD appointed eighty-three people to the Academy, comprised of: (1) thirty-seven officers from the general certification list; (2) ten from the special language certification lists; (3) one disability retiree; (4) thirty-one cadets; and (5) four officers from a previous Academy class. All thirty-seven officers appointed from the general certification list qualified for a statutory preference. The last non-minority hired was a veteran whose name appears on page three of the eligible list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, BPD decided that it was necessary to appoint another class of officers from the same eligible list that was created from the results of the April 1997 exam. In response to BPD's requisition, HRD issued a certification list containing 163 names. Additional special certification lists were created with the names of those candidates with the requisite language skills. On May 12, 1999, BPD appointed fifty-six people to the Academy, comprised of: (1) thirty-one officers from the general certification list; (2) four from the language certification lists; (3) one disability retiree; (4) seventeen cadets; and (5) three officers recycled from a previous class. Of the thirty-one officers appointed from the general certification list, eighteen had statutory preferences. The thirteen officers without statutory preference, all minority candidates, scored higher on the exam than Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lowest-ranking non-minority applicant who was appointed to the May 1999 class was an individual whose name appeared on page four of the eligible list, while Donahue's name appeared on page twenty-seven. Since the names on the eligible list alternate between minority and non-minority, there were more than 580 non-minority names between the lowest-ranking non-minority appointee and Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Donahue passed this examination with a score of ninety-six. On March 5, 2001, consistent with the procedure we have already described, BPD appointed forty-nine new police officers, comprised of thirty-three candidates from the general certification list and sixteen from the cadet program. Twenty-six officers appointed from the general certification list qualified for a statutory preference. The seven without statutory preferences were all minority candidates certified to the list pursuant to the alternation requirement of the consent decree. Although six of these candidates had exam scores greater than Donahue's, one minority appointee had a lower exam score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lowest-ranking non-minority applicant appointed was an individual whose name appears on page two of the eligible list, at number ninety-one. Meanwhile, Donahue's name appears on page seven of the eligible list, at number 326. Thus, there were 117 non-minority candidates between the last non-minority appointee and Donahue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

The complaint names as defendants the City of Boston, the BPD, and the Commissioner of the BPD (collectively, \"appellees\"). Donahue also asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985 and 1986 against several state officials (collectively, \"state appellees\") based on their failure to comply with certain public record requests. Donahue's complaint prayed for injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After filing his complaint, Donahue took the civil service examination again on April 26, 2001, receiving a passing score of 100. BPD requisitioned a certification list in order to hire police officers from the class of individuals that took that exam. In response, HRD forwarded a certification list dated September 14, 2001. Donahue's name does not appear on that certification list. Appellees contend that, because Donahue had reached the age of thirty-two when he took the April 2001 exam, he was ineligible for appointment to the Academy under a recent state statute which provides that, in any municipality that adopts the statute, no person who has reached his thirty-second birthday on the date of the entrance examination shall be eligible to have his name certified for \"original appointment\" to a municipal police officer position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 2000 Mass.

On September 13, 2001, Donahue cross-moved for summary judgment, claiming that the undisputed facts demonstrate that the consent decree is unconstitutional. On October 30, 2001, Donahue also moved for leave to amend his first amended complaint to add a claim based on the results of the April 2001 exam and to assert a challenge to the constitutionality of Chapter 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum and order dated December 13, 2001, the district court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. <i>Donahue v.

Distilled to their essence, however, Donahue's arguments fall into three basic categories. First, Donahue argues that the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to assert an equal protection claim seeking both prospective and retrospective relief. Second, he argues that the court below abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend. Finally, he claims error in the district court's entry of judgment on his claims against the state appellees. We address these issues separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

The Court stated, \"[s]imply put, where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under &#167; 1983.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1854808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1854808/texas-v-lesage/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The first two instances stemmed from hiring decisions based on the results of the April 1997 exam. On that exam, roughly 580 non-minority applicants scored higher than Donahue but were not considered for appointment. Thus, in order for Donahue to have been appointed based on his April 1997 exam scores under an otherwise race-neutral policy, all of these applicants would have to be considered and rejected. The situation was similar when Donahue was passed over for a third time, based on the results of the May 1999 exam. There, roughly 120 non-minority applicants scored higher than Donahue but were also denied appointment. Under a race-neutral policy, the BPD would have had to consider and reject all of these candidates before Donahue was offered a position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is plain from the undisputed evidence that, notwithstanding the race-conscious elements of the consent decree, Donahue was too far down the list to be even remotely considered for hiring in any of the three instances of which he complains. It follows unavoidably from <i>Lesage</i> that Donahue's damages claim is therefore doomed to fail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would ordinarily be the end of our inquiry on this claim. However, the fact that this question comes to us as one framed in terms of Article III standing &#8212; which is, of course, jurisdictional in nature &#8212; adds one significant consideration. That is, this Court must resolve questions pertaining to its subject-matter jurisdiction before it may address the merits of a case. <i>See Steel Co. v.

L.Rev. 235 (1999) (examining the effects of <i>Steel Co.</i>'s prohibition on exercising \"hypothetical jurisdiction\"). We must therefore determine whether Donahue's inability to establish that he would have received the benefit he sought under a race-neutral policy warrants dismissal based on standing, or, alternatively, whether this deficiency in his case goes only to the ultimate merits of the claim. We hold that, in this case, dismissal for want of standing was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own terms, the Court's decision in <i>Lesage</i> does not specifically address standing.

Injury-in-fact is a touchstone of the standing inquiry, and the <i>Lesage</i> decision states in no uncertain terms that, unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he would have received the sought-after benefit under race-neutral criteria, \"there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under &#167; 1983.\" 528 U.S. at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1854808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1854808/texas-v-lesage/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The promotion system was governed by a consent decree that required a certain number of minority candidates to be promoted. <i>Id.</i> at 518. Although some white officers would have received the promotion in the absence of a racial preference, the <i>Aiken</i> plaintiffs were not among them. As the court stated, it was \"beyond debate that ... [the plaintiffs] still would not have been promoted to sergeant,\" as it was their \"composite [test] scores (not the City's affirmative action program) [that] kept them from being promoted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 519. Accordingly, the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek retrospective relief, reasoning as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the plaintiffs allege that a racial preference cost them some benefit under a government program, those plaintiffs may have alleged an injury in fact. But if those same plaintiffs cannot also allege and show that \"under a race-neutral policy\" they would have received the benefit, those plaintiffs have not alleged an injury in fact because they have not alleged an invasion of some interest that the law protects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least one circuit, however, has concluded that an equal protection plaintiff who seeks damages in a challenge to an affirmative action plan need not demonstrate, for purposes of standing, that he would have received the sought-after benefit in the absence of considerations of race. <i>See Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></span>, 1279 (11th Cir.2001). The <i>Wooden</i> court reasoned that \"the injury in these kinds of cases is not the denial of the sought-after benefit, but rather the direct exposure to unequal treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1280. The court reasoned further that the plaintiff's inability to show that he would have ultimately obtained the benefit under race-neutral criteria under <i>Lesage</i> \"goes less to standing than it does to [his] ability to succeed on the merits of his claim.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis hews closer to <i>Aiken</i> than <i>Wooden.</i> We think that <i>Lesage</i> is a clear cue from the Supreme Court that we cannot apply identical standing analyses to claims for damages and claims for prospective relief. It is equally apparent, in light of <i>Lesage,</i> that the \"equal footing\" analysis is applied only in claims for the latter type of relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Our standing inquiry on the claim for damages therefore asks whether Donahue can demonstrate that, under a race-neutral policy, he would have received the benefit for which he now seeks compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, cases will arise where, because the issues of causation and injury are disputed and fact-intensive, the plaintiff's inability to demonstrate damages should be treated as a merit-based question. <i>See, e.g., Mt.

It is not disputed that at least one minority candidate &#8212; one with no statutory preference or language skills &#8212; was appointed to the Academy despite having scored lower than Donahue on the May 1999 exam. Such evidence makes the conclusion inescapable: Donahue would likely have been hired based on his May 1999 exam score if he were a minority applicant. Although this is not the same as evidence demonstrating that Donahue would have received an appointment under race-neutral criteria, it is enough to satisfy a key element of standing to seek forward-looking relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees assert, however, that Donahue lacks standing for his prospective-relief claims for the additional reason that he is not \"able and ready\" to apply for future appointment to the BPD. They note that Chapter 242 prevents individuals, such as Donahue, who are over the age of thirty-two from applying for a position in the police or fire department of any city that adopts the law. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 58A. Since Donahue can no longer apply to be a Boston police officer, appellees argue, he would not be subject to a future violation of his right to compete for the job on equal footing with all other applicants, regardless of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue responds by arguing first that Chapter 242, by its own terms, does not apply to him. The statute states that those aged thirty-two or older are not eligible for an \"original appointment.\" <i>Id.</i> Donahue contends that, because he has worked as a police officer in another city (Yarmouth, Massachusetts), his appointment to a position in the BPD would not be \"original\" within the meaning of the statute. Appellees dispute Donahue's interpretation of Chapter 242 and argue that an \"original appointment\" is the appointment of any person who has not been previously appointed to the same position (<i>i.e.,</i> a Boston police officer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue argues further that, while Boston initially accepted Chapter 242, it has since repealed it. Appellees assert that this is simply not so. But, unfortunately, the record does not disclose what action, if any, the Boston City Council has taken with respect to Chapter 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it is a relatively new statute, we find no Massachusetts cases that give a definitive interpretation of the reach of Chapter 242. And it is difficult to determine on the record and briefs before us whether the statute would pose an obstacle to Donahue's standing to seek prospective relief. As a general matter, \"original appointment\" appears to be a term of art in the state civil service statutes that denotes any position that is filled from an eligible list established as the result of a competitive civil service examination. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &#167; 6; <i>see generally City of Somerville v. Somerville Mun. Employees Ass'n,</i> 20 Mass.App.Ct. 594, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2103325\"><a href=\"/opinion/2103325/somerville-v-somerville-mun-employees-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></a></span>, 1180-81 (Mass.App.Ct.1985) (noting the differences between \"original\" and \"promotional\" appointments under the Massachusetts civil service laws). Such a definition appears to have been applied to an earlier statute, since repealed, that is analogous to Chapter 242. <i>See Joseph v. Adm'r of Div. of Pers. Admin.,</i> 11 Mass. App.Ct. 943, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></span>, 991-92 (Mass.App.Ct.1981) (rescript opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these considerations would seem to point in favor of appellees' interpretation of Chapter 242, the answer is not pellucid. The parties have not provided us with the factual and legal support for a reasoned conclusion, particularly in regards to the question of whether Chapter 242 continues to be observed by the City of Boston.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In all events, Donahue's standing to pursue prospective relief in the form of an injunction against the operation of the consent decree requires greater development.

Motion to amend</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donahue sought to add a handful of claims to his complaint by way of a motion to amend, which the district court denied as moot following the entry of judgment on all of Donahue's claims. We review the district court's denial of Donahue's motion for an abuse of discretion. <i>Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Donahue attempted to augment his complaint with a claim for damages and injunctive relief based on his failure to be hired in light of his performance on the April 2001 civil service exam. As we have already discussed, Donahue scored 100 on the exam but was not considered for employment because of Chapter 242. Appellees argue that, because Donahue was ineligible to seek future appointment to the BPD based on his age, the addition of any claim based on the April 2001 test results would be futile. Donahue argues that the amendment would not be futile because the terms of Chapter 242 do not apply to him and because the Boston City Council rescinded Chapter 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to the second amendment Donahue sought to include in his complaint: a claim that Chapter 242 is unconstitutional because its age restriction does not pass scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See Kimel v.

Thus, we leave it to the district court upon remand to determine in the first instance whether Donahue's proposed amendments are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Claims against state appellees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Donahue complains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his remaining claims. The gravamen of these claims is that the state defendants violated 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985 and 1986 by withholding certain documents (including copies of the original consent decree) from Donahue in a manner inconsistent with the Massachusetts Public Records Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 66, &#167; 10. The district court's order does not mention these claims, nor is it apparent that the court even considered the claims before entering judgment on the entire case. Nonetheless, we may affirm the district court's judgment on any ground squarely presented below. <i>Pure Distribs., Inc. v. Baker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></span>, 156 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, Donahue makes only the most half-hearted attempt to challenge the entry of judgment. Donahue's main brief devotes only three sentences to the issue, arguing in essence that the absence of a reason given by the district court for entering judgment alone warrants reversal. Our general rule with regard to such poorly developed arguments is to treat them as forfeited. <i>See Beatty v. Michael Bus. Mach. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762749\"><a href=\"/opinion/762749/kevin-p-beatty-and-cynthia-l-beatty-v-michael-business-machines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 120-21 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am.

Alexandria Women's Health Clinic,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112805\"><a href=\"/opinion/112805/bray-v-alexandria-womens-health-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 267-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112805\"><a href=\"/opinion/112805/bray-v-alexandria-womens-health-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span> (1993). In this case, Donahue points to no evidence &#8212; direct or indirect &#8212; of class-based animus. Instead, Donahue's claim appears to be nothing more than a thinly disguised attempt to repackage a state-law public records action as a claim arising under federal law. We therefore affirm the district court's entry of judgment in favor of the state appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district court's judgment with respect to Donahue's claim under the Equal Protection Clause for prospective equitable relief. Because the case remains active, the district court should also reevaluate the propriety of Donahue's motion to amend. In all other respects, the district court's judgment is affirmed. We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In accordance with the terms of the consent decree, the civil service exam has been validated under the testing guidelines of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,<i>see</i> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1607 (1978).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The cadet program is authorized by state statute,<i>see</i> 1984 Mass. Acts ch. 277, which permits the Boston Police Department to hire up to 33 percent of its new officers each year from the program, <i>see</i> 1979 Mass. Acts ch. 560. The program enables the BPD to recruit prospective candidates for entry-level police officer positions from all areas of Boston by employing police cadets to perform administrative duties while obtaining some basic experience and training. Once a person is a cadet for two years, passes the statewide civil service examination, and successfully completes the same screening procedures used to evaluate applicants from the certification list, that person can be appointed to the Academy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The entire text of the statute reads:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, in any city, town or district that accepts this section, no person shall be eligible to have his name certified for original appointment to the position of firefighter or police officer if such person has reached his thirty-second birthday on the date of the entrance examination.

Fletcher, <i>The Structure of Standing,</i> 98 Yale L.J. 221, 251-53 (1988).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Donahue attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that, since he is the only BPD applicant to have filed a lawsuit and other unsuccessful non-minority applicants have now forfeited their rights, he is essentially the \"next in line\" for an appointment to the BPD. While this argument demonstrates admirable creativity, it is not persuasive. A litigant cannot use the fact that he filed his lawsuit to bootstrap an argument against potential standing and causation deficiencies in the very same lawsuit</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Donahue also argues at some length that appellees are implementing the terms of the consent decree incorrectly by hiring new officers from the cadet program. It is unclear how this allegation bears on Donahue's claim that he was discriminated against based on his race. To the extent he intimates that the cadet program is being operated based on a racial quota system, he offers little more than speculation as to the program's supposedly discriminatory operation. Nor does he contend that he applied for the cadet program but was denied entrance due to unlawful racial considerations.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> It is noteworthy that Donahue did not assert a claim of race discrimination under Title VII, which makes it unlawful for an employer to consider race as \"a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(m). An employer who violates this provision may still be held liable for declaratory relief, certain limited injunctive relief, and attorney's fees, even though the employer would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor<i>Id.</i> &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Congress is empowered to create substantive rights and to authorize suit for their enforcement. Consequently, Congress may define an injury, as it did in Title VII, in a way that provides the basis for standing even in the absence of other injury to the plaintiff. <i>See Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. at 580, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2130</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). But as Donahue made no claim under Title VII, we need not consider its implications for his standing to sue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although a plaintiff might be able to demonstrate that he was prevented from competing on equal footing, it is unclear how such a plaintiff would satisfy the element of redressability necessary to assert a claim for damages<i>Lesage</i> plainly dictates that damages may only be awarded based on a showing that the plaintiff would have received the benefit absent the unlawful discrimination.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Donahue's claim that the Boston City Council has rescinded its approval of Chapter 242 is one that we expect will be backed with evidentiary support<i>Cf.</i> Fed. R. Civ. 11(b)(3).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Section 1985 has three subsections, each of which sets forth a distinct cause of action. However, Donahue makes no effort to specify the subsection under which his claim arises. We think the first two subsections are plainly inapplicable: &#167; 1985(1) protects federal officers from those conspiring to prevent (by force, intimidation, or threat) the officer from discharging his or her duties; and &#167; 1985(2) protects parties and witnesses in federal court from conspiracies to deter them from appearing or testifying. Section 1985(3) is broader in its reach and prohibits, in general terms, conspiracies to violate civil rights. We therefore assume, for the sake of argument, that Donahue intends to assert a claim under &#167;&#167; 1985(3) and 1986 (the latter extends liability to persons who knowingly fail to prevent conspiracies under the former)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
