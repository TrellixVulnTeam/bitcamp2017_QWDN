Professor Héctor Rivera-García (\"Rivera\")\n\nwas terminated on August 2, 1999 from his positions as Director of\n\nthe Department of Liberal Arts and faculty member at the Colegio\n\nUniversitario    del    Este   (\"University\"),        one    of   three     private\n\nuniversities comprising the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Méndez\n\n(SUAGM).     Rivera was terminated after a female secretary in his\n\nDepartment filed a sexual harassment complaint against him and a\n\nsubsequent    investigation      by    the     University's       administration\n\nconcluded that he had engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment\n\nthat included not only harassment of the complainant, but also\n\ninappropriate    comments      directed      toward   at     least    two   female\n\nprofessors.\n\n           Rivera, together with his wife and conjugal partnership,\n\nbrought suit against the University, SUAGM, and Alberto Maldonado,\n\nthe   University       Chancellor,     among     others,      challenging      his\n\ntermination from employment and alleging that he was a victim of\n\ndisability    discrimination,     in    violation      of,    inter    alia,   the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et\n\nseq., the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a), and Puerto Rico law.\n\nRivera, who suffered polio as a child, has difficulty walking. For\n\npurposes of this opinion, we assume arguendo that he is disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the ADA.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            The   district     court       entered       summary      judgment   for\n\ndefendants on the ADA claim and related federal claims,1 dismissed\n\nthe federal claims against the individual defendants in their\n\npersonal     capacities,      and,     declining         to   exercise      pendent\n\njurisdiction, dismissed the state claims without prejudice.2                     The\n\ndistrict court originally entered summary judgment on the ADA claim\n\non the reasoning that plaintiff had not made the threshold showing\n\nthat he was disabled or regarded as disabled -- that is, he had not\n\nshown he suffered from a \"substantial\" limitation on his ability to\n\nwalk.     See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as \"a\n\nphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more\n\nof the major life activities of [an] individual\"); see also Calef\n\nv. Gillette Co., 322 F.3d 75, 83-84 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which the\n\ncourt construed as a motion to alter judgment.                See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).      In    a     thoughtful   opinion       denying      the     motion   for\n\nreconsideration, the court supplemented its initial reasoning as to\n\nsummary judgment.        It added the ground that even assuming Rivera\n\nwas   disabled,       plaintiffs   still     had   not    proffered      sufficient\n\nevidence to show that the defendants' articulated reason for\n\n\n      1\n          The court noted that the claims under the Civil Rights\nActs of 1964 and 1991 were linked to a violation of the ADA, and\nthat dismissal on summary judgment of Rivera's ADA claim would\namount to a dismissal of his remaining federal claims.\n      2\n          Plaintiffs do not appeal the court's dismissal of the\ndefendants in their individual capacities or of the state claims.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fterminating    Rivera      --   that   he    had   violated   SUAGM's   sexual\n\nharassment policy -- was a pretext and that the true reason was\n\ndisability discrimination.\n\n            Plaintiffs appeal both from the court's summary judgment\n\norder and from the court's denial of their Rule 59(e) motion.               We\n\nreview the former determination de novo, see Colburn v. Parker\n\nHannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325, 329 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nand the latter for abuse of discretion, see Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-\n\nMart P.R., Inc., 434 F.3d 75, 89 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            In analyzing plaintiffs' ADA claim, we employ, as did the\n\nparties and the district court, a modified version of the framework\n\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\n\n(1973).    Within this framework, plaintiffs must ultimately present\n\nenough evidence to create a material issue of fact that defendants'\n\nnon-discriminatory justification for terminating Rivera -- that he\n\nhad committed sexual harassment -- is mere pretext and that the\n\nactual reason for the adverse employment action was disability\n\ndiscrimination.     See Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100,\n\n104-05 (1st Cir. 2005).         Plaintiffs make three arguments to this\n\neffect.\n\n            Their   main    argument    is    that   the   sexual   harassment\n\ninvestigation was a sham designed to get rid of Rivera for other\n\nreasons.    In support of this theory, plaintiffs allege: (1) that\n\nwhen Chancellor Maldonado first informed Rivera that a complaint\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhad been filed against him, the Chancellor suggested to Rivera that\n\nhe might want to resign; (2) that the University denied Rivera\n\nprocedural protections during the course of the sexual harassment\n\ninvestigation; and (3) that the University terminated Rivera even\n\nthough lesser sanctions were available.              The argument fails.\n\n            To begin, the Chancellor's statement is insufficient to\n\npermit an inference that the sexual harassment finding was a\n\npretext;   it     is    equally   reasonable    to   view   the   statement   as\n\npractical advice to Rivera following a credible claim of harassment\n\nby an employee.\n\n            The arguments Rivera makes of procedural irregularities\n\ntake license with -- and are contradicted by -- the record.                   We\n\nwill assume in Rivera's favor that a kangaroo proceeding, devoid of\n\nany fairness, to evaluate a trumped-up sexual harassment charge\n\ncould, in an appropriate case, be shown to have produced a reason\n\nfor termination of employment that was a pretext. The record shows\n\nthat this is not what happened here: Rivera was permitted to\n\nrespond to the charges. The complainant and two female professors,\n\nwho in the course of the investigation revealed that Rivera had\n\nalso made inappropriate comments to them, testified of their own\n\nknowledge about what Rivera had done.                 And Rivera's proffered\n\ncharacter witnesses, who had no personal knowledge of any of the\n\nallegedly harassing incidents, were understandably excluded. There\n\nis   no   basis    in    the   evidence   for    Rivera's    claim   that     the\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\finvestigation procedures were so fundamentally unfair as to cast\n\ndoubt on the legitimacy of the outcome. Furthermore, even if there\n\nhad been mistakes as to procedure, and we see none, there is\n\nabsolutely      no   evidence    that    any    errors        were    motivated   by\n\ndiscrimination against the disabled.\n\n              That other disciplinary measures for sexual harassment\n\nwere available does not make defendants' decision to terminate\n\nRivera a form of discrimination.               Plaintiffs admitted at oral\n\nargument that Rivera's employment could legally be terminated if he\n\nwas found to have engaged in sexual harassment; indeed, SUAGM's\n\nsexual harassment policy plainly provided that \"[a]ny person who\n\nengages in behavior constituting sexual harassment . . . will be\n\nsubject to severe penalties, including dismissal . . . from the\n\ninstitution.\"        Moreover,    Rivera      has    pointed     to    no   evidence\n\nindicating that defendants' choice of sanctions was motivated by\n\ndiscriminatory animus.\n\n              Plaintiffs' secondary argument in support of their theory\n\nthat the sexual harassment investigation was mere pretext for\n\ndisability discrimination is the allegation that the University\n\nfailed   to    satisfy   Rivera's   earlier         request    for    a   reasonable\n\naccommodation.       Rivera alleges that he had sent a letter to\n\nChancellor Maldonado, requesting that meetings not be held on the\n\nsecond floor of a building that had no elevator; Maldonado denies\n\never having received this letter. We agree with the district court\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthat Rivera did not provide sufficient evidence of his request or\n\nof   the   University's   purported   failure   to   respond   to   such   a\n\nrequest.3\n\n            Finally, plaintiffs attempt to undermine the conclusion\n\nthat Rivera's employment was terminated because he engaged in\n\nsexual harassment by pointing to the fact that Rivera was one of\n\nthree candidates considered in the fall of 1998 for the position of\n\nVice Chancellor of Academic Affairs at the University and did not\n\nget the position; the University hired another candidate, and when\n\nthat candidate resigned, the University appointed someone else who\n\nwas not among the original pool of three.\n\n            Even if Rivera did not get the Vice Chancellorship\n\nbecause of disability discrimination, a claim Rivera made only\n\nafter his employment was terminated almost a year later, that is\n\nnot sufficient to raise an issue of material fact that he was fired\n\nfor any reason other than the sexual harassment.           In any event,\n\nthere is no evidence that he was denied employment opportunities\n\n\n      3\n          With their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs\nattempted to submit the letter Rivera allegedly sent to Maldonado.\nThe court declined to consider the letter, because plaintiffs\nfailed to submit it before judgment was entered. To the extent\nthat plaintiffs challenge this ruling on appeal, we hold that there\nwas no abuse of discretion in the district court's rejection of the\nletter and of plaintiffs' motion to alter judgment on account of a\nbelated evidentiary proffer, especially where that evidence was\npreviously available and should have been submitted to the court\nfor timely consideration. See Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10,\n16 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[Rule 59(e)] . . . does not allow a party to\nintroduce new evidence or advance arguments that could and should\nhave been presented to the district court prior to the judgment.\").\n\n                                  -7-\n\fdue to disability discrimination.          When another candidate was\n\nselected as Vice Chancellor, the University did not turn Rivera\n\naway.    Instead,   knowing   of    his   difficulty   in   walking,   the\n\nUniversity hired him as a faculty member and as Director of the\n\nDepartment   of   Liberal   Arts,   presenting   him   with   a   one-year\n\ncontract, beginning August 15, 1998 and ending July 31, 1999.\n\nFurther, in a letter dated May 28, 1999, mere days before the\n\nsexual harassment allegation arose on June 1, 1999, the University\n\ninformed Rivera that it wished to extend his faculty appointment\n\nfor another two years, through August 2001.      Nothing in the record\n\nsupports an inference that the reason for termination of Rivera's\n\nemployment was anything other than his own conduct in sexually\n\nharassing women.4\n\n          Judgment for defendants is affirmed.         Costs are awarded\n\nto defendants.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          We construe plaintiffs' allegations that the University\ndiscriminated against Rivera by refusing to appoint him to the Vice\nChancellorship and by failing to provide him with reasonable\naccommodations as arguments in support of the wrongful discharge\nclaim, and not as independent grounds for relief under the ADA. To\nthe extent that plaintiffs are advancing independent disparate\nimpact and failure to accommodate claims, their arguments are\ndesultory at best and amount to waiver.      See United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that \"issues\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived,\" because \"a litigant\nhas an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and\ndistinctly\" (quoting Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635\n(1st Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks omitted))).\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

Instead, knowing of his difficulty in walking, the University hired him as a faculty member and as Director of the Department of Liberal Arts, presenting him with a one-year contract, beginning August 15, 1998 and ending July 31, 1999. Further, in a letter dated May 28, 1999, mere days before the sexual harassment allegation arose on June 1, 1999, the University informed Rivera that it wished to extend his faculty appointment for another two years, through August 2001. Nothing in the record supports an inference that the reason for termination of Rivera's employment was anything other than his own conduct in sexually harassing women.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment for defendants is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court noted that the claims under the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991 were linked to a violation of the ADA, and that dismissal on summary judgment of Rivera's ADA claim would amount to a dismissal of his remaining federal claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs do not appeal the court's dismissal of the defendants in their individual capacities or of the state claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> With their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs attempted to submit the letter Rivera allegedly sent to Maldonado.

M&#233;ndez (SUAGM). Rivera was terminated after a female secretary in his Department filed a sexual harassment complaint against him and a subsequent investigation by the University's administration concluded that he had engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment that included not only harassment of the complainant, but also inappropriate comments directed toward at least two female professors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera, together with his wife and conjugal partnership, brought suit against the University, SUAGM, and Alberto Maldonado, the University Chancellor, among others, challenging his termination from employment and alleging that he was a victim of disability discrimination, in violation of, inter alia, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 <i>et seq.,</i> the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981(a), and Puerto Rico law. Rivera, who suffered polio as a child, has difficulty walking. For purposes of this opinion, we assume arguendo that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered summary judgment for defendants on the ADA claim and related federal claims,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> dismissed the federal claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacities, and, declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction, dismissed the state claims without prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court originally entered summary judgment on the ADA claim on the reasoning that plaintiff had not made the threshold showing that he was disabled or regarded as disabled &#8212; that is, he had not shown he suffered from a \"substantial\" limitation on his ability to walk. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual\"); <i>see also Calef v.

In a thoughtful opinion denying the motion for reconsideration, the court supplemented its initial reasoning as to summary judgment. It added the ground that even assuming Rivera was disabled, plaintiffs still had not proffered sufficient evidence to show that the defendants' articulated reason for terminating Rivera &#8212; that he had violated SUAGM's sexual harassment policy &#8212; was a pretext and that the true reason was disability discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appeal both from the court's summary judgment order and from the court's denial of their Rule 59(e) motion.

Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973). Within this framework, plaintiffs must ultimately present enough evidence to create a material issue of fact that defendants' non-discriminatory justification for terminating Rivera &#8212; that he had committed sexual harassment &#8212; is mere pretext and that the actual reason for the adverse employment action was disability discrimination. <i>See Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792800\"><a href=\"/opinion/792800/kevin-w-tobin-v-liberty-mutual-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 104-05 (1st Cir.2005). Plaintiffs make three arguments to this effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their main argument is that the sexual harassment investigation was a sham designed to get rid of Rivera for other reasons. In support of this theory, plaintiffs allege: (1) that when Chancellor Maldonado first informed Rivera that a complaint had been filed against him, the Chancellor suggested to Rivera that he might want to resign; (2) that the University denied Rivera procedural protections during the course of the sexual harassment investigation; and (3) that the University terminated Rivera even though lesser sanctions were available. The argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, the Chancellor's statement is insufficient to permit an inference that the sexual harassment finding was a pretext; it is equally reasonable to view the statement as practical advice to Rivera following a credible claim of harassment by an employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arguments Rivera makes of procedural irregularities take license with &#8212; and are contradicted by &#8212; the record. We will assume in Rivera's favor that a kangaroo proceeding, devoid of any fairness, to evaluate a trumped-up sexual harassment charge could, in an appropriate case, be shown to have produced a reason for termination of employment that was a pretext. The record shows that this is not what happened here: Rivera was permitted to respond to the charges. The complainant and two female professors, who in the course of the investigation revealed that Rivera had also made inappropriate comments to them, testified of their own knowledge about what Rivera had done. And Rivera's proffered character witnesses, who had no personal knowledge of any of the allegedly harassing incidents, were understandably excluded. There is no basis in the evidence for Rivera's claim that the investigation procedures were so fundamentally unfair as to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the outcome. Furthermore, even if there had been mistakes as to procedure, and we see none, there is absolutely no evidence that any errors were motivated by discrimination against the disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That other disciplinary measures for sexual harassment were available does not make defendants' decision to terminate Rivera a form of discrimination. Plaintiffs admitted at oral argument that Rivera's employment could legally be terminated if he was found to have engaged in sexual harassment; indeed, SUAGM's sexual harassment policy plainly provided that \"[a]ny person who engages in behavior constituting sexual harassment ... will be subject to severe penalties, including dismissal... from the institution.\" Moreover, Rivera has pointed to no evidence indicating that defendants' choice of sanctions was motivated by discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' secondary argument in support of their theory that the sexual harassment investigation was mere pretext for disability discrimination is the allegation that the University failed to satisfy Rivera's earlier request for a reasonable accommodation. Rivera alleges that he had sent a letter to Chancellor Maldonado, requesting that meetings not be held on the second floor of a building that had no elevator; Maldonado denies ever having received this letter. We agree with the district court that Rivera did not provide sufficient evidence of his request or of the University's purported failure to respond to such a request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs attempt to undermine the conclusion that Rivera's employment was terminated because he engaged in sexual harassment by pointing to the fact that Rivera was one of three candidates considered in the fall of 1998 for the position of Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs at the University and did not get the position; the University hired another candidate, and when that candidate resigned, the University appointed someone else who was not among the original pool of three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Rivera did not get the Vice Chancellorship because of disability discrimination, a claim Rivera made only after his employment was terminated almost a year later, that is not sufficient to raise an issue of material fact that he was fired for any reason other than the sexual harassment. In any event, there is no evidence that he was denied employment opportunities due to disability discrimination. When another candidate was selected as Vice Chancellor, the University did not turn Rivera away. Instead, knowing of his difficulty in walking, the University hired him as a faculty member and as Director of the Department of Liberal Arts, presenting him with a one-year contract, beginning August 15, 1998 and ending July 31, 1999. Further, in a letter dated May 28, 1999, mere days before the sexual harassment allegation arose on June 1, 1999, the University informed Rivera that it wished to extend his faculty appointment for another two years, through August 2001. Nothing in the record supports an inference that the reason for termination of Rivera's employment was anything other than his own conduct in sexually harassing women.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment for defendants is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court noted that the claims under the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991 were linked to a violation of the ADA, and that dismissal on summary judgment of Rivera's ADA claim would amount to a dismissal of his remaining federal claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs do not appeal the court's dismissal of the defendants in their individual capacities or of the state claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> With their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs attempted to submit the letter Rivera allegedly sent to Maldonado.
