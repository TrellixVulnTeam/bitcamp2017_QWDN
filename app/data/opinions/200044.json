Cammarano and Cammarano & Associates on Response to\nShow Cause Order for appellant.\n\n\n\n                          July 23, 2002\n\f              Per Curiam.          Mr. Aquino-Encarnacion is a native and\n\ncitizen of the Dominican Republic.                 Prior to initiation of\n\ndeportation proceedings, his immigration status was that of a\n\nlawful permanent resident.            In 1998, Aquino was convicted in\n\nthe   trial    court   of    the    Commonwealth      of   Massachusetts      of\n\nreceiving stolen property worth over $250 and of receiving a\n\nstolen motor vehicle, in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266\n\n§§ 60 and 28 (2001). The Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\ncharged that Aquino is subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(2)(A)(i), as an alien convicted of a crime of moral\nturpitude,      committed     within     five     years    of   the    date   of\n\nadmission, for which a sentence of one year or longer may be\nimposed.        The    Immigration       Judge     entered      an    order   of\ndeportation,     which      was    upheld    on   appeal   by   the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals. Aquino is scheduled to be deported in the\nnear future.\n               Aquino has petitioned for review of that decision\n\nand has requested a stay of deportation pending review. He\nchallenges the decision of the BIA on the ground that the Board\nmisinterpreted 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) in determining that\n\nhe is deportable. That provision states:\n              Any alien who -\n              (I) is convicted of a crime involving\n              moral turpitude committed within five\n              years ... after the date of admission [to\n              this country], and\n              (II) is convicted of a crime for which a\n              sentence of one year of longer may be\n              imposed,\n              is deportable.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fAquino concedes that he was initially sentenced to probation\n\nfor one year for each offense, the terms to run concurrently.\n\nHowever, in July, 2000, his sentence was reduced to 11 months'\nprobation for each offense, to run concurrently, deemed served.\n\nHe argues that as a result of this reduction, the deportation\n\nprovision does not encompass his case because subclause (II)\nrefers to the sentence that has actually been imposed upon\n\nconviction of a crime of moral turpitude.           However, this\n\ninterpretation must be rejected.\n\n        The language at issue was inserted into the immigration\n\nstatutes by § 435(a) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act of 1996.    Prior to this amendment, subclause II\n\nread:\n            either is sentenced to confinement or is\n            confined   therefor  in   a   prison  or\n            correctional institution for one year or\n            longer.\nIf Congress intended deportability resting on the commission of\n\na crime of moral turpitude to turn on the sentence imposed or\n\nserved, rather than the sentence to which commission of the\noffense exposed a violator, there would have been no reason to\n\nreplace the earlier language with the new subclause II:\n\n            is convicted of a crime for which a\n            sentence of one year or longer may be\n            imposed....\n\nAccord, United States     v.   Qadeer,   953   F.Supp.   1570,   1580\n(S.D.Ga. 1997).\n\n            The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
