William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Ryan M. Schiff, with whom John Salsberg and Salsberg   &\nSchneider, were on brief, for appellant Carrasquillo.\n\f     Mark W. Shea, with whom Shea and LaRocque, was on      brief for\nappellant Garrasteguy.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney    with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney and John A.     Wortmann,\nJr., Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for   appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          March 6, 2009\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.    In early 2006, federal and local\n\nauthorities    commenced     Operation    Brickhouse    to    combat    drug\n\ntrafficking in the Bromley-Heath Housing Project (Bromley-Heath)\n\nlocated in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.       The investigation snared\n\nthe appellants Amos Carrasquillo and Nathan Garrasteguy through a\n\nseries of controlled drug purchases executed by a cooperating\n\nwitness.      Faced   with   unshakable    evidence    of    their   illicit\n\nactivities, the appellants pleaded guilty to several counts of\n\ndistributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and to\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.   The issue of the drug weights involved in the offenses,\n\nhowever, was reserved and tried to a jury.1\n\n           After a six-day trial, at which the appellants presented\n\nno evidence, the jury determined that the conspiracy involved\n\nbetween five and twenty grams of cocaine base.         At sentencing, the\n\njudge accepted the government's sentencing recommendation, declined\n\nto give Carrasquillo any credit for acceptance of responsibility,\n\nand sentenced him to 132 months of imprisonment followed by eight\n\nyears of supervised release.      Garrasteguy received a sentence of\n\n\n\n\n1\n The default statutory maximum in crack cocaine cases where the\njury does not find a quantity of drugs, or in which the drug\nquantity is undetectable, is twenty years.           21 U.S.C. §\n841(b)(1)(C). But if a defendant is convicted of possessing at\nleast five grams of cocaine base, the statutory maximum sentence is\nenhanced to forty years. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).\n\n                                   -3-\n\ften years followed by twelve years of supervised release.2                 As a\n\nspecial condition of supervised release, the sentencing court\n\nprohibited    the    appellants       from    entering      Suffolk   County,\n\nMassachusetts during the term of his supervised release, without\n\nprejudice to their right to return to the sentencing court to seek\n\nrevision or rescission of this special condition.            See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(e)(2).\n\n          Carrasquillo appeals the denial of his acceptance of\n\nresponsibility credit, and both appellants challenge the special\n\ncondition of supervised release.         We affirm.\n\n                    I.    Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n          We begin with Carrasquillo's acceptance of responsibility\n\nargument, which, stripped to its essentials, is a request that he\n\nbe permitted to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.                 In\n\nconcrete terms, Carrasquillo believes that he is entitled to a two\n\npoint   reduction        in   his   offense   level   for     acceptance     of\n\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) -- despite having\n\ngone to trial regarding drug weight -- because he pleaded guilty to\n\nthe rest of the indictment.         This claim fails.\n\n          During the Rule 11 plea colloquy, the district court\n\n\n\n2\n Garrasteguy   was  also   denied   credit   for   acceptance   of\nresponsibility, but he does not appeal that issue, because such\ncredit cannot reduce his mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months.\nGarrasteguy qualifies for a mandatory minimum sentence due to a\nprevious felony conviction for illegal sales of controlled\nsubstances. See 21 U.S.C. § 851.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fadvised both defendants of the possibility that if a jury concluded\n\nthat they were responsible for drug weights sufficient to trigger\n\nenhanced penalties, it might not grant either of them any reduction\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility.       The court stated:\n\n          THE COURT: Now, again, I don't mean this in\n          any way as a threat, you must understand that\n          if we go to trial . . . and [if] you lose,\n          it's more than five grams, and the government\n          is put to the expense and time of the trial,\n          there are situations, your lawyers will argue\n          them to me, where I should still give some\n          discount. And I have no hard and fast rule.\n          But you understand that I'll be keeping in\n          mind that we've spent all the time and expense\n          on a trial and you've been found guilty of\n          more than five grams. And I will take that\n          into account.    I think under the law I'm\n          required to.\n\nBoth defendants indicated that they understood the court's warning.\n\nDespite the court's statement, the defendants proceeded to try to\n\na jury the issue of drug weight.     During the course of this trial,\n\nthe defendants did nothing more than cross-examine witnesses; the\n\ndefense rested at the close of the government's case.            Within two\n\nhours of receiving the case, the jury returned a verdict finding\n\nthe defendants responsible for at least five grams of cocaine base.\n\n          After   trial,   the   probation   department,    in    its   pre-\n\nsentence report (PSR), included a recommendation that Carrasquillo\n\nbe given a two-level reduction in the offense level pursuant to\n\nsection   3E1.1(a)   of    the    Sentencing    Guidelines,        bringing\n\nCarrasquillo's total offense level to 27. The government objected,\n\narguing that Carrasquillo's demand for a jury trial on drug weight\n\n                                  -5-\n\fnot only demonstrated a failure to accept responsibility for the\n\nfull extent of his conduct, but also falsely denied the extent and\n\nnature of the relevant conduct.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, Carrasquillo reiterated his\n\ndesire   for    the   acceptance   of    responsibility   reduction.3    The\n\nsentencing court considered Carrasquillo's argument, but decided\n\nnot to credit Carrasquillo with any reduction of the total offense\n\nlevel based on acceptance of responsibility.         The court rested its\n\ndecision primarily on the fact that Carrasquillo did not spare the\n\ngovernment from the time and expense of a trial.           In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the district court remarked that the acceptance of\n\nresponsibility provision is an \"empty sophistry,\" that should be\n\nviewed as a discretionary reduction in the total offense level to\n\nreward defendants who spare the government the expense of a trial.\n\n(\"What   [the    acceptance   of   responsibility    reduction]   is    is   a\n\ndiscount that is usually granted, it's in my discretion for sparing\n\nthe government expense.\")          Carrasquillo's argument on appeal is\n\nthat the sentencing court's comments constitute a misinterpretation\n\n\n\n3\n At sentencing, counsel for Carrasquillo repeated the arguments in\nfavor of the acceptance of responsibility credit contained in the\nPSR, which he first made in his sentencing memorandum, and\nemphasized Carrasquillo's position that he was entitled to the\nacceptance of responsibility credit. (\"Even if your Honor's not\ngiving him the acceptance of responsibility, he admitted to\nthat.\").   Thus, Carrasquillo's claim is preserved.     See United\nStates v. Gonczy, 357 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)(where defendant\nobjects and district court was aware of objection and underlying\nreasons, sentencing objection preserved for appellate review).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fof   the   Sentencing    Guidelines,      and   thus     the    sentencing    court\n\nmisapplied the Guidelines.\n\n             We review a sentencing court's determination of whether\n\na defendant accepted responsibility for clear error. United States\n\nv. Glaum, 356 F.3d 169, 180 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v.\n\nDeppe, 509 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Recognizing the special\n\ndifficulty of discerning, on a cold record, whether a defendant's\n\nexpressions of remorse were in earnest, we review a sentencing\n\ncourt's judgment about acceptance of responsibility for clear\n\nerror.\")(citing United States v. Dethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1990);     U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.5)).            Nevertheless, we continue\n\nto   conduct   a    plenary   review    of    any    related    legal    questions,\n\nincluding the interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.                   Deppe,\n\n509 F.3d at 60 (citing United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255,\n\n1263 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n             The   Sentencing   Guidelines          recognize    the    \"legitimate\n\nsocietal interests\" in acceptance of responsibility and therefore\n\nallow sentencing judges to provide a measure of leniency to those\n\ndefendants who accept responsibility for their actions.                   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3E1.1 cmt. backg'd. The Guidelines therefore dispense credit for\n\nacceptance of responsibility in two flavors: a two-point reduction\n\nat the discretion of the sentencing court if the defendant \"clearly\n\ndemonstrates       acceptance   of     responsibility      for    his    offense.\"\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a).      And, if, in a serious offense, a defendant\n\naccepts responsibility at an early stage of the investigation, a\n\ndefendant may be eligible for an additional one point reduction in\n\nthe offense level.   U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b).     This second reduction is\n\navailable only to defendants who accept responsibility early enough\n\nto save the government the time and expense of preparing for trial,\n\nand consequently, this further reduction is only available \"upon\n\nmotion of the government.\"     Id.\n\n          Defendants are not, however, automatically entitled to\n\neven the two-point acceptance of responsibility reduction.           United\n\nStates v. Franky-Ortiz, 230 F.3d 405, 408 (1st Cir. 2000).             The\n\nonus of proving acceptance of responsibility is on the defendant.\n\nId.   (defendant   must    \"demonstrate    that   he   has   taken    full\n\nresponsibility for his actions and he must do so candidly and with\n\ngenuine contrition\")(quoting United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 2000)).       To prove acceptance of responsibility, a\n\ndefendant must truthfully admit or not falsely deny the conduct\n\ncomprising the conviction, as well as any additional relevant\n\nconduct for which he is accountable.          Glaum, 356 F.3d at 180\n\n(citing U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n. 1(a))).4\n\n\n4\n It should be noted, however that a defendant is not required to\nvolunteer or affirmatively admit relevant conduct beyond the\noffense of conviction to obtain an acceptance of responsibility\nreduction.    U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.1(a)).       Similarly, a\ndefendant \"may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond\nthe offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain\na reduction\" for acceptance of responsibility. Id.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           We have further held that defendants who proceed to trial\n\nand put the government to its proof normally do not qualify for any\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility. Deppe, 509 F.3d at 60;\n\nsee also U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.2).           Proceeding to trial,\n\nhowever, does not constitute a per se bar to credit for acceptance\n\nof   responsibility.    Instead,    proceeding   to   trial   creates   a\n\nrebuttable presumption that no credit is available.           Deppe, 509\n\nF.3d at 60.\n\n           Carrasquillo's argument is that his guilty plea -- rather\n\nthan the trial -- resulted in his conviction and that his testing\n\nof the government's proof regarding drug weight should not alter\n\nthe fact that in his guilty plea, he accepted responsibility for\n\nhis actions.   Accordingly, he argues that the sentencing court's\n\ndescription of the acceptance of responsibility credit as \"an empty\n\nsophistry\" and the court's further characterization of the credit\n\nas an expense calculation demonstrates that the sentencing court\n\nmisapplied the guidelines.\n\n           The government responds that Carrasquillo's challenge to\n\nthe drug weight required it to introduce evidence regarding all of\n\nthe elements of the crimes to which Carrasquillo pleaded guilty.\n\nMoreover, the government claims that the defendant's rigorous\n\nchallenge to the drug weight does not evince the candid acceptance\n\nof responsibility with \"genuine contrition\" that is a prerequisite\n\nto receiving a reduction.    See Franky-Ortiz, 230 F.3d at 408.\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f             In the circumstances of this case, we agree with the\n\ngovernment and with the sentencing court's implicit finding that\n\nCarrasquillo failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility.\n\nHe went to trial, and yet, he has adduced no evidence to rebut the\n\npresumption that his trial with respect to drug weight rendered him\n\nineligible for any acceptance of responsibility-based reduction,\n\nnor has he so much as argued against the presumption. Furthermore,\n\nhis actions in requesting a trial regarding drug weight were not\n\nconsistent with acceptance of responsibility for relevant conduct.\n\nSee Glaum, 356 F.3d at 180 (sentencing court did not clearly err\n\nwhere it denied acceptance of responsibility reduction to defendant\n\nwho offered to plead guilty to conspiracy involving lesser quantum\n\nof drugs).    See also, e.g., United States v. Acosta, 534 F.3d 574,\n\n580 (7th Cir. 2008) (affirming district court denial of acceptance\n\nof responsibility reduction where defendant who pleaded guilty\n\nchallenged certain factual assertions in PSR); United States v.\n\nAnnis, 446 F.3d 852, 857-58 (8th Cir. 2006) (affirming district\n\ncourt   denial   of   acceptance   of   responsibility   reduction   where\n\ndefendant pleaded guilty to offense but refused to admit to any\n\ndrug quantity and challenged reliability of prior statement to\n\nauthorities).\n\n             In a final attempt to gain traction, Carrasquillo argues\n\nthat the sentencing court's characterizations of the acceptance of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fresponsibility reduction suggest that the court did not properly\n\napply this provision of the Guidelines.\n\n          The acceptance of responsibility reduction acknowledges\n\nlegitimate societal interests.         U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt., backg'd.\n\nThe provision also recognizes the longstanding judicial practice of\n\nmore leniently sentencing defendants who evidence contrition and\n\ncooperate with law enforcement.       See United States v. Frazier, 971\n\nF.2d 1076, 1084 (4th Cir. 1992).        As has been said, acceptance of\n\nresponsibility provisions recognize and support varied societal\n\ninterests including the reduction of crime, restitution, early\n\nwithdrawal from criminal activity, the increased potential for\n\nrehabilitation among those who feel and show true remorse for their\n\nanti-social   act,   as   well   as    encouraging   judicial    and   law\n\nenforcement economy.      Id. at 1084-85 (citing United States v.\n\nBelgard, 694 F. Supp. 1488,           1497 (D. Or. 1988)).      Thus, the\n\nacceptance of responsibility determination does not necessarily\n\nreduce to merely an expense calculation, but rather can serve\n\nseveral important societal interests.\n\n          As we have noted, the sentencing court did consider the\n\nfact that Carrasquillo pleaded guilty, but also balanced that plea\n\nagainst Carrasquillo's pressing of the drug weight issue at trial,\n\nin which he challenged the evidence against him.         Based on this\n\nbalancing, the court concluded that Carrasquillo was not entitled\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fto any credit for acceptance of responsibility.5             Regardless of\n\nwhether the sentencing court acknowledged the all of the varied\n\ninterests recognized by the acceptance of responsibility credit,\n\nthe court nevertheless properly denied the credit to Carrasquillo.\n\n                II.    Exclusion From Suffolk County\n\n          We now turn to the issue whether the sentencing court\n\ncould impose a condition of supervised release that prohibited the\n\ndefendants from entering an entire county during the full term of\n\nsupervised release.     The breadth and duration of this condition\n\ngive us pause, but on this record we are unable to conclude that\n\nthe district court plainly erred in imposing the special condition.\n\n          We review a sentencing court's decision to impose special\n\nconditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion.              United\n\nStates v. Riccio, 529 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir. 2008).          If, however, a\n\ndefendant has an opportunity to object to a special condition at\n\nsentencing,   and   stays   silent,   we   review   the   imposition    of   a\n\nsupervised release condition for plain error only.           United States\n\n\n5\n The district court had previously noted that it had \"no hard and\nfast rule\" regarding an acceptance of responsibility reduction if\nthe defendants contested the drug weight at trial, but cautioned\nthe defendants that it would \"be keeping in mind that we've spent\nall the time and expense on a trial and you've been found guilty of\nmore than five grams. And I will take that into account. I think\nunder the law, I'm required to.\" Thus, while it is true that the\ndistrict court, in its characterization of the Sentencing\nGuidelines overlooked differences between the two sections on\nacceptance of responsibility, one for actual acceptance and the\nother for early acceptance, nonetheless the basis for denying a\ndownward departure was sound, and the district court certainly did\nnot commit clear error in making such a denial.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fv. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 219 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc); United\n\nStates v. Perazza-Mercado, 553 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2009); Riccio,\n\n529 F.3d at 48.\n\n          Carrasquillo     claims      that   he   properly   preserved   his\n\nobjection to the special condition of supervised release.6                The\n\ngovernment originally requested, in its sentencing memorandum, a\n\nspecial condition of supervised release ordering both defendants to\n\nstay outside the City of Boston.7            In his sentencing memorandum,\n\nCarrasquillo    objected   to   the    government's    proposed   condition\n\nprimarily on constitutional grounds, claiming that the condition\n\nwould impermissibly impinge on (unspecified) rights protected under\n\nthe First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution,\n\nand that the condition would preclude Carrasquillo from being fully\n\ninvolved in raising his young son.\n\n          At sentencing, however, the district court appeared far\n\nmore interested in the special condition of supervised release than\n\nCarrasquillo.   The district court sua sponte noted that it was not\n\n\n\n6\n Appellant Garrasteguy claims that he preserved by relying on co-\ndefendant Carrasquillo's objection, weak as it may have been.\nGiven our disposition on the merits, we needn't tarry over\nGarrasteguy's dubious contention that his claim has not been\nforfeited.\n7\n When it imposed the condition the district court sua sponte              and\nwithout comment expanded the scope of the condition to include            all\nof Suffolk County, which includes not only the City of Boston,            but\nalso the communities of Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop. Neither            the\ngovernment nor the defendants objected to this enlargement of             the\nscope of the condition.\n\n                                      -13-\n\ffamiliar with such conditions, and engaged in a dialogue regarding\n\nthe   condition   with   not   only   the    prosecutor,   but   also   a\n\nrepresentative of the probation department to satisfy itself that\n\nthe condition was reasonable and enforceable.\n\n          By contrast, at sentencing, Carrasquillo mentioned the\n\nspecial condition only in passing, and when he did discuss it he\n\nnoted that the condition was unimportant:\n\n          The other thing I would just comment on very\n          briefly is this issue of whether or not to be\n          in Boston or not be in Boston. Winning that\n          from our standpoint and not getting what we're\n          looking for in terms of the length of\n          incarceration would be a Pyrrhic victory.\n          It's unimportant compared to the amount of\n          time --\n\n\n          Carrasquillo's counsel specifically termed the condition\n\n\"unimportant\" and remained focused on seeking a reduction in his\n\nsentence. This amounted to at least a forfeiture of the objection,\n\nif not an outright abandonment of it.       See United States v. Walker,\n\n538 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2008) (describing difference between\n\nwaiver and forfeiture).   Carrasquillo made a strategic decision in\n\nmaking his presentation to the sentencing judge: he focused his\n\nefforts on obtaining a lower sentence. In so doing, he essentially\n\nleft his objections regarding this condition of supervised release\n\nby the wayside.\n\n          Moreover, even though the defendants now argue that the\n\nspecial condition's geographic scope (all of Suffolk County) was\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fimpermissibly broad, neither of them advanced a narrower area of\n\nexclusion to the sentencing court.          Similarly, the defendants were\n\nentirely   silent   regarding    the   particulars     of   this    condition,\n\nincluding the availability of exceptions, as well as the scope and\n\nbreadth of the condition.       Consequently, the sentencing court did\n\nnot have the opportunity to evaluate alternatives that might make\n\nthe exclusion more acceptable.         It would be both unfair and an\n\ninappropriate deployment of limited judicial resources to permit\n\nthe defendants to raise such specific concerns on appeal.                  Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding\n\nthat defendant cannot challenge a district court’s ruling at\n\nsentencing with an argument not raised below in the papers or at\n\nsentencing). Consequently, we review the condition for plain error\n\nonly.\n\n           District courts have significant flexibility to impose\n\nspecial conditions of supervised release.             A district court may\n\nimpose as a condition of supervised release most discretionary\n\nconditions   identified   in    18   U.S.C.    §   3563(b),8   or   any   other\n\ncondition the court deems appropriate.               All such conditions,\n\nhowever, must be \"reasonably related\" to the factors set forth in\n\n§ 3553(a),9 may involve \"no greater deprivation of liberty than\n\n\n8\n Specifically, the court can impose any condition set forth in 18\nU.S.C. §§ 3563(b)(1) through (b)(10) and (b)(12) through (b)(20).\n9\n The factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18\n\n                                     -15-\n\freasonably necessary\" to achieve the purposes of §§ 3553(a)(2)(c),\n\n(a)(2)(D),     (viz.   to   protect       the    public   and     promote    the\n\nrehabilitation of the defendant), and must be consistent with any\n\npertinent     policy   statement     of   the    United   States    Sentencing\n\nCommission.    18 U.S.C. § 3583(d); see also United States v. York,\n\n357 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Any conditions of supervised release that a sentencing\n\ncourt chooses to impose must, of course, be supported by the\n\nrecord. United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc). But this requirement can be satisfied without a written\n\nor oral explanation of the reasons supporting the condition if we\n\ncan infer the court’s reasoning by comparing what was argued by the\n\nparties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the court\n\ndid.   United States v. Jiminez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc).\n\n            The government advanced several reasons for excluding the\n\ndefendants from the City of Boston.           The government noted that the\n\nBromley-Heath    project    is   a   refuge     of   affordable    housing   for\n\nfamilies of modest means, and that it has been beset with an\n\nexceedingly high level of gun and drug crimes.                  The government\n\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(1); (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence to\ncriminal conduct, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B); (3) the need to\nprotect the public from future crimes of the defendant, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(a)(2)(c); and (4) the need to provide the defendant with\nneeded educational or vocational training, medical care or other\ncorrectional treatment in the most effective manner, 18 U.S.C. §\n3553(a)(2)(D).\n\n                                     -16-\n\fargues that the sentencing court, pursuant to sections 3553(a)(1)\n\nand (a)(2)(C), properly took into account the effects of the\n\ndefendants' offenses on the Bromley-Heath community.                   Furthermore,\n\nthe   government       noted    that    both     defendants      had     repeatedly\n\ndisregarded Boston Housing Authority's (BHA) \"no-trespass\" orders\n\ndenying them permission to enter Bromley-Heath.                      Finally, the\n\ngovernment noted Carrasquillo ignored a prior state court probation\n\ncondition ordering him to stay out of all BHA properties.                    In the\n\nface of these orders, the defendants sold crack cocaine several\n\ntimes at or near Bromley-Heath.               The government therefore argued\n\nthat the defendants had to be excluded from a larger geographic\n\narea. The sentencing court, without objection from the defendants,\n\nappears    to   have    concluded      that    Suffolk    County    represents    a\n\nsufficient geographic exclusion and is administratively feasible to\n\nenforce, without elaborating on the deprivation of liberty this\n\nexclusion entails.\n\n            Although     we    have    never    before    passed    on   a   special\n\ncondition of supervised release that bars an individual from\n\nentering   an   entire    county,      two     circuits   have     upheld    similar\n\nconditions.10      In United States v. Sicher, the Third Circuit\n\n\n\n10\n The Sixth Circuit has also upheld a related special condition\nrequiring a defendant, who had a history of 38 prior criminal\nconvictions and who repeatedly violated the conditions of his then\npending period of federal supervised release, live in a city away\nfrom his home for a period of one year.         United States v.\nAlexander, 509 F.3d 253 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                        -17-\n\fapproved, on plain error review, a special condition of supervised\n\nrelease prohibiting the defendant from entering the Allentown, Pa.,\n\nmetro area, which consists of two counties, for a period of ten\n\nyears.11 239 F.3d 289 (3d Cir. 2000). In reaching this conclusion,\n\nthe Sicher court relied on two salient considerations.                    First, it\n\nnoted that the sentencing court had relied on ample record evidence\n\ndemonstrating that the defendant's criminal history was uniquely\n\ntied   to   the    mal-influence         of   her    family     and   associates   in\n\nAllentown.        Id.    at     290.     Second,     the   special     condition   of\n\nsupervised release did not operate as a total banishment because\n\nSicher was free to request permission from her probation officer to\n\nvisit the counties covered in the supervised release condition.\n\nId. at 292.\n\n            Similarly, in United States v. Cothran, the Eleventh\n\nCircuit,    on    an    abuse    of    discretion     review,    upheld   a   special\n\ncondition of probation that prohibited a defendant from entering\n\nFulton County, Georgia during the first two years of probation.\n\n855 F.2d 749, 751 (11th Cir. 1988).                 In reaching this conclusion,\n\nthe Cothran court found several factors persuasive. First, Cothran\n\ncould have been sentenced to up to 30 years but received a sixty-\n\nsix month sentence, all but six months of which were suspended.\n\n\n11\n This condition of supervised release was imposed as part of the\ndistrict court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for a\nsentence modification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, which reduced\nthe defendant's six-year sentence to time served (approximately 10\nmonths). Sircher, 239 F.3d at 290.\n\n                                          -18-\n\fId. at 750.     In addition, the Cothran court        relied on the district\n\ncourt's finding that Cothran, a charismatic twenty-six year-old,\n\nwas popular with adolescents in his native Fulton County and had\n\nbeen convicted of willfully distributing cocaine to a minor.                   Id.\n\nFinally, the probation condition at issue in Cothran permitted\n\nCothran to enter Fulton County with the permission of his probation\n\nofficer, and contemplated the possibility that Cothran could reach\n\nan arrangement with his probation officer to permit repeated entry\n\ninto certain portions of the county for educational or employment\n\npurposes.     Id. at 752.        On those facts, the Cothran court found\n\nthat the district court's probation condition was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            The     cases       permitting    exclusion     from    a     defined\n\ngeographical area do not entirely ease our doubts about the breadth\n\nand duration of the supervised release condition imposed here.\n\nMost   courts     have    not   authorized    a   blanket   exclusion     from   a\n\nparticular area lasting as long as the exclusions in the present\n\ncase (eight and twelve years).               Moreover, such conditions have\n\ntended to be imposed after a substantial reduction of a defendant's\n\nsentence, which also did not occur here.\n\n            We are even more uneasy over the fact that the condition\n\nin this case is not subject to any qualification.                       Exclusion\n\nconditions approved elsewhere have permitted defendants to seek\n\nauthorization      from     probation    officers     for   entry       into   the\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fgeographical areas from which the defendants are excluded.                    Here,\n\nhowever, the sentencing court imposed an unqualified banishment\n\nfrom Suffolk County for a period of as long as twelve years with\n\nonly the possibility of seeking a modification of the condition\n\nfrom the court itself at some later date, pursuant to section\n\n3583(e).12    Given its importance as a government center where a\n\ncitizen   may    be   required     to   conduct       business    with    government\n\nofficials, the defendants could well have significant reasons for\n\nentering Suffolk County.          Moreover, at this early juncture, it is\n\nimpossible      to    ascertain     the    level       of   either       defendant's\n\nrehabilitation,       which   might     impact    a    decision    to    permit   the\n\ndefendants to enter Suffolk County.\n\n             Additionally, the evidence justifying the imposition of\n\nthe present condition is not as stark as in other cases upholding\n\nexclusions.     It is true that Garrasteguy and Carrasquillo had at\n\nthe time of their convictions previously violated BHA-imposed \"no\n\n\n12\n The showing required for a defendant to obtain a modification of\na condition of supervised release pursuant to section 3583(e)is an\nopen question in this circuit. Compare United States v. Smith, 445\nF.3d 713, 716-17 (3d Cir. 2006) (reviewing district court's\nmodification of supervised release for abuse of discretion and\nleaving open question of whether \"significantly changed or\nextraordinary\" circumstances are prerequisite to modification) with\nUnited States v. Lussier, 104 F.3d 32, 36 (2d Cir. 1997)(\"Section\n3583 provides the district court with retained authority to . . .\nmodify terms and conditions [of supervised release] . . . in order\nto account for new or unforseen circumstances.\").\n     In light of the potential consequences that could flow from a\ncomplete inability to enter Suffolk County, a somewhat relaxed\nshowing might suffice to obtain a modification of the supervised\nrelease condition here.\n\n                                        -20-\n\ftrespass\"   orders   at     Bromley-Heath,       and   that   Carrasquillo       was\n\nsubject to a wider order prohibiting him from entering any public\n\nhousing project in Boston.           But this case does not include the\n\nfulsome record present Sicher, nor do the appellants' records\n\nevince the same level of criminality that the Sixth Circuit found\n\nsufficient to support a prohibition from entering the defendant's\n\nreservation in Alexander.         Thus, exclusion from all of Suffolk\n\nCounty could be a large leap, if the sentencing court had evidence\n\nregarding   the   suitability    of     a    more    circumscribed     geographic\n\nboundary.\n\n            But the defendants did not offer any of these arguments\n\nbelow,   nor   did   they    suggest       any   alternative,       more   limited,\n\nexclusion boundary to aid the district court in the exercise of its\n\ndiscretion.       Therefore,    as    we    have    noted,    the    condition    of\n\nsupervised release is subject only to plain error review, and the\n\ncondition meets this minimal hurdle.               In order to show a district\n\ncourt committed plain error, a defendant must demonstrate (1) the\n\nexistence of an error; (2) that it is plain; (3) that such plain\n\nerror affected substantial rights; and (4) that left uncorrected,\n\nsuch error seriously affects the fairness integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings. United States v. Carrasco, 540\n\nF.3d 43, 42 (1st Cir. 2008); see also United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f           Although it is axiomatic that the constitutional rights\n\nof supervised releasees and probationers are limited, United States\n\nv. Knights, 534 U.S. 112, 119 (2001), such individuals, by virtue\n\nof their status, do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights.\n\nYet, even assuming that exclusion from all of Suffolk County for a\n\nlengthy   period        would        unjustifiably       impinge     the       defendants'\n\nfundamental rights, we cannot conclude that leaving the imposed\n\ncondition intact would bring judicial proceedings into public\n\ndisrepute.   The record, which indicates that both defendants have\n\ncommitted several criminal offenses, including drug offenses at\n\nBromley-Heath, and further that both defendants have violated prior\n\n\"no trespass\" orders with respect to Bromley-Heath, provides some\n\nsupport for the condition of supervised release.                          Moreover, this\n\ncondition expressly preserves the defendants' ability to return to\n\nthe   district    court        for    modification       of   the    condition.         The\n\ncondition does not constitute a miscarriage of justice.\n\n           Accordingly,          we     affirm     the    denial      of       credit   for\n\nacceptance       of     responsibility           with     respect         to     defendant\n\nCarrasquillo,         and,   noting      again    that    the    supervised        release\n\ncondition is without prejudice to their rights to petition for\n\nmodification      of     the    condition,        we    affirm      the    condition    of\n\nsupervised release with respect to both defendants.\n\n\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney and John A. Wortmann, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In early 2006, federal and local authorities commenced Operation Brickhouse to combat drug trafficking in the Bromley-Heath Housing Project (Bromley-Heath) located in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The investigation snared the appellants Amos Carrasquillo and Nathan Garrasteguy through a series of controlled drug purchases executed by a cooperating witness. Faced with unshakable evidence of their illicit activities, the appellants pleaded guilty to several counts of distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and to conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The issue of the drug weights involved in the offenses, however, was reserved and tried to a jury.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>After a six-day trial, at which the appellants presented no evidence, the jury determined that the conspiracy involved between five and twenty grams of cocaine base. At sentencing, the judge accepted the government's sentencing recommendation, declined to give Carrasquillo any credit for acceptance of responsibility, and sentenced him to 132 months of imprisonment followed by eight years of supervised release. Garrasteguy received a sentence of ten years followed by twelve years of supervised release.<sup>[2]</sup> As a special condition of supervised release, the sentencing court prohibited the appellants from entering Suffolk County, Massachusetts during the term of his supervised release, without prejudice to their right to return to the sentencing court to seek revision or rescission of this special condition. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2).</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo appeals the denial of his acceptance of responsibility credit, and both appellants challenge the special condition of supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Acceptance of Responsibility</h2>\n<p>We begin with Carrasquillo's acceptance of responsibility argument, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> which, stripped to its essentials, is a request that he be permitted to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds. In concrete terms, Carrasquillo believes that he is entitled to a two point reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a)despite having gone to trial regarding drug weightbecause he pleaded guilty to the rest of the indictment. This claim fails.</p>\n<p>During the Rule 11 plea colloquy, the district court advised both defendants of the possibility that if a jury concluded that they were responsible for drug weights sufficient to trigger enhanced penalties, it might not grant either of them any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Now, again, I don't mean this in any way as a threat, you must understand that if we go to trial. . . and [if] you lose, it's more than five grams, and the government is put to the expense and time of the trial, there are situations, your lawyers will argue them to me, where I should still give some discount. And I have no hard and fast rule. But you understand that I'll be keeping in mind that we've spent all the time and expense on a trial and you've been found guilty of more than five grams. And I will take that into account. I think under the law I'm required to.</blockquote>\n<p>Both defendants indicated that they understood the court's warning. Despite the court's statement, the defendants proceeded to try to a jury the issue of drug weight. During the course of this trial, the defendants did nothing more than cross-examine witnesses; the defense rested at the close of the government's case. Within two hours of receiving the case, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendants responsible for at least five grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p>After trial, the probation department, in its pre-sentence report (PSR), included a recommendation that Carrasquillo be given a two-level reduction in the offense level pursuant to section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, bringing Carrasquillo's total offense level to 27. The government objected, arguing that Carrasquillo's demand for a jury trial on drug weight not only demonstrated a failure to accept responsibility for the full extent of his conduct, but also falsely denied the extent and nature of the relevant conduct.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, Carrasquillo reiterated his desire for the acceptance of responsibility reduction.<sup>[3]</sup> The sentencing court considered Carrasquillo's argument, but decided not to credit Carrasquillo with any reduction of the total offense level based on acceptance of responsibility. The court rested its decision primarily on the fact that Carrasquillo did not spare the government from the time and expense of a trial. In reaching this conclusion, the district court remarked that the acceptance of responsibility provision is an \"empty sophistry,\" that should be viewed as a discretionary reduction in the total offense level to reward defendants who spare the government the expense of a trial. (\"What [the acceptance of responsibility <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> reduction] is is a discount that is usually granted, it's in my discretion for sparing the government expense.\") Carrasquillo's argument on appeal is that the sentencing court's comments constitute a misinterpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and thus the sentencing court misapplied the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>We review a sentencing court's determination of whether a defendant accepted responsibility for clear error. <i>United States v. Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d 169, 180 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Recognizing the special difficulty of discerning, on a cold record, whether a defendant's expressions of remorse were in earnest, we review a sentencing court's judgment about acceptance of responsibility for clear error.\")(<i>citing </i><i>United States v. Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Royer,</i> 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990); U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.5)). Nevertheless, we continue to conduct a plenary review of any related legal questions, including the interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. <i>Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d at 60 (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. Talladino,</i> 38 F.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p>The Sentencing Guidelines recognize the \"legitimate societal interests\" in acceptance of responsibility and therefore allow sentencing judges to provide a measure of leniency to those defendants who accept responsibility for their actions. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt. backg'd. The Guidelines therefore dispense credit for acceptance of responsibility in two flavors: a two-point reduction at the discretion of the sentencing court if the defendant \"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a). And, if, in a serious offense, a defendant accepts responsibility at an early stage of the investigation, a defendant may be eligible for an additional one point reduction in the offense level. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b). This second reduction is available only to defendants who accept responsibility early enough to save the government the time and expense of preparing for trial, and consequently, this further reduction is only available \"upon motion of the government.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Defendants are not, however, automatically entitled to even the two-point acceptance of responsibility reduction. <i>United States v. Franky-Ortiz,</i> 230 F.3d 405, 408 (1st Cir.2000). The onus of proving acceptance of responsibility is on the defendant. <i>Id.</i> (defendant must \"demonstrate that he has taken full responsibility for his actions and he must do so candidly and with genuine contrition\")(<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2000)). To prove acceptance of responsibility, a defendant must truthfully admit or not falsely deny the conduct comprising the conviction, as well as any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable. <i>Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d at 180 (<i>citing</i> U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n. 1(a))).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We have further held that defendants who proceed to trial and put the government to its proof normally do not qualify for any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d at 60; <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.2). Proceeding to trial, however, does not constitute a <i>per se</i> bar to credit for acceptance of responsibility. Instead, proceeding to trial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> creates a rebuttable presumption that no credit is available. <i>Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d at 60.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo's argument is that his guilty plearather than the trialresulted in his conviction and that his testing of the government's proof regarding drug weight should not alter the fact that in his guilty plea, he accepted responsibility for his actions. Accordingly, he argues that the sentencing court's description of the acceptance of responsibility credit as \"an empty sophistry\" and the court's further characterization of the credit as an expense calculation demonstrates that the sentencing court misapplied the guidelines.</p>\n<p>The government responds that Carrasquillo's challenge to the drug weight required it to introduce evidence regarding all of the elements of the crimes to which Carrasquillo pleaded guilty. Moreover, the government claims that the defendant's rigorous challenge to the drug weight does not evince the candid acceptance of responsibility with \"genuine contrition\" that is a prerequisite to receiving a reduction. <i>See </i><i>Franky-Ortiz,</i> 230 F.3d at 408.</p>\n<p>In the circumstances of this case, we agree with the government and with the sentencing court's implicit finding that Carrasquillo failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility. He went to trial, and yet, he has adduced no evidence to rebut the presumption that his trial with respect to drug weight rendered him ineligible for any acceptance of responsibility-based reduction, nor has he so much as argued against the presumption. Furthermore, his actions in requesting a trial regarding drug weight were not consistent with acceptance of responsibility for relevant conduct. <i>See </i><i>Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d at 180 (sentencing court did not clearly err where it denied acceptance of responsibility reduction to defendant who offered to plead guilty to conspiracy involving lesser quantum of drugs). <i>See also, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Acosta,</i> 534 F.3d 574, 580 (7th Cir.2008) (affirming district court denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction where defendant who pleaded guilty challenged certain factual assertions in PSR); <i>United States v. Annis,</i> 446 F.3d 852, 857-58 (8th Cir.2006) (affirming district court denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction where defendant pleaded guilty to offense but refused to admit to any drug quantity and challenged reliability of prior statement to authorities).</p>\n<p>In a final attempt to gain traction, Carrasquillo argues that the sentencing court's characterizations of the acceptance of responsibility reduction suggest that the court did not properly apply this provision of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The acceptance of responsibility reduction acknowledges legitimate societal interests. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt., backg'd. The provision also recognizes the longstanding judicial practice of more leniently sentencing defendants who evidence contrition and cooperate with law enforcement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Frazier,</i> 971 F.2d 1076, 1084 (4th Cir.1992). As has been said, acceptance of responsibility provisions recognize and support varied societal interests including the reduction of crime, restitution, early withdrawal from criminal activity, the increased potential for rehabilitation among those who feel and show true remorse for their anti-social act, as well as encouraging judicial and law enforcement economy. <i>Id.</i> at 1084-85 (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. Belgard,</i> 694 F.Supp. 1488, 1497 (D.Or.1988)). Thus, the acceptance of responsibility determination does not necessarily reduce to merely an expense calculation, but rather can serve several important societal interests.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, the sentencing court did consider the fact that Carrasquillo pleaded guilty, but also balanced that plea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> against Carrasquillo's pressing of the drug weight issue at trial, in which he challenged the evidence against him. Based on this balancing, the court concluded that Carrasquillo was not entitled to any credit for acceptance of responsibility.<sup>[5]</sup> Regardless of whether the sentencing court acknowledged the all of the varied interests recognized by the acceptance of responsibility credit, the court nevertheless properly denied the credit to Carrasquillo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Exclusion From Suffolk County</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the issue whether the sentencing court could impose a condition of supervised release that prohibited the defendants from entering an entire county during the full term of supervised release. The breadth and duration of this condition give us pause, but on this record we are unable to conclude that the district court plainly erred in imposing the special condition.</p>\n<p>We review a sentencing court's decision to impose special conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Riccio,</i> 529 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir.2008). If, however, a defendant has an opportunity to object to a special condition at sentencing, and stays silent, we review the imposition of a supervised release condition for plain error only. <i>United States v. Padilla,</i> 415 F.3d 211, 219 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc); <i>United States v. Perazza-Mercado,</i> 553 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Riccio,</i> 529 F.3d at 48.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo claims that he properly preserved his objection to the special condition of supervised release.<sup>[6]</sup> The government originally requested, in its sentencing memorandum, a special condition of supervised release ordering both defendants to stay outside the City of Boston.<sup>[7]</sup> In his sentencing memorandum, Carrasquillo objected to the government's proposed condition primarily on constitutional grounds, claiming that the condition would impermissibly impinge on (unspecified) rights protected under the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and that the condition would preclude Carrasquillo from being fully involved in raising his young son.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, however, the district court appeared far more interested in the special condition of supervised release than Carrasquillo. The district court sua sponte noted that it was not familiar with such conditions, and engaged in a dialogue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> regarding the condition with not only the prosecutor, but also a representative of the probation department to satisfy itself that the condition was reasonable and enforceable.</p>\n<p>By contrast, at sentencing, Carrasquillo mentioned the special condition only in passing, and when he did discuss it he noted that the condition was unimportant:</p>\n<blockquote>The other thing I would just comment on very briefly is this issue of whether or not to be in Boston or not be in Boston. Winning that from our standpoint and not getting what we're looking for in terms of the length of incarceration would be a Pyrrhic victory. It's unimportant compared to the amount of time</blockquote>\n<p>Carrasquillo's counsel specifically termed the condition \"unimportant\" and remained focused on seeking a reduction in his sentence. This amounted to at least a forfeiture of the objection, if not an outright abandonment of it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Walker,</i> 538 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir.2008) (describing difference between waiver and forfeiture). Carrasquillo made a strategic decision in making his presentation to the sentencing judge: he focused his efforts on obtaining a lower sentence. In so doing, he essentially left his objections regarding this condition of supervised release by the wayside.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even though the defendants now argue that the special condition's geographic scope (all of Suffolk County) was impermissibly broad, neither of them advanced a narrower area of exclusion to the sentencing court. Similarly, the defendants were entirely silent regarding the particulars of this condition, including the availability of exceptions, as well as the scope and breadth of the condition. Consequently, the sentencing court did not have the opportunity to evaluate alternatives that might make the exclusion more acceptable. It would be both unfair and an inappropriate deployment of limited judicial resources to permit the defendants to raise such specific concerns on appeal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that defendant cannot challenge a district court's ruling at sentencing with an argument not raised below in the papers or at sentencing). Consequently, we review the condition for plain error only.</p>\n<p>District courts have significant flexibility to impose special conditions of supervised release. A district court may impose as a condition of supervised release most discretionary conditions identified in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b),<sup>[8]</sup> or any other condition the court deems appropriate. All such conditions, however, must be \"reasonably related\" to the factors set forth in § 3553(a),<sup>[9]</sup> may involve \"no greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary\" to achieve the purposes of §§ 3553(a)(2)(c), (a)(2)(D), (<i>viz.</i> to protect the public and promote the rehabilitation of the defendant), and must be consistent with any pertinent policy statement of the United States Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. York,</i> 357 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> Any conditions of supervised release that a sentencing court chooses to impose must, of course, be supported by the record. <i>United States v. Scherrer,</i> 444 F.3d 91, 96 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). But this requirement can be satisfied without a written or oral explanation of the reasons supporting the condition if we can infer the court's reasoning by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the court did. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p>The government advanced several reasons for excluding the defendants from the City of Boston. The government noted that the Bromley-Heath project is a refuge of affordable housing for families of modest means, and that it has been beset with an exceedingly high level of gun and drug crimes. The government argues that the sentencing court, pursuant to sections 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C), properly took into account the effects of the defendants' offenses on the Bromley-Heath community. Furthermore, the government noted that both defendants had repeatedly disregarded Boston Housing Authority's (BHA) \"no-trespass\" orders denying them permission to enter Bromley-Heath. Finally, the government noted Carrasquillo ignored a prior state court probation condition ordering him to stay out of all BHA properties. In the face of these orders, the defendants sold crack cocaine several times at or near Bromley-Heath. The government therefore argued that the defendants had to be excluded from a larger geographic area. The sentencing court, without objection from the defendants, appears to have concluded that Suffolk County represents a sufficient geographic exclusion and is administratively feasible to enforce, without elaborating on the deprivation of liberty this exclusion entails.</p>\n<p>Although we have never before passed on a special condition of supervised release that bars an individual from entering an entire county, two circuits have upheld similar conditions.<sup>[10]</sup> In <i>United States v. Sicher,</i> the Third Circuit approved, on plain error review, a special condition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant from entering the Allentown, Pa., metro area, which consists of two counties, for a period of ten years.<sup>[11]</sup> 239 F.3d 289 (3d Cir.2000). In reaching this conclusion, the <i>Sicher</i> court relied on two salient considerations. First, it noted that the sentencing court had relied on ample record evidence demonstrating that the defendant's criminal history was uniquely tied to the mal-influence of her family and associates in Allentown. <i>Id.</i> at 290. Second, the special condition of supervised release did not operate as a total banishment because Sicher was free to request permission from her probation officer to visit the counties covered in the supervised release condition. <i>Id.</i> at 292.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <i>United States v. Cothran,</i> the Eleventh Circuit, on an abuse of discretion review, upheld a special condition of probation that prohibited a defendant from entering Fulton County, Georgia during the first two years of probation. 855 F.2d 749, 751 (11th Cir.1988). In reaching <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> this conclusion, the <i>Cothran</i> court found several factors persuasive. First, Cothran could have been sentenced to up to 30 years but received a sixty-six month sentence, all but six months of which were suspended. <i>Id.</i> at 750. In addition, the <i>Cothran</i> court relied on the district court's finding that Cothran, a charismatic twenty-six year-old, was popular with adolescents in his native Fulton County and had been convicted of willfully distributing cocaine to a minor. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the probation condition at issue in <i>Cothran</i> permitted Cothran to enter Fulton County with the permission of his probation officer, and contemplated the possibility that Cothran could reach an arrangement with his probation officer to permit repeated entry into certain portions of the county for educational or employment purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 752. On those facts, the <i>Cothran</i> court found that the district court's probation condition was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The cases permitting exclusion from a defined geographical area do not entirely ease our doubts about the breadth and duration of the supervised release condition imposed here. Most courts have not authorized a blanket exclusion from a particular area lasting as long as the exclusions in the present case (eight and twelve years). Moreover, such conditions have tended to be imposed after a substantial reduction of a defendant's sentence, which also did not occur here.</p>\n<p>We are even more uneasy over the fact that the condition in this case is not subject to any qualification. Exclusion conditions approved elsewhere have permitted defendants to seek authorization from probation officers for entry into the geographical areas from which the defendants are excluded. Here, however, the sentencing court imposed an unqualified banishment from Suffolk County for a period of as long as twelve years with only the possibility of seeking a modification of the condition from the court itself at some later date, pursuant to section 3583(e).<sup>[12]</sup> Given its importance as a government center where a citizen may be required to conduct business with government officials, the defendants could well have significant reasons for entering Suffolk County. Moreover, at this early juncture, it is impossible to ascertain the level of either defendant's rehabilitation, which might impact a decision to permit the defendants to enter Suffolk County.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the evidence justifying the imposition of the present condition is not as stark as in other cases upholding exclusions. It is true that Garrasteguy and Carrasquillo had at the time of their convictions previously violated BHA-imposed \"no trespass\" orders at Bromley-Heath, and that Carrasquillo was subject to a wider order prohibiting him from entering any public housing project in Boston. But this case does not include the fulsome record present <i>Sicher,</i> nor do the appellants' records evince the same level of criminality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> that the Sixth Circuit found sufficient to support a prohibition from entering the defendant's reservation in <i>Alexander.</i> Thus, exclusion from all of Suffolk County could be a large leap, if the sentencing court had evidence regarding the suitability of a more circumscribed geographic boundary.</p>\n<p>But the defendants did not offer any of these arguments below, nor did they suggest any alternative, more limited, exclusion boundary to aid the district court in the exercise of its discretion. Therefore, as we have noted, the condition of supervised release is subject only to plain error review, and the condition meets this minimal hurdle. In order to show a district court committed plain error, a defendant must demonstrate (1) the existence of an error; (2) that it is plain; (3) that such plain error affected substantial rights; and (4) that left uncorrected, such error seriously affects the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Carrasco,</i> 540 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p>Although it is axiomatic that the constitutional rights of supervised releasees and probationers are limited, <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 534 U.S. 112, 119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), such individuals, by virtue of their status, do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights. Yet, even assuming that exclusion from all of Suffolk County for a lengthy period would unjustifiably impinge the defendants' fundamental rights, we cannot conclude that leaving the imposed condition intact would bring judicial proceedings into public disrepute. The record, which indicates that both defendants have committed several criminal offenses, including drug offenses at Bromley-Heath, and further that both defendants have violated prior \"no trespass\" orders with respect to Bromley-Heath, provides some support for the condition of supervised release. Moreover, this condition expressly preserves the defendants' ability to return to the district court for modification of the condition. The condition does not constitute a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility with respect to defendant Carrasquillo, and, noting again that the supervised release condition is without prejudice to their rights to petition for modification of the condition, we <i>affirm</i> the condition of supervised release with respect to both defendants.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The default statutory maximum in crack cocaine cases where the jury does not find a quantity of drugs, or in which the drug quantity is undetectable, is twenty years. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). But if a defendant is convicted of possessing at least five grams of cocaine base, the statutory maximum sentence is enhanced to forty years. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p>[2]  Garrasteguy was also denied credit for acceptance of responsibility, but he does not appeal that issue, because such credit cannot reduce his mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. Garrasteguy qualifies for a mandatory minimum sentence due to a previous felony conviction for illegal sales of controlled substances. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 851.</p>\n<p>[3]  At sentencing, counsel for Carrasquillo repeated the arguments in favor of the acceptance of responsibility credit contained in the PSR, which he first made in his sentencing memorandum, and emphasized Carrasquillo's position that he was entitled to the acceptance of responsibility credit. (\"Even if your Honor's not giving him the acceptance of responsibility, he admitted to that.\"). Thus, Carrasquillo's claim is preserved. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonczy,</i> 357 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)(where defendant objects and district court was aware of objection and underlying reasons, sentencing objection preserved for appellate review).</p>\n<p>[4]  It should be noted, however that a defendant is not required to volunteer or affirmatively admit relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction to obtain an acceptance of responsibility reduction. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n. 1(a)). Similarly, a defendant \"may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction\" for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  The district court had previously noted that it had \"no hard and fast rule\" regarding an acceptance of responsibility reduction if the defendants contested the drug weight at trial, but cautioned the defendants that it would \"be keeping in mind that we've spent all the time and expense on a trial and you've been found guilty of more than five grams. And I will take that into account. I think under the law, I'm required to.\" Thus, while it is true that the district court, in its characterization of the Sentencing Guidelines overlooked differences between the two sections on acceptance of responsibility, one for actual acceptance and the other for early acceptance, nonetheless the basis for denying a downward departure was sound, and the district court certainly did not commit clear error in making such a denial.</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellant Garrasteguy claims that he preserved by relying on co-defendant Carrasquillo's objection, weak as it may have been. Given our disposition on the merits, we needn't tarry over Garrasteguy's dubious contention that his claim has not been forfeited.</p>\n<p>[7]  When it imposed the condition the district court sua sponte and without comment expanded the scope of the condition to include all of Suffolk County, which includes not only the City of Boston, but also the communities of Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop. Neither the government nor the defendants objected to this enlargement of the scope of the condition.</p>\n<p>[8]  Specifically, the court can impose any condition set forth in 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(b)(1) through (b)(10) and (b)(12) through (b)(20).</p>\n<p>[9]  The factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1); (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B); (3) the need to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(c); and (4) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p>[10]  The Sixth Circuit has also upheld a related special condition requiring a defendant, who had a history of 38 prior criminal convictions and who repeatedly violated the conditions of his then pending period of federal supervised release, live in a city away from his home for a period of one year. <i>United States v. Alexander,</i> 509 F.3d 253 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[11]  This condition of supervised release was imposed as part of the district court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for a sentence modification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, which reduced the defendant's six-year sentence to time served (approximately 10 months). <i>Sicher,</i> 239 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p>[12]  The showing required for a defendant to obtain a modification of a condition of supervised release pursuant to section 3583(e)is an open question in this circuit. <i>Compare </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 445 F.3d 713, 716-17 (3d Cir.2006) (reviewing district court's modification of supervised release for abuse of discretion and leaving open question of whether \"significantly changed or extraordinary\" circumstances are prerequisite to modification) <i>with </i><i>United States v. Lussier,</i> 104 F.3d 32, 36 (2d Cir.1997)(\"Section 3583 provides the district court with retained authority to ... modify terms and conditions [of supervised release]... in order to account for new or unforeseen circumstances.\").\n</p>\n<p>In light of the potential consequences that could flow from a complete inability to enter Suffolk County, a somewhat relaxed showing might suffice to obtain a modification of the supervised release condition here.</p>\n\n</div>",

Wortmann, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In early 2006, federal and local authorities commenced Operation Brickhouse to combat drug trafficking in the Bromley-Heath Housing Project (Bromley-Heath) located in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The investigation snared the appellants Amos Carrasquillo and Nathan Garrasteguy through a series of controlled drug purchases executed by a cooperating witness. Faced with unshakable evidence of their illicit activities, the appellants pleaded guilty to several counts of distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and to conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The issue of the drug weights involved in the offenses, however, was reserved and tried to a jury.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>After a six-day trial, at which the appellants presented no evidence, the jury determined that the conspiracy involved between five and twenty grams of cocaine base. At sentencing, the judge accepted the government's sentencing recommendation, declined to give Carrasquillo any credit for acceptance of responsibility, and sentenced him to 132 months of imprisonment followed by eight years of supervised release. Garrasteguy received a sentence of ten years followed by twelve years of supervised release.<sup>[2]</sup> As a special condition of supervised release, the sentencing court prohibited the appellants from entering Suffolk County, Massachusetts during the term of his supervised release, without prejudice to their right to return to the sentencing court to seek revision or rescission of this special condition. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2).</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo appeals the denial of his acceptance of responsibility credit, and both appellants challenge the special condition of supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Acceptance of Responsibility</h2>\n<p>We begin with Carrasquillo's acceptance of responsibility argument, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> which, stripped to its essentials, is a request that he be permitted to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds. In concrete terms, Carrasquillo believes that he is entitled to a two point reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a)despite having gone to trial regarding drug weightbecause he pleaded guilty to the rest of the indictment. This claim fails.</p>\n<p>During the Rule 11 plea colloquy, the district court advised both defendants of the possibility that if a jury concluded that they were responsible for drug weights sufficient to trigger enhanced penalties, it might not grant either of them any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Now, again, I don't mean this in any way as a threat, you must understand that if we go to trial. . . and [if] you lose, it's more than five grams, and the government is put to the expense and time of the trial, there are situations, your lawyers will argue them to me, where I should still give some discount. And I have no hard and fast rule. But you understand that I'll be keeping in mind that we've spent all the time and expense on a trial and you've been found guilty of more than five grams. And I will take that into account. I think under the law I'm required to.</blockquote>\n<p>Both defendants indicated that they understood the court's warning. Despite the court's statement, the defendants proceeded to try to a jury the issue of drug weight. During the course of this trial, the defendants did nothing more than cross-examine witnesses; the defense rested at the close of the government's case. Within two hours of receiving the case, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendants responsible for at least five grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p>After trial, the probation department, in its pre-sentence report (PSR), included a recommendation that Carrasquillo be given a two-level reduction in the offense level pursuant to section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, bringing Carrasquillo's total offense level to 27. The government objected, arguing that Carrasquillo's demand for a jury trial on drug weight not only demonstrated a failure to accept responsibility for the full extent of his conduct, but also falsely denied the extent and nature of the relevant conduct.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, Carrasquillo reiterated his desire for the acceptance of responsibility reduction.<sup>[3]</sup> The sentencing court considered Carrasquillo's argument, but decided not to credit Carrasquillo with any reduction of the total offense level based on acceptance of responsibility. The court rested its decision primarily on the fact that Carrasquillo did not spare the government from the time and expense of a trial. In reaching this conclusion, the district court remarked that the acceptance of responsibility provision is an \"empty sophistry,\" that should be viewed as a discretionary reduction in the total offense level to reward defendants who spare the government the expense of a trial. (\"What [the acceptance of responsibility <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> reduction] is is a discount that is usually granted, it's in my discretion for sparing the government expense.\") Carrasquillo's argument on appeal is that the sentencing court's comments constitute a misinterpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and thus the sentencing court misapplied the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>We review a sentencing court's determination of whether a defendant accepted responsibility for clear error. <i>United States v.

The Guidelines therefore dispense credit for acceptance of responsibility in two flavors: a two-point reduction at the discretion of the sentencing court if the defendant \"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a). And, if, in a serious offense, a defendant accepts responsibility at an early stage of the investigation, a defendant may be eligible for an additional one point reduction in the offense level. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b). This second reduction is available only to defendants who accept responsibility early enough to save the government the time and expense of preparing for trial, and consequently, this further reduction is only available \"upon motion of the government.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Defendants are not, however, automatically entitled to even the two-point acceptance of responsibility reduction. <i>United States v. Franky-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199134\"><a href=\"/opinion/199134/united-states-v-franky-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 408 (1st Cir.2000). The onus of proving acceptance of responsibility is on the defendant. <i>Id.</i> (defendant must \"demonstrate that he has taken full responsibility for his actions and he must do so candidly and with genuine contrition\")(<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Saxena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199110\"><a href=\"/opinion/199110/united-states-v-saxena/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2000)). To prove acceptance of responsibility, a defendant must truthfully admit or not falsely deny the conduct comprising the conviction, as well as any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable. <i>Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d at 180 (<i>citing</i> U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n. 1(a))).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>We have further held that defendants who proceed to trial and put the government to its proof normally do not qualify for any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d at 60; <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.2). Proceeding to trial, however, does not constitute a <i>per se</i> bar to credit for acceptance of responsibility. Instead, proceeding to trial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> creates a rebuttable presumption that no credit is available. <i>Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d at 60.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo's argument is that his guilty plearather than the trialresulted in his conviction and that his testing of the government's proof regarding drug weight should not alter the fact that in his guilty plea, he accepted responsibility for his actions. Accordingly, he argues that the sentencing court's description of the acceptance of responsibility credit as \"an empty sophistry\" and the court's further characterization of the credit as an expense calculation demonstrates that the sentencing court misapplied the guidelines.</p>\n<p>The government responds that Carrasquillo's challenge to the drug weight required it to introduce evidence regarding all of the elements of the crimes to which Carrasquillo pleaded guilty. Moreover, the government claims that the defendant's rigorous challenge to the drug weight does not evince the candid acceptance of responsibility with \"genuine contrition\" that is a prerequisite to receiving a reduction. <i>See </i><i>Franky-Ortiz,</i> 230 F.3d at 408.</p>\n<p>In the circumstances of this case, we agree with the government and with the sentencing court's implicit finding that Carrasquillo failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility. He went to trial, and yet, he has adduced no evidence to rebut the presumption that his trial with respect to drug weight rendered him ineligible for any acceptance of responsibility-based reduction, nor has he so much as argued against the presumption. Furthermore, his actions in requesting a trial regarding drug weight were not consistent with acceptance of responsibility for relevant conduct. <i>See </i><i>Glaum,</i> 356 F.3d at 180 (sentencing court did not clearly err where it denied acceptance of responsibility reduction to defendant who offered to plead guilty to conspiracy involving lesser quantum of drugs). <i>See also, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Acosta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1199994\"><a href=\"/opinion/1199994/united-states-v-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 580 (7th Cir.2008) (affirming district court denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction where defendant who pleaded guilty challenged certain factual assertions in PSR); <i>United States v. Annis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794209\"><a href=\"/opinion/794209/united-states-v-jason-paul-annis/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 857-58 (8th Cir.2006) (affirming district court denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction where defendant pleaded guilty to offense but refused to admit to any drug quantity and challenged reliability of prior statement to authorities).</p>\n<p>In a final attempt to gain traction, Carrasquillo argues that the sentencing court's characterizations of the acceptance of responsibility reduction suggest that the court did not properly apply this provision of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>The acceptance of responsibility reduction acknowledges legitimate societal interests. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt., backg'd. The provision also recognizes the longstanding judicial practice of more leniently sentencing defendants who evidence contrition and cooperate with law enforcement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Frazier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588127\"><a href=\"/opinion/588127/united-states-v-malcolm-frazier/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span>, 1084 (4th Cir.1992). As has been said, acceptance of responsibility provisions recognize and support varied societal interests including the reduction of crime, restitution, early withdrawal from criminal activity, the increased potential for rehabilitation among those who feel and show true remorse for their anti-social act, as well as encouraging judicial and law enforcement economy. <i>Id.</i> at 1084-85 (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. Belgard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1874336\"><a href=\"/opinion/1874336/united-states-v-belgard/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1488</span></a></span>, 1497 (D.Or.1988)). Thus, the acceptance of responsibility determination does not necessarily reduce to merely an expense calculation, but rather can serve several important societal interests.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, the sentencing court did consider the fact that Carrasquillo pleaded guilty, but also balanced that plea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> against Carrasquillo's pressing of the drug weight issue at trial, in which he challenged the evidence against him. Based on this balancing, the court concluded that Carrasquillo was not entitled to any credit for acceptance of responsibility.<sup>[5]</sup> Regardless of whether the sentencing court acknowledged the all of the varied interests recognized by the acceptance of responsibility credit, the court nevertheless properly denied the credit to Carrasquillo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Exclusion From Suffolk County</h2>\n<p>We now turn to the issue whether the sentencing court could impose a condition of supervised release that prohibited the defendants from entering an entire county during the full term of supervised release. The breadth and duration of this condition give us pause, but on this record we are unable to conclude that the district court plainly erred in imposing the special condition.</p>\n<p>We review a sentencing court's decision to impose special conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Riccio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203852\"><a href=\"/opinion/203852/united-states-v-riccio/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.2008). If, however, a defendant has an opportunity to object to a special condition at sentencing, and stays silent, we review the imposition of a supervised release condition for plain error only. <i>United States v. Padilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201389\"><a href=\"/opinion/201389/united-states-v-padilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 219 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc); <i>United States v. Perazza-Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203689\"><a href=\"/opinion/203689/united-states-v-perazza-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2009); <i>Riccio,</i> 529 F.3d at 48.</p>\n<p>Carrasquillo claims that he properly preserved his objection to the special condition of supervised release.<sup>[6]</sup> The government originally requested, in its sentencing memorandum, a special condition of supervised release ordering both defendants to stay outside the City of Boston.<sup>[7]</sup> In his sentencing memorandum, Carrasquillo objected to the government's proposed condition primarily on constitutional grounds, claiming that the condition would impermissibly impinge on (unspecified) rights protected under the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and that the condition would preclude Carrasquillo from being fully involved in raising his young son.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, however, the district court appeared far more interested in the special condition of supervised release than Carrasquillo. The district court sua sponte noted that it was not familiar with such conditions, and engaged in a dialogue <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> regarding the condition with not only the prosecutor, but also a representative of the probation department to satisfy itself that the condition was reasonable and enforceable.</p>\n<p>By contrast, at sentencing, Carrasquillo mentioned the special condition only in passing, and when he did discuss it he noted that the condition was unimportant:</p>\n<blockquote>The other thing I would just comment on very briefly is this issue of whether or not to be in Boston or not be in Boston. Winning that from our standpoint and not getting what we're looking for in terms of the length of incarceration would be a Pyrrhic victory. It's unimportant compared to the amount of time</blockquote>\n<p>Carrasquillo's counsel specifically termed the condition \"unimportant\" and remained focused on seeking a reduction in his sentence. This amounted to at least a forfeiture of the objection, if not an outright abandonment of it. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203438\"><a href=\"/opinion/203438/united-states-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2008) (describing difference between waiver and forfeiture). Carrasquillo made a strategic decision in making his presentation to the sentencing judge: he focused his efforts on obtaining a lower sentence. In so doing, he essentially left his objections regarding this condition of supervised release by the wayside.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even though the defendants now argue that the special condition's geographic scope (all of Suffolk County) was impermissibly broad, neither of them advanced a narrower area of exclusion to the sentencing court. Similarly, the defendants were entirely silent regarding the particulars of this condition, including the availability of exceptions, as well as the scope and breadth of the condition. Consequently, the sentencing court did not have the opportunity to evaluate alternatives that might make the exclusion more acceptable. It would be both unfair and an inappropriate deployment of limited judicial resources to permit the defendants to raise such specific concerns on appeal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that defendant cannot challenge a district court's ruling at sentencing with an argument not raised below in the papers or at sentencing). Consequently, we review the condition for plain error only.</p>\n<p>District courts have significant flexibility to impose special conditions of supervised release. A district court may impose as a condition of supervised release most discretionary conditions identified in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b),<sup>[8]</sup> or any other condition the court deems appropriate. All such conditions, however, must be \"reasonably related\" to the factors set forth in § 3553(a),<sup>[9]</sup> may involve \"no greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary\" to achieve the purposes of §§ 3553(a)(2)(c), (a)(2)(D), (<i>viz.</i> to protect the public and promote the rehabilitation of the defendant), and must be consistent with any pertinent policy statement of the United States Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200831\"><a href=\"/opinion/200831/united-states-v-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> Any conditions of supervised release that a sentencing court chooses to impose must, of course, be supported by the record. <i>United States v. Scherrer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202150\"><a href=\"/opinion/202150/united-states-v-scherrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). But this requirement can be satisfied without a written or oral explanation of the reasons supporting the condition if we can infer the court's reasoning by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the court did. <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p>The government advanced several reasons for excluding the defendants from the City of Boston. The government noted that the Bromley-Heath project is a refuge of affordable housing for families of modest means, and that it has been beset with an exceedingly high level of gun and drug crimes. The government argues that the sentencing court, pursuant to sections 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C), properly took into account the effects of the defendants' offenses on the Bromley-Heath community. Furthermore, the government noted that both defendants had repeatedly disregarded Boston Housing Authority's (BHA) \"no-trespass\" orders denying them permission to enter Bromley-Heath. Finally, the government noted Carrasquillo ignored a prior state court probation condition ordering him to stay out of all BHA properties. In the face of these orders, the defendants sold crack cocaine several times at or near Bromley-Heath. The government therefore argued that the defendants had to be excluded from a larger geographic area. The sentencing court, without objection from the defendants, appears to have concluded that Suffolk County represents a sufficient geographic exclusion and is administratively feasible to enforce, without elaborating on the deprivation of liberty this exclusion entails.</p>\n<p>Although we have never before passed on a special condition of supervised release that bars an individual from entering an entire county, two circuits have upheld similar conditions.<sup>[10]</sup> In <i>United States v. Sicher,</i> the Third Circuit approved, on plain error review, a special condition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant from entering the Allentown, Pa., metro area, which consists of two counties, for a period of ten years.<sup>[11]</sup> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771976\"><a href=\"/opinion/771976/united-states-v-shannon-sicher/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span> (3d Cir.2000). In reaching this conclusion, the <i>Sicher</i> court relied on two salient considerations. First, it noted that the sentencing court had relied on ample record evidence demonstrating that the defendant's criminal history was uniquely tied to the mal-influence of her family and associates in Allentown. <i>Id.</i> at 290. Second, the special condition of supervised release did not operate as a total banishment because Sicher was free to request permission from her probation officer to visit the counties covered in the supervised release condition. <i>Id.</i> at 292.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <i>United States v. Cothran,</i> the Eleventh Circuit, on an abuse of discretion review, upheld a special condition of probation that prohibited a defendant from entering Fulton County, Georgia during the first two years of probation. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510755\"><a href=\"/opinion/510755/united-states-v-glen-douglas-cothran/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 751 (11th Cir.1988). In reaching <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> this conclusion, the <i>Cothran</i> court found several factors persuasive. First, Cothran could have been sentenced to up to 30 years but received a sixty-six month sentence, all but six months of which were suspended. <i>Id.</i> at 750. In addition, the <i>Cothran</i> court relied on the district court's finding that Cothran, a charismatic twenty-six year-old, was popular with adolescents in his native Fulton County and had been convicted of willfully distributing cocaine to a minor. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the probation condition at issue in <i>Cothran</i> permitted Cothran to enter Fulton County with the permission of his probation officer, and contemplated the possibility that Cothran could reach an arrangement with his probation officer to permit repeated entry into certain portions of the county for educational or employment purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 752. On those facts, the <i>Cothran</i> court found that the district court's probation condition was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>The cases permitting exclusion from a defined geographical area do not entirely ease our doubts about the breadth and duration of the supervised release condition imposed here. Most courts have not authorized a blanket exclusion from a particular area lasting as long as the exclusions in the present case (eight and twelve years). Moreover, such conditions have tended to be imposed after a substantial reduction of a defendant's sentence, which also did not occur here.</p>\n<p>We are even more uneasy over the fact that the condition in this case is not subject to any qualification. Exclusion conditions approved elsewhere have permitted defendants to seek authorization from probation officers for entry into the geographical areas from which the defendants are excluded. Here, however, the sentencing court imposed an unqualified banishment from Suffolk County for a period of as long as twelve years with only the possibility of seeking a modification of the condition from the court itself at some later date, pursuant to section 3583(e).<sup>[12]</sup> Given its importance as a government center where a citizen may be required to conduct business with government officials, the defendants could well have significant reasons for entering Suffolk County. Moreover, at this early juncture, it is impossible to ascertain the level of either defendant's rehabilitation, which might impact a decision to permit the defendants to enter Suffolk County.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the evidence justifying the imposition of the present condition is not as stark as in other cases upholding exclusions. It is true that Garrasteguy and Carrasquillo had at the time of their convictions previously violated BHA-imposed \"no trespass\" orders at Bromley-Heath, and that Carrasquillo was subject to a wider order prohibiting him from entering any public housing project in Boston. But this case does not include the fulsome record present <i>Sicher,</i> nor do the appellants' records evince the same level of criminality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> that the Sixth Circuit found sufficient to support a prohibition from entering the defendant's reservation in <i>Alexander.</i> Thus, exclusion from all of Suffolk County could be a large leap, if the sentencing court had evidence regarding the suitability of a more circumscribed geographic boundary.</p>\n<p>But the defendants did not offer any of these arguments below, nor did they suggest any alternative, more limited, exclusion boundary to aid the district court in the exercise of its discretion. Therefore, as we have noted, the condition of supervised release is subject only to plain error review, and the condition meets this minimal hurdle. In order to show a district court committed plain error, a defendant must demonstrate (1) the existence of an error; (2) that it is plain; (3) that such plain error affected substantial rights; and (4) that left uncorrected, such error seriously affects the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Carrasco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203458\"><a href=\"/opinion/203458/united-states-v-carrasco/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span> (2001), such individuals, by virtue of their status, do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights. Yet, even assuming that exclusion from all of Suffolk County for a lengthy period would unjustifiably impinge the defendants' fundamental rights, we cannot conclude that leaving the imposed condition intact would bring judicial proceedings into public disrepute. The record, which indicates that both defendants have committed several criminal offenses, including drug offenses at Bromley-Heath, and further that both defendants have violated prior \"no trespass\" orders with respect to Bromley-Heath, provides some support for the condition of supervised release. Moreover, this condition expressly preserves the defendants' ability to return to the district court for modification of the condition. The condition does not constitute a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> the denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility with respect to defendant Carrasquillo, and, noting again that the supervised release condition is without prejudice to their rights to petition for modification of the condition, we <i>affirm</i> the condition of supervised release with respect to both defendants.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The default statutory maximum in crack cocaine cases where the jury does not find a quantity of drugs, or in which the drug quantity is undetectable, is twenty years. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). But if a defendant is convicted of possessing at least five grams of cocaine base, the statutory maximum sentence is enhanced to forty years. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p>[2]  Garrasteguy was also denied credit for acceptance of responsibility, but he does not appeal that issue, because such credit cannot reduce his mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. Garrasteguy qualifies for a mandatory minimum sentence due to a previous felony conviction for illegal sales of controlled substances. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 851.</p>\n<p>[3]  At sentencing, counsel for Carrasquillo repeated the arguments in favor of the acceptance of responsibility credit contained in the PSR, which he first made in his sentencing memorandum, and emphasized Carrasquillo's position that he was entitled to the acceptance of responsibility credit. (\"Even if your Honor's not giving him the acceptance of responsibility, he admitted to that.\"). Thus, Carrasquillo's claim is preserved. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonczy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200838\"><a href=\"/opinion/200838/united-states-v-gonczy/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)(where defendant objects and district court was aware of objection and underlying reasons, sentencing objection preserved for appellate review).</p>\n<p>[4]  It should be noted, however that a defendant is not required to volunteer or affirmatively admit relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction to obtain an acceptance of responsibility reduction. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n. 1(a)). Similarly, a defendant \"may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction\" for acceptance of responsibility. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[5]  The district court had previously noted that it had \"no hard and fast rule\" regarding an acceptance of responsibility reduction if the defendants contested the drug weight at trial, but cautioned the defendants that it would \"be keeping in mind that we've spent all the time and expense on a trial and you've been found guilty of more than five grams. And I will take that into account. I think under the law, I'm required to.\" Thus, while it is true that the district court, in its characterization of the Sentencing Guidelines overlooked differences between the two sections on acceptance of responsibility, one for actual acceptance and the other for early acceptance, nonetheless the basis for denying a downward departure was sound, and the district court certainly did not commit clear error in making such a denial.</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellant Garrasteguy claims that he preserved by relying on co-defendant Carrasquillo's objection, weak as it may have been. Given our disposition on the merits, we needn't tarry over Garrasteguy's dubious contention that his claim has not been forfeited.</p>\n<p>[7]  When it imposed the condition the district court sua sponte and without comment expanded the scope of the condition to include all of Suffolk County, which includes not only the City of Boston, but also the communities of Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop. Neither the government nor the defendants objected to this enlargement of the scope of the condition.</p>\n<p>[8]  Specifically, the court can impose any condition set forth in 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(b)(1) through (b)(10) and (b)(12) through (b)(20).</p>\n<p>[9]  The factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1); (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B); (3) the need to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(c); and (4) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p>[10]  The Sixth Circuit has also upheld a related special condition requiring a defendant, who had a history of 38 prior criminal convictions and who repeatedly violated the conditions of his then pending period of federal supervised release, live in a city away from his home for a period of one year. <i>United States v.
