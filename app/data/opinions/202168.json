A public official's assertion of a\n\nqualified immunity defense engenders a tripartite analysis.               See\n\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 207-08 (2001); Limone v. Condon, 372\n\nF.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2004).       The first component of that analysis\n\ninvolves ascertaining whether the plaintiff's averments, if true,\n\nestablish a violation of a right secured by federal constitutional\n\nor statutory law.      See Limone, 372 F.3d at 44.         The case at hand\n\nturns on an application of this facet of the qualified immunity\n\ndoctrine.1\n\n             The plaintiff here, Kevin Valdizán, is a quondam employee\n\nof the Puerto Rico Department of Labor.             He claims that he was\n\ncashiered in 2001 because of his political leanings.                 After a\n\nmodicum of pretrial discovery, the Secretary of the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment of Labor moved for summary judgment on the ground of\n\nqualified immunity. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19\n\n(1982).      After    the   district     court   denied   the   motion,   this\n\ninterlocutory appeal ensued.\n\n\n     1\n      Because the first component of the analysis is dispositive\nhere, see text infra, we need not elaborate upon the other two\nsteps in the pavane.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          Generally, our appellate jurisdiction is limited to the\n\nreview of final orders and judgments.      See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nInterlocutory orders, such as those denying summary judgment, are\n\nnot normally appealable as of right when entered.        See, e.g.,\n\nCamilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 44-45 (1st Cir. 1999).      A\n\nqualified immunity defense, however, raises special considerations.\n\nThus, when a public official qua defendant seeks the prophylaxis of\n\nthat doctrine and unsuccessfully pursues summary judgment, he\n\nsometimes may appeal without awaiting the entry of final judgment.\n\nSee id. at 45.   In broad-brush terms, the denial of such a motion\n\nis immediately appealable if the central issue is a purely legal\n\none.   See Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 318 (1995).    It is not\n\nimmediately appealable if the central issue is \"whether or not the\n\npretrial record sets forth a 'genuine' issue of fact for trial.\"\n\nId. at 320.\n\n          In many situations in which a qualified immunity defense\n\nhas been raised, a district court's denial of summary judgment will\n\nnot fit neatly into one category or the other.     This is so, in\n\npart, because although the \"[d]enial of summary judgment often\n\nincludes a determination that there are controverted issues of\n\nmaterial fact,\" that circumstance alone \"does not mean that every\n\nsuch denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.\"       Behrens v.\n\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 312-13 (1996) (emphasis in original). For\n\nexample, the court of appeals retains jurisdiction to entertain an\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fimmediate appeal in \"situations in which the district court assumes\n\na set of facts and decides, as a matter of law, that those facts\n\nwill not support a qualified immunity defense.\"           Camilo-Robles v.\n\nHoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998).         In that event, \"the court of\n\nappeals can simply take, as given, the facts that the district\n\ncourt assumed when it denied summary judgment for [a] (purely\n\nlegal) reason.\"       Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319.\n\n              This case represents such a situation.         The plaintiff\n\ncharges, in substance, that the Secretary transgressed his First\n\nAmendment rights by firing him from his non-tenured position —\n\n\"Executive II\" — because of their differing political allegiances.\n\nThe district court discerned a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether   or    not   the   record   contained    significantly    probative\n\nevidence linking political animus to the plaintiff's discharge. We\n\nare not at liberty to reexamine that conclusion on an interlocutory\n\nappeal.   See Camilo-Robles, 151 F.3d at 8.\n\n              Still, that determination does not entirely close the\n\ndoor to appellate jurisdiction.             In reaching its decision, the\n\ndistrict court necessarily assumed that a patronage dismissal, if\n\nproven, would be unconstitutional.           As long as we do not question\n\nthe district court's determination that a reasonable jury could\n\nfind   that    political    animus   comprised   the   impetus    behind   the\n\nplaintiff's ouster, we remain free to examine, on an interlocutory\n\nappeal, whether that fact makes any cognizable legal difference.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fThis means that, here, we remain free to examine the logically\n\nantecedent    (and   completely      separate)        question      of    whether   the\n\nplaintiff occupied a position in the government agency for which\n\npolitical affiliation is an appropriate qualification.                      See, e.g.,\n\nGalloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2004).                        We turn to\n\nthat discrete issue.\n\n            This inquiry starts — and in this case ends — with an\n\ninspection of the functions of the position in question, aimed at\n\ndetermining whether it is a policymaking position.                       See Branti v.\n\nFinkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518 (1980) (framing the relevant inquiry as\n\n\"whether     the    hiring    authority         can    demonstrate        that   party\n\naffiliation    is    an   appropriate       requirement       for    the     effective\n\nperformance of the public office involved\"); Elrod v. Burns, 427\n\nU.S. 347, 367 (1976) (plurality op.) (holding that, under the First\n\nAmendment,     \"patronage         dismissals\"         must   be     restricted       to\n\n\"policymaking positions\"); see also Rutan v. Repub. Party of Ill.,\n\n497 U.S. 62, 74 (1990) (reaffirming Elrod/Branti rule and stating\n\nthat \"government's interest in securing employees who will loyally\n\nimplement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or\n\ndismissing certain high-level employees on the basis of their\n\npolitical    views\").        On    this    issue,      the   material       facts   are\n\nundisputed: the plaintiff served in a \"trust\" position labeled\n\n\"Executive II,\" and we may rely upon the official job description\n\nfor the position to determine whether it is one for which political\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\floyalty is an appropriate qualification.                      See, e.g., Mendez-Palou\n\nv.   Rohena-Betancourt,            813    F.2d       1255,    1260        (1st    Cir.     1987)\n\n(\"Whenever          possible,      we    will     rely       upon     [the       written    job\n\ndescription] because it contains precisely the information we need\n\nconcerning the position's inherent powers and responsibilities . .\n\n. .\").\n\n               The    applicable        job   description2          prominently      includes\n\n\"[p]rofessional,            executive           and      administrative             financial\n\nresponsibilities\" of a high order.                       In addition, the position\n\nspecifically          requires      the       holder's       participation          in      \"the\n\nformulation and implementation of public and finance policy\" at the\n\nproject, commonwealth, and federal levels.                      And, finally, the job\n\ndescription authorizes the holder to exercise \"ample liberty in the\n\nuse of his judgment\" in the performance of his administrative\n\nfunctions.          These stipulations leave no doubt but that, under our\n\nprecedents, the position is policymaking in nature.                                See, e.g.,\n\nGalloza, 389 F.3d at 31-32; Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, 867 F.2d 1,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 1989); Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d\n\n236,       242-46    (1st   Cir.    1986)      (en    banc).         As    such,    political\n\naffiliation is, as a matter of law, an appropriate criterion for\n\n\n\n       2\n      The official job description in the record is in Spanish.\nHowever, the Secretary's statement of material facts not in\ndispute, see D.P.R. R. 56 (formerly D.P.R. R. 311.12), contains\ntranslations of pertinent excerpts.     The plaintiff has not\nchallenged either the accuracy or the completeness of those\ntranslations. Accordingly, we accept them unconditionally.\n\n                                              -6-\n\fcontinued employment and the position, for federal constitutional\n\npurposes, is fairly subject to the changing winds of patronage.\n\n           The plaintiff's only real response to this line of\n\nreasoning is that the actual duties he performed as \"Executive II\"\n\nwere more technical than the official job description suggests,\n\nand, therefore, that his position was not truly policymaking in\n\nnature.    Our case law makes it abundantly clear, however, that a\n\ncourt must \"focus on the powers inherent in a given office, as\n\nopposed to the functions performed by a particular occupant of that\n\noffice.\"    Jimenez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 242; accord Cordero, 867\n\nF.2d at 9; Mendez-Palou, 813 F.2d at 1258.   The plaintiff offers no\n\nreason why that general rule should not govern here.   Accordingly,\n\nthe job description trumps the plaintiff's self-serving account of\n\nhis actual duties.\n\n           We need go no further.   The only claim presently before\n\nus is the plaintiff's First Amendment claim for money damages,\n\npremised on political discrimination, against the head of the\n\nagency that employed him.   Because the plaintiff occupied a high-\n\nlevel policymaking position, there is no First Amendment violation\n\neven if raw politics prompted his release.      The Secretary was,\n\ntherefore, entitled to qualified immunity.    See Duriex-Gauther v.\n\nLopez-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 9-11 (1st Cir. 2001).          Hence, the\n\ndecision of the district court denying the Secretary's motion for\n\nsummary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity is reversed,\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                              -8-\n\f",

He claims that he was cashiered in 2001 because of his political leanings. After a modicum of pretrial discovery, the Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. <i>See Harlow v.

After the district court denied the motion, this interlocutory appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, our appellate jurisdiction is limited to the review of final orders and judgments. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Interlocutory orders, such as those denying summary judgment, are not normally appealable as of right when entered. <i>See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763555\"><a href=\"/opinion/763555/grancid-camilo-robles-v-jose-r-zapata-aka-jose-r-zapata-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44-45 (1st Cir.1999). A qualified immunity defense, however, raises special considerations. Thus, when a public official <i>qua</i> defendant seeks the prophylaxis of that doctrine and unsuccessfully pursues summary judgment, he sometimes may appeal without awaiting the entry of final judgment. <i>See id.</i> at 45. In broad-brush terms, the denial of such a motion is immediately appealable if the central issue is a purely legal one. <i>See Johnson v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span> (1995). It is not immediately appealable if the central issue is \"whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a `genuine' issue of fact for trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 320, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is so, in part, because although the \"[d]enial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are controverted issues of material fact,\" that circumstance alone \"does not mean that <i>every</i> such denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.\" <i>Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 312-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span> (1996) (emphasis in original). For example, the court of appeals retains jurisdiction to entertain an immediate appeal in \"situations in which the district court assumes a set of facts and decides, as a matter of law, that those facts will not support a qualified immunity defense.\" <i>Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756655\"><a href=\"/opinion/756655/grancid-camilo-robles-v-dr-guillermo-hoyos-and-dr-hector-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1998). In that event, \"the court of appeals can simply take, as given, the facts that the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment for [a] (purely legal) reason.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 515 U.S. at 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The plaintiff charges, in substance, that the Secretary transgressed his First Amendment rights by firing him from his non-tenured position &#8212; \"Executive II\" &#8212; because of their differing political allegiances. The district court discerned a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not the record contained significantly probative evidence linking political animus to the plaintiff's discharge. We are not at liberty to reexamine that conclusion on an interlocutory appeal. <i>See Camilo-Robles,</i> 151 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, that determination does not entirely close the door to appellate jurisdiction. In reaching its decision, the district court necessarily <i>assumed</i> that a patronage dismissal, if proven, would be unconstitutional. As long as we do not question the district court's determination that a reasonable jury could find that political animus comprised the impetus behind the plaintiff's ouster, we remain free to examine, on an interlocutory appeal, whether that fact makes any cognizable <i>legal</i> difference. This means that, here, we remain free to examine the logically antecedent (and completely separate) question of whether the plaintiff occupied a position in the government agency for which political affiliation is an appropriate qualification. <i>See, e.g., Galloza v. Foy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201328\"><a href=\"/opinion/201328/galloza-gonzalez-v-foy/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29-30 (1st Cir.2004).

Finkel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 518, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On this issue, the material facts are undisputed: the plaintiff served in a \"trust\" position labeled \"Executive II,\" and we may rely upon the official job description for the position to determine whether it is one for which political loyalty is an appropriate qualification. <i>See, e.g., Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484880\"><a href=\"/opinion/484880/juan-a-mendez-palou-v-santos-rohena-betancourt-etc-jose-m-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>, 1260 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Whenever possible, we will rely upon [the written job description] because it contains precisely the information we need concerning the position's inherent powers and responsibilities. . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable job description<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> prominently includes \"[p]rofessional, executive and administrative financial responsibilities\" of a high order. In addition, the position specifically requires the holder's participation in \"the formulation and implementation of public and finance policy\" at the project, commonwealth, and federal levels. And, finally, the job description authorizes the holder to exercise \"ample liberty in the use of his judgment\" in the performance of his administrative functions. These stipulations leave no doubt but that, under our precedents, the position is policymaking in nature. <i>See, e.g., Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 31-32; <i>Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518086\"><a href=\"/opinion/518086/william-cordero-v-juan-de-jesus-mendez-etc-william-cordero-v-juan-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 1989); <i>Jimenez Fuentes v.

As such, political affiliation is, as a matter of law, an appropriate criterion for continued employment and the position, for federal constitutional purposes, is fairly subject to the changing winds of patronage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's only real response to this line of reasoning is that the <i>actual</i> duties he performed as \"Executive II\" were more technical than the official job description suggests, and, therefore, that his position was not truly policymaking in nature. Our case law makes it abundantly clear, however, that a court must \"focus on the powers inherent in a given office, as opposed to the functions performed by a particular occupant of that office.\" <i>Jimenez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242; <i>accord Cordero,</i> 867 F.2d at 9; <i>Mendez-Palou,</i> 813 F.2d at 1258.
