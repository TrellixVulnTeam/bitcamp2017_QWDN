Ana  Maria Lopez Del  Rio appeals the\n                     \n\ndismissal of her  second pro se motion to  vacate, set aside,\n                               \n\nor correct her sentence under  28 U.S.C.   2255.  The  motion\n\nwas denied as an abuse of the writ.  We affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          Del Rio pleaded guilty  to possessing, distributing\n\nand conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C.    841 and  846 and was sentenced to 132  months\n\nimprisonment.  Her  appeal of that  sentence raised only  one\n\nground for review:  that the district court incorrectly found\n\nher  to  be   a  \"leader\"  under  U.S.S.G.      3B1.1(a)  and\n\nerroneously enhanced  her  offense  level  accordingly.    We\n\naffirmed the sentence,  United States v. Ana  Maria Lopez Del\n                                                             \n\nRio, No. 91-1442 (1st Cir.  Nov. 14, 1991), and Del Rio  then\n   \n\nfiled  her first   2255  motion.  It  alleged two grounds for\n\nrelief.  First, she argued that the district court misapplied\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(2) in  deciding that  the  scope of  the\n\nconspiracy included the drug transactions and quantities  set\n\nout in the presentence report as well as the testimony at the\n\ntrial  of Del Rio's  co-conspirator and brother,  Andre Lopez\n\nPolanco.     Second,  Del   Rio  contended  that   there  was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support a  conclusion that she was a\n\nleader  under  U.S.S.G.     3B1.1(a).    The  district  court\n\nsummarily denied the motion and no appeal was taken.\n\n          In this, her second motion to vacate sentence under\n\n   2255, Del Rio asserts one ground  for relief:  Whether the\n\ndistrict court erred by adopting the presentence report based\n\non the relevant conduct section of the sentencing guidelines.\n\nIn a supporting memorandum, Del Rio argued that  the November\n\n1, 1992 amendments  to   1B1.3 clarified the relevant conduct\n\nguideline,   and  that,   accordingly,  the   district  court\n\nimproperly  based  her  sentence  on  drug  transactions  and\n\nquantities that she could not reasonably have foreseen within\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n          The  government's  response claiming,  inter  alia,\n                                                            \n\nabuse of  the writ under  the teaching of McCleskey  v. Zant,\n                                                            \n\n111 S. Ct.  1454, 1468 (1991), outlined Del  Rio's prior writ\n\nhistory and argued that the single issue raised in the second\n\nmotion, to the extent that it differed from ground one in the\n\nfirst    2255  motion,  could  not be  raised  now without  a\n\nshowing  of \"cause\"  for having  failed to raise  the present\n\nclaim  earlier.   Id.   The  government contended  that cause\n                     \n\ncould not  be shown  because the  current \"relevant  conduct\"\n\nclaim was  simply a  restatement of the  claim raised  in the\n\nfirst motion disputing the amount of cocaine involved in  the\n\nconspiracy.  The  district court summarily denied  the motion\n\nas an abuse of the  writ.  Del Rio's subsequently-filed reply\n\nto the government's response did not address the abuse of the\n\nwrit charge.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                             -3-\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          Del  Rio's second  motion  to vacate  sentence  was\n\nproperly dismissed under Rule 9 of the Rules Governing   2255\n\nproceedings.  Rule  9(b), consistent with  the language of   \n\n2255   (\"The  sentencing  court  shall  not  be  required  to\n\nentertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on\n\nbehalf  of the same  prisoner.\"), provides that  successive  \n\n2255 motions may  be dismissed \"for abuse of  the procedure.\"\n\nWhile Rule 9(b)  does not define \"abuse\", under  the abuse of\n\nthe writ  doctrine, see  McCleskey,  111 S.  Ct. at  1467-71,\n                                  \n\npetitioners invoking either 28 U.S.C.    2254 or 2255 will be\n\nexcused from  failing  to  raise  an issue  earlier  only  by\n\nshowing   \"cause  for  failing  to  raise  it  and  prejudice\n\ntherefrom\" or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would\n\notherwise result.  McCleskey,  111 S. Ct. at 1470;  Andiarena\n                                                             \n\nv. United States,  967 F.2d 715, 717 (1st  Cir. 1992); United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Flores, 981 F.2d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 1993).\n                \n\n          Here, the  government adequately  pleaded abuse  of\n\nthe writ in response to  Del Rio's second motion.  Andiarena,\n                                                            \n\n967 F.2d at 716.  Since Del Rio's first   2255 motion was not\n\ndecided on  the merits, she  must disprove  abuse by  showing\n\nthat   \"some   external   impediment,   such  as   government\n\ninterference or the reasonable unavailability of the  factual\n\n                             -4-\n\nor legal  basis for a  claim, prevented it from  being raised\n\nearlier.\"   Id. at 718.   Del Rio has  failed to make  such a\n               \n\nshowing.  The only new assertion in support of her claim that\n\nthe  court held  her  accountable for  conduct  that was  not\n\n\"reasonably  foreseeable\" by her --- that Guideline Amendment\n\n439  \"clarified\" the relevant conduct guideline,   1B1.3, and\n\nreduced  her sentencing range  exposure --- is  unavailing to\n\nshow  \"cause.\"   The  amendment, which  came  into effect  on\n\nNovember  1, 1992, eighteen  months after sentencing,  is not\n\nretroactive  in operation.  U.S.S.G.   1B1.10.  Thus, whether\n\nor  not the  amendment has  the  effect Del  Rio contends,  a\n\nquestion we need not decide,  it is not a \"retroactive change\n\nin  the law . . . represent[ing  an] acceptable excuse[ ] for\n\nfailing to raise  the claim earlier.\"  McCleskey,  111 S. Ct.\n                                                \n\nat 1467.  Thus, Del Rio not only has failed to show cause for\n\nher  previous  failure  to  raise the  issue,  she  has shown\n\nneither  prejudice nor  a miscarriage  of  justice since  the\n\namendment  on which  her  claim  depends  was,  and  remains,\n\ninapplicable.    \n\n          Because  of the \"threshold  nature of the  abuse of\n\nthe writ  inquiry,\" id.  at 1471, we  also need  not consider\n                      \n\nwhether  the  claim  at  issue  here  had  been  procedurally\n\ndefaulted  at  some   earlier  stage  of  the   proceedings.1\n\n                    \n\n1.  Although Del  Rio was  then represented  by counsel,  she\nfailed  to  raise  a  relevant  conduct sentencing  guideline\nchallenge on  direct appeal.   Generally, waiver of a    2255\n\n                             -5-\n\nObviously, if a successive motion  under   2255 was found not\n\nan abuse of procedure,  Rule 9(b), 28 U.S.C. foll.   2255, it\n\nwould  then be  necessary to  consider  whether the  petition\n\nsuffers from other procedural defects.  McCleskey, 111 S. Ct.\n                                                 \n\nat 1466.\n\n                             III.\n                                \n\n          In conclusion, even if we were to  reach the merits\n\nof Del Rio's claim, we would  find no error in the sentencing\n\ncourt's  application  of the  relevant conduct  guidelines in\n\neffect at  the  time  of  sentencing.    The  district  court\n\nproperly  determined, as  a matter  of law,  that the  motion\n\nconstituted an abuse of the writ.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                    \n\nclaim  on direct appeal is excused by  a showing of cause and\nactual prejudice.   See Campino  v. United  States, 968  F.2d\n                                                  \n187, 190 (2d Cir. 1992); United States v.

While we need not decide  the issue,\nwe  note that  Del Rio  has not  alleged that  her attorney's\nfailure  to raise the issue on appeal constituted ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\n\n                             -6-\n",

The motion was denied as an abuse of the writ.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Del Rio pleaded guilty to possessing, distributing and conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841 and 846 and was sentenced to 132 months imprisonment.  Her appeal of that sentence raised only one ground for review:  that the district court incorrectly found her to be a \"leader\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a) and erroneously enhanced her offense level accordingly.  We affirmed the sentence, United States v. Ana Maria Lopez Del Rio, No. 91-1442 (1st Cir.  Nov. 14, 1991), and Del Rio then filed her first &#167; 2255 motion.  It alleged two grounds for relief.  First, she argued that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) in deciding that the scope of the conspiracy included the drug transactions and quantities set out in the presentence report as well as the testimony at the trial of Del Rio's co-conspirator and brother, Andre Lopez Polanco.  Second, Del Rio contended that there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that she was a leader under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a).  The district court summarily denied the motion and no appeal was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this, her second motion to vacate sentence under &#167; 2255, Del Rio asserts one ground for relief:  Whether the district court erred by adopting the presentence report based on the relevant conduct section of the sentencing guidelines.  In a supporting memorandum, Del Rio argued that the November 1, 1992 amendments to &#167; 1B1.3 clarified the relevant conduct guideline, and that, accordingly, the district court improperly based her sentence on drug transactions and quantities that she could not reasonably have foreseen within the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's response claiming, inter alia, abuse of the writ under the teaching of  McCleskey v. Zant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112573\"><a href=\"/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1454</span></a></span>, 1468 (1991), outlined Del Rio's prior writ history and argued that the single issue raised in the second motion, to the extent that it differed from ground one in the first &#167; 2255 motion, could not be raised now without a showing of \"cause\" for having failed to raise the present claim earlier.  Id. The government contended that cause could not be shown because the current \"relevant conduct\" claim was simply a restatement of the claim raised in the first motion disputing the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy.  The district court summarily denied the motion as an abuse of the writ.  Del Rio's subsequently-filed reply to the government's response did not address the abuse of the writ charge.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Del Rio's second motion to vacate sentence was properly dismissed under Rule 9 of the Rules Governing &#167; 2255 proceedings.  Rule 9(b), consistent with the language of &#167; 2255 (\"The sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\"), provides that successive &#167; 2255 motions may be dismissed \"for abuse of the procedure.\"  While Rule 9(b) does not define \"abuse\", under the abuse of the writ doctrine,  see McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1467-71, petitioners invoking either 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2254 or 2255 will be excused from failing to raise an issue earlier only by showing \"cause for failing to raise it and prejudice therefrom\" or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.   McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1470;  Andiarena v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585783\"><a href=\"/opinion/585783/oscar-andiarena-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 717 (1st Cir. 1992);  United States v. Flores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596426\"><a href=\"/opinion/596426/united-states-v-abraham-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 234 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government adequately pleaded abuse of the writ in response to Del Rio's second motion.   Andiarena, 967 F.2d at 716.  Since Del Rio's first &#167; 2255 motion was not decided on the merits, she must disprove abuse by showing that \"some external impediment, such as government interference or the reasonable unavailability of the factual or legal basis for a claim, prevented it from being raised earlier.\"   Id. at 718.  Del Rio has failed to make such a showing.  The only new assertion in support of her claim that the court held her accountable for conduct that was not \"reasonably foreseeable\" by her-that Guideline Amendment 439 \"clarified\" the relevant conduct guideline, &#167; 1B1.3, and reduced her sentencing range exposure-is unavailing to show \"cause.\"  The amendment, which came into effect on November 1, 1992, eighteen months after sentencing, is not retroactive in operation.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.10.  Thus, whether or not the amendment has the effect Del Rio contends, a question we need not decide, it is not a \"retroactive change in the law ... represent[ing an] acceptable excuse[ ] for failing to raise the claim earlier.\"   McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1467.  Thus, Del Rio not only has failed to show cause for her previous failure to raise the issue, she has shown neither prejudice nor a miscarriage of justice since the amendment on which her claim depends was, and remains, inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the \"threshold nature of the abuse of the writ inquiry,\"  id. at 1471, we also need not consider whether the claim at issue here had been procedurally defaulted at some earlier stage of the proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Obviously, if a successive motion under &#167; 2255 was found not an abuse of procedure, Rule 9(b), 28 U.S.C. foll. &#167; 2255, it would then be necessary to consider whether the petition suffers from other procedural defects.   McCleskey, 111 S. Ct. at 1466.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, even if we were to reach the merits of Del Rio's claim, we would find no error in the sentencing court's application of the relevant conduct guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.  The district court properly determined, as a matter of law, that the motion constituted an abuse of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Del Rio was then represented by counsel, she failed to raise a relevant conduct sentencing guideline challenge on direct appeal.  Generally, waiver of a &#167; 2255 claim on direct appeal is excused by a showing of cause and actual prejudice.   See Campino v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586296\"><a href=\"/opinion/586296/jose-pagan-campino-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 190 (2d Cir. 1992);   United States v. Biberfeld, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578217\"><a href=\"/opinion/578217/united-states-v-alfred-g-biberfeld/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 104 (3d Cir. 1992).  While we need not decide the issue, we note that Del Rio has not alleged that her attorney's failure to raise the issue on appeal constituted ineffective assistanceof counsel</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
