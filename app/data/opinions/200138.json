WALL, DIRECTOR, DEP'T OF CORRECTIONS,\n                      STATE OF RHODE ISLAND,\n                       Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n              [Hon. Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n        [Hon. Robert W. Lovegreen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Selya, Lynch, and Lipez,\n\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Larry J. Ritchie, by appointment of the court, for petitioner.\n     Aaron L. Weisman, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nSheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General, was on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 27, 2002\n\f          Per Curiam. On July 14, 1994, petitioner-appellant Edson\n\nToro was convicted in Providence County Superior Court of assault\n\nwith intent to commit murder.         See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-1.      The\n\ncourt sentenced Toro to serve an incarcerative term of ten years.1\n\nOn direct appeal, the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed his\n\nconviction.    State v. Toro, 684 A.2d 1147 (R.I. 1996).         One of the\n\nissues raised during that appeal related to the trial justice's\n\nfailure to give a jury instruction on self-defense.              The state\n\nsupreme court found the issue to be forfeited because a self-\n\ndefense instruction had not been requested in writing as required\n\nby Rule 30 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure.              See\n\nid. at 1149.\n\n          The    petitioner    then   filed   an   application   for   post-\n\nconviction     relief   in   the   state   superior    court.     In    that\n\napplication, he questioned not only the trial justice's refusal to\n\ninstruct the jury on self-defense but also whether he had received\n\neffective assistance of counsel.           The trial justice denied the\n\napplication on March 9, 2000, and the petitioner again appealed to\n\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The petitioner has completed service of that sentence, but he\nis still imprisoned on other charges. His habeas petition is not\nmoot, however, because the underlying conviction has collateral\nconsequences in respect to his continuing incarceration.       See,\ne.g., Carafas v. LaVellee, 391 U.S. 234, 237 (1968); United States\nv. Gallo, 20 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                      2\n\f            While     that        appeal        was    pending,      the    petitioner\n\nsimultaneously sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island.                       See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254.   The issues raised included an alleged denial of due process\n\narising out of the trial justice's refusal to instruct the jury on\n\nself-defense (thus foreclosing the petitioner from pursuing a valid\n\ntheory of defense).             After certain preliminary skirmishing, not\n\nrelevant     here     —     among     other      things,       the   district      court\n\nappropriately required the petitioner to drop unexhausted claims\n\n(such as his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel) before\n\nproceeding       further    —    a   magistrate        judge   filed    a   report   and\n\nrecommendation suggesting that the habeas petition be denied. Toro\n\nv. Wall, C.A. No. 00-561, magistrate's report and recommendation\n\n(D.R.I. Sept. 12, 2001).             The gravamen of the recommendation was\n\nthe magistrate judge's conclusion that the state supreme court's\n\ndetermination of procedural default constituted an independent and\n\nadequate state ground of decision, not susceptible to federal\n\nhabeas review.       See id. at 8-9.        In due course, the district court\n\nentered     an      order       accepting        the     report,       approving     the\n\nrecommendation, and dismissing the habeas petition.                      Toro v. Wall,\n\nC.A. No. 00-561 (D.R.I. Oct. 1, 2001).\n\n            On October 22, 2001, the scene shifted back to the state\n\ncourts.    On that date, the Rhode Island Supreme Court remanded the\n\npetitioner's application for post-conviction relief to the trial\n\n\n                                            3\n\fjustice for an evidentiary hearing.            State v. Toro, 785 A.2d 568\n\n(R.I. 2001) (per curiam).       That hearing was held in June of 2002,\n\nand the matter is currently under advisement in the state superior\n\ncourt.\n\n            Notwithstanding his victory before the state supreme\n\ncourt, the petitioner continued to proceed on parallel fronts.                    He\n\nasked    the     federal    district       court        for   a   certificate     of\n\nappealability, 28 U.S.C. § 2253, and the district court granted one\n\non November 9, 2001.        The petitioner pressed his federal habeas\n\nappeal and, on March 29, 2002, this court granted a supplementary\n\ncertificate of appealability and specified various issues, mainly\n\nregarding      procedural   default,   that        it    wished   the   parties   to\n\naddress.    We also issued a briefing schedule and appointed counsel\n\nfor the petitioner.\n\n            On September 12, 2002, we heard oral argument.                        We\n\nexplored with counsel the petitioner's central allegation:                      that\n\nhis trial attorney had not requested a self-defense instruction in\n\nwriting because the trial justice, at the charge conference, had\n\nassured the attorney that he would instruct the jury on self-\n\ndefense.2      The assistant attorney general representing the state\n\ncandidly conceded that \"the appropriate disposition\" of this appeal\n\n\n     2\n      It is undisputed that the petitioner's trial attorney\nobjected to the omission of a self-defense instruction at the\nconclusion of the court's charge and orally requested that the\ncourt give a self-defense instruction. The objection and request\nboth occurred before the jury had retired to deliberate.\n\n                                       4\n\fwas the entry of an order vacating the dismissal and \"sending this\n\n[matter] back to the district court for a factual determination\n\nabout whether the [trial justice's misleading statement] took\n\nplace.\"3\n\n             We need go no further.           The state's point is well taken,\n\nand the prosecutor's concession makes it apparent that the appeal\n\ncannot (or, at least, should not) be decided without further\n\nfactfinding.          Accordingly, we vacate the order appealed from and\n\nremand     the   matter      to   the   district   court   to   (1)   conduct   an\n\nevidentiary hearing with respect to what transpired at the charge\n\nconference       in    the   petitioner's     original   trial,   (2)   make    the\n\nnecessary findings as to whether the petitioner's trial attorney\n\nwas misled by the trial justice, and (3) make such other findings\n\nand conclusions, and consider such other issues and arguments, as\n\nmay be appropriate under the circumstances.                 We hasten to add,\n\nhowever, that the district court may, if it so chooses, await a\n\nreasonably prompt decision from the state courts in order to see if\n\nthe state courts, in the course of adjudicating the petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, determine whether or not\n\nany misleading conduct took place at the charge conference.\n\n\n\n             Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n     3\n      The assistant attorney general explained that if \"there\nappears to have been what we are describing as sandbagging, that\nwould be cause and prejudice\" sufficient to overcome the procedural\ndefault. See Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 615 (1998)\n(describing \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" standards).\n\n                                          5\n\f",
