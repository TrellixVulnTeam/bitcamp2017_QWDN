Steven Rowe, Attorney General, with whom Christopher\nC.

This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether a federal court has jurisdiction to hear an Indian tribe's\nsuit to stop a state agency from investigating tribal employees'\n\ncomplaints of workplace discrimination.            The Maine Human Rights\n\nCommission has investigated complaints by three former employees of\nthe   Aroostook   Band   of   Micmacs,    and   asserts   that   it    has   the\n\nauthority to investigate any future complaints, pursuant to Maine\n\nantidiscrimination law.       The Band filed this action for injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief against the Commission's investigations,\n\narguing that such investigations impermissibly encroach upon the\n\nBand's inherent tribal sovereignty, congressionally-affirmed right\n\nto    self-governance    without   state   interference,     and      sovereign\n\nimmunity from judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. The district\n\ncourt concluded that the Band's complaint did not invoke a right to\n\nrelief under federal law, but rather invoked affirmative federal\n\ndefenses to state law actions, and therefore did not satisfy the\n\nwell-pleaded complaint rule. Consequently, the court dismissed the\n\naction for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.            We reverse.\n                                     I.\n\n            The Aroostook Band of Micmacs is a federally recognized\n\nIndian tribe.     Over a four month span in 2001, the Band fired three\n\ntribal employees: Chief Financial Officer Lisa Gardiner, Compliance\nOfficer Tammy Condon, and Housing Director Beverly Ayoob. Pursuant\nto internal tribal procedure, Gardiner and Condon appealed the\n\nBand's termination decisions to the Band's Tribal Council, claiming\nthat they were terminated in retaliation for protected activities;\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe Tribal Council affirmed their terminations.             Ayoob, who had\n\nfiled a sexual harassment charge with the Tribal Council before\n\nbeing terminated, did not challenge her termination.1\n\n             The three ex-employees turned to the Maine Human Rights\n\nCommission, a state agency charged with \"investigating all forms of\n\ninvidious discrimination.\"          Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 4566.\n\nUpon   receipt   of   a   private    complaint   of   discrimination,   the\n\nCommission   conducts     a   preliminary   investigation   to   \"determine\n\nwhether there are reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful\n\ndiscrimination has occurred.\" Id. § 4612(1)(B). The target of the\n\ninvestigation must cooperate:\n\n           [T]he commission . . . shall have access at\n           all reasonable times to premises, records,\n           documents, individuals and other evidence or\n           possible sources of evidence and may examine,\n           record and copy those materials and take and\n           record the testimony or statements of such\n           persons as are reasonably necessary for the\n           furtherance of the investigation.          The\n           commission may issue subpoenas to compel\n           access to or production of those materials or\n           the appearance of those persons, . . . and may\n           serve interrogatories on a respondent to the\n           same extent as interrogatories served in aid\n           of a civil action in the Superior Court.\n\nId.    If the Commission determines that there are \"reasonable\ngrounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred,\" it\n\nfirst attempts to broker a conciliation.              Id. § 4612(3).    If\n\nconciliation fails, the Commission may \"file in the Superior Court\n\na civil action seeking such relief as is appropriate, including\n\ntemporary restraining orders.\"         Id. § 4612(4).   Whether or not it\n\n\n     1\n       Because of the narrow jurisdictional nature of this appeal,\nthe substance of the discrimination charges is not relevant.\n                                      -3-\n\fdoes    so,   \"[t]he   complaint    and    evidence    collected   during   the\n\ninvestigation of the complaint . . . shall become a matter of\n\npublic record at the conclusion of the investigation. . . . [and]\nmay be used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding, civil or\n\ncriminal.\"      Id. § 4612(1)(B).        If the Commission does not itself\n\nfile a civil action -- and it usually does not -- the complainant\n\nmay file an action herself.         Id. § 4621.2\n              In the fall of 2001, Gardiner and Condon filed complaints\n\nwith the Commission alleging employment discrimination on the basis\n\nof race, color, and national origin, as well as retaliation, under\n\nthe Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,\n\n§§ 4551-4634, and the Maine Whistleblowers' Protection Act (MWPA),\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, §§ 831-840.           In the summer and fall of\n2002, Ayoob filed two complaints alleging employment discrimination\n\nand retaliation under the MHRA and MWPA.               In each case, shortly\nafter receiving the individual's complaint, the Commission filed\ncharges on the complainant's behalf with the United States Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5.\n              The   Band   asked   the    Commission   to   dismiss   all   four\n\ncomplaints on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the\n\nBand.    The Commission refused, concluding that it had jurisdiction\n\n\n\n     2\n       While the complainant can skip the Commission altogether and\nproceed straight to court, Maine law provides a significant\nincentive not to do so. Successful court plaintiffs can recover\nattorney's fees, civil penal damages, compensatory damages, or\npunitive damages only if they had exhausted their Commission\nremedies before filing suit. Id. § 4622(1).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbecause the Band is subject to the MHRA, the MWPA, and, for\n\nGardiner and Condon's complaints, Title VII.      It investigated the\n\ncomplaints, and on at least two occasions issued document requests\nto the Band seeking a variety of tribal personnel documents.        The\n\nBand complied with those requests.\n\n          In January 2003, the Commission's investigator issued a\n\nreport suggesting that there were no reasonable grounds to believe\n\nthat the Band had discriminated or retaliated against Gardiner or\n\nCondon.   Before the full Commission could rule on the report, the\n\nBand filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Maine against the executive director and members of the\n\nCommission   (collectively,   \"Maine\"),   and   the   three   individual\ncomplainants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief directing\nthe Commission to (1) dismiss the complaints on the ground that the\n\nBand is not subject to the MHRA or MWPA, and (2) stop filing\ncomplaints against the Band with the EEOC.            The complaint, as\namended, pled five claims:    that the enforcement of the MHRA and\n\nMWPA against the Band violates its inherent tribal sovereignty and\nstatutorily codified right to self-governance (Count I); that the\nenforcement of these state laws against the Band violates its\n\ntribal sovereign immunity (Count II);3 that the Band is exempt from\n\n\n     3\n       The complaint relies on three similarly-named but distinct\ndoctrines: tribal sovereignty, tribal sovereign immunity, and a\nstatutory right to self-governance.       Although we explain the\ndifferences between these below in detail, see infra Parts IV.B-C,\nwe provide thumbnail definitions here. Tribal sovereignty is a\ncommon law doctrine recognizing tribes' inherent powers to self-\ngovern, including the power to determine the structure and internal\noperations of the governing body itself, and exempting tribes from\nstate law that would otherwise infringe upon this sovereignty.\n                                 -5-\n\fTitle VII (Count III); that the Band's exemption from Title VII\n\npreempts state antidiscrimination law, and so, regardless of what\n\nthe MHRA and MWPA say, the Band is not subject to them (Count IV);\nand that, even under the MHRA and MWPA's own terms, the Band is not\n\nan \"employer\" (Count V).\n\n             Shortly after the complaint was filed, the Commission\n\ndetermined that, contrary to its investigator's initial report,\n\nthere were reasonable grounds to believe that Gardiner and Condon\n\nhad been retaliated against based on protected conduct. Meanwhile,\n\nGardiner and Condon filed suit against the Band in Aroostook County\n\nSuperior Court.4    That court stayed the action pending the outcome\n\nof the federal litigation.5\n             In federal court, the parties consented to adjudication\nby a United States Magistrate Judge, and cross-moved for summary\n\njudgment. Although both parties addressed the merits of the Band's\nclaims, Maine also argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.6        In February 2004, the\n\n\nTribal sovereign immunity is a common law doctrine providing that\ntribes are immune from lawsuits or quasi-judicial proceedings\nwithout their consent or Congressional waiver. Finally, the Band\nclaims a statutory right to self-governance deriving from Section\n7(a) of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, which provides that the\nBand \"may organize for its common welfare and . . . act[] in its\ngovernmental capacity.\" 105 Stat. at 1148. According to the Band,\nthis provision reaffirms and codifies the common law doctrine of\ntribal sovereignty as it applies to the Band.\n\n     4\n         Again, the merits are not relevant here.\n     5\n       At that point, the Commission had            not   yet   made   a\ndetermination regarding Ayoob's complaint.\n\n     6\n       The record does not reveal why Maine did not argue lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction earlier, by filing a motion to dismiss\n                                  -6-\n\fdistrict court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the complaint.        See Aroostook Band of Micmacs v. Exec. Dir.\n\nMe. Human Rights Comm'n, 307 F. Supp. 2d 95, 96 (D. Me. 2004)\n(\"Micmacs\").     Specifically, the district court concluded that\n\nCounts I and II did not raise questions \"arising under\" federal law\n\nas required by the applicable jurisdictional statutes, and that\n\nCounts   III    and   IV    did   not    allege      a    justiciable        case    or\n\ncontroversy.7 Consequently, the court dismissed the entire action.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (court must dismiss action upon\n\ndetermining,     at   any    point,      that   it       lacks     subject     matter\n\njurisdiction).    The Band timely appealed.\n                                        II.\n\n          The    tribal-state     relationship           between   Maine     and    the\nIndian tribes located within its borders is complex.                    The Band's\n\nrelationship with the state is particularly complex.                  We provide a\nbrief summary of the recent history of that relationship, and\ninclude some background concerning three other Maine tribes, to set\n\nthe stage for the legal analysis that follows.\n\n\n\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). At any rate, it was proper to\nraise the issue at summary judgment. Subject matter jurisdiction\nmay be challenged at any stage. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\n\n     7\n       The Band apparently concedes that Count V does not present a\nfederal claim. We address later the possibility (not argued by the\nstate) that the federal courts should abstain pending resolution of\nthe state law claim, which might render resolution of the federal\nissues unnecessary. See infra Part VI.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fA.        The 1980 Legislation\n\n          In the 1970s, two tribes -- the Penobscot Nation and the\n\nPassamaquoddy Tribe -- filed suit claiming much of Maine as their\nancestral homelands.   See generally Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer,\n\n164 F.3d 706, 707-08 (1st Cir. 1999) (recounting history). Neither\n\ntribe was federally recognized at that point.         The Aroostook Band\n\nof Micmacs was not represented by counsel at the time and was not\n\na party to the litigation.8\n          In   1980,   with   the   aid   of   the   United   States,   the\n\nPenobscots and the Passamaquoddy reached a compromise with Maine.\n\nA third tribe, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, which had not\n\nfiled suit but was represented by counsel and had a potential\nclaim, was later included in the compromise.         See S. Rep. No. 101-\n\n291 (1990).    The resulting settlement was embodied in the Maine\n\nImplementing Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, §§ 6201-14; see also\n\n25 U.S.C. § 1721(a)(8) (\"The State of Maine, with the agreement of\nthe Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, has enacted\n\nlegislation defining the relationship between the Passamaquoddy\nTribe, the Penobscot Nation, and their members, and the State of\nMaine.\"); Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians v. Me. Human Rights\n\nComm'n, 960 F. Supp. 449, 451-52 (D. Me. 1997).\n\n          Under the Act -- which affected \"all Indians, Indian\n\nnations, and tribes and bands of Indians in the State,\" Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 30, § 6204, not just the named tribes -- the\n\n\n     8\n       Apparently there was some confusion as to whether the\nAroostook Band of Micmacs was distinct from the larger Canadian\nBand of Micmacs. See generally S. Rep. No. 101-291 (1990).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fPenobscots      and    the     Passamaquoddy     received   somewhat     more\n\nadvantageous terms than the Maliseets.             The Penobscots and the\n\nPassamaquoddy obtained territory and all the governmental rights\nand powers of municipalities within Maine.           See id. §§ 6205, 6206,\n\n6211.   By contrast, the Maliseets received only land held in trust\n\nfor them by the United States, and no municipal powers.            See id.\n\n§§ 6205-A, 6206-A.\n\n           In exchange for what the tribes received, and \"partly as\n\na result of the Tribes' disputed status, the State of Maine, as\n\npart of the settlement, obtained legal authority over the Tribes\n\nexceeding the usual state authority over native American tribes.\"\n\nPenobscot Nation v. Georgia-Pac. Corp., 254 F.3d 317, 320 (1st Cir.\n2001) (\"Penobscot Nation II\"), aff'g 106 F. Supp. 2d 81, 82-83 (D.\n\nMe. 2000) (\"Penobscot Nation I\").           Here, too, the tribes did not\n\nreceive equally favorable treatment.           For reasons that will become\napparent later, we highlight the special status of the Maliseets.\n             Before the passage of the Maine Implementing Act, neither\n\nMaine   nor     the   United    States   had   officially   recognized    the\nMaliseets, and Maine was reluctant to accord them special status.\nInstead, the Act subjected the Maliseets to Maine law to a greater\n\ndegree than the Penobscots or the Passamaquoddy.             The Maliseets\n\nwere subject to a default clause applicable to all Indian tribes:\n\n              Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all\n              Indians, Indian nations, and tribes and bands\n              of Indians in the State . . . shall be subject\n              to the laws of the State and to the civil and\n              criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the\n              State to the same extent as any other person\n              or lands or other natural resources therein.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, § 6204.      However, the Penobscots and\n\nPassamaquoddy benefitted from an important exception: for those two\n\ntribes,   \"internal   tribal   matters,   including    .   .   .   tribal\norganization, [and] tribal government . . . shall not be subject to\n\nregulation by the State.\"       Id. § 6206(1).        By contrast, the\n\nMaliseets received no such privilege.     Rather, the Act emphasized\n\nthat \"[t]he Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and its lands will be\n\nwholly subject to the laws of the State.\"     Id. § 6202.\n\n          Congress ratified the settlement through the Maine Indian\n\nClaims Settlement Act (\"MICSA\"), 25 U.S.C. §§ 1721-1735.           Among\n\nMICSA's purposes were \"to ratify the Maine Implementing Act\" and\n\n\"to confirm that all other Indians, Indian nations and tribes and\nbands of Indians now or hereafter existing or recognized in the\nState of Maine are and shall be subject to all laws of the State of\n\nMaine.\"   Id. §§ 1721(b)(3)-(4).   MICSA reiterated the distinction\nbetween the Maliseets and the other two tribes as to applicability\nof Maine law:\n\n          Except as provided in [two provisions not\n          relevant here], all Indians, Indian nations,\n          or tribes or bands of Indians in the State of\n          Maine, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the\n          Penobscot Nation, and their members . . .\n          shall be subject to the civil and criminal\n          jurisdiction of the State, the laws of the\n          State, and the civil and criminal jurisdiction\n          of the courts of the State, to the same extent\n          as any other person or land therein.\n\nId. § 1725(a).9\n\n\n     9\n       We have also assumed that MICSA implicitly incorporates into\nfederal law the \"internal tribal matters\" exception of the Maine\nImplementing Act as it applies to the Penobscots and the\nPassamaquoddy. See Penobscot Nation II, 254 F.3d at 320-21.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fB.        The Micmac Legislation\n\n          Approximately ten years later, the Band filed aboriginal\n\nland claims against Maine.   In 1989, Maine and the Band reached a\nsettlement that was memorialized in the Micmac Settlement Act, Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, §§ 7201-7207.   The Act generally accorded\n\nthe Band the same status as the Maliseets, not the greater powers\n\nand autonomy enjoyed by the Penobscots and the Passamaquoddy.   See\n\nid. §§ 7203 (subjecting Band to state laws and court jurisdiction\n\nwithout exception), 7204 (land to be held in trust by United\n\nStates), 7205 (no municipal powers for Band).\n\n          In 1991, at the behest of both Maine and the Band,\n\nCongress enacted the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act\n(\"Federal Micmac Settlement Act\"), Pub. L. No. 102-171, 105 Stat.\n1143 (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 1721 note).       The Federal Micmac\n\nSettlement Act explained that \"[t]he Band was not referred to in\n[MICSA] because historical documentation of the Micmac presence in\nMaine was not available at that time.\"   Id. § 2(a)(2), 105 Stat. at\n\n1143.   Now that such documentation was available, Congress found\nthat \"[t]he Aroostook Band of Micmacs, in both its history and its\npresence in Maine, is similar to the Houlton Band of Maliseet\n\nIndians and would have received similar treatment under [MICSA] if\n\nthe information available today had been available to Congress and\n\nthe parties at that time.\"     Id. § 2(a)(4).     Consequently, the\n\nFederal Micmac Settlement Act aimed to \"afford the Aroostook Band\n\nof Micmacs the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of\n\nMaliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims, to the\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fextent   [the   Micmacs]   would   have   benefited   from   inclusion   in\n\n[MICSA].\"   Id. § 2(a)(5).    On this basis, Congress \"ratif[ied] the\n\n[state] Micmac Settlement Act, which defines the relationship\nbetween the State of Maine and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.\"           Id.\n\n§ 2(b)(4), 105 Stat. at 1144.\n\n            Three provisions of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act are\n\nrelevant here.    First, the Act provides for self-governance: \"The\n\nBand may organize for its common welfare and adopt an appropriate\n\ninstrument in writing to govern the affairs of the Band when acting\n\nin its governmental capacity.\"       Id. § 7(a), 105 Stat. at 1148.\n            Second, despite Congress's stated desire to provide the\n\nBand with \"the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of\nMaliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims,\" id.\n\n§ 2(a)(5), 105 Stat. at 1143, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act\n\ndoes not explicitly subject the Band to Maine law.       Section 6(b) of\nthe federal act, entitled \"Laws Applicable,\" subjects the Band to\nfederal law on the same terms as the other Maine tribes.        105 Stat.\n\nat 1148.    Nothing in the federal act explicitly subjects the Band\nto Maine law.     By contrast, the earlier MICSA explicitly stated\nthat all Indian tribes other than the Passamaquoddy and Penobscots\n\n\"shall be subject to the civil . . . jurisdiction of the State, the\n\nlaws of the State, and the civil . . . jurisdiction of the courts\n\nof the State, to the same extent as any other person or land\n\ntherein.\"    25 U.S.C. § 1725(a); id. § 1721(b)(4).\n\n            Finally, the federal act provided that \"[i]n the event of\n\na conflict of interpretation between the provisions of the [state]\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fMaine Implementing Act [affecting the Penobscots, Passamaquoddy,\n\nand Maliseets], the [state] Micmac Settlement Act, or the [federal]\n\nMaine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 and this Act, the\nprovisions of this [Federal Micmac Settlement] Act shall govern.\"\n\nFederal Micmac Settlement Act § 11, 105 Stat. at 1149.\n                               III.\n\n          Although the issues raised in the Band's complaint go to\n\nthe heart of its relationship with Maine, this appeal is narrow.\n\nAs noted, the district court did not reach the merits; rather, it\n\ndismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nConsequently, we do not decide whether the Band's claims have\n\nmerit, but only whether the district court had subject matter\njurisdiction over those claims.    In so doing, we review de novo the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal.   Wang v. N.H. Bd. of Registration in\n\nMed., 55 F.3d 698, 700 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995).       \"In reviewing the\ndismissal, we construe the Complaint liberally and treat all\nwell-pleaded facts as true, according the plaintiff the benefit of\n\nall reasonable inferences.\"   Murphy v. United States, 45 F.3d 520,\n\n522 (1st Cir. 1995).\n          Counts I and II against the Commission defendants were\n\ndismissed under the well-pleaded complaint rule. Counts III and IV\n\nwere dismissed for lack of a justiciable case or controversy.     We\n\ndivide our analysis accordingly.\n                                  IV.\n\n          The Band's action seeks to enjoin state officials from\n\nenforcing the MHRA and MWPA on the grounds that enforcing those\n\n\n                               -13-\n\facts against the Band conflicts with federal law and thus violates\n\nthe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.10                 See\n\ngenerally Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 144-45 (1908) (authorizing\nsuch actions).     We must decide whether the complaint pleads an Ex\n\nparte   Young     claim   in     a     manner   that    establishes   federal\n\njurisdiction.11\n\n          The Band bases its claim of federal jurisdiction on 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1362.         Section 1331 grants the district courts\n\njurisdiction      over    \"all       civil    actions   arising   under   the\n\nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"                Section\n\n1362 grants the district courts jurisdiction over \"all civil\n\nactions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body\nduly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the\nmatter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or\n\ntreaties of the United States.\"               The district court dismissed\n\nCounts I and II on the grounds that they did not satisfy either\n\n§§ 1331 or 1362 under the well-pleaded complaint rule.\n\n\n     10\n        \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which\nshall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law\nof the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\nany Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary\nnotwithstanding.\" U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2.\n\n     11\n        The complaint pleads a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, but the\nBand appears to have abandoned that argument as the litigation\nprogressed. In light of the Supreme Court's recent statement that\na \"Tribe may not sue under § 1983 to vindicate the sovereign right\"\nof tribal sovereign immunity, Inyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone\nIndians, 538 U.S. 701, 712 (2003), the Band probably would not have\na colorable § 1983 argument here. At any rate, in its appellate\nbrief, the Band barely mentions § 1983, and we deem any potential\n§ 1983 argument to be forfeited.             See United States v.\nCaraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 393 (1st Cir. 1995).\n                                       -14-\n\fA.         The Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule and Ex parte Young\n\n           The Supreme Court has long construed § 1331 to require\n\n\"that it be apparent from the face of the plaintiff's complaint\neither that a cause of action arise under federal law, or at least\n\n(in some cases) that a traditional state-law cause of action . . .\n\npresent an important federal issue.\" Penobscot Nation II, 254 F.3d\n\nat 321 (citation omitted).    Under this rule, \"the federal claim or\n\nissue [must] appear on the face of 'a well [i.e., properly] pleaded\n\ncomplaint,' so that federal jurisdiction is absent where the\n\nfederal issue would arise only as a defense to a state cause of\n\naction.\"   Id. (quoting Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, 211\nU.S. 149, 153-54 (1908)) (second alteration in original). The same\nrule applies to claims filed in state court and then removed to\nfederal court   under   28   U.S.C.   §   1441.    Rossello-Gonzalez v.\n\nCalderon-Serra, 398 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"[I]n deciding (for\nremoval purposes) whether a case presents a federal 'claim or\nright,' a court is to ask whether the plaintiff's claim to relief\n\nrests upon a federal right, and the court is to look only to\nplaintiff's complaint to find the answer.\") (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n           As noted, the Supreme Court has long recognized a federal\n\ncause of action for allegations that a state officer's enforcement\n\nof state law would violate federal rights.        See Ex parte Young, 209\n\nU.S. at 144-45.      While the Court did not identify a specific\n\nfederal cause of action in Ex parte Young itself, \"'[t]he best\n\nexplanation of Ex parte Young and its progeny is that the Supremacy\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fClause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief\n\nagainst state officers who are threatening to violate the federal\n\nConstitution or laws.'\"       Burgio & Campofelice, Inc. v. N.Y. State\n\nDep't of Labor, 107 F.3d 1000, 1006 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting Charles\n\nAlan Wright et al., 13B Federal Practice & Procedure: Jurisdiction\n\n2d § 3566 (1984)); see also Local Union No. 12004 v. Massachusetts,\n\n377 F.3d 64, 75 & n.8 (1st Cir. 2004) (no \"explicit statutory cause\n\nof action\" is needed for an Ex parte Young action because \"'the\n\nrule that there is an implied right of action to enjoin state or\n\nlocal regulation that is preempted by a federal statutory or\n\nconstitutional provision -- and that such an action falls within\n\nthe    federal   question    jurisdiction      --     is   well-established.'\"\n(quoting Richard H. Fallon et al., Hart & Wechsler's The Federal\n\nCourts & The Federal System 903 (5th ed. 2003)).\n\n            It is simply beyond dispute that a complaint which\nproperly pleads a claim for relief against state officers under the\nEx parte Young implied right of action will satisfy the well-\n\npleaded complaint rule.        See Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\nComm'n, 535 U.S. 635, 642 (2002) (there is \"no doubt that federal\ncourts have jurisdiction under § 1331\" over an action seeking\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against state officials on the\n\ngrounds that a state regulation was preempted by federal law); Shaw\n\nv. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96 n.14 (1983) (in unanimous\n\ndecision, stating that it is \"beyond dispute that federal courts\n\nhave   jurisdiction   over    suits    to    enjoin    state   officials   from\n\ninterfering with federal rights\"); Local Union No. 12004, 377 F.3d\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fat 74 (Verizon Maryland \"eliminates any doubt\" that declaratory or\n\ninjunctive actions against state officials to prevent interference\n\nwith federal rights qualify for § 1331 jurisdiction);12 Playboy\n\nEnters. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 906 F.2d 25, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(reiterating, despite some uncertainty as to why Supreme Court\n\njurisprudence   developed   as   it   did,    that   federal   courts   have\n\njurisdiction over an action by \"a plaintiff seeking injunctive\n\nrelief from a state enforcement action, on the ground that state\n\nlaw is preempted by a federal statute\").\n\n          The   above   propositions         are   well-settled   and    our\n\ndiscussion of jurisdictional principles could end here. After all,\n\nwe have identified a federal cause of action that will qualify for\n§ 1331 jurisdiction; the only remaining question is whether the\nBand's complaint properly pleads such an action.           However, Maine\n\nargues that the principles established in a different line of cases\nrequire dismissal.   We explain below why Maine's arguments fail.\nIn doing so, we emphasize two fundamental principles. First, under\n\nthe well-pleaded complaint rule, the plaintiff's complaint is the\n\ndocument in which the federal claim must appear, regardless of\n\n\n     12\n        In Local Union No. 12004, a supervisor filed a complaint\nagainst a labor union with the Massachusetts Commission Against\nDiscrimination (\"MCAD\") based on alleged sexual harassment during\nthe course of a labor dispute. 377 F.3d at 69-70. MCAD rejected\nthe union's argument that the complaint was preempted by federal\nlabor law. Id. at 70-71. The union then filed a federal action\nagainst MCAD, three commissioners, and the complainant, seeking an\ninjunction and a declaratory judgment that MCAD's proceedings were\npreempted by federal law. Id. at 71. We held that the union's\nclaims against \"a state administrative agency for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, alleging that the agency has acted in a manner\ninconsistent with federal law,\" asserted an Ex parte Young claim\nand thus satisfied the well-pleaded complaint rule. Id. at 75.\n                                  -17-\n\fwhether that complaint was filed in federal court pursuant to\n\n§ 1331, or filed in state court and then removed to federal court\n\npursuant to § 1441.       Second, by definition, an Ex parte Young\n\naction can only be brought against state officer defendants; the\n\nSupremacy   Clause    implies    no   right   of   action   against   private\n\nparties, or by state officers.\n\n            By focusing on these points, we can make some sense out\n\nof the array of cases invoked by Maine in support of its argument\n\nthat the Band's complaint runs afoul of the well-pleaded complaint\n\nrule.    The cases upon which Maine relies -- wherein federal\n\njurisdiction was lacking -- are, quite simply, not Ex parte Young\ncases.   These cases fall into three groups: cases where state\nofficers were not parties at all; cases where state officers were\nplaintiffs, not defendants; and cases where state officers were\n\ndefendants, but there was some other serious flaw in the complaint\nsuch that Ex parte Young was not properly pled.\n\n            1.       State officers not parties\n\n            Several of the cases on which Maine relies did not even\ninvolve state officers -- they were between private parties, or\nbetween a tribe and a private party.               See Skelly Oil Co. v.\n\nPhillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667 (1950) (private party v.\n\nprivate party); TTEA v. Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, 181 F.3d 676 (5th\n\nCir. 1999) (private party v. tribe); Colonial Penn Group, Inc. v.\n\nColonial Deposit Co., 834 F.2d 229 (1st Cir. 1987) (private party\n\nv. private party).       In such cases, the Ex parte Young cause of\n\naction is not available.        Therefore, the private plaintiffs' only\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\ffederal cause of action in those cases was the Declaratory Judgment\n\nAct itself.    In such cases, \"[w]hatever federal claim [plaintiff]\n\nmay be able to urge would in any event be injected into the case\nonly in anticipation of a defense to be asserted by [defendants],\"\n\nand the Declaratory Judgment Act does not provide an independent\n\nbasis for jurisdiction.    Skelly Oil, 339 U.S. at 672.\n\n          State officers were also absent from Penobscot Nation\n\nI/II, the primary case upon which the district court relied in\n\nfinding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.       See Micmacs,\n\n307 F. Supp. 2d at 98-101.    That was a suit by a tribe against a\n\nprivate party.13 Indeed, the district court recognized in that case\n\nthat \"[i]f the Tribes were seeking to enjoin state officials,\nfederal jurisdiction would exist, but . . . where, as here, private\nparties are defendants,\" Ex parte Young analysis does not apply.\n\nPenobscot Nation I,    106 F. Supp. 2d at 83 n.4.\n          Simply put, where state officers are not even parties --\nlet alone defendants -- the Ex parte Young cause of action is\n\nunavailable.   That is the context in which we stated that the well-\npleaded complaint rule \"cannot be avoided by having the beneficiary\nof the [federal] defense assert the defense preemptively in a claim\n\nfor declaratory or injunctive relief.\"    Penobscot Nation II, 254\n\n\n\n     13\n        In Penobscot Nation I/II, paper companies threatened to sue\ntwo tribes in Maine court to compel them to turn over certain\ndocuments pursuant to state law. The tribes sued first in federal\ncourt, \"seeking an injunction against any state court lawsuit and\na declaratory judgment that the Maine Freedom of Access Act\nviolates 'their federal right to be free of such state\nregulation.'\" Penobscot Nation I, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 82 (citation\nomitted).\n                                -19-\n\fF.3d at 321.   Consequently, Penobscot Nation I/II -- which Maine\n\ndescribes as \"much like this case\" -- is in fact completely unlike\n\nthis case for jurisdictional purposes.\n          2.     State officers as plaintiffs\n\n          In the second class of cases, state officers sue a\n\nprivate party in state court and the defendant removes to federal\n\ncourt.   See Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Graham, 489 U.S. 838 (1989) (per\n\ncuriam) (state agency v. tribe in state court);14 Franchise Tax Bd.\n\nv. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1 (1983) (state agency\n\nv. private party in state court).15   For jurisdictional purposes,\n\ntwo problems confront such defendants: first, by definition, the\n\naction is not an Ex parte Young action, since it has been brought\nby state officers, not against them; second, it is the state\n\nplaintiff's complaint, not the defendant's answer or motion to\n\ndismiss, that is analyzed under the well-pleaded complaint rule.\nIn Graham and Franchise Tax Board, the state's complaint pled only\n\n\n     14\n        In Graham, the state's cause of action derived from Oklahoma\ntax law.     The tribe removed to federal court and raised tribal\nsovereign immunity as a defense. See 489 U.S. at 839.\n\n     15\n        In Franchise Tax Board, a state tax agency, seeking to\ncollect unpaid taxes from union members, attempted to levy the sums\nfrom the members' accounts in the union's vacation trust.       The\ntrust resisted, claiming that the accounts were protected from\nstate levies by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). The agency sued the trust in state\ncourt for the unpaid sums and a declaratory judgment that ERISA did\nnot preempt the state's authority to levy against the trust; the\ntrust removed to federal court. See 463 U.S. at 3-7. The Supreme\nCourt ruled that the state's claim for damages arose under state\nlaw, and federal law arose only as a defense. See id. at 13-14.\nRegarding the state's declaratory judgment claim, the Court held\nthat a state law claim with a federal law defense cannot be\nconverted to a federal claim by seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe federal defense does not apply. See id. at 14-22.\n\n                               -20-\n\fstate claims, and hence there was no jurisdiction under § 1331.\n\nSuch removal cases have no bearing on an Ex parte Young action.16\n\n             Indeed, for Ex parte Young purposes, this class of cases\n\nis formally identical to the previous class: the defendant is not\n\na state officer. We have described it separately, however, because\n\nof a curious asymmetry.     If a private party files an action against\n\nstate    officers   alleging    that    their   enforcement   of   state   law\n\nviolates the private party's federal rights, that is an Ex parte\n\nYoung action and § 1331 jurisdiction is available.                 But if the\n\nstate officers file an action in state court to enforce that very\n\nstate law, and the private party seeks to remove to federal court\n\non the basis of the same preemption argument, that is not an Ex\nparte Young action, and there is usually no federal jurisdiction\n(unless there is some other basis for jurisdiction).\n\n             This   asymmetry   is,    however,   a   virtually    inevitable\nconsequence of the fact that, even though an Ex parte Young action\n\nis in some ways the mirror image of state prosecution, § 1331\n\n\n\n\n     16\n        Franchise Tax Board itself recognized that had the trust\n(defendant in the state court action) brought an Ex parte Young\naction instead of removing to federal court, the outcome might well\nhave been different:\n\n        [Defendant] CLVT might have been able to obtain federal\n        jurisdiction under the doctrine applied in some cases\n        that a person subject to a scheme of federal regulation\n        may sue in federal court to enjoin application to him of\n        conflicting state regulations, and a declaratory judgment\n        action by the same person does not necessarily run afoul\n        of the Skelly Oil doctrine.\n463 U.S. at 20-21 n.20.\n                                       -21-\n\fjurisdiction is determined from the complaint alone.17 In the first\nexample -- where the private party files an Ex parte Young action\n\nin federal court -- the federal court looks at the plaintiff's\ncomplaint and sees a federal cause of action.                      In the second\n\nexample -- where the state files a state law action in state court\n\nand the private party removes -- the federal court looks at the\n\nplaintiff's complaint and sees only state law issues.                 While this\n\nasymmetry may yield odd results or incentives to race to the\n\ncourthouse,     it    is   a   logical    consequence   of    the   well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint rule itself.\n\n           3.          Some other defect          precludes   Ex    parte   Young\n                       jurisdiction\n           In the third class of cases, the parties are properly\n\naligned for an Ex parte Young action -- the defendants are state\n\nofficers   --   but     some    other    defect   precludes    Ex   parte   Young\n\njurisdiction.        The leading example of this class is Public Service\n\n\n\n\n     17\n        As one commentator on federal jurisdiction in the Indian law\ncontext has noted:\n\n     Graham simply exemplifies the paradox for the well-\n     pleaded complaint rule presented by Ex parte Young\n     actions. Had the Tribe proceeded in federal court to\n     seek injunctive relief against the state officers\n     imposing the disputed tax, the Tribe would have invoked\n     federal question jurisdiction, for its affirmative claim\n     for relief would have been a cognizable federal cause of\n     action under Ex parte Young, thereby 'arising under'\n     federal law.   But because the Tribe instead tried to\n     remove the state court action, it was barred by the well-\n     pleaded complaint rule.\n\nKaighn Smith, Jr., Federal Courts, State Power, and Indian Tribes:\nConfronting the Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule, 35 N.M. L. Rev. __, __\n(43) (forthcoming 2005).\n                                         -22-\n\fCommission v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 248 (1952).18       A widely-\n\ncited dictum in that case stated that federal jurisdiction does not\n\nextend to declaratory judgment actions that assert federal defenses\nto state claims.   See id. at 248; see also Franchise Tax Bd., 463\n\nU.S. at 16 (quoting Wycoff).     But, as the Court made clear, the\n\nflaw in Wycoff was that, while the complaint sought to resolve a\n\ndisputed question of federal law, it did not actually assert any\n\nfederal rights or violations:\n\n          The complainant in this case does not request\n          an adjudication that it has a right to do, or\n          to have, anything in particular. It does not\n          ask a judgment that the Commission is without\n          power to enter any specific order or take any\n          concrete regulatory step. It seeks simply to\n          establish   that,  as   presently   conducted,\n          [plaintiff]'s carriage of goods between points\n          within as well as without Utah is all\n          interstate commerce. One naturally asks, so\n          what? To that ultimate question no answer is\n          sought.\nId. at 244.     The Court held that the complaint did not state a\n\nclaim for relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, and was unripe\nin any event.   Id. at 243-47.   Consequently, it was \"not necessary\nto determine whether . . . the    alleged controversy over an action\n\nthat may be begun in state court would be maintainable under the\nhead of federal-question jurisdiction.\"    Id. at 248-49.\n\n\n\n\n     18\n        In Wycoff, the plaintiff (which specialized in transporting\nfilm) filed a federal action against a state agency, seeking \"(1)\na declaratory judgment that [its] carriage of motion picture film\nand newsreels between points in Utah constitutes interstate\ncommerce; [and] (2) that the Public Service Commission of Utah and\nits members be forever enjoined from interfering with such\ntransportation over routes authorized by the Interstate Commerce\nCommission.\" Id. at 239.\n\n                                 -23-\n\f          The oddly deficient complaint in Wycoff might be sui\n\ngeneris among published appellate cases.   Indeed, we have found no\n\ncase in which we applied the Wycoff dictum to a case in the posture\nof Wycoff itself -- i.e., no case in which we applied Wycoff to an\n\nEx parte Young action and found jurisdiction lacking. At any rate,\n\nthe flaw in Wycoff is not present here.\n\n          4.      Conclusion\n\n          Maine's reliance on the well-pleaded complaint rule, when\n\nreduced to its essentials, is misguided. The Band seeks injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief against the Commission and its officers for\npurportedly violating its federal rights.      Assuming that other\n\nrequirements of Ex parte Young are satisfied -- e.g., that there is\na colorable claim of a federal right -- these claims qualify for\n\"arising under\" jurisdiction under the well-pleaded complaint rule.\n\n          It is true that the Band's arguments could arise as\ndefenses in a state court action.     But a properly framed federal\ncause of action does not fall outside § 1331 simply because it\n\ncould also arise as an affirmative federal defense in state court.\n\n\"[F]ederal jurisdiction is absent where the federal issue would\narise only as a defense to a state cause of action.\"      Penobscot\n\nNation II, 254 F.3d at 321 (emphasis added).        Just because a\n\nfederal issue could arise as a defense to a state law action does\n\nnot mean that the federal issue can only arise as a defense to a\n\nstate law action.    In fact, the federal claims in most Ex parte\n\nYoung actions could be raised as affirmative defenses to state\n\ncourt actions.   But an Ex parte Young action -- \"though ultimately\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f'defensive' in the sense that it seeks to prevent harms threatened\n\nby state officials -- does constitute a federal question under\n\n§ 1331.\"   Local Union No. 12004, 377 F.3d at 74.\n           Relying on Penobscot Nation I/II, the district court in\n\nthis case -- which did not have the benefit of our Local Union No.\n\n12004 decision -- decided that it \"must look at the individual\n\ndefendants' MHRA and MWPA complaints as they are tendered in the\n\nstate court\"; hypothesized how those complaints might \"play[] out\";\n\nand imagined how, in potential state court proceedings, the Band\n\nmight \"answer[] and assert[] as affirmative defenses the contents\n\nof their three (non-Title VII) counts in this declaratory action.\"\n\nMicmacs, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 101.     It then concluded that the Band's\nclaims could be raised as affirmative defenses, and hence were not\npart of a well-pleaded federal complaint.\n\n           As Verizon Maryland and Local Union 12004 make clear,\n\nthat is not the correct analysis.     The question is not whether the\nallegedly federal claims could be raised as affirmative defenses to\n\na state action, but rather whether they could only be so raised.\nWith an Ex parte Young action, that is clearly not the case.         Such\nan action rests, at bottom, on the implied federal right of action\n\ncreated by the Supremacy Clause.        That implied right of action,\n\nwhen   properly   pled,   supplies   the   basis   for   \"arising   under\"\n\njurisdiction under § 1331.       The question here is whether the\n\ncomplaint properly pleads such a claim.\nB.         Count I (Application of MHRA and MWPA to the Band)\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f          To analyze Count I's basis for § 1331 jurisdiction, we\n\nfirst sketch its outline; next, we determine whether the rights\n\nthat the Band alleges are colorable, federal, and potentially\npreemptive of contrary state laws; and, finally, we examine the\n\nstate's argument that there is no actual or threatened state\n\nenforcement action.19\n\n          Count I argues that the Commission's investigation of\n\ntribal   personnel   affairs   violates   two   closely   related     but\n\nconceptually   distinct   federal   rights:   tribal   sovereignty,    as\n\ninherent to the Band and reaffirmed by Congress when it extended\n\nfederal recognition to the Band; and a statutory right to tribal\n\nself-governance, derived from Section 7(a) of the Federal Micmac\nSettlement Act.20    It contends that the latter Act, which finally\nresolves the Band's legal status and controls any prior law, does\n\nnot grant the state any jurisdiction over the personnel practices\nof the Band's governing body.\n          Count I fundamentally asserts two rights: (1) inherent\n\ntribal sovereignty and (2) tribal self-governance under Section 7\nof the Federal Micmac Settlement Act.     We examine each.\n\n\n\n     19\n        We reiterate that this appeal is focused narrowly on\njurisdiction.    For jurisdictional purposes, \"the inquiry into\nwhether suit lies under Ex parte Young does not include an analysis\nof the merits of the claim.\"     Verizon Md., 535 U.S. at 636-37;\nPenobscot Nation II, 254 F.3d at 322 (\"[A] colorable claim of a\nfederal cause of action will confer subject matter jurisdiction\neven though the claim itself may fail as a matter of law on further\nexamination.\").\n\n     20\n        Although the Band collapses the two in its reply brief, we\nfind it helpful to keep them analytically separate since they arise\nfrom different sources.\n                                 -26-\n\f            1.     Tribal sovereignty\n\n            Tribal \"retained sovereignty predates federal recognition\n\n-- indeed, it predates the birth of the Republic.\"               Rhode Island v.\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 694 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\"Because of their sovereign status, tribes . . .               are insulated in\n\nsome   respects   by   a   'historic    immunity       from    state   and   local\n\ncontrol,'   and   tribes    retain     any    aspect    of    their    historical\n\nsovereignty not 'inconsistent with the overriding interests of the\n\nNational Government.'\"      New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462\n\nU.S. 324, 332 (1983) (citations omitted).\n\n            When we speak of a tribe's sovereignty, we mean its\n\npowers as a government.         At its apex, tribal sovereignty can\ninclude broad powers to determine the form of tribal government; to\ndetermine membership; to \"enact substantive criminal and civil\n\nlaws\" that apply to tribal members within tribal territory; to\nregulate domestic relations, such as marriages and divorces, and\n\"the descent and distribution of the property of tribal members\";\n\nto impose taxes; to operate court systems and administer justice;\nand to exclude persons from tribal territory.                See Felix S. Cohen,\n\nHandbook of Federal Indian Law 246-52 (1982 ed.).                Of course, not\n\nall tribes retain the full panoply of these powers today.                 A tribe\n\nretains those aspects of sovereignty that have not been \"withdrawn\n\nby treaty or statute, or by implication as a necessary result of\n\n[the tribe's] dependent status.\"             United States v. Wheeler, 435\n\nU.S. 313, 323 (1978). Congress's broad powers over tribes are both\n\n\"plenary and exclusive,\"      United States v. Lara, 124 S. Ct. 1628,\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f1633 (2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted), and \"only\n\nCongress can abrogate or limit an Indian tribe's sovereignty,\"\n\nFellencer, 164 F.3d at 709.\n\n              One important aspect of tribal sovereignty is \"'the power\n\nof regulating [its] internal and social relations,'\" which includes\n\nthe \"right of internal self-government.\"             Wheeler, 435 U.S. at 322\n\n(citation omitted).      A tribe's power to \"maintain or establish its\n\nown    form   of   government   .   .   .   .   is   the   first   element   of\n\nsovereignty.\"      Handbook of Federal Indian Law, supra, at 247.            The\n\nform of tribal government \"may reflect the tribe's determination as\n\nto what form best fits its needs based on practical, cultural,\n\nhistorical, or religious considerations.\"             Id.21\n              This right to self-governance may preempt contrary state\nlaw.    Conceptually, inherent tribal sovereignty is a doctrine of\n\nfederal common law.      See Lara, 124 S. Ct. at 1637.22 The Supremacy\n\n\n     21\n        The phrase \"tribal self-government\" has been used in two\ndistinct ways. In a broad sense, it can mean a tribe's power to\nregulate the conduct of tribal members. See, e.g., Wheeler, 435\nU.S. at 322 (\"Their right of internal self-government includes the\nright to prescribe laws applicable to tribe members and to enforce\nthose laws by criminal sanctions.\"). We do not understand the Band\nto claim that it has this power. A second, narrower sense means\nthe tribe's power to determine the structure and internal\noperations of the governing body itself. See, e.g., Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law, supra, at 247.       This is the meaning we\nemphasize.\n\n     22\n        In Lara, the Court determined the continuing viability of one\nof its Indian law decisions that Congress had purported to overrule\nby statute. In Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S. 676 (1990), the Court had\nheld that tribal sovereignty does not empower a tribe to bring a\ncriminal prosecution against non-member Indians.         After Duro,\nCongress enacted a statute \"'recogniz[ing] and affirm[ing]' the\n'inherent' authority of a tribe\" to do just that. Lara, 124 S. Ct.\nat 1631 (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 1301(2)) (alterations in original).\nThe Lara Court concluded that Duro and other cases limning the\n\n                                    -28-\n\fClause applies to federal common law no less than federal statutes.\n\nSee Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., 348 U.S. 310, 314\n\n(1955) (where the federal courts have the authority to fashion\nfederal common law, \"[s]tates can no more override such judicial\n\nrules validly fashioned than they can override Acts of Congress\");\n\nSampson v. F.R.G., 250 F.3d 1145, 1153 n.4 (7th Cir. 2001) (unlike\n\nearlier \"general common law,\" \"the federal common law of today\n\n. . . fall[s] under the Supremacy Clause\").         Consequently, tribal\n\nsovereignty may preempt contrary state law under the Supremacy\n\nClause.    \"State jurisdiction is pre-empted by the operation of\n\nfederal law if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and\n\ntribal    interests   reflected   in   federal   law,   unless   the   state\ninterests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state\nauthority.\"    Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. at 334.23\n\n            In short, inherent tribal sovereignty is a federal common\nlaw right that preempts contrary state law, and is therefore a\nproper basis for an Ex parte Young action.\n\n\n\nbounds of retained tribal sovereignty were construing federal\ncommon law, and that Congress could \"change 'judicially made'\nfederal Indian law\" and adjust that sovereignty. 124 S. Ct. at\n1637 (citation omitted).\n\n     23\n        Whether a particular state interest justifies the assertion\nof state authority \"is not dependent on mechanical or absolute\nconceptions of state or tribal sovereignty, but has called for a\nparticularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and\ntribal interests at stake.\"       White Mountain Apache Tribe v.\nBracker, 448 U.S. 136, 145 (1980). For example, the Court has held\nthat a state cannot require Indian vendors operating on reservation\nland to collect state cigarette sales tax from Indian purchasers,\nbut it can require them to collect that tax from non-Indian\npurchasers. See Moe v. Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes of\nFlathead Reservation, 425 U.S. 463, 480-83 (1976).\n                                   -29-\n\f            2.          Statutory right to self-governance\n\n            In   addition     to    inherent     sovereignty,      the    Band    also\n\nasserts a statutory right to self-governance codified in Section\n7(a) of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act.24 The Band further notes\nthat,    while   MICSA     required    the     governing    instruments      of    the\n\nPenobscots, Passamaquoddy, and Maliseets to be                  \"consistent with\n\nthe terms of [MICSA] and the Maine Implementing Act,\" the Federal\n\nMicmac Settlement Act requires only that the Band's governing\n\ninstrument be consistent with the terms of the Federal Micmac\n\nSettlement Act itself.         Compare id. with 25 U.S.C. § 1726(a).              And\n\nthe Federal Micmac Settlement Act -- again unlike MICSA -- does not\n\nexplicitly subject the Band to Maine law.                  See supra Part II.B.\nFinally,   the    Band     argues,    while    MICSA   admittedly        makes    \"all\nIndians, Indian nations, or tribes or bands of Indians in the State\n\nof Maine, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe[ and] the Penobscot\nNation . . . subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the\nState,    the    laws    of   the    State,    and   the   civil    and    criminal\n\njurisdiction of the courts of the State, to the same extent as any\nother person . . . therein,\" 25 U.S.C. § 1725(a), the Federal\nMicmac Settlement Act explicitly states that it controls in case of\n\na conflict with the Maine Implementing Act, MICSA, or the State\n\n\n\n\n     24\n        \"The Band may organize for its common welfare and adopt an\nappropriate instrument in writing to govern the affairs of the Band\nwhen acting in its governmental capacity.\" 105 Stat. at 1148.\n                                        -30-\n\fMicmac Settlement Act. See Federal Micmac Settlement Act § 11, 105\n\nStat. at 1148.25\n           The complaint anticipates the state's response -- that\nthe   Federal   Micmac   Settlement   Act   ratified   the   State   Micmac\n\nSettlement Act, which did make the Band \"subject to the laws of the\n\nState and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of\n\nthe State to the same extent as any other person . . . therein,\"\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, § 7203 -- and attempts to neutralize\n\nit in two ways.\n\n           First, the Band contends that only Congress can make a\n\ntribe subject to state law.     Congress did not do so in the Federal\n\nMicmac Settlement Act, and in fact it specified that the federal\nAct controls in the event of a conflict with the state Act.             See\n\nFederal Micmac Settlement Act § 11, 105 Stat. at 1148.\n\n           Second, the Band contends that the entire State Micmac\nSettlement Act never took effect. A provision of that Act provided\nthat \"[t]his Act shall be effective only if . . . [w]ithin 60 days\n\nof adjournment of the Legislature, the Secretary of State receives\nwritten certification by the Council of the Aroostook Band of\nMicmacs that the band has agreed to this Act.\"         1989 Me. Laws 149,\n\n§ 4(2).   That did not happen -- the Band never formally certified\n\nthat it agreed to the State Micmac Settlement Act as required by\n\n\n     25\n        We express no view on whether the Federal Micmac Settlement\nAct's apparent differences from MICSA or the Maine Implementing Act\nactually create an inconsistency, let alone a conflict to which\nSection 11 of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act would apply. We\nsimply note that it may be necessary to resolve this question in\ndetermining the substantive reach of Section 7(a) of the Federal\nMicmac Settlement Act.\n                                  -31-\n\fthe Act's    terms.26    Thus,   the    Band   argues,    the   State   Micmac\n\nSettlement Act -- which made the Band subject to the laws of Maine\n\n-- never took effect, and is null and void.               Consequently, the\nfederal Act, which purported to ratify the state Act, could not do\n\nso, because Congress simply cannot ratify a non-existent state law.\n\n            However,    the   Band     continues,   the     Federal     Micmac\n\nSettlement Act did implicitly repeal the earlier state and federal\n\nlegislation -- the Maine Implementing Act and MICSA -- to the\n\nextent that they applied to the Band.27         Thus, in the Band's view,\n\nfederal common law and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act are the\n\nonly applicable law determining the scope of the Band's right to\n\nself-governance, and neither subjects the Band to state law.\n            Despite the complex argument concerning the validity of\nthe State Micmac Settlement Act, \"[w]hether a case is one arising\n\nunder [federal law], in the sense of the jurisdictional statute,\n. . . must be determined from what necessarily appears in the\nplaintiff's statement of his own claim . . . , unaided by anything\n\n\n     26\n        Apparently this provision was added relatively late in the\nprocess, and the Band did not realize that certification was\nrequired. The original bill provided that the bill would become\neffective upon enactment of legislation by the United States, and\nnothing in the original bill required the Band to certify its\nassent. The amendment requiring certification by the Band for the\nlegislation to become effective was added just ten days before the\nbill was passed. According to a witness that the Band provided to\ntestify on its behalf pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), the\nBand did not send in the written certification only because it was\nnever told about the certification requirement and did not know\nabout it. However, after the Maine legislature passed the Act, the\nBand supported its ratification before Congress, and did not\nexpress any concern about the state Act's validity.\n\n     27\n        Unlike MICSA, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act contains no\nexpress severability clause. See 25 U.S.C. § 1734 (MICSA).\n\n                                     -32-\n\falleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is\n\nthought the defendant may interpose.\"            Graham, 489 U.S. at 840\n\n(quoting Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74, 75-76 (1914)) (second and\nthird alterations in original).       The Band alleges that it holds a\n\nfederal right, deriving from Section 7(a) of the Federal Micmac\n\nSettlement Act, to self-governance without state interference, and\n\nthat this right preempts contrary state law.            This is a proper\n\nbasis for an Ex parte Young action.\n\n            3.   Imminence\n\n            Maine's principal response is that, even if a violation\n\nof a federal right is alleged, Ex parte Young jurisdiction is not\nsatisfied because here there is no actual or threatened enforcement\naction by state officials.       See Morales v. TWA, 504 U.S. 374, 382\n\n(1992) (\"In [Ex parte Young] suits such as this one, which the\n\nplaintiff intends as a 'first strike' to prevent a State from\ninitiating a suit of its own, the prospect of state suit must be\n\nimminent, for it is the prospect of that suit which supplies the\n\nnecessary irreparable injury.\") (emphasis added); Ex parte Young,\n209 U.S. at 155-56 (\"[I]ndividuals who, as officers of the state,\nare clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws\n\nof   the   state,   and   who   threaten   and   are   about   to   commence\n\nproceedings . . . to enforce[,] against parties affected[,] an\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\funconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be\n\nenjoined by a Federal court of equity from such action.\").\n\n           We have recognized an imminence requirement in Ex parte\n\nYoung actions, though the extent to which it is jurisdictional\n\n(rather than just a substantive element of the action or a limit on\n\nequitable discretion) may be subject to debate.            See N.H. Hemp\n\nCouncil, Inc. v. Marshall, 203 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2000) (in an\n\naction to enjoin criminal prosecution, describing the imminence\n\nrequirement as \"often referred to as a standing requirement\" but\n\n\"probably more complex in character, involving as well concerns\n\nabout ripeness and the exercise of equitable discretion\"); accord\nNat'l Audubon Soc'y, Inc. v. Davis, 307 F.3d 835, 847 (9th Cir.\n2002) (\"We decline to read additional 'ripeness' or 'imminence'\nrequirements into the Ex Parte Young exception . . . beyond those\n\nalready imposed by a general Article III and prudential ripeness\nanalysis.\"), opinion amended on other grounds on denial of reh'g,\n\n312 F.3d 416 (9th Cir. 2002). Indeed, in Morales the lack of\n\n\"imminence\" did not divest the district court of jurisdiction; it\nsimply   meant   that   the   court   should   have   issued   a   narrower\ninjunction.   504 U.S. at 381-83.     But we need not resolve here the\n\nquestion of whether \"imminence\" is purely a merits question or also\n\nrequired for jurisdiction, because the Band has adequately alleged\n\na threat of enforcement which would satisfy any jurisdictional\n\nrequirement.28\n\n\n     28\n        We express no view on whether the Band has alleged a threat\nof enforcement sufficient to establish the substantive elements of\nthe Ex parte Young claim or for the exercise of the district\n\n                                  -34-\n\f          The flaw in Maine's analysis is its assumption that only\n\ncourt proceedings constitute \"enforcement,\" ignoring the threats to\n\ntribal sovereignty, self-governance, and sovereign immunity posed\nby the investigations themselves.        Twice in recent years we have\n\nfound jurisdiction over actions to enjoin state discrimination\n\ninvestigations.     See Local Union No. 12004, 377 F.3d at 70-71, 75\n\n(court had jurisdiction over Ex parte Young action to enjoin\n\nproceedings of Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination\n\n(\"MCAD\") on the grounds that state law was preempted by National\n\nLabor Relations Act); Chaulk Servs., Inc. v. Mass. Comm'n Against\nDiscrimination, 70 F.3d 1361, 1364, 1371 (1st Cir. 1995) (same,\n\nwhere   MCAD's    only    activity      so   far   had    been   issuing\ninterrogatories).    Similar logic applies here.29\n          Finally, the fact that the target of an investigation\n\nyields to the agency's demands and \"cooperates\" to some degree does\nnot rob the investigation of its coercive power.         See, e.g., Major\n\nLeague Baseball v. Butterworth, 181 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1321 n.2\n\n(N.D.

Me. Human Rights Comm'n, No. AP-97-024, 1997 Me. Super.\nLEXIS 194, at *4 (Me. Super. Ct. June 24, 1997). We do not find\nthese differences to be dispositive here. The Band argues that it\nis not subject to Maine's laws and cannot be made to appear before\nany Maine tribunal, regardless of that tribunal's particular\nenforcement powers.\n                                 -35-\n\ffor answers to interrogatories and document production, and noting\n\nthat \"[f]ar from part of a legal proceeding, a CID may be issued\n\nonly before a legal proceeding is filed . . . .        Moreover, it seems\nlikely that the vast majority of CIDs result merely in compliance,\n\nwith   no   court   proceeding   ever   filed   by   anyone,   unless   the\n\ninvestigation leads to the filing of an enforcement action, which\n\nmay or may not occur.\"), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Major\n\nLeague Baseball v. Crist, 331 F.3d 1177 (11th Cir. 2003).               The\n\ntarget has a right to challenge the investigation itself in federal\n\ncourt, and this right is not forfeited by compliance with the\n\ninvestigative demands:\n\n            The recipients of the CIDs had several options\n            available, but only one option could yield the\n            desired result. The most obvious option would\n            have been to comply with the terms of the\n            CIDs.    But this option was unattractive\n            because the CIDs were burdensome, and the\n            recipients believed that the federal exemption\n            gave them a \"federal right\" to be free not\n            only from antitrust prosecution, but also from\n            this investigation. Second, the recipients of\n            the CIDs could have filed suit in state court\n            . . . .         This option was similarly\n            unattractive because [of unfavorable and\n            probably incorrect state law].      This left\n            option three: an action in federal court, the\n            present lawsuit.\nCrist, 331 F.3d at 1180-81.\n\n            Here, the Band had essentially the same choices.            By\n\nstatute, the Maine Commission has the right of \"access at all\n\nreasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and\n\nother evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine,\n\nrecord and copy those materials and take and record the testimony\nor statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the\n\n                                  -36-\n\ffurtherance of the investigation.\"                Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,\n\n§ 4612(1)(B).       In light of this broad authority, the fact that the\n\nCommission did not need to exercise its subpoena power \"to compel\naccess to or production of those materials or the appearance of\n\nthose persons,\" id., may simply mean that the Band decided to first\n\ncomply with state law, and then challenge its applicability.\n\n             An Indian tribe that is unlawfully called to answer\n\nbefore   a    state    agency      may   suffer    both   practical   harms   and\n\nintrusions upon its sovereignty.            As a practical matter, the Band\n\nasserts, \"[i]nvestigations, interrogatories, and discovery divert\n\nthe Micmac government from other pressing official matters and\n\nconsume scarce resources. . . .            includ[ing] the expense of legal\nconsultation during the Commission's investigations and discovery.\"\nCf. Petroleum Exploration, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 304 U.S. 209,\n\n215-16 (1938) (jurisdictional amount-in-controversy minimum was met\nby the \"necessary expense of producing the information demanded by\nthe order,\" which was \"not collateral or incidental to the purpose\n\nof the injunction, but a threatened expense from which relief is\nsought\"). As a more symbolic matter, simply being called to appear\nand defend its internal employment practices before a state agency\n\nmay be an insult to a tribe's sovereignty and right to self-\n\ngovernance.     Cf. Bishop Paiute Tribe v. County of Inyo, 275 F.3d\n\n893, 902 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that execution of warrant against\n\ntribe to obtain employee records violated tribal immunity because\n\n\"at   issue    is     not   just    the    Tribe's    right   to   protect    the\n\nconfidentiality of its employee records, but the more fundamental\n\nright of the Tribe not to have its policies undermined by the\n                            -37-\n\fstates and their political subdivisions\"), vacated on other grounds\n\nsub nom. Inyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone Indians, 538 U.S. 701\n\n(2003); cf. Fed. Mar. Comm'n v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S.\n743, 760-761 (2002) (forcing a state to submit to adjudication\n\nbefore a federal administrative agency is an \"affront to a State's\n\ndignity\" because the \"State is required to defend itself in an\n\nadversarial proceeding\").30    Sometimes, Congress requires a tribe\n\nto submit to such invasions.   We do not comment on whether Congress\n\nhas done so here -- only that the Band may argue its case in a\n\nfederal forum.\n\n          4.     Conclusion\n\n          For § 1331 purposes, Count I adequately alleges that,\npursuant to federal common law and the Federal Micmac Settlement\nAct, the Band possesses both inherent tribal sovereignty and a\n\nstatutory right to self-governance, and that the enforcement of\nstate law against the Band violates these rights.     Consequently,\n\n\n\n\n     30\n        Maine argues that this case more closely resembles Reyes v.\nSupervisor of the DEA, 834 F.2d 1093 (1st Cir. 1987), where the\nplaintiff argued that an entry in a government file stating that he\nwas a member of a terrorist organization was incorrect and had\nresulted in more stringent conditions of imprisonment. We affirmed\ndismissal of his due process challenge because he alleged only harm\nto his \"interest in a good name or good reputation\" and not any\n\"continuing infringement of a liberty interest, or that he\nrealistically expect[ed] a repetition of his previous experiences\"\nin prison. Id. at 1098. Reyes is hardly a useful analogue because\nthe Band's interest in self-governance is decidedly greater than a\nprisoner's interest in correct information in a government file,\nand the Band may realistically expect to repeat its previous\nexperiences with the Commission.\n                                -38-\n\fthe district court erred in dismissing Count I for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction.31\nC.        Count II (Tribal Sovereign Immunity)\n\n          Count II alleges that, as a matter of federal law, the\n\nBand's tribal sovereign immunity bars the enforcement of state law\n\nagainst it.   The difference between the rights asserted in Count\n\nI and the tribal sovereign immunity asserted in Count II is subtle\n\nbut important.   The Band's alleged rights to self-governance and\n\ntribal sovereignty mean, in essence, that it is not subject to\n\nstate laws (at least those that purport to regulate the internal\n\ngovernance affairs of the Band itself) at all. By contrast, tribal\n\nsovereign immunity means that the Band is not amenable to state\n\njudicial or quasi-judicial proceedings to enforce those laws.    See\n\nKaighn Smith, Jr., Federal Courts, State Power, and Indian Tribes:\n\nConfronting the Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule, 35 N.M. L. Rev. __, __\n(24-26) (forthcoming 2005) (contrasting doctrines of infringement\nof tribal sovereignty versus tribal sovereign immunity). In short,\n\nwe read Count I to allege that the Band is not subject to the MHRA\nand MWPA, and Count II to allege that, even if the Band is subject\nto those acts, it is not subject to the power of any Maine tribunal\n\nto investigate and enforce those laws.32\n\n\n     31\n        Because we hold that the district court had jurisdiction\nunder § 1331, we need not decide whether § 1362 jurisdiction would\nalso be available.\n\n     32\n        The Band's briefs are not always precise in this distinction,\nbut the complaint adequately separates the concepts. Count I\nalleges that the Commission's application of the MHRA and the MWPA\nto the Band violates its \"retained inherent tribal sovereignty\" and\nthe Federal Micmac Settlement Act. Count II, by contrast, alleges\nthat \"[t]he Band's tribal sovereign immunity . . . bars the\n                                 -39-\n\f          \"As a matter of federal law, an Indian tribe is subject\n\nto suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe\n\nhas waived its immunity.\"     Kiowa Tribe v. Mfg. Techs., Inc., 523\n\nU.S. 751, 754 (1998); Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49,\n\n58 (1978).   This immunity applies in state proceedings as well as\n\nfederal proceedings.     Kiowa Tribe, 523 U.S. at 755.    The Band has\n\nfiled a suit to enjoin state officials from interfering with its\n\nalleged federal right of tribal sovereign immunity. Such an action\n\nwould appear to satisfy the requirements of Verizon Maryland and\n\nLocal Union No. 12004.    See Kiowa Indian Tribe v. Hoover, 150 F.3d\n\n1163, 1171-72 (10th Cir. 1998) (reversing district court's denial\n\nof tribe's motion for preliminary injunction against enforcement of\nstate court judgments on the grounds of tribal sovereign immunity).\n          Maine argues, however, that tribal sovereign immunity\n\ncannot be asserted in an Ex parte Young action.          Its principal\nauthority for this argument is Graham, in which the Supreme Court\n\nheld that a tribe, sued in state court by the state, may not remove\n\nto federal court on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity because\n\"a federal immunity to the claims asserted does not convert a suit\notherwise arising under state law into one which, in the statutory\n\nsense, arises under federal law.\"     489 U.S. at 841.      In Maine's\n\nview, Graham stands for the proposition that \"a tribal sovereign\n\nimmunity defense . . . cannot form the basis of 'arising under'\n\njurisdiction.\"   But Maine fails to recognize that Count II pleads\n\na tribal sovereignty offense.      As described above, there is a\n\n\n\nenforcement of the MHRA and the MWPA against the Band.\"\n                               -40-\n\fcrucial difference between removal of a state claim and an Ex parte\n\nYoung action.    See supra Part IV.A.2.   The well-pleaded complaint\n\nrule applies to the plaintiff's complaint, regardless of whether it\nwas filed in state court or federal court.    See Rossello-Gonzalez,\n\n398 F.3d at 10 (applying rule to complaint filed in state court).\n\nThe well-pleaded complaint in Graham contained an Oklahoma law tax\n\nclaim; the well-pleaded complaint here contains a claim under a\n\nfederal cause of action asserting a federal common law right.\n\nGraham addressed whether a defendant may remove on the basis of a\n\ntribal sovereign immunity defense; it simply does not apply where\n\na plaintiff pleads an Ex parte Young action on the basis of the\nfederal right of tribal sovereign immunity.\n             Again, a key flaw in Maine's analysis is its assumption\nthat tribal sovereign immunity is only a defense to a lawsuit, and\n\nsince the Commission has not filed (or threatened to file) suit\nagainst the Band, considerations of tribal sovereign immunity are\npremature.      But tribal sovereign immunity might apply to the\n\nCommission's investigations themselves.33      We do not hold that\ntribal sovereign immunity applies to such proceedings, nor even\nthat the Band actually retains tribal sovereign immunity in light\n\nof MICSA and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act.   See supra note 19.\n\nWe simply conclude that the Band's claim of tribal sovereign\n\nimmunity presents a \"colorable\" claim of a federal cause of action\n\n\n\n\n     33\n        As an analogy, state sovereign immunity applies to certain\nfederal administrative proceedings. See S.C. State Ports Auth.,\n535 U.S. at 760-61.\n                                -41-\n\funder Ex parte Young.   Consequently, the district court erred in\n\ndismissing Count II for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.34\n                                V.\n\n          Counts III and IV relate to a provision in the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964 stating that Indian tribes are not \"employers\"\n\nunder Title VII.   See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b).    Count III seeks a\n\ndeclaration that the Band is not subject to Title VII, and an\n\ninjunction against the Commission from applying Title VII to the\n\nBand and filing charges against the Band with the federal EEOC.\n\nCount IV alleges that the Title VII exemption preempts contrary\n\nstate law, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that the\n\nCommission may not apply the MHRA and MWPA against the Band.      In\nother words, Count III claims that the Band is exempt from Title\nVII, while Count IV says that because the Band is exempt from Title\n\nVII, it must be exempt, as a matter of federal law, from the MHRA\nand MWPA too. The district court dismissed both counts on the\ngrounds that they did not pose justiciable cases or controversies.\n\nSee Micmacs, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 106-08.   We disagree.\nA.        Count III (Title VII Exemption)\n\n          Until recently, Commission staff would apparently, as a\n\nmatter of course under the agencies' \"dual filing\" procedure,35\n\n\n     34\n        Again, we need not decide whether § 1362 would apply.    See\nsupra note 31.\n\n     35\n        \"Dual filing\" refers to the practice by which a complainant\nmay file a charge with a state antidiscrimination agency alleging\nviolations of both state and federal law. The state agency then\nfiles a charge with the EEOC on the complainant's behalf, but\nprocesses the complaint itself first. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-5(b)-\n(e) (describing how dual filed charges are treated for purposes of\ndetermining whether reasonable cause exists, time for filing\n                                -42-\n\fautomatically file EEOC complaints against the Band on behalf of\n\nCommission complainants and let the EEOC decide whether Title VII\n\napplied.    This practice has apparently stopped, and the Commission\nadmitted in its answer that Title VII does not apply to the Band.\n\nCf. Fellencer, 164 F.3d at 712 (Title VII exemption applies to\n\nPenobscot Nation); Boudman v. Aroostook Band of Micmac Indians, 54\n\nF. Supp. 2d 44, 48-49 (D. Me. 1999) (same for the Band).                           The\n\nCommission's      current       position    is   that      it   \"does     not   file\n\ndiscrimination charges against tribes with the EEOC unless the\n\n[Commission] has some reason for believing that Title VII might\n\nsomehow apply.\"\n\n             Maine     argues    that   there    is   no   justiciable      case    or\ncontroversy because there is no dispute: all parties agree that the\nBand is exempt from Title VII, and hence there is nothing for a\n\ncourt to resolve.         The district court apparently agreed.                    See\n\nMicmacs, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 107.            While the district court did not\nidentify which branch of case or controversy doctrine supported its\n\nruling, we understand it to have meant the dispute was moot.\n             The dispute is not moot because nothing prevents the\nCommission      from   resuming     its    former     practice.       \"[V]oluntary\n\ncessation of allegedly illegal conduct . . . does not make the case\n\nmoot.\"     United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953).\n\nThe reason is simple: \"The defendant is free to return to his old\n\nways.\" Id.      Voluntary cessation will only moot a dispute when \"(1)\n\nit   can   be   said    with    assurance   that      'there    is   no   reasonable\n\n\n\ncharges, and other purposes).\n                                        -43-\n\fexpectation . . .' that the alleged violation will recur, and (2)\n\ninterim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated\n\nthe effects of the alleged violation.\"             Los Angeles County v.\nDavis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (citations omitted; alteration in\n\noriginal).     The defendant's burden of establishing mootness \"is a\n\nheavy one,\" W.T. Grant, 345 U.S. at 633, and it must be \"absolutely\n\nclear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\n\nexpected to recur.\" United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export\n\nAss'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968).\n\n             The Commission has not met that burden.               First, the\n\nrecord     indicates   that   the   Commission   referred   four    different\n\ncomplaints to the EEOC after the United States District Court for\nthe District of Maine held in Boudman that the Band is exempt from\nTitle VII.36 Second, even the Commission's concession is qualified.\n\nIt reserves the right to file EEOC charges against the Band if it\n\"has some reason for believing that Title VII might somehow apply.\"\nFor these reasons, the Commission has not adequately demonstrated\n\nthat its voluntary cessation is permanent.\n             The district court advanced a second reason why Count III\ndoes not present a case or controversy:           Even if the Commission\n\nwere still referring charges against the Band to the EEOC, \"such\n\nact would have no possible operative effect under the law\" because\n\nthe Band is, in fact, exempt under Boudman.         Micmacs, 307 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 107.      We read this as finding that the complaint does not\n\nallege an injury-in-fact for standing purposes.             In other words,\n\n\n\n     36\n          To be fair, the Commission was not a party in Boudman.\n                                  -44-\n\feven if the Commission erroneously files an EEOC charge against the\n\nBand, such referral causes no cognizable injury.                 See generally\n\nSteir v. Girl Scouts of the USA, 383 F.3d 7, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2004)\n(summarizing Article III injury-in-fact requirement).\n\n             We disagree.    As a general rule, \"[w]hen the suit is one\n\nchallenging the legality of government action . . . [and] the\n\nplaintiff is himself an object of the action . . . . there is\n\nordinarily little question that the action . . . has caused him\n\ninjury, and that a judgment preventing . . . the action will\n\nredress it.\"    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-62\n\n(1992).       The   Band    alleges    two    specific    injuries    from   the\n\nCommission's filing of charges with the EEOC.                  First, the Band\nasserts dignitary harm: it is forced to defend itself to the EEOC\nwhen,   it   claims,   Congress       has    shielded    the   Band   from   such\n\ninvestigations entirely.       As the Band notes, if \"the desire to use\nor observe an animal species, even for purely esthetic purposes, is\nundeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing,\" id. at\n\n562-63, then repeated filing of arguably frivolous federal charges\nagainst an Indian tribe that Congress has expressly exempted from\nthe law's reach also causes a cognizable injury. Similarly, if the\n\nloss of the right to litigate in the forum of one's choice is\n\ncognizable, see Int'l Primate Prot. League v. Adm'rs of Tulane\n\nEduc. Fund, 500 U.S. 72, 77 (1991), superseded by statute on other\n\ngrounds as stated in Parker v. Della Rocco, 252 F.3d 663, 666 n.2\n\n(2d Cir. 2001), then so too is being forced to litigate in a forum\n\nwhere one is not required to appear at all.\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f            Second, the Band asserts economic harm: it must respond\n\nto the charge and pay attorneys to argue that it is exempt.                     Even\n\nassuming that       the   EEOC   immediately    agrees    with    the    Band    and\ndismisses    each    case,   repeatedly     forcing      the   Band     to   defend\n\nobviously futile Title VII complaints makes it incur financial\n\ncosts that qualify as a cognizable injury.                Cf. P.R. Aqueduct &\n\nSewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144-45 (1993)\n\n(holding that denial of motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment\n\ngrounds is immediately appealable under collateral order rule, and\n\nexplaining    that    \"the   value   to   the   States    of     their   Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity . . . is for the most part lost as litigation\n\nproceeds past motion practice\").\n             Because the Band had standing to raise Count III and that\nclaim was not rendered moot by the Commission's voluntary cessation\n\nof its conduct, the district court erred in dismissing Count III\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nB.           Count IV (Title VII Preemption)\n\n             Count IV alleges that Title VII preempts the MHRA and\nMWPA to the extent that those laws include the Band within their\nrespective definitions of \"employer.\"            The district court stated\n\nthat it \"consider[ed] the question settled as to the Maine tribes\"\n\nand cited Shannon v. Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, 54 F. Supp.\n\n2d 35, 40 (D. Me. 1999), for the proposition that the Title VII\n\nexemption does not preempt state law as to the Maliseets. Micmacs,\n\n307 F. Supp. 2d at 107; see also Fellencer, 164 F.3d at 711 n.3\n\n(the idea that \"the Title VII exemption operated to preempt state\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\flaw with respect to the Maliseet Indians . . . was clearly not\n\nintended by the [MICSA]\").37\n           However, after a brief discussion of the merits (and why\nthe rule of Shannon applies to the Band), the district court\n\nultimately concluded that \"Count IV does not raise a case or\n\ncontroversy.\"    Micmacs, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 108.      That analysis is\n\nincorrect. The fact that the Band's position might be difficult to\n\nmaintain because another district court has already answered the\n\nlegal question in the state's favor does not mean that there is no\n\ncase or controversy.    Plaintiffs are free to bring cases that fly\n\nin the face of precedent.      When they do so, however, those cases\n\nshould be resolved on the legal or factual merits, not dismissed\nfor lack of a case or controversy.           \"Courts should not . . .\nconflate   the   constitutional   standing   inquiry   with   the   merits\n\ndetermination that comes later.\" United States v. One-Sixth Share,\n\n326 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2003).38\n                                  VI.\n\n\n\n\n     37\n        While the Band arguably stands in a different legal position\nthan the Maliseets in some respects, we understand the district\ncourt to have meant that, whatever the differences between those\ntwo tribes, the impact of the Title VII exemption would be\nidentical.\n\n     38\n        Although the Band's position on this point may be foreclosed\nby Fellencer, 164 F.3d at 711 n.3, and we have the discretion to\naffirm the district court's dismissal on any basis supported by the\nrecord, Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 704 (1st Cir. 1991), we\ndecline to exercise that discretion here. Because of the district\ncourt's disposition, the Band understandably devoted its arguments\non appeal to the question of justiciability. Consequently, we will\nnot pretermit the Band's case by deciding the merits before the\ndistrict court has done so.\n                                 -47-\n\f           One might argue (though Maine did not) that, even if the\n\ndistrict   court     has   jurisdiction    over   Counts   I-IV,       it   should\n\nnevertheless abstain from exercising that jurisdiction. Under the\ndoctrine of Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S.\n\n496   (1941),    a   federal    court     may   abstain    when    a    \"federal\n\nconstitutional challenge turns on a state statute, the meaning of\n\nwhich is unclear under state law.\"         Harris County Comm'rs Court v.\n\nMoore, 420 U.S. 77, 84 (1975).           In such circumstances, a federal\n\ncourt \"should stay its hand in order to provide the state courts an\n\nopportunity to settle the underlying state-law question and thus\n\navoid the possibility of unnecessarily deciding a constitutional\n\nquestion.\"    Id. at 83.     Here, litigation in state court might lead\nto a holding that the Band is not an \"employer\" under the MHRA and\nMWPA, and thus eliminate the need to resolve the federal claims in\n\nthis case.\n             Even assuming arguendo that abstention is proper when the\n\nonly constitutional issue in the case is preemption,39 abstention\n\nis inappropriate here.         Since the principal federal issue is\nwhether the Band is subject to state law and required to submit to\nthe jurisdiction of state tribunals (whether administrative or\n\njudicial) at all, requiring the Band to first try its hand in state\n\nproceedings would be perverse.          Cf. Miller-Davis Co. v. Ill. State\n\nToll Highway Auth., 567 F.2d 323, 325-27 (7th Cir. 1977) (district\n\n\n\n     39\n        Compare, e.g., Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. City of Lodi, 302\nF.3d 928, 939 n.12 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that \"Pullman\nabstention is not appropriate when the federal question at stake is\none of federal preemption\") with Fleet Bank, N.A. v. Burke, 160\nF.3d 883, 890-93 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding the opposite).\n                                -48-\n\fcourt erred in abstaining from deciding state agency's Eleventh\n\nAmendment defense so that state court could decide whether agency\n\nhad waived immunity as a matter of state law).         For the Band to\nargue that it is not an \"employer\" under the MHRA and MWPA, it must\n\nfirst submit to the jurisdiction of the state court.           That is\n\nprecisely what it does not wish to do, and it has come to federal\n\ncourt explicitly seeking a ruling that it need not defend itself in\n\nstate court.    Since the Band has asserted a dignitary harm in being\n\nforced to defend itself before the Commission, let alone Maine\n\ncourts, abstention would be tantamount to a decision on the merits\n\nagainst the Band.\n                                  VII.\n\n          One    final   matter   remains.   Besides   the   Commission\ndefendants, the Band also sued Gardiner, Condon, and Ayoob, the\n\nformer employees who charged the Band with discrimination.          The\ncomplaint does not allege any unlawful activity by the individual\ndefendants, nor pray for relief against them.40 On appeal, the Band\n\nconcedes that it seeks no injunctive relief against the individual\ndefendants, and confines its argument to the Commission defendants.\nWe assume that the individual defendants were joined as persons\n\nneeded for just adjudication pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2),\n\nbecause they have an interest in the action and, arguably, their\n\nability to protect that interest would be impaired without their\n\nparticipation.    We express no view on this subject, but, given our\n\n\n\n     40\n        Indeed, the Ex parte Young cause of action upon which the\ncomplaint depends would not be available against the individual\ndefendants. See Penobscot Nation I, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 83 n.4.\n                                -49-\n\fdisposition of the rest of the case, vacate the dismissal of the\n\ncomplaint as against the individual defendants for reconsideration\n\non remand.41\n\n           With the exception of Count V, which the Band apparently\n\nconcedes is purely a state law claim, the Band is entitled to make\n\nits case, and receive a determination on the merits, in federal\n\ncourt.   Because it dismissed the entire action, the district court\n\ndid not consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\n\nCount V under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.        We express no view regarding\n\nwhether, on remand, it should do so, nor whether, in making that\n\ndecision, the court should consider the possibility of certifying\n\nthe state law question to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.     See\n\nMe. R. App. P. 25.\n                               VIII.\n\n           As to the individual defendants, we vacate the dismissal\n\nof all claims.   As to the Commission defendants, we reverse the\n\ndismissal of Counts I, II, III, and IV for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, vacate the dismissal of Count V, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     41\n        If the district court determines that the individual\ndefendants need not (or cannot) be joined pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 19(a), and decides again to dismiss the complaint as to them,\nthe court should also consider any timely application by those\nindividuals to intervene under Fed. R. Civ.

The Maine Human Rights Commission has investigated complaints by three former employees of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs, and asserts that it has the authority to investigate any future complaints, pursuant to Maine antidiscrimination law. The Band filed this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Commission's investigations, arguing that such investigations impermissibly encroach upon the Band's inherent tribal sovereignty, congressionally-affirmed right to self-governance without state interference, and sovereign immunity from judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. The district court concluded that the Band's complaint did not invoke a right to relief under federal law, but rather invoked affirmative federal defenses to state law actions, and therefore did not satisfy the well-pleaded complaint rule. Consequently, the court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Aroostook Band of Micmacs is a federally recognized Indian tribe. Over a four month span in 2001, the Band fired three tribal employees: Chief Financial Officer Lisa Gardiner, Compliance Officer Tammy Condon, and Housing Director Beverly Ayoob. Pursuant to internal tribal procedure, Gardiner and Condon appealed the Band's termination decisions to the Band's Tribal Council, claiming that they were terminated in retaliation for protected activities; the Tribal Council affirmed their terminations. Ayoob, who had filed a sexual harassment charge with the Tribal Council before being terminated, did not challenge her termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three ex-employees turned to the Maine Human Rights Commission, a state agency charged with \"investigating all forms of invidious discrimination.\" Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4566. Upon receipt of a private complaint of discrimination, the Commission conducts a preliminary investigation to \"determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(1)(B). The target of the investigation must cooperate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he commission ... shall have access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. The commission may issue subpoenas to compel access to or production of those materials or the appearance of those persons, ... and may serve interrogatories on a respondent to the same extent as interrogatories served in aid of a civil action in the Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> If the Commission determines that there are \"reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred,\" it first attempts to broker a conciliation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(3). If conciliation fails, the Commission may \"file in the Superior Court a civil action seeking such relief as is appropriate, including temporary restraining orders.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(4). Whether or not it does so, \"[t]he complaint and evidence collected during the investigation of the complaint... shall become a matter of public record at the conclusion of the investigation .... [and] may be used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding, civil or criminal.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(1)(B). If the Commission does not itself file a civil action &#8212; and it usually does not &#8212; the complainant may file an action herself. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4621.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2001, Gardiner and Condon filed complaints with the Commission alleging employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, as well as retaliation, under the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167;&#167; 4551-4634, and the Maine Whistleblowers' Protection Act (MWPA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 831-840. In the summer and fall of 2002, Ayoob filed two complaints alleging employment discrimination and retaliation under the MHRA and MWPA. In each case, shortly after receiving the individual's complaint, the Commission filed charges on the complainant's behalf with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Band asked the Commission to dismiss all four complaints on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the Band. The Commission refused, concluding that it had jurisdiction because the Band is subject to the MHRA, the MWPA, and, for Gardiner and Condon's complaints, Title VII. It investigated the complaints, and on at least two occasions issued document requests to the Band seeking a variety of tribal personnel documents. The Band complied with those requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2003, the Commission's investigator issued a report suggesting that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the Band had discriminated or retaliated against Gardiner or Condon. Before the full Commission could rule on the report, the Band filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against the executive director and members of the Commission (collectively, \"Maine\"), and the three individual complainants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief directing the Commission to (1) dismiss the complaints on the ground that the Band is not subject to the MHRA or MWPA, and (2) stop filing complaints against the Band with the EEOC. The complaint, as amended, pled five claims: that the enforcement of the MHRA and MWPA against the Band violates its inherent tribal sovereignty and statutorily codified right to self-governance (Count I); that the enforcement of these state laws against the Band violates its tribal sovereign immunity (Count II);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that the Band is exempt from Title VII (Count III); that the Band's exemption from Title VII preempts state antidiscrimination law, and so, regardless of what the MHRA and MWPA say, the Band is not subject to them (Count IV); and that, even under the MHRA and MWPA's own terms, the Band is not an \"employer\" (Count V).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the complaint was filed, the Commission determined that, contrary to its investigator's initial report, there <i>were</i> reasonable grounds to believe that Gardiner and Condon had been retaliated against based on protected conduct. Meanwhile, Gardiner and Condon filed suit against the Band in Aroostook County Superior Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> That court stayed the action pending the outcome of the federal litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal court, the parties consented to adjudication by a United States Magistrate Judge, and cross-moved for summary judgment. Although both parties addressed the merits of the Band's claims, Maine also argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In February 2004, the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. <i>See Aroostook Band of Micmacs v. Exec. Dir. Me. Human Rights Comm'n,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d 95, 96 (D.Me.2004) (\"<i>Micmacs</i>\"). Specifically, the district court concluded that Counts I and II did not raise questions \"arising under\" federal law as required by the applicable jurisdictional statutes, and that Counts III and IV did not allege a justiciable case or controversy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Consequently, the court dismissed the entire action. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (court must dismiss action upon determining, at any point, that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction).

The Band's relationship with the state is particularly complex. We provide a brief summary of the recent history of that relationship, and include some background concerning three other Maine tribes, to set the stage for the legal analysis that follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The 1980 Legislation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970s, two tribes &#8212; the Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe &#8212; filed suit claiming much of Maine as their ancestral homelands. <i>See generally Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer,</i> 164 F.3d 706, 707-08 (1st Cir.1999) (recounting history). Neither tribe was federally recognized at that point. The Aroostook Band of Micmacs was not represented by counsel at the time and was not a party to the litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1980, with the aid of the United States, the Penobscots and the Passamaquoddy reached a compromise with Maine. A third tribe, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, which had not filed suit but was represented by counsel and had a potential claim, was later included in the compromise. <i>See</i> S.Rep. No. 101-291 (1990). The resulting settlement was embodied in the Maine Implementing Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167;&#167; 6201-14; <i>see also</i> 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1721(a)(8) (\"The State of Maine, with the agreement of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, has enacted legislation defining the relationship between the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and their members, and the State of Maine.\"); <i>Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians v.

The Penobscots and the Passamaquoddy obtained territory and all the governmental rights and powers of municipalities within Maine. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 6205, 6206, 6211. By contrast, the Maliseets received only land held in trust for them by the United States, and no municipal powers. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 6205-A, 6206-A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In exchange for what the tribes received, and \"partly as a result of the Tribes' disputed status, the State of Maine, as part of the settlement, obtained legal authority over the Tribes exceeding the usual state authority over native American tribes.\" <i>Penobscot Nation v.

Instead, the Act subjected the Maliseets to Maine law to a greater degree than the Penobscots or the Passamaquoddy. The Maliseets were subject to a default clause applicable to all Indian tribes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as otherwise provided in this Act, all Indians, Indian nations, and tribes and bands of Indians in the State ... shall be subject to the laws of the State and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other person or lands or other natural resources therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.Rev.Stat.

By contrast, the Maliseets received no such privilege. Rather, the Act emphasized that \"[t]he Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and its lands will be wholly subject to the laws of the State.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 6202.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress ratified the settlement through the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act (\"MICSA\"), 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1721-1735.

The Micmac Legislation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the years following the passage of MICSA, the Band, through counsel, raised its own claims with the state of Maine. In 1989, Maine and the Band reached a settlement that was memorialized in the Micmac Settlement Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167;&#167; 7201-7207. The Act generally accorded the Band the same status as the Maliseets, not the greater powers and autonomy enjoyed by the Penobscots and the Passamaquoddy. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 7203 (subjecting Band to state laws and court jurisdiction without exception), 7204 (land to be held in trust by United States), 7205 (no municipal powers for Band).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, at the behest of both Maine and the Band, Congress enacted the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act (\"Federal Micmac Settlement Act\"), Pub.L. No. 102-171, 105 Stat. 1143 (codified at 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1721 note). The Federal Micmac Settlement Act explained that \"[t]he Band was not referred to in [MICSA] because historical documentation of the Micmac presence in Maine was not available at that time.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(2), 105 Stat. at 1143. Now that such documentation was available, Congress found that \"[t]he Aroostook Band of Micmacs, in both its history and its presence in Maine, is similar to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and would have received similar treatment under [MICSA] if the information available today had been available to Congress and the parties at that time.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(4). Consequently, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act aimed to \"afford the Aroostook Band of Micmacs the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims, to the extent [the Micmacs] would have benefited from inclusion in [MICSA].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(5). On this basis, Congress \"ratif[ied] the [state] Micmac Settlement Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(b)(4), 105 Stat. at 1144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three provisions of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act are relevant here. First, the Act provides for self-governance: \"The Band may organize for its common welfare and adopt an appropriate instrument in writing to govern the affairs of the Band when acting in its governmental capacity.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7(a), 105 Stat. at 1148.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, despite Congress's stated desire to provide the Band with \"the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(5), 105 Stat. at 1143, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act does not explicitly subject the Band to Maine law.

After all, we have identified a federal cause of action that will qualify for &#167; 1331 jurisdiction; the only remaining question is whether the Band's complaint properly pleads such an action. However, Maine argues that the principles established in a different line of cases require dismissal. We explain below why Maine's arguments fail. In doing so, we emphasize two fundamental principles. First, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the <i>plaintiff's complaint</i> is the document in which the federal claim must appear, regardless of whether that complaint was filed in federal court pursuant to &#167; 1331, or filed in state court and then removed to federal court pursuant to &#167; 1441. Second, by definition, an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action can only be brought <i>against state officer defendants;</i> the Supremacy Clause implies no right of action against private parties, or <i>by</i> state officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By focusing on these points, we can make some sense out of the array of cases invoked by Maine in support of its argument that the Band's complaint runs afoul of the well-pleaded complaint rule. The cases upon which Maine relies &#8212; wherein federal jurisdiction was lacking &#8212; are, quite simply, not <i>Ex parte Young</i> cases. These cases fall into three groups: cases where state officers were not parties at all; cases where state officers were plaintiffs, not defendants; and cases where state officers were defendants, but there was some other serious flaw in the complaint such that <i>Ex parte Young</i> was not properly pled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. State officers not parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of the cases on which Maine relies did not even involve state officers &#8212; they were between private parties, or between a tribe and a private party. <i>See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 667, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950) (private party v. private party); <i>TTEA v. Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo,</i> 181 F.3d 676 (5th Cir.1999) (private party v. tribe); <i>Colonial Penn Group, Inc. v. Colonial Deposit Co.,</i> 834 F.2d 229 (1st Cir.1987) (private party v. private party). In such cases, the <i>Ex parte Young</i> cause of action is not available. Therefore, the private plaintiffs' only federal cause of action in those cases was the Declaratory Judgment Act itself. In such cases, \"[w]hatever federal claim [plaintiff] may be able to urge would in any event be injected into the case only in anticipation of a defense to be asserted by [defendants],\" and the Declaratory Judgment Act does not provide an independent basis for jurisdiction. <i>Skelly Oil,</i> 339 U.S. at 672, 70 S.Ct. 876.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State officers were also absent from <i>Penobscot Nation I/II,</i> the primary case upon which the district court relied in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 98-101. That was a suit by a tribe against a private party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Indeed, the district court recognized in that case that \"[i]f the Tribes were seeking to enjoin state officials, federal jurisdiction would exist, but ... where, as here, private parties are defendants,\" <i>Ex parte Young</i> analysis does not apply. <i>Penobscot Nation I,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d at 83 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, where state officers are not even parties &#8212; let alone defendants &#8212; the <i>Ex parte Young</i> cause of action is unavailable. That is the context in which we stated that the well-pleaded complaint rule \"cannot be avoided by having the beneficiary of the [federal] defense assert the defense preemptively in a claim for declaratory or injunctive relief.\" <i>Penobscot Nation II,</i> 254 F.3d at 321. Consequently, <i>Penobscot Nation I/II</i> &#8212; which Maine describes as \"much like this case\" &#8212; is in fact completely unlike this case for jurisdictional purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. State officers as plaintiffs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second class of cases, state officers sue a private party in state court and the defendant removes to federal court. <i>See Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Graham,</i> 489 U.S. 838, 109 S.Ct. 1519, 103 L.Ed.2d 924 (1989) (per curiam) (state agency v. tribe in state court);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust,</i> 463 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983) (<i>state agency v. private party in state court</i>).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> For jurisdictional purposes, two problems confront such defendants: first, by definition, the action is not an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action, since it has been brought <i>by</i> state officers, not <i>against</i> them; second, it is the state plaintiff's complaint, not the defendant's answer or motion to dismiss, that is analyzed under the well-pleaded complaint rule. In <i>Graham</i> and <i>Franchise Tax Board,</i> the state's complaint pled only state claims, and hence there was no jurisdiction under &#167; 1331. Such removal cases have no bearing on an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, for <i>Ex parte Young</i> purposes, this class of cases is formally identical to the previous class: the defendant is not a state officer. We have described it separately, however, because of a curious asymmetry. If a private party files an action <i>against</i> state officers alleging that their enforcement of state law violates the private party's federal rights, that is an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action and &#167; 1331 jurisdiction is available. But if the state officers file an action in state court to enforce that very state law, and the private party seeks to remove to federal court on the basis of the same preemption argument, that is not an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action, and there is usually no federal jurisdiction (unless there is some other basis for jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This asymmetry is, however, a virtually inevitable consequence of the fact that, even though an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action is in some ways the mirror image of state prosecution, &#167; 1331 jurisdiction is determined from the complaint alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> In the first example &#8212; where the private party files an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action in federal court &#8212; the federal court looks at the plaintiff's complaint and sees a federal cause of action. In the second example &#8212; where the state files a state law action in state court and the private party removes &#8212; the federal court looks at the plaintiff's complaint and sees only state law issues. While this asymmetry may yield odd results or incentives to race to the courthouse, it is a logical consequence of the well-pleaded complaint rule itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Some other defect precludes <i>Ex parte Young</i> jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the third class of cases, the parties are properly aligned for an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action &#8212; the defendants are state officers &#8212; but some other defect precludes <i>Ex parte Young</i> jurisdiction. The leading example of this class is <i>Public Service Commission v. Wycoff Co.,</i> 344 U.S. 237, 248, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> A widely-cited dictum in that case stated that federal jurisdiction does not extend to declaratory judgment actions that assert federal defenses to state claims. <i>See id.</i> at 248, 73 S.Ct. 236; <i>see also Franchise Tax Bd.,</i> 463 U.S. at 16, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (quoting <i>Wycoff</i>). But, as the Court made clear, the flaw in <i>Wycoff</i> was that, while the complaint sought to resolve a disputed question of federal law, it did not actually assert any federal rights or violations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complainant in this case does not request an adjudication that it has a right to do, or to have, anything in particular. It does not ask a judgment that the Commission is without power to enter any specific order or take any concrete regulatory step. It seeks simply to establish that, as presently conducted, [plaintiff]'s carriage of goods between points within as well as without Utah is all interstate commerce. One naturally asks, so what? To that ultimate question no answer is sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 244, 73 S.Ct. 236. The Court held that the complaint did not state a claim for relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, and was unripe in any event. <i>Id.</i> at 243-47, 73 S.Ct. 236. Consequently, it was \"not necessary to determine whether ... the alleged controversy over an action that may be begun in state court would be maintainable under the head of federal-question jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 248-49, 73 S.Ct. 236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The oddly deficient complaint in <i>Wycoff</i> might be <i>sui generis</i> among published appellate cases. Indeed, we have found no case in which we applied the <i>Wycoff</i> dictum to a case in the posture of <i>Wycoff</i> itself &#8212; i.e., no case in which we applied <i>Wycoff</i> to an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action and found jurisdiction lacking. At any rate, the flaw in <i>Wycoff</i> is not present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's reliance on the well-pleaded complaint rule, when reduced to its essentials, is misguided. The Band seeks injunctive and declaratory relief <i>against the Commission and its officers</i> for purportedly violating its federal rights. Assuming that other requirements of <i>Ex parte Young</i> are satisfied &#8212; e.g., that there is a colorable claim of a federal right &#8212; these claims qualify for \"arising under\" jurisdiction under the well-pleaded complaint rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Band's arguments could arise as defenses in a state court action. But a properly framed federal cause of action does not fall outside &#167; 1331 simply because it could <i>also</i> arise as an affirmative federal defense in state court. \"[F]ederal jurisdiction is absent where the federal issue would arise <i>only</i> as a defense to a state cause of action.\" <i>Penobscot Nation II,</i> 254 F.3d at 321 (emphasis added). Just because a federal issue <i>could</i> arise as a defense to a state law action does not mean that the federal issue can <i>only</i> arise as a defense to a state law action. In fact, the federal claims in most <i>Ex parte Young</i> actions could be raised as affirmative defenses to state court actions. But an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action &#8212; \"though ultimately `defensive' in the sense that it seeks to prevent harms threatened by state officials &#8212; <i>does</i> constitute a federal question under &#167; 1331.\" <i>Local Union No. 12004,</i> 377 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>Penobscot Nation I/II,</i> the district court in this case &#8212; which did not have the benefit of our <i>Local Union No. 12004</i> decision &#8212; decided that it \"must look at the individual defendants' MHRA and MWPA complaints as they are tendered in the state court\"; hypothesized how those complaints might \"play[ ] out\"; and imagined how, in potential state court proceedings, the Band might \"answer[ ] and assert[] as affirmative defenses the contents of their three (non-Title VII) counts in this declaratory action.\" <i>Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 101. It then concluded that the Band's claims could be raised as affirmative defenses, and hence were not part of a well-pleaded federal complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Verizon Maryland</i> and <i>Local Union 12004</i> make clear, that is not the correct analysis. The question is not whether the allegedly federal claims <i>could</i> be raised as affirmative defenses to a state action, but rather whether they could <i>only</i> be so raised. With an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action, that is clearly not the case. Such an action rests, at bottom, on the implied federal right of action created by the Supremacy Clause. That implied right of action, when properly pled, supplies the basis for \"arising under\" jurisdiction under &#167; 1331. The question here is whether the complaint properly pleads such a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

A tribe's power to \"maintain or establish its own form of government.... is the first element of sovereignty.\" <i>Handbook of Federal Indian Law, supra,</i> at 247.

Conceptually, inherent tribal sovereignty is a doctrine of federal common law. <i>See Lara,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1637.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> The Supremacy Clause applies to federal common law no less than federal statutes. <i>See Wilburn Boat Co. v.

Consequently, tribal sovereignty may preempt contrary state law under the Supremacy Clause. \"State jurisdiction is pre-empted by the operation of federal law if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law, unless the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority.\" <i>Mescalero Apache Tribe,</i> 462 U.S. at 334, 103 S.Ct. 2378.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, inherent tribal sovereignty is a federal common law right that preempts contrary state law, and is therefore a proper basis for an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Statutory right to self-governance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to inherent sovereignty, the Band also asserts a statutory right to self-governance codified in Section 7(a) of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> The Band further notes that, while MICSA required the governing instruments of the Penobscots, Passamaquoddy, and Maliseets to be \"consistent with the terms of [MICSA] and the Maine Implementing Act,\" the Federal Micmac Settlement Act requires only that the Band's governing instrument be consistent with the terms of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act itself. <i>Compare id. with</i> 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1726(a). And the Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#8212; again unlike MICSA &#8212; does not explicitly subject the Band to Maine law. <i>See supra</i> Part II.B. Finally, the Band argues, while MICSA admittedly makes \"all Indians, Indian nations, or tribes or bands of Indians in the State of Maine, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe [and] the Penobscot Nation ... subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State, the laws of the State, and the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State, to the same extent as any other person ... therein,\" 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(a), the Federal Micmac Settlement Act explicitly states that it controls in case of a conflict with the Maine Implementing Act, MICSA, or the State Micmac Settlement Act. <i>See</i> Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#167; 11, 105 Stat. at 1148.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint anticipates the state's response &#8212; that the Federal Micmac Settlement Act ratified the State Micmac Settlement Act, which <i>did</i> make the Band \"subject to the laws of the State and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other person... therein,\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167; 7203 &#8212; and attempts to neutralize it in two ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Band contends that only Congress can make a tribe subject to state law. Congress did not do so in the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, and in fact it specified that the federal Act controls in the event of a conflict with the state Act. <i>See</i> Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#167; 11, 105 Stat. at 1148.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Band contends that the entire State Micmac Settlement Act never took effect. A provision of that Act provided that \"[t]his Act shall be effective only if ... [w]ithin 60 days of adjournment of the Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification by the Council of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs that the band has agreed to this Act.\" 1989 Me. Laws 149, &#167; 4(2). That did not happen &#8212; the Band never formally certified that it agreed to the State Micmac Settlement Act as required by the Act's terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Thus, the Band argues, the State Micmac Settlement Act &#8212; which made the Band subject to the laws of Maine &#8212; never took effect, and is null and void. Consequently, the federal Act, which purported to ratify the state Act, could not do so, because Congress simply cannot ratify a non-existent state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Band continues, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act <i>did</i> implicitly repeal the earlier state and federal legislation &#8212; the Maine Implementing Act and MICSA &#8212; to the extent that they applied to the Band.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> Thus, in the Band's view, federal common law and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act are the only applicable law determining the scope of the Band's right to self-governance, and neither subjects the Band to state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the complex argument concerning the validity of the State Micmac Settlement Act, \"[w]hether a case is one arising under [federal law], in the sense of the jurisdictional statute,... must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim ..., unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.\" <i>Graham,</i> 489 U.S. at 840, 109 S.Ct. 1519 (quoting <i>Taylor v. Anderson,</i> 234 U.S. 74, 75-76, 34 S.Ct. 724, 58 L.Ed. 1218 (1914)) (second and third alterations in original). The Band alleges that it holds a federal right, deriving from Section 7(a) of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, to self-governance without state interference, and that this right preempts contrary state law. This is a proper basis for an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Imminence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's principal response is that, even if a violation of a federal right is alleged, <i>Ex parte Young</i> jurisdiction is not satisfied because here there is no actual or threatened enforcement action by state officials. <i>See Morales v. TWA,</i> 504 U.S. 374, 382, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) (\"In [<i>Ex parte Young</i>] suits such as this one, which the plaintiff intends as a `first strike' to prevent a State from initiating a suit of its own, <i>the prospect of state suit must be imminent,</i> for it is the prospect of that suit which supplies the necessary irreparable injury.\") (emphasis added); <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. at 155-56, 28 S.Ct. 441 (\"[I]ndividuals who, as officers of the state, are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the state, and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings ... to enforce [,] against parties affected[,] an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a Federal court of equity from such action.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized an imminence requirement in <i>Ex parte Young</i> actions, though the extent to which it is <i>jurisdictional</i> (rather than just a substantive element of the action or a limit on equitable discretion) may be subject to debate. <i>See N.H. Hemp Council, Inc. v. Marshall,</i> 203 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2000) (in an action to enjoin criminal prosecution, describing the imminence requirement as \"often referred to as a standing requirement\" but \"probably more complex in character, involving as well concerns about ripeness and the exercise of equitable discretion\"); <i>accord Nat'l Audubon Soc'y, Inc. v. Davis,</i> 307 F.3d 835, 847 (9th Cir.2002) (\"We decline to read additional `ripeness' or `imminence' requirements into the <i>Ex Parte Young</i> exception ... beyond those already imposed by a general Article III and prudential ripeness analysis.\"), <i>opinion amended on other grounds on denial of reh'g,</i> 312 F.3d 416 (9th Cir.2002). Indeed, in <i>Morales</i> the lack of \"imminence\" did not divest the district court of jurisdiction; it simply meant that the court should have issued a narrower injunction. 504 U.S. at 381-83, 112 S.Ct. 2031. But we need not resolve here the question of whether \"imminence\" is purely a merits question or also required for jurisdiction, because the Band has adequately alleged a threat of enforcement which would satisfy any jurisdictional requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in Maine's analysis is its assumption that only court proceedings constitute \" enforcement,\" ignoring the threats to tribal sovereignty, self-governance, and sovereign immunity posed by the investigations themselves. Twice in recent years we have found jurisdiction over actions to enjoin state discrimination investigations. <i>See Local Union No. 12004,</i> 377 F.3d at 70-71, 75 (court had jurisdiction over <i>Ex parte Young</i> action to enjoin proceedings of Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\") on the grounds that state law was preempted by National Labor Relations Act); <i>Chaulk Servs., Inc. v. Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination,</i> 70 F.3d 1361, 1364, 1371 (1st Cir.1995) (same, where MCAD's only activity so far had been issuing interrogatories). Similar logic applies here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that the target of an investigation yields to the agency's demands and \"cooperates\" to some degree does not rob the investigation of its coercive power. <i>See, e.g., Major League Baseball v. Butterworth,</i> 181 F.Supp.2d 1316, 1321 n. 2 (N.D.Fla.2001) (enjoining \"civil investigative demand\" (\"CID\") for answers to interrogatories and document production, and noting that \"[f]ar from part of a legal proceeding, a CID may be issued only <i>before</i> a legal proceeding is filed.... Moreover, it seems likely that the vast majority of CIDs result merely in compliance, with no court proceeding ever filed by anyone, unless the investigation leads to the filing of an enforcement action, which may or may not occur.\"), <i>aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Major League Baseball v. Crist,</i> 331 F.3d 1177 (11th Cir.2003). The target has a right to challenge the investigation itself in federal court, and this right is not forfeited by compliance with the investigative demands:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recipients of the CIDs had several options available, but only one option could yield the desired result. The most obvious option would have been to comply with the terms of the CIDs. But this option was unattractive because the CIDs were burdensome, and the recipients believed that the federal exemption gave them a \"federal right\" to be free not only from antitrust <i>prosecution,</i> but also from this <i>investigation.</i> Second, the recipients of the CIDs could have filed suit in state court.... This option was similarly unattractive because [of unfavorable and probably incorrect state law]. This left option three: an action in federal court, the present lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Crist,</i> 331 F.3d at 1180-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Band had essentially the same choices. By statute, the Maine Commission has the right of \"access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation.\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4612(1)(B). In light of this broad authority, the fact that the Commission did not need to exercise its subpoena power \"to compel access to or production of those materials or the appearance of those persons,\" <i>id.,</i> may simply mean that the Band decided to first comply with state law, and <i>then</i> challenge its applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An Indian tribe that is unlawfully called to answer before a state agency may suffer both practical harms and intrusions upon its sovereignty. As a practical matter, the Band asserts, \"[i]nvestigations, interrogatories, and discovery divert the Micmac government from other pressing official matters and consume scarce resources .... includ[ing] the expense of legal consultation during the Commission's investigations and discovery.\" <i>Cf. Petroleum Exploration v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> 304 U.S. 209, 215-16, 58 S.Ct. 834, 82 L.Ed. 1294 (1938) (jurisdictional amount-in-controversy minimum was met by the \"necessary expense of producing the information demanded by the order,\" which was \"not collateral or incidental to the purpose of the injunction, but a threatened expense from which relief is sought\"). As a more symbolic matter, simply being called to appear and defend its internal employment practices before a state agency may be an insult to a tribe's sovereignty and right to self-governance. <i>Cf. Bishop Paiute Tribe v. County of Inyo,</i> 275 F.3d 893, 902 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that execution of warrant against tribe to obtain employee records violated tribal immunity because \"at issue is not just the Tribe's right to protect the confidentiality of its employee records, but the more fundamental right of the Tribe not to have its policies undermined by the states and their political subdivisions\"), <i>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Inyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone Indians,</i> 538 U.S. 701, 123 S.Ct. 1887, 155 L.Ed.2d 933 (2003); <i>cf. Fed. Mar. Comm'n v. S.C. State Ports Auth.,</i> 535 U.S. 743, 760-761, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (forcing a state to submit to adjudication before a federal administrative agency is an \"affront to a State's dignity\" because the \"State is required to defend itself in an adversarial proceeding\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> Sometimes, Congress requires a tribe to submit to such invasions. We do not comment on whether Congress has done so here &#8212; only that the Band may argue its case in a federal forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For &#167; 1331 purposes, Count I adequately alleges that, pursuant to federal common law and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, the Band possesses both inherent tribal sovereignty and a statutory right to self-governance, and that the enforcement of state law against the Band violates these rights. Consequently, the district court erred in dismissing Count I for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Count II (Tribal Sovereign Immunity)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count II alleges that, as a matter of federal law, the Band's tribal sovereign immunity bars the enforcement of state law against it. The difference between the rights asserted in Count I and the tribal sovereign immunity asserted in Count II is subtle but important. The Band's alleged rights to self-governance and tribal sovereignty mean, in essence, that it is not subject to state laws (at least those that purport to regulate the internal governance affairs of the Band itself) <i>at all.</i> By contrast, tribal sovereign immunity means that the Band is not amenable to <i>state judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings</i> to enforce those laws. <i>See</i> Kaighn Smith, Jr., <i>Federal Courts, State Power, and Indian Tribes: Confronting the Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule,</i> 35 N.M. L.Rev. ___, ___ (24-26) (forthcoming 2005) (contrasting doctrines of infringement of tribal sovereignty versus tribal sovereign immunity). In short, we read Count I to allege that the Band is not subject to the MHRA and MWPA, and Count II to allege that, even if the Band is subject to those acts, it is not subject to the power of any Maine tribunal to investigate and enforce those laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"As a matter of federal law, an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.\" <i>Kiowa Tribe v. Mfg. Techs., Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 751, 754, 118 S.Ct. 1700, 140 L.Ed.2d 981 (1998); <i>Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez,</i> 436 U.S. 49, 58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978). This immunity applies in state proceedings as well as federal proceedings. <i>Kiowa Tribe,</i> 523 U.S. at 755, 118 S.Ct. 1700. The Band has filed a suit to enjoin state officials from interfering with its alleged federal right of tribal sovereign immunity. Such an action would appear to satisfy the requirements of <i>Verizon Maryland</i> and <i>Local Union No. 12004. See Kiowa Indian Tribe v. Hoover,</i> 150 F.3d 1163, 1171-72 (10th Cir.1998) (reversing district court's denial of tribe's motion for preliminary injunction against enforcement of state court judgments on the grounds of tribal sovereign immunity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine argues, however, that tribal sovereign immunity cannot be asserted in an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action. Its principal authority for this argument is <i>Graham,</i> in which the Supreme Court held that a tribe, sued in state court by the state, may not <i>remove</i> to federal court on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity because \"a federal immunity to the claims asserted does not convert a suit otherwise arising under state law into one which, in the statutory sense, arises under federal law.\" 489 U.S. at 841, 109 S.Ct. 1519. In Maine's view, <i>Graham</i> stands for the proposition that \"a tribal sovereign immunity defense ... cannot form the basis of `arising under' jurisdiction.\" But Maine fails to recognize that Count II pleads a tribal sovereignty <i>offense.</i> As described above, there is a crucial difference between removal of a state claim and an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action. <i>See supra</i> Part IV.A.2. The well-pleaded complaint rule applies to the plaintiff's complaint, regardless of whether it was filed in state court or federal court. <i>See Rossello-Gonzalez,</i> 398 F.3d at 10 (applying rule to complaint filed in state court). The well-pleaded complaint in <i>Graham</i> contained an Oklahoma law tax claim; the well-pleaded complaint here contains a claim under a federal cause of action asserting a federal common law right. <i>Graham</i> addressed whether a defendant may <i>remove</i> on the basis of a tribal sovereign immunity defense; it simply does not apply where a plaintiff pleads an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action on the basis of the federal right of tribal sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, a key flaw in Maine's analysis is its assumption that tribal sovereign immunity is only a defense to a <i>lawsuit,</i> and since the Commission has not filed (or threatened to file) suit against the Band, considerations of tribal sovereign immunity are premature. But tribal sovereign immunity might apply to the Commission's investigations themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> We do not hold that tribal sovereign immunity applies to such proceedings, nor even that the Band actually retains tribal sovereign immunity in light of MICSA and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act. <i>See supra</i> note 19. We simply conclude that the Band's claim of tribal sovereign immunity presents a \"colorable\" claim of a federal cause of action under <i>Ex parte Young.</i> Consequently, the district court erred in dismissing Count II for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts III and IV relate to a provision in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stating that Indian tribes are not \"employers\" under Title VII. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(b). Count III seeks a declaration that the Band is not subject to Title VII, and an injunction against the Commission from applying Title VII to the Band and filing charges against the Band with the federal EEOC. Count IV alleges that the Title VII exemption preempts contrary state law, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that the Commission may not apply the MHRA and MWPA against the Band. In other words, Count III claims that the Band is exempt from Title VII, while Count IV says that <i>because</i> the Band is exempt from Title VII, it must be exempt, as a matter of federal law, from the MHRA and MWPA too. The district court dismissed both counts on the grounds that they did not pose justiciable cases or controversies. <i>See Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 106-08. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Count III (Title VII Exemption)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until recently, Commission staff would apparently, as a matter of course under the agencies'\"dual filing\" procedure,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> automatically file EEOC complaints against the Band on behalf of Commission complainants and let the EEOC decide whether Title VII applied. This practice has apparently stopped, and the Commission admitted in its answer that Title VII does not apply to the Band. <i>Cf. Fellencer,</i> 164 F.3d at 712 (Title VII exemption applies to Penobscot Nation); <i>Boudman v. Aroostook Band of Micmac Indians,</i> 54 F.Supp.2d 44, 48-49 (D.Me.1999) (same for the Band). The Commission's current position is that it \"does not file discrimination charges against tribes with the EEOC unless the [Commission] has some reason for believing that Title VII might somehow apply.\" Maine argues that there is no justiciable case or controversy because there is no dispute: all parties agree that the Band is exempt from Title VII, and hence there is nothing for a court to resolve. The district court apparently agreed. <i>See Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 107. While the district court did not identify which branch of case or controversy doctrine supported its ruling, we understand it to have meant the dispute was moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispute is not moot because nothing prevents the Commission from resuming its former practice. \"[V]oluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct ... does not make the case moot.\" <i>United States v. W.T. Grant Co.,</i> 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). The reason is simple: \"The defendant is free to return to his old ways.\" <i>Id.</i> Voluntary cessation will only moot a dispute when \"(1) it can be said with assurance that `there is no reasonable expectation...' that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.\" <i>Los Angeles County v. Davis,</i> 440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979) (citations omitted; alteration in original). The defendant's burden of establishing mootness \"is a heavy one,\" <i>W.T. Grant,</i> 345 U.S. at 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, and it must be \"absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\" <i>United States v.

First, the record indicates that the Commission referred four different complaints to the EEOC after the United States District Court for the District of Maine held in <i>Boudman</i> that the Band is exempt from Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> Second, even the Commission's concession is qualified. It reserves the right to file EEOC charges against the Band if it \"has some reason for believing that Title VII might somehow apply.\" For these reasons, the Commission has not adequately demonstrated that its voluntary cessation is permanent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court advanced a second reason why Count III does not present a case or controversy: Even if the Commission were still referring charges against the Band to the EEOC, \"such act would have no possible operative effect under the law\" because the Band is, in fact, exempt under <i>Boudman. Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 107. We read this as finding that the complaint does not allege an injury-in-fact for standing purposes. In other words, even if the Commission erroneously files an EEOC charge against the Band, such referral causes no cognizable injury. <i>See generally Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA,</i> 383 F.3d 7, 14-15 (1st Cir.2004) (summarizing Article III injury-in-fact requirement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. As a general rule, \"[w]hen the suit is one challenging the legality of government action ... [and] the plaintiff is himself an object of the action .... there is ordinarily little question that the action ... has caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing ... the action will redress it.\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 561-62, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). The Band alleges two specific injuries from the Commission's filing of charges with the EEOC. First, the Band asserts dignitary harm: it is forced to defend itself to the EEOC when, it claims, Congress has shielded the Band from such investigations entirely. As the Band notes, if \"the desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing,\" <i>id.</i> at 562-63, 112 S.Ct. 2130, then repeated filing of arguably frivolous federal charges against an Indian tribe that Congress has expressly exempted from the law's reach also causes a cognizable injury. Similarly, if the loss of the right to litigate in the forum of one's choice is cognizable, <i>see Int'l Primate Prot. League v. Adm'rs of Tulane Educ. Fund,</i> 500 U.S. 72, 77, 111 S.Ct. 1700, 114 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991), <i>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Parker v. Della Rocco,</i> 252 F.3d 663, 666 n. 2 (2d Cir.2001), then so too is being forced to litigate in a forum where one is not required to appear at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Band asserts economic harm: it must respond to the charge and pay attorneys to argue that it is exempt. Even assuming that the EEOC immediately agrees with the Band and dismisses each case, repeatedly forcing the Band to defend obviously futile Title VII complaints makes it incur financial costs that qualify as a cognizable injury. <i>Cf. P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 144-45, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (holding that denial of motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment grounds is immediately appealable under collateral order rule, and explaining that \"the value to the States of their Eleventh Amendment immunity ... is for the most part lost as litigation proceeds past motion practice\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Band had standing to raise Count III and that claim was not rendered moot by the Commission's voluntary cessation of its conduct, the district court erred in dismissing Count III for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Count IV (Title VII Preemption)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count IV alleges that Title VII preempts the MHRA and MWPA to the extent that those laws include the Band within their respective definitions of \"employer.\" The district court stated that it \"consider[ed] the question settled as to the Maine tribes\" and cited <i>Shannon v. Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians,</i> 54 F.Supp.2d 35, 40 (D.Me.1999), for the proposition that the Title VII exemption does not preempt state law as to the Maliseets. <i>Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 107; <i>see also Fellencer,</i> 164 F.3d at 711 n. 3 (the idea that \"the Title VII exemption operated to preempt state law <i>with respect to the Maliseet Indians</i> ... was clearly not intended by the [MICSA]\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, after a brief discussion of the merits (and why the rule of <i>Shannon</i> applies to the Band), the district court ultimately concluded that \"Count IV does not raise a case or controversy.\" <i>Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 108. That analysis is incorrect. The fact that the Band's position might be difficult to maintain because another district court has already answered the legal question in the state's favor does not mean that there is no case or controversy. Plaintiffs are free to bring cases that fly in the face of precedent. When they do so, however, those cases should be resolved on the legal or factual merits, not dismissed for lack of a case or controversy. \"Courts should not ... conflate the constitutional standing inquiry with the merits determination that comes later.\" <i>United States v. One-Sixth Share,</i> 326 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might argue (though Maine did not) that, even if the district court has jurisdiction over Counts I-IV, it should nevertheless abstain from exercising that jurisdiction. Under the doctrine of <i>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co.,</i> 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), a federal court may abstain when a \"federal constitutional challenge turns on a state statute, the meaning of which is unclear under state law.\" <i>Harris County Comm'rs Court v. Moore,</i> 420 U.S. 77, 84, 95 S.Ct. 870, 43 L.Ed.2d 32 (1975). In such circumstances, a federal court \"should stay its hand in order to provide the state courts an opportunity to settle the underlying state-law question and thus avoid the possibility of unnecessarily deciding a constitutional question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83, 95 S.Ct. 870. Here, litigation in state court might lead to a holding that the Band is not an \"employer\" under the MHRA and MWPA, and thus eliminate the need to resolve the federal claims in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that abstention is proper when the only constitutional issue in the case is preemption,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> abstention is inappropriate here. Since the principal federal issue is whether the Band is subject to state law and required to submit to the jurisdiction of state tribunals (whether administrative or judicial) <i>at all,</i> requiring the Band to first try its hand in state proceedings would be perverse. <i>Cf. Miller-Davis Co. v. Ill. State Toll Highway Auth.,</i> 567 F.2d 323, 325-27 (7th Cir.1977) (district court erred in abstaining from deciding state agency's Eleventh Amendment defense so that state court could decide whether agency had waived immunity as a matter of state law). For the Band to argue that it is not an \"employer\" under the MHRA and MWPA, it must first submit to the jurisdiction of the state court. That is precisely what it does not wish to do, and it has come to federal court explicitly seeking a ruling that it need <i>not</i> defend itself in state court. Since the Band has asserted a dignitary harm in being forced to defend itself before the Commission, let alone Maine courts, abstention would be tantamount to a decision on the merits against the Band.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final matter remains. Besides the Commission defendants, the Band also sued Gardiner, Condon, and Ayoob, the former employees who charged the Band with discrimination. The complaint does not allege any unlawful activity by the individual defendants, nor pray for relief against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> On appeal, the Band concedes that it seeks no injunctive relief against the individual defendants, and confines its argument to the Commission defendants. We assume that the individual defendants were joined as persons needed for just adjudication pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2), because they have an interest in the action and, arguably, their ability to protect that interest would be impaired without their participation. We express no view on this subject, but, given our disposition of the rest of the case, vacate the dismissal of the complaint as against the individual defendants for reconsideration on remand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the exception of Count V, which the Band apparently concedes is purely a state law claim, the Band is entitled to make its case, and receive a determination on the merits, in federal court. Because it dismissed the entire action, the district court did not consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Count V under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367. We express no view regarding whether, on remand, it should do so, nor whether, in making that decision, the court should consider the possibility of certifying the state law question to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. <i>See</i> Me.

Although we explain the differences between these below in detail,<i>see infra</i> Parts IV.B-C, we provide thumbnail definitions here. Tribal <i>sovereignty</i> is a common law doctrine recognizing tribes' inherent powers to self-govern, including the power to determine the structure and internal operations of the governing body itself, and exempting tribes from state law that would otherwise infringe upon this sovereignty. Tribal <i>sovereign immunity</i> is a common law doctrine providing that tribes are immune from lawsuits or quasi-judicial proceedings without their consent or Congressional waiver. Finally, the Band claims a statutory right to <i>self-governance</i> deriving from Section 7(a) of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, which provides that the Band \"may organize for its common welfare and ... act[ ] in its governmental capacity.\" 105 Stat. at 1148. According to the Band, this provision reaffirms and codifies the common law doctrine of tribal sovereignty as it applies to the Band.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Again, the merits are not relevant here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At that point, the Commission had not yet made a determination regarding Ayoob's complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The record does not reveal why Maine did not argue lack of subject matter jurisdiction earlier, by filing a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).

In light of the Supreme Court's recent statement that a \"Tribe may not sue under &#167; 1983 to vindicate the sovereign right\" of tribal sovereign immunity,<i>Inyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone Indians,</i> 538 U.S. 701, 712, 123 S.Ct. 1887, 155 L.Ed.2d 933 (2003), the Band probably would not have a colorable &#167; 1983 argument here. At any rate, in its appellate brief, the Band barely mentions &#167; 1983, and we deem any potential &#167; 1983 argument to be forfeited. <i>See United States v.

The Maine Human Rights Commission has investigated complaints by three former employees of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs, and asserts that it has the authority to investigate any future complaints, pursuant to Maine antidiscrimination law. The Band filed this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Commission's investigations, arguing that such investigations impermissibly encroach upon the Band's inherent tribal sovereignty, congressionally-affirmed right to self-governance without state interference, and sovereign immunity from judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. The district court concluded that the Band's complaint did not invoke a right to relief under federal law, but rather invoked affirmative federal defenses to state law actions, and therefore did not satisfy the well-pleaded complaint rule. Consequently, the court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Aroostook Band of Micmacs is a federally recognized Indian tribe. Over a four month span in 2001, the Band fired three tribal employees: Chief Financial Officer Lisa Gardiner, Compliance Officer Tammy Condon, and Housing Director Beverly Ayoob. Pursuant to internal tribal procedure, Gardiner and Condon appealed the Band's termination decisions to the Band's Tribal Council, claiming that they were terminated in retaliation for protected activities; the Tribal Council affirmed their terminations. Ayoob, who had filed a sexual harassment charge with the Tribal Council before being terminated, did not challenge her termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three ex-employees turned to the Maine Human Rights Commission, a state agency charged with \"investigating all forms of invidious discrimination.\" Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4566. Upon receipt of a private complaint of discrimination, the Commission conducts a preliminary investigation to \"determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(1)(B). The target of the investigation must cooperate:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he commission ... shall have access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. The commission may issue subpoenas to compel access to or production of those materials or the appearance of those persons, ... and may serve interrogatories on a respondent to the same extent as interrogatories served in aid of a civil action in the Superior Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> If the Commission determines that there are \"reasonable grounds to believe that unlawful discrimination has occurred,\" it first attempts to broker a conciliation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(3). If conciliation fails, the Commission may \"file in the Superior Court a civil action seeking such relief as is appropriate, including temporary restraining orders.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(4). Whether or not it does so, \"[t]he complaint and evidence collected during the investigation of the complaint... shall become a matter of public record at the conclusion of the investigation .... [and] may be used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding, civil or criminal.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4612(1)(B). If the Commission does not itself file a civil action &#8212; and it usually does not &#8212; the complainant may file an action herself. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4621.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 2001, Gardiner and Condon filed complaints with the Commission alleging employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, as well as retaliation, under the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167;&#167; 4551-4634, and the Maine Whistleblowers' Protection Act (MWPA), Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 831-840. In the summer and fall of 2002, Ayoob filed two complaints alleging employment discrimination and retaliation under the MHRA and MWPA. In each case, shortly after receiving the individual's complaint, the Commission filed charges on the complainant's behalf with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Band asked the Commission to dismiss all four complaints on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the Band. The Commission refused, concluding that it had jurisdiction because the Band is subject to the MHRA, the MWPA, and, for Gardiner and Condon's complaints, Title VII. It investigated the complaints, and on at least two occasions issued document requests to the Band seeking a variety of tribal personnel documents. The Band complied with those requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2003, the Commission's investigator issued a report suggesting that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the Band had discriminated or retaliated against Gardiner or Condon. Before the full Commission could rule on the report, the Band filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against the executive director and members of the Commission (collectively, \"Maine\"), and the three individual complainants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief directing the Commission to (1) dismiss the complaints on the ground that the Band is not subject to the MHRA or MWPA, and (2) stop filing complaints against the Band with the EEOC. The complaint, as amended, pled five claims: that the enforcement of the MHRA and MWPA against the Band violates its inherent tribal sovereignty and statutorily codified right to self-governance (Count I); that the enforcement of these state laws against the Band violates its tribal sovereign immunity (Count II);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that the Band is exempt from Title VII (Count III); that the Band's exemption from Title VII preempts state antidiscrimination law, and so, regardless of what the MHRA and MWPA say, the Band is not subject to them (Count IV); and that, even under the MHRA and MWPA's own terms, the Band is not an \"employer\" (Count V).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the complaint was filed, the Commission determined that, contrary to its investigator's initial report, there <i>were</i> reasonable grounds to believe that Gardiner and Condon had been retaliated against based on protected conduct. Meanwhile, Gardiner and Condon filed suit against the Band in Aroostook County Superior Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> That court stayed the action pending the outcome of the federal litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In federal court, the parties consented to adjudication by a United States Magistrate Judge, and cross-moved for summary judgment. Although both parties addressed the merits of the Band's claims, Maine also argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In February 2004, the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. <i>See Aroostook Band of Micmacs v.

In 1989, Maine and the Band reached a settlement that was memorialized in the Micmac Settlement Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &#167;&#167; 7201-7207. The Act generally accorded the Band the same status as the Maliseets, not the greater powers and autonomy enjoyed by the Penobscots and the Passamaquoddy. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 7203 (subjecting Band to state laws and court jurisdiction without exception), 7204 (land to be held in trust by United States), 7205 (no municipal powers for Band).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, at the behest of both Maine and the Band, Congress enacted the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Settlement Act (\"Federal Micmac Settlement Act\"), Pub.L. No. 102-171, 105 Stat. 1143 (codified at 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1721 note). The Federal Micmac Settlement Act explained that \"[t]he Band was not referred to in [MICSA] because historical documentation of the Micmac presence in Maine was not available at that time.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(2), 105 Stat. at 1143. Now that such documentation was available, Congress found that \"[t]he Aroostook Band of Micmacs, in both its history and its presence in Maine, is similar to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and would have received similar treatment under [MICSA] if the information available today had been available to Congress and the parties at that time.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(4). Consequently, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act aimed to \"afford the Aroostook Band of Micmacs the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band's claims, to the extent [the Micmacs] would have benefited from inclusion in [MICSA].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(a)(5). On this basis, Congress \"ratif[ied] the [state] Micmac Settlement Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2(b)(4), 105 Stat. at 1144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three provisions of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act are relevant here.

Section 6(b) of the federal act, entitled \"Laws Applicable,\" subjects the Band to <i>federal</i> law on the same terms as the other Maine tribes. 105 Stat. at 1148. Nothing in the federal act explicitly subjects the Band to Maine law. By contrast, the earlier MICSA explicitly stated that all Indian tribes other than the Passamaquoddy and Penobscots \"shall be subject to the civil ... jurisdiction of the State, the laws of the State, and the civil ... jurisdiction of the courts of the State, to the same extent as any other person or land therein.\" 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(a); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1721(b)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the federal act provided that \"[i]n the event of a conflict of interpretation between the provisions of the [state] Maine Implementing Act [affecting the Penobscots, Passamaquoddy, and Maliseets], the [state] Micmac Settlement Act, or the [federal] Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 and this Act, the provisions of this [Federal Micmac Settlement] Act shall govern.\" Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#167; 11, 105 Stat. at 1149.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the issues raised in the Band's complaint go to the heart of its relationship with Maine, this appeal is narrow.

After all, we have identified a federal cause of action that will qualify for &#167; 1331 jurisdiction; the only remaining question is whether the Band's complaint properly pleads such an action. However, Maine argues that the principles established in a different line of cases require dismissal. We explain below why Maine's arguments fail. In doing so, we emphasize two fundamental principles. First, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the <i>plaintiff's complaint</i> is the document in which the federal claim must appear, regardless of whether that complaint was filed in federal court pursuant to &#167; 1331, or filed in state court and then removed to federal court pursuant to &#167; 1441. Second, by definition, an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action can only be brought <i>against state officer defendants;</i> the Supremacy Clause implies no right of action against private parties, or <i>by</i> state officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By focusing on these points, we can make some sense out of the array of cases invoked by Maine in support of its argument that the Band's complaint runs afoul of the well-pleaded complaint rule. The cases upon which Maine relies &#8212; wherein federal jurisdiction was lacking &#8212; are, quite simply, not <i>Ex parte Young</i> cases. These cases fall into three groups: cases where state officers were not parties at all; cases where state officers were plaintiffs, not defendants; and cases where state officers were defendants, but there was some other serious flaw in the complaint such that <i>Ex parte Young</i> was not properly pled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. State officers not parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of the cases on which Maine relies did not even involve state officers &#8212; they were between private parties, or between a tribe and a private party. <i>See Skelly Oil Co. v.

In such cases, the <i>Ex parte Young</i> cause of action is not available. Therefore, the private plaintiffs' only federal cause of action in those cases was the Declaratory Judgment Act itself. In such cases, \"[w]hatever federal claim [plaintiff] may be able to urge would in any event be injected into the case only in anticipation of a defense to be asserted by [defendants],\" and the Declaratory Judgment Act does not provide an independent basis for jurisdiction. <i>Skelly Oil,</i> 339 U.S. at 672, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104808\"><a href=\"/opinion/104808/skelly-oil-co-v-phillips-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such removal cases have no bearing on an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, for <i>Ex parte Young</i> purposes, this class of cases is formally identical to the previous class: the defendant is not a state officer. We have described it separately, however, because of a curious asymmetry. If a private party files an action <i>against</i> state officers alleging that their enforcement of state law violates the private party's federal rights, that is an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action and &#167; 1331 jurisdiction is available. But if the state officers file an action in state court to enforce that very state law, and the private party seeks to remove to federal court on the basis of the same preemption argument, that is not an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action, and there is usually no federal jurisdiction (unless there is some other basis for jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This asymmetry is, however, a virtually inevitable consequence of the fact that, even though an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action is in some ways the mirror image of state prosecution, &#167; 1331 jurisdiction is determined from the complaint alone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> In the first example &#8212; where the private party files an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action in federal court &#8212; the federal court looks at the plaintiff's complaint and sees a federal cause of action. In the second example &#8212; where the state files a state law action in state court and the private party removes &#8212; the federal court looks at the plaintiff's complaint and sees only state law issues. While this asymmetry may yield odd results or incentives to race to the courthouse, it is a logical consequence of the well-pleaded complaint rule itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Indeed, we have found no case in which we applied the <i>Wycoff</i> dictum to a case in the posture of <i>Wycoff</i> itself &#8212; i.e., no case in which we applied <i>Wycoff</i> to an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action and found jurisdiction lacking. At any rate, the flaw in <i>Wycoff</i> is not present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine's reliance on the well-pleaded complaint rule, when reduced to its essentials, is misguided. The Band seeks injunctive and declaratory relief <i>against the Commission and its officers</i> for purportedly violating its federal rights. Assuming that other requirements of <i>Ex parte Young</i> are satisfied &#8212; e.g., that there is a colorable claim of a federal right &#8212; these claims qualify for \"arising under\" jurisdiction under the well-pleaded complaint rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the Band's arguments could arise as defenses in a state court action. But a properly framed federal cause of action does not fall outside &#167; 1331 simply because it could <i>also</i> arise as an affirmative federal defense in state court. \"[F]ederal jurisdiction is absent where the federal issue would arise <i>only</i> as a defense to a state cause of action.\" <i>Penobscot Nation II,</i> 254 F.3d at 321 (emphasis added). Just because a federal issue <i>could</i> arise as a defense to a state law action does not mean that the federal issue can <i>only</i> arise as a defense to a state law action. In fact, the federal claims in most <i>Ex parte Young</i> actions could be raised as affirmative defenses to state court actions. But an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action &#8212; \"though ultimately `defensive' in the sense that it seeks to prevent harms threatened by state officials &#8212; <i>does</i> constitute a federal question under &#167; 1331.\" <i>Local Union No. 12004,</i> 377 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>Penobscot Nation I/II,</i> the district court in this case &#8212; which did not have the benefit of our <i>Local Union No. 12004</i> decision &#8212; decided that it \"must look at the individual defendants' MHRA and MWPA complaints as they are tendered in the state court\"; hypothesized how those complaints might \"play[ ] out\"; and imagined how, in potential state court proceedings, the Band might \"answer[ ] and assert[] as affirmative defenses the contents of their three (non-Title VII) counts in this declaratory action.\" <i>Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 101. It then concluded that the Band's claims could be raised as affirmative defenses, and hence were not part of a well-pleaded federal complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Verizon Maryland</i> and <i>Local Union 12004</i> make clear, that is not the correct analysis. The question is not whether the allegedly federal claims <i>could</i> be raised as affirmative defenses to a state action, but rather whether they could <i>only</i> be so raised. With an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action, that is clearly not the case. Such an action rests, at bottom, on the implied federal right of action created by the Supremacy Clause. That implied right of action, when properly pled, supplies the basis for \"arising under\" jurisdiction under &#167; 1331. The question here is whether the complaint properly pleads such a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

And the Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#8212; again unlike MICSA &#8212; does not explicitly subject the Band to Maine law. <i>See supra</i> Part II.B. Finally, the Band argues, while MICSA admittedly makes \"all Indians, Indian nations, or tribes or bands of Indians in the State of Maine, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe [and] the Penobscot Nation ... subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the State, the laws of the State, and the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State, to the same extent as any other person ... therein,\" 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1725(a), the Federal Micmac Settlement Act explicitly states that it controls in case of a conflict with the Maine Implementing Act, MICSA, or the State Micmac Settlement Act. <i>See</i> Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#167; 11, 105 Stat. at 1148.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint anticipates the state's response &#8212; that the Federal Micmac Settlement Act ratified the State Micmac Settlement Act, which <i>did</i> make the Band \"subject to the laws of the State and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other person... therein,\" Me.Rev.Stat.

Congress did not do so in the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, and in fact it specified that the federal Act controls in the event of a conflict with the state Act. <i>See</i> Federal Micmac Settlement Act &#167; 11, 105 Stat. at 1148.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Band contends that the entire State Micmac Settlement Act never took effect. A provision of that Act provided that \"[t]his Act shall be effective only if ... [w]ithin 60 days of adjournment of the Legislature, the Secretary of State receives written certification by the Council of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs that the band has agreed to this Act.\" 1989 Me. Laws 149, &#167; 4(2). That did not happen &#8212; the Band never formally certified that it agreed to the State Micmac Settlement Act as required by the Act's terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Thus, the Band argues, the State Micmac Settlement Act &#8212; which made the Band subject to the laws of Maine &#8212; never took effect, and is null and void. Consequently, the federal Act, which purported to ratify the state Act, could not do so, because Congress simply cannot ratify a non-existent state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Band continues, the Federal Micmac Settlement Act <i>did</i> implicitly repeal the earlier state and federal legislation &#8212; the Maine Implementing Act and MICSA &#8212; to the extent that they applied to the Band.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> Thus, in the Band's view, federal common law and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act are the only applicable law determining the scope of the Band's right to self-governance, and neither subjects the Band to state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the complex argument concerning the validity of the State Micmac Settlement Act, \"[w]hether a case is one arising under [federal law], in the sense of the jurisdictional statute,... must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim ..., unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.\" <i>Graham,</i> 489 U.S. at 840, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112230\"><a href=\"/opinion/112230/oklahoma-tax-commn-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In light of this broad authority, the fact that the Commission did not need to exercise its subpoena power \"to compel access to or production of those materials or the appearance of those persons,\" <i>id.,</i> may simply mean that the Band decided to first comply with state law, and <i>then</i> challenge its applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An Indian tribe that is unlawfully called to answer before a state agency may suffer both practical harms and intrusions upon its sovereignty.

Consequently, the district court erred in dismissing Count I for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Count II (Tribal Sovereign Immunity)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count II alleges that, as a matter of federal law, the Band's tribal sovereign immunity bars the enforcement of state law against it. The difference between the rights asserted in Count I and the tribal sovereign immunity asserted in Count II is subtle but important. The Band's alleged rights to self-governance and tribal sovereignty mean, in essence, that it is not subject to state laws (at least those that purport to regulate the internal governance affairs of the Band itself) <i>at all.</i> By contrast, tribal sovereign immunity means that the Band is not amenable to <i>state judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings</i> to enforce those laws. <i>See</i> Kaighn Smith, Jr., <i>Federal Courts, State Power, and Indian Tribes: Confronting the Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule,</i> 35 N.M. L.Rev. ___, ___ (24-26) (forthcoming 2005) (contrasting doctrines of infringement of tribal sovereignty versus tribal sovereign immunity). In short, we read Count I to allege that the Band is not subject to the MHRA and MWPA, and Count II to allege that, even if the Band is subject to those acts, it is not subject to the power of any Maine tribunal to investigate and enforce those laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"As a matter of federal law, an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.\" <i>Kiowa Tribe v.

Its principal authority for this argument is <i>Graham,</i> in which the Supreme Court held that a tribe, sued in state court by the state, may not <i>remove</i> to federal court on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity because \"a federal immunity to the claims asserted does not convert a suit otherwise arising under state law into one which, in the statutory sense, arises under federal law.\" 489 U.S. at 841, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112230\"><a href=\"/opinion/112230/oklahoma-tax-commn-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Maine's view, <i>Graham</i> stands for the proposition that \"a tribal sovereign immunity defense ... cannot form the basis of `arising under' jurisdiction.\" But Maine fails to recognize that Count II pleads a tribal sovereignty <i>offense.</i> As described above, there is a crucial difference between removal of a state claim and an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action. <i>See supra</i> Part IV.A.2. The well-pleaded complaint rule applies to the plaintiff's complaint, regardless of whether it was filed in state court or federal court. <i>See Rossello-Gonzalez,</i> 398 F.3d at 10 (applying rule to complaint filed in state court). The well-pleaded complaint in <i>Graham</i> contained an Oklahoma law tax claim; the well-pleaded complaint here contains a claim under a federal cause of action asserting a federal common law right. <i>Graham</i> addressed whether a defendant may <i>remove</i> on the basis of a tribal sovereign immunity defense; it simply does not apply where a plaintiff pleads an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action on the basis of the federal right of tribal sovereign immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, a key flaw in Maine's analysis is its assumption that tribal sovereign immunity is only a defense to a <i>lawsuit,</i> and since the Commission has not filed (or threatened to file) suit against the Band, considerations of tribal sovereign immunity are premature. But tribal sovereign immunity might apply to the Commission's investigations themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> We do not hold that tribal sovereign immunity applies to such proceedings, nor even that the Band actually retains tribal sovereign immunity in light of MICSA and the Federal Micmac Settlement Act. <i>See supra</i> note 19. We simply conclude that the Band's claim of tribal sovereign immunity presents a \"colorable\" claim of a federal cause of action under <i>Ex parte Young.</i> Consequently, the district court erred in dismissing Count II for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts III and IV relate to a provision in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stating that Indian tribes are not \"employers\" under Title VII. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(b). Count III seeks a declaration that the Band is not subject to Title VII, and an injunction against the Commission from applying Title VII to the Band and filing charges against the Band with the federal EEOC. Count IV alleges that the Title VII exemption preempts contrary state law, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that the Commission may not apply the MHRA and MWPA against the Band. In other words, Count III claims that the Band is exempt from Title VII, while Count IV says that <i>because</i> the Band is exempt from Title VII, it must be exempt, as a matter of federal law, from the MHRA and MWPA too. The district court dismissed both counts on the grounds that they did not pose justiciable cases or controversies. <i>See Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 106-08.

This practice has apparently stopped, and the Commission admitted in its answer that Title VII does not apply to the Band. <i>Cf.

The Commission's current position is that it \"does not file discrimination charges against tribes with the EEOC unless the [Commission] has some reason for believing that Title VII might somehow apply.\" Maine argues that there is no justiciable case or controversy because there is no dispute: all parties agree that the Band is exempt from Title VII, and hence there is nothing for a court to resolve. The district court apparently agreed. <i>See Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 107.

Micmacs,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 107. We read this as finding that the complaint does not allege an injury-in-fact for standing purposes. In other words, even if the Commission erroneously files an EEOC charge against the Band, such referral causes no cognizable injury. <i>See generally Steir v.

First, the Band asserts dignitary harm: it is forced to defend itself to the EEOC when, it claims, Congress has shielded the Band from such investigations entirely. As the Band notes, if \"the desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing,\" <i>id.</i> at 562-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That analysis is incorrect. The fact that the Band's position might be difficult to maintain because another district court has already answered the legal question in the state's favor does not mean that there is no case or controversy. Plaintiffs are free to bring cases that fly in the face of precedent. When they do so, however, those cases should be resolved on the legal or factual merits, not dismissed for lack of a case or controversy. \"Courts should not ... conflate the constitutional standing inquiry with the merits determination that comes later.\" <i>United States v.

Here, litigation in state court might lead to a holding that the Band is not an \"employer\" under the MHRA and MWPA, and thus eliminate the need to resolve the federal claims in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that abstention is proper when the only constitutional issue in the case is preemption,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> abstention is inappropriate here. Since the principal federal issue is whether the Band is subject to state law and required to submit to the jurisdiction of state tribunals (whether administrative or judicial) <i>at all,</i> requiring the Band to first try its hand in state proceedings would be perverse. <i>Cf. Miller-Davis Co. v. Ill.

For the Band to argue that it is not an \"employer\" under the MHRA and MWPA, it must first submit to the jurisdiction of the state court. That is precisely what it does not wish to do, and it has come to federal court explicitly seeking a ruling that it need <i>not</i> defend itself in state court. Since the Band has asserted a dignitary harm in being forced to defend itself before the Commission, let alone Maine courts, abstention would be tantamount to a decision on the merits against the Band.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final matter remains. Besides the Commission defendants, the Band also sued Gardiner, Condon, and Ayoob, the former employees who charged the Band with discrimination. The complaint does not allege any unlawful activity by the individual defendants, nor pray for relief against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a> On appeal, the Band concedes that it seeks no injunctive relief against the individual defendants, and confines its argument to the Commission defendants. We assume that the individual defendants were joined as persons needed for just adjudication pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2), because they have an interest in the action and, arguably, their ability to protect that interest would be impaired without their participation.

Because it dismissed the entire action, the district court did not consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Count V under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367. We express no view regarding whether, on remand, it should do so, nor whether, in making that decision, the court should consider the possibility of certifying the state law question to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. <i>See</i> Me.

Although we explain the differences between these below in detail,<i>see infra</i> Parts IV.B-C, we provide thumbnail definitions here. Tribal <i>sovereignty</i> is a common law doctrine recognizing tribes' inherent powers to self-govern, including the power to determine the structure and internal operations of the governing body itself, and exempting tribes from state law that would otherwise infringe upon this sovereignty. Tribal <i>sovereign immunity</i> is a common law doctrine providing that tribes are immune from lawsuits or quasi-judicial proceedings without their consent or Congressional waiver. Finally, the Band claims a statutory right to <i>self-governance</i> deriving from Section 7(a) of the Federal Micmac Settlement Act, which provides that the Band \"may organize for its common welfare and ... act[ ] in its governmental capacity.\" 105 Stat. at 1148. According to the Band, this provision reaffirms and codifies the common law doctrine of tribal sovereignty as it applies to the Band.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Again, the merits are not relevant here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At that point, the Commission had not yet made a determination regarding Ayoob's complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The record does not reveal why Maine did not argue lack of subject matter jurisdiction earlier, by filing a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).
