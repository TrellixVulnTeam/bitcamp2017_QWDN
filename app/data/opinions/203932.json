José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lipez, and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Seth A. Erbe, with whom Jose R. Ortiz-Velez, Pedro F. Soler-\nMuñiz, David C. Indiano, Ada Sofia Esteves, and Indiano & Williams,\nP.S.C. were on brief, for appellants.\n     Heidi Rodriguez, with whom Giselle Lopez Soler and Pietrantoni\nMendez & Alvarez LLP were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            July 31, 2009\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. This case requires us to determine\n\nthe enforceability of a forum selection clause embedded in informed\n\nconsent    documents    presented    to     a    patient     before    a   medical\n\nprocedure.    The appellants, Florentino Rivera, his wife Carmen de\n\nLeón Rivera, and their conjugal partnership, filed suit against the\n\nCentro Médico de Turabo, Inc., which does business as HIMA San\n\nPablo Caguas (\"HIMA\" or \"the hospital\"), in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging medical\n\nmalpractice.      HIMA moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that,\n\npursuant to a forum selection clause contained in two preoperative\n\nconsent forms signed by Rivera, the Commonwealth Court of First\n\nInstance    was   the   exclusive   venue       for   any   claims    against   the\n\nhospital.     The district court granted HIMA's motion to dismiss\n\nbased on the forum selection clause.              For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n            Since this appeal arises from a dismissal pursuant to\n\nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we \"assume\n\nthe truth of all well-pleaded facts\" in the complaint and \"indulge\n\nall reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of\n\nliability.\" Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005) (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).1\n\n             On November 9, 2005, Rivera, a 65-year-old male, visited\n\nthe office of Dr. Marcial Walker to discuss the results of a test\n\nindicating elevated levels of PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) in\n\nRivera's blood.      Based on the test results, the doctor scheduled\n\nRivera for a prostate biopsy.           The biopsy, performed on December\n\n12, 2005, revealed a prostatic adenocarcinoma – a tumor in Rivera's\n\nprostate.      In    an   appointment    after   the   biopsy,   Dr.    Walker\n\nrecommended    the   surgical   removal     of   Rivera's   prostate.     The\n\nprocedure was scheduled for February 21, 2006.\n\n             Before the surgery, Rivera was examined by Dr. Lydia Díaz\n\nBorrás to determine whether he should receive medical clearance for\n\nthe procedure.       Dr. Díaz Borrás noted that the patient suffered\n\nfrom several medical conditions, including hypertension (high blood\n\npressure) and hyperlipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the\n\nblood stream), and that he exhibited several risk factors for\n\ncardiac and pulmonary conditions.          Nevertheless, she declared him\n\nto be clinically stable for surgery.         On February 16, 2006, Rivera\n\nalso passed a pre-anaesthesia screening.\n\n             The surgery was performed as scheduled on February 21,\n\n2006.    However, due to significant blood loss resulting from a\n\n\n     1\n       As we discuss below, certain procedural irregularities\ndistinguish this case from the run-of-the-mill 12(b)(6) dismissal.\nThose irregularities do not affect this factual summary.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhemorrhage     during          surgery,         Rivera        required         several         blood\n\ntransfusions.      The next day, he developed weakness or paralysis on\n\none   side   of    his       body       and   was     diagnosed      with      a       \"stroke    in\n\nevolution,\" i.e., the preliminary stages of a stroke.\n\n             Rivera was discharged on February 27 to an extended care\n\nfacility,    where       he    remained         for    five      weeks    of    recovery         and\n\nrehabilitation.              During      this    time,      he    received         a    course    of\n\nantibiotics       to    treat       a    postoperative           infection      that      he     had\n\ndeveloped     at       the    hospital.             After     his    discharge          from     the\n\nrehabilitation center, Rivera had a follow-up appointment with Dr.\n\nWalker, who recommended a second operation to remedy some of the\n\nnegative effects of the initial procedure.                          Rivera refused.\n\n             Rivera alleges that, as a result of his treatment at\n\nHIMA, he is partially disabled and cannot enjoy life as he did\n\nbefore the surgery.            Despite the aid of a leg brace and a cane, he\n\nrequires assistance to walk, as well as to perform daily tasks such\n\nas bathing and eating.                   When the complaint was filed, Rivera\n\nreceived physical and occupational therapy multiple times a week\n\nand expected the disability to be permanent.                             The complaint also\n\nalleges that both Rivera and his wife have endured significant\n\nmental anguish as a result of his medical condition.\n\nB.    Procedural History\n\n             On February 16, 2007, appellants filed a complaint in\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\falleging medical malpractice and breach of the duty of care, and\n\nasserting a right to recover damages under Articles 1802 and 1803\n\nof the Civil Code of Puerto Rico (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141\n\nand 5142).2         The complaint named as defendants the hospital, Drs.\n\nWalker       and      Díaz     Borrás,   several     \"placeholder\"       defendants\n\nrepresenting unidentified individuals who may have contributed to\n\nRivera's injuries, and unidentified insurance companies from whom\n\nthe hospital had purchased malpractice coverage; the placeholder\n\ndefendants were to be identified through discovery.\n\n                  The complaint alleged that Rivera had not been informed\n\nabout many of the less radical alternatives to prostate removal or\n\nabout       the    risks     and   benefits   of   each   treatment   option,   and\n\ntherefore that he never gave his informed consent to the operation.\n\nRivera also accused the hospital and the doctors of negligence in\n\nthe selection and execution of Rivera's course of treatment,\n\nincluding          the   preoperative    evaluations,      which   the   complaint\n\ncharacterized as \"substandard.\"               In sum, Rivera claimed that the\n\ndefendants were jointly and severally liable both for the treatment\n\nexpenses arising from his postoperative complications and for\n\n\n\n\n        2\n       Section 5141 provides generally that \"[a] person who by an\nact or omission causes damage to another through fault or\nnegligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" Section\n5142 embodies the principle of respondeat superior, and provides,\ninter alia, that \"[t]he obligation imposed by § 5141 of this title\nis demandable, not only for personal acts and omissions, but also\nfor those of the persons for whom they should be responsible.\"\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdamages sufficient to compensate him (and his wife) for their\n\nphysical and mental suffering.\n\n              The hospital filed a motion to dismiss based on a forum\n\nselection clause contained in two different consent forms that\n\nRivera had signed prior to surgery.          On February 16, 2006, five\n\ndays before the operation, Rivera signed a form entitled \"Consent\n\nto Administer Anesthesia and Conscious Sedation.\"         On February 26,\n\n2006, the day of the procedure itself, he signed an additional\n\n\"Consent to Surgery\" form.      Both documents contained the following\n\nidentical clause: \"In the event that by act or omission I consider\n\nthat physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to\n\nme, I expressly agree to submit to the Jurisdiction of the Court of\n\nFirst Instance of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, for any possible\n\nclaim.\"       On both forms, this clause was in boldface type and\n\nsurrounded by a box that set it apart from the rest of the text.\n\nEach document further required that Rivera specifically place his\n\ninitials next to the forum selection clause and also that he\n\nseparately sign under a certification that: \"this consent has been\n\nexplained to me and to my entire satisfaction and that I understand\n\nthe content of this form, that I have read and I have been given a\n\ncopy of the same, thus, I accept its terms as patient . . . .\"\n\n              In its motion to dismiss, HIMA argued that, pursuant to\n\nthe   forum    selection   clause,   the   Commonwealth   Court   of   First\n\nInstance was the exclusive venue for Rivera's claims against the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fhospital.     In reply, Rivera argued that the consent forms should\n\nnot be considered freely negotiated contracts; that, as a general\n\nmatter, forum selection clauses should not be enforced in medical\n\nmalpractice cases; and, in the alternative, that at least Rivera's\n\nwife,   as   a   non-signatory,   should   not    be   bound   by   the   forum\n\nselection clause in the consent form.        The district court granted\n\nthe motion to dismiss.     Rivera appeals.\n\n                                    II.\n\n             In this circuit, we treat a motion to dismiss based on a\n\nforum selection clause as a motion alleging the failure to state a\n\nclaim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6).                Silva\n\nv. Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc., 239 F.3d 385, 387 & n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); compare Lipcon v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 148 F.3d\n\n1285, 1289-90 (11th Cir. 1998) (describing the circuits' varying\n\napproaches to motions to dismiss on the basis of forum selection\n\nclauses and concluding that such motions are most properly brought\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(3)).     We review the grant of a motion to dismiss\n\nfor failure to state a claim de novo.            Vernet v. Serrano-Torres,\n\n566 F.3d 254, 258 (1st Cir. 2009).         In such cases, the district\n\ncourt must \"accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of\n\nthe complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the\n\nplaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read,\n\nlimns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\ftheory.\"   LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 508\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           The fact that a motion to dismiss on the basis of a forum\n\nselection clause is treated as a 12(b)(6) motion has certain\n\nconsequences   for   the   materials   that   a   district   court   may\n\nappropriately consider when ruling on such a motion.         \"Under Rule\n\n12(b)(6), the district court may properly consider only facts and\n\ndocuments that are part of or incorporated into the complaint; if\n\nmatters outside the pleadings are considered, the motion must be\n\ndecided under the more stringent standards applicable to a Rule 56\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\"      Trans-Spec Truck Serv., Inc. v.\n\nCaterpillar, Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) . . .,\n\nmatters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by\n\nthe court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment\n\nunder Rule 56.\").    We have recognized an exception to this rule\n\n\"for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the\n\nparties; for official public records; for documents central to\n\nplaintiffs' claim; or for documents sufficiently referred to in the\n\ncomplaint,\" which courts may properly consider on 12(b)(6) motions.\n\nAlternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 267\n\nF.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nIf, however, the supplemental materials submitted to the district\n\ncourt fall outside this narrow class of documents, and the court\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fchooses to consider them using Rule 12(d)'s conversion procedure,\n\n\"[a]ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present\n\nall the material that is pertinent to the motion.\"             Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(d).\n\n            Here, appellants' original complaint did not mention the\n\nforum selection clause, nor did it include copies of the consent\n\nforms as an exhibit to the complaint.            Instead, the consent forms\n\ncontaining the forum selection clause were first brought to the\n\ndistrict court's attention on the hospital's motion to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint.    In their opposition to the motion, appellants did not\n\nchallenge    the     authenticity   of    the     documents,     but   instead\n\nintroduced allegations that Rivera's consent to the forum selection\n\nclause was obtained by fraud or overreaching.            These allegations\n\nwere     supported    by   affidavits     from    Mr.   and     Mrs.   Rivera.\n\nAdditionally, appellants argued that the court should treat the\n\nhospital's motion as one for summary judgment and allow appellants\n\nto conduct further discovery regarding the forum selection clause.\n\n            The following week, appellants commendably sought leave\n\nto file an amended complaint that would, among other things,\n\n\"supplement the allegations [in the complaint] concerning lack of\n\ninformed consent\" and include the affidavits from Rivera and his\n\nwife, \"so that [the] averments may be considered pleadings in the\n\ntrue sense of the word.\"       It was not until months later, in its\n\ndecision granting the motion to dismiss, that the district court\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\falso \"abstain[ed] from deciding\" on plaintiffs' pending motion to\n\namend. Appellants do not now challenge this disposition -- indeed,\n\nit is unclear whether the decision to abstain would even be\n\nappealable as an interlocutory order.\n\n          However, in spite of the district court's disposition of\n\nappellants' request to amend their pleadings and an explicit\n\nstatement that it would consider only the factual summary in the\n\nplaintiffs'    original   complaint     and    the   two   consent   forms\n\nthemselves, the court's actions belied its statements.            In fact,\n\nthe   court   expressly   considered    the     factual    allegations   of\n\noverreaching found in appellants' amended complaint and their\n\nopposition to the motion to dismiss.          By considering appellants'\n\nfactual allegations, the court effectively converted the hospital's\n\nmotion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.           On appeal,\n\nneither side objects to the court's consideration of factual\n\nallegations beyond the complaint or to the fact that the parties\n\ndid not receive notice, pursuant to Rule 12(d), that it intended to\n\ndo so.   Appellants continue to press the same factual allegations\n\non appeal.    Accordingly, while we do not endorse the district\n\ncourt's treatment of the motion to dismiss (i.e., its sub silentio\n\nconversion into a motion for summary judgment), we accept it for\n\nthe purposes of this appeal. We are particularly comfortable doing\n\nso in this instance because, as we discuss below, even accepting\n\nthe allegations in the affidavits as true, they would not suffice\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fto prove the kind of fraud or overreaching required to render the\n\nforum selection clause unenforceable.3   See, e.g., Silva, 239 F.3d\n\nat 388 (\"[W]e are not bound by the label below, and agree that the\n\ncase should have been dismissed.\") (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n                                III.\n\n            Although this is a suit based on diversity, we need not\n\nreach the unsettled issue of whether \"forum selection clauses are\n\nto be treated as substantive or procedural for Erie purposes.\"\n\nLambert v. Kysar, 983 F.2d 1110, 1116 & n.10 (1st Cir. 1993).   This\n\nis because \"there is no conflict between federal common law and\n\nPuerto Rico law regarding the enforceability of forum-selection\n\nclauses.\"    Silva, 239 F.3d at 387 n.1; see also id. (noting that\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court has adopted federal jurisprudence\n\nregarding the general enforceability of forum selection clauses).\n\nWe therefore apply federal common law.\n\n\n\n     3\n       Relatedly, appellants argue that the district court erred by\nfailing to allow them to conduct additional discovery on the\ncircumstances surrounding the inclusion of the forum selection\nclause in the consent documents. Even interpreting the district\ncourt's actions as a sua sponte conversion of the 12(b)(6) motion\ninto a motion for summary judgment, we find that it was not an\nabuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that\nadditional discovery was unnecessary because we find that none of\nappellants' allegations, even if substantiated, would render the\nforum selection clause unenforceable. Cf. Adorno v. Crowley Towing\nand Transp. Co., 443 F.3d 122, 127-8 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting that,\nin the Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) context, a motion for additional\ndiscovery must establish that the facts sought would influence the\noutcome of the motion for summary judgment).\n\n                                -11-\n\f            Under federal law, the threshold question in interpreting\n\na   forum   selection    clause   is   whether   the   clause    at   issue   is\n\npermissive or mandatory.          \"Permissive forum selection clauses,\n\noften described as 'consent to jurisdiction' clauses, authorize\n\njurisdiction and venue in a designated forum, but do not prohibit\n\nlitigation elsewhere . . .        In contrast, mandatory forum selection\n\nclauses contain clear language indicating that jurisdiction and\n\nvenue are appropriate exclusively in the designated forum.\"                   14D\n\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 3803.1 (3d ed. 1998).              Rivera argues that\n\nthe clause in HIMA's consent forms was permissive; that it was\n\nintended    only    to   affirmatively    confer     jurisdiction     upon    the\n\nCommonwealth Court of First Instance, and should not be interpreted\n\nto limit the jurisdiction of federal district courts.                 We reject\n\nthat assertion.4\n\n            In Redondo Constr. Corp. v. Banco Exterior de España,\n\nS.A., 11 F.3d 3 (1st Cir. 1993), we considered language providing\n\nthat \"each [party] hereby expressly submits to jurisdiction of all\n\nFederal and State Courts located in the State of Florida.\"               Id. at\n\n5   (emphasis      omitted).      We    explained    that    \"[a]ffirmatively\n\nconferring Florida jurisdiction by consent does not negatively\n\nexclude any other proper jurisdiction.\"             Id. at 6.   Similarly, in\n\n\n\n      4\n       HIMA argues that Rivera waived this permissive/mandatory\nargument below. We disagree.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fAutoridad de Energía Eléctrica de Puerto Rico v. Ericsson, Inc.,\n\n201 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 2000), the clause at issue stated: \"This\n\ncontract will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the Laws of\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the parties agree to submit to\n\nthe jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"\n\n Id. at 18 (emphasis added).        Citing Redondo, we again concluded\n\nthat the contractual language was merely an affirmative conferral\n\nof jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth courts, particularly in light\n\nof the fact that Ericsson, which was not the originator of the\n\nprovision, was incorporated and had its principal place of business\n\noutside of Puerto Rico.       Id.   Accordingly, it made sense that the\n\ndrafter of the contract and eventual plaintiff, the Power Authority\n\nof   Puerto   Rico,   would    require     Ericsson   to   consent   to   the\n\njurisdiction of the Puerto Rico courts in the event of any dispute,\n\nthereby obviating the need for any personal jurisdiction analysis.\n\nId. at 19.\n\n           Certainly, the forum selection clause in HIMA's consent\n\nform shares the \"agree to submit\" language with the two cases\n\ninvoked by appellants. However, \"words are not viewed in isolation\n\nwithin a contract.\"    McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 391 F.3d\n\n287, 298 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term\n\nDisability Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 179 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that\n\n\"[a]ccepted canons of construction forbid the balkanization of\n\ncontracts for interpretive purposes\" (citing Fashion House, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fK mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1084 (1st Cir. 1989))).         Moreover,\n\nthere is no \"general rule for forum-selection clauses[;]\" rather,\n\nwe \"base[] our conclusion on the specific language of the contract\n\nat issue.\"5    Silva, 239 F.3d at 388.    Here, unlike in Redondo or\n\nEricsson, the \"expressly agree to submit\" language is preceded and\n\ninformed by a qualifying phrase: \"In the event that by act or\n\nomission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages\n\nhave been caused to me, I expressly agree to submit . . . .\"\n\n(emphasis added).    That is, the consent form required Rivera to\n\nassert any causes of action that he may have against the hospital\n\nin the Commonwealth courts.     In contrast, by assenting to the\n\nclauses in Redondo and Ericsson, both of which lacked a similar\n\nintroductory phrase, the signatories consented to the exercise of\n\njurisdiction over themselves as defendants in order to avoid the\n\npersonal jurisdiction analysis that would otherwise be required for\n\nout-of-state    defendants.    This      difference   in   context   is\n\ndeterminative, and we therefore conclude that the forum selection\n\nclause is mandatory.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      For the same reason, we reject appellant's argument that the\nabsence of \"typical mandatory terms\" such as \"shall,\" \"exclusive,\"\n\"only,\" or \"must\" requires a contrary result. See, e.g., Summit\nPackaging Sys., Inc. v. Kenyon & Kenyon, 273 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.\n2001) (holding that term in contract providing that parties \"will\nsubmit\" their dispute to a specified forum implied the exclusion of\nall other forums).\n\n                                -14-\n\f                                IV.\n\n           \"Contractual provisions undertaking to provide where a\n\nsuit may be brought in disputes arising out of the agreement are\n\nnot uncommon.\"   14D Federal Practice & Procedure § 3803.1.   It is\n\nwell established that forum selection clauses \"are prima facie\n\nvalid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the\n\nresisting party to be 'unreasonable' under the circumstances.\" M/S\n\nBremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 10 (1972); see also\n\nSilva, 239 F.3d at 386.     More specifically, a forum selection\n\nclause should be enforced unless the resisting party can show \"that\n\nenforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause\n\nwas invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching . . . [or\n\nthat] enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the\n\nforum in which suit is brought, whether declared by statute or by\n\njudicial decision.\"    M/S Bremen, 407 U.S. at 15.    We therefore\n\ninquire whether appellants have overcome this strong presumption of\n\nenforceability, considering each of their arguments in turn.\n\nA.   Nature of Consent Form/Nature of Action\n\n           Appellants claim that forum selection clauses, which are\n\ncontractual in nature, cannot be included in medical consent forms\n\nwhich are designed to comply with physicians' obligations under\n\nPuerto Rico law to obtain informed consent to medical procedures.\n\nThey argue that the forum selection clause, thus placed in an\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\finformed consent form, is unreasonable and contrary to public\n\npolicy for that reason alone and therefore should not be enforced.\n\n               This argument is too broad.          Appellants cite no legal\n\nauthority so holding.        The placement of the forum selection clause\n\nin a consent form is just one of the factors to be considered in\n\nassessing a claim that enforcement of the clause is unreasonable\n\nunder   the     circumstances.     Absent      a   finding    of    procedural    or\n\nsubstantive unconscionability, courts have repeatedly enforced\n\nforum selection clauses and arbitration agreements found in consent\n\nforms and similar documents.            See, e.g., Wilcox v. Lexington Eye\n\nInst., No. 53871-3-I, 2005 WL 1964481, at *8 (Wash. Ct. App. Aug.\n\n15, 2005) (enforcing forum selection clause in surgical consent\n\nform); Covenant Health Rehab. of Picayune, L.P. v. Brown, 949 So.\n\n2d 732, 741 (Miss. 2007) (enforcing those provisions of arbitration\n\nagreement contained in nursing home admissions form that were not\n\nfound to be unconscionable); see also Wilkerson ex rel. Estate of\n\nWilkerson v. Nelson, 395 F. Supp. 2d 281, 284 (M.D.N.C. 2005)\n\n(enforcing      arbitration    clause    contained      in   \"a    form   typically\n\nfurnished to and completed by patients while in the waiting room\"\n\nthat    also    included    statement    of    financial     responsibility      and\n\ninsurance authorization).\n\n               Relatedly,     appellants        argue      that     it    would be\n\ninappropriate to hold Rivera to the forum selection clause because\n\ntheir lawsuit was a tort action and not a breach of contract\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\faction.   They state that the district court's reliance on contract\n\ncases like Silva6 is unjustified because \"the present case is a\n\ntort case, which carries with it entirely different public policy\n\nconsiderations - a patient's life, health and well being.\"     That\n\nargument is also unpersuasive.         The applicability of a forum\n\nselection clause does not depend on the nature of the underlying\n\naction.   One of the classic Supreme Court cases concerning forum\n\nselection clauses, Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S.\n\n585 (1991), enforced a non-negotiated forum selection provision\n\ncontained in the passengers' cruise tickets in a personal injury\n\naction.   Courts have routinely followed that example.\n\n           Moreover, it is the language of the forum selection\n\nclause itself that determines which claims fall within its scope.\n\nHere, the provision plainly requires that a suit sounding in tort\n\nmust be brought according to its terms: \"In the event that by act\n\nor omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages\n\nhave been caused to me, I expressly agree to submit to the\n\nJurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, for any possible claim.\"         Indeed, this language\n\nspecifically contemplates its applicability to a malpractice claim.\n\nAccordingly, the nature of the instant action does not preclude\n\nenforcement of the forum selection clause.\n\n\n     6\n      In Silva, we held that a forum selection clause contained in\nan employment contract between a corporation and an independent\ncontractor was mandatory, valid, and enforceable. 239 F.3d at 386.\n\n                                -17-\n\fB.   The Forum Selection Clause as a Contract of Adhesion\n\n            Appellants claim that if it is proper for the consent\n\nforms to include contractual terms, then the forum selection clause\n\nis a contract of adhesion,7 \"to be construed against [its] drafter,\n\nand [is] therefore invalid.\"   The mere fact that a contract is one\n\nof adhesion does not render it per se unenforceable, as appellants'\n\nargument would suggest.   \"[A]dhesion does not imply nullity of a\n\ncontract.\"   Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co. of P.R., 964\n\nF.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).   \"If the wording of\n\nthe contract is explicit and its language is clear, its terms and\n\nconditions are binding on the parties.\"     Id. (collecting Puerto\n\nRico cases); see also Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d\n\n321, 331 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[O]f course, even a contract of adhesion\n\nis enforced unless unconscionable or unfair.\").   Here, because the\n\nimport of the forum selection provision is clear, \"we do not have\n\nto address whether the . . . doctrine of contra preferentum\n\napplies.\"    Pelletier v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 549 F.3d 578, 582\n\n(1st Cir. 2008); see also Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. M.V. DSR Atl.,\n\n131 F.3d 1336, 1339 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"As we find no ambiguity in\n\nthe forum clause, whether or not [the contract] is a contract of\n\n\n\n     7\n       A contract of adhesion is a contract \"offered by the\nauthoring party on a take it or leave it basis rather than being\nnegotiated between the parties.\" Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co. v.\nDonovan, 916 F.2d 372, 377 (7th Cir. 1990) (applying federal common\nlaw) (citing Todd S. Rakoff, Contracts of Adhesion: An Essay in\nReconstruction, 96 Harv L. Rev. 1174, 1242-43 (1983)).\n\n                               -18-\n\fadhesion is of no relevance to the result we reach in this\n\nmatter.\").\n\nC.   Fraud and Overreaching\n\n           Appellants argue that \"the clause was invalid for such\n\nreasons as fraud or overreaching.\"    M/S Bremen, 407 U.S. at 15.   In\n\nsupport of this claim, they cite the affidavits submitted to the\n\ndistrict court by Rivera and his wife, which were essentially\n\nidentical. Florentino Rivera's affidavit stated, in relevant part:\n\n                  5.    It was not explained to me by\n           anyone at HIMA that by signing the . . .\n           documents I was renouncing to file a case\n           before the Federal District Court for the\n           District of Puerto Rico. Said document does\n           not state that I am renouncing to file a case\n           before the Federal District Court for the\n           District of Puerto Rico. When signing these\n           forms I thought I was merely authorizing the\n           anaesthesia and the operation.\n                  6.    I do not know the difference\n           between the Courts of the Commonwealth of\n           Puerto Rico and the United States District\n           Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\n                  7.   I was not informed, at any time\n           prior to the signing of these forms that I was\n           waiving his [sic] right to a trial by jury, as\n           I thought that the Courts of the Commonwealth\n           of Puerto Rico have juries in all cases, as is\n           my common knowledge of the Courts in the\n           United States.\n                  8.   I was not advised that I could\n           consult this waiver of my rights with an\n           attorney, nor did I understand that I needed\n           to do so, because in my mind I was not waiving\n           any rights, I was simply consenting to the\n           operation and the anaesthesia.\n                  9.   Should an opportunity been [sic]\n           afforded for me to seek legal advice on the\n           matter, I would not have signed either of the\n           forms and would have either demanded that the\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f           waiver language be removed or gone elsewhere\n           for the operation.\n                  10.   I did not negotiate in any way,\n           form or manner what is written in those\n           documents, I was just demanded from the\n           hospital personnel to sign in order to have\n           the operation.\n\n           1. Fraud\n\n           A contract is voidable (and thus unenforceable) if \"a\n\nparty's manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent\n\nor material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the\n\nrecipient is justified in relying.\"          Restatement (Second) of\n\nContracts, § 164 (1979) (cited in Nash v. Trustees of Boston Univ.,\n\n946 F.2d 960, 967 (1st Cir. 1991)).        Rivera's averments do not\n\ndescribe fraud.     They say only that (1) no one verbally explained\n\nthe forum selection clause to appellants or told them that they\n\ncould consult an attorney; (2) appellants did not attempt to\n\nnegotiate the clause in any way, but, \"should an opportunity [have]\n\nbeen afforded\" to seek legal counsel, appellants would have either\n\nasked that the clause be removed or sought treatment elsewhere; and\n\n(3)   appellants    ultimately   misunderstood   the   forms   and   their\n\nimplications.      In essence, the affidavit describes the absence of\n\nan explanation about the significance of the forum selection\n\nclause.\n\n           This omission, in the circumstances here, cannot serve as\n\na basis for a misrepresentation claim:\n\n           The assertion 'I didn't know what was in the\n           contract that I signed' is made by litigants\n\n                                  -20-\n\f           frequently but almost never successfully.\n           Absent fraud, a person is deemed to know the\n           contents of a contract that he or she signs\n           . . . . Thus whether plaintiffs actually knew\n           of the arbitration clause in their contracts\n           is irrelevant; that knowledge is imputed as a\n           matter of law.\n\nParler v. KFC Corp., 529 F. Supp. 2d 1009, 1014 (D. Minn. 2008)\n\nThat logic applies here as well.\n\n           2. Overreaching\n\n           \"[A]lthough there is some ambiguity as to the precise\n\nboundaries of what constitutes 'overreaching,' a nebulous concept\n\nat best,\" Haynsworth v. The Corporation, 121 F.3d 956, 965 (5th\n\nCir. 1997), we understand \"overreaching\" to refer to one party's\n\nunfair   exploitation   of   its   overwhelming   bargaining   power   or\n\ninfluence over the other party.      See, e.g., Silva, 239 F.3d at 389\n\n(inquiring whether one party inappropriately used its bargaining\n\npower to coerce or exploit another); Ginter ex rel. Ballard v.\n\nBelcher, Prendergast, & Laporte, 536 F.3d 439, 449 n.2 (5th Cir.\n\n2008) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (evidencing similar understanding of\n\noverreaching); Outek Carribean Distrib., Inc. v. Echo, Inc., 206 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 263, 267 (D.P.R. 2002) (same).      But the mere fact of this\n\ninequality is not enough to render an agreement unenforceable.\n\nGilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 32 (1991)\n\n(making this observation in context of agreement to arbitrate);\n\nOutek Carribean, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 267.          The reference in M/S\n\nBremen to \"undue influence,\" and \"overweening bargaining power,\"\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f407 U.S. at 12 (emphasis added), is instructive.           There must be\n\nsome evidence that the party has exploited this bargaining power in\n\na way that the courts will not tolerate.        Outek Carribean, 206 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 267.\n\n           Similarly,     contrary     to    appellants'     suggestion,\n\n\"overreaching must be based on something more than the mere fact\n\nthat the clause was a 'boilerplate' provision printed on the back\n\nof a form contract.     As noted in our discussion of the contract of\n\nadhesion claim, it is not the law that one must bargain for each\n\nand every written term of a contract.\"        Lambert, 983 F.2d at 1120\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).        For this reason,\n\n\"the fact that a contract was in boilerplate form will not, by\n\nitself, render it unfair or invalid.\"          Outek Carribean, 206 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 267; see also Carnival Cruise Lines, 499 U.S. at 593\n\n(mere fact that term in contract was not negotiated does not make\n\nit unenforceable); Diaz-Rosado v. Auto-Wax Co., Inc., No. Civ. 04-\n\n2296, 2005 WL 2138794, at *3 (D.P.R. 2005).            Put another way,\n\nalthough   appellants   emphasize    \"the   relative   disparity   in   the\n\nbargaining positions of the parties . . . , the presumption in\n\nfavor of enforcing a forum selection clause applies even if the\n\nclause was not the product of negotiation.\"              2215 Fifth St.\n\nAssocs., LP v. U-Haul Intern., Inc., 148 F. Supp. 2d 50, 56 (D.D.C.\n\n2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, the district\n\ncourt of Puerto Rico has enforced a forum selection clause printed\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fin English on a cruise ticket where the passenger spoke only\n\nSpanish because \"[t]he examination of the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe passengers' purchase and retention of the contract, does not\n\ndepend upon actual knowledge of the terms in the contract of\n\npassage,     but   focuses    instead   on   the   opportunity    for   such\n\nknowledge.\"    De La Mota Estrella v. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines,\n\nInc., 2006 WL 2601657, at *3 (D.P.R. 2006) (quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n           There are certainly suggestions of overreaching here.\n\nRivera's relationship with the hospital grew out of a grave medical\n\ncondition.     He was likely more focused on that medical condition\n\nthan the significance of the documents that he was asked to sign.\n\nHe was not thinking about possible lawsuits. This reality in cases\n\nlike this one undoubtedly prompted the Puerto Rico Office of the\n\nPatient Advocate, subsequent to the filing of this lawsuit, to\n\npromulgate a regulation prohibiting the practice of including a\n\nforum selection clause in an informed consent document.            See Part\n\nIV. D.2, infra.\n\n           Nevertheless, despite this regulatory initiative, the\n\nfederal common law of overreaching as it presently stands convinces\n\nus that this is not a case where the presumption in favor of\n\nenforcing a forum selection clause is overcome.           The language of\n\nthe clause was clear.        The clause was in bold print and marked off\n\nfrom the rest of the one-page form by a special box.             It was not\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f\"buried in fine print\" or otherwise obscured.      The clause required\n\nthe patient to signal his assent by placing his initials next to\n\nit.   See Wilkerson, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 287 (rejecting plaintiff's\n\nargument that arbitration clause must be separately negotiated and\n\nfinding \"no claim of ambiguity\" where \"[p]laintiff signed the form\n\non the separate signature line before the arbitration clause\").\n\n           Furthermore, Rivera signaled his assent to the forum\n\nselection clause on two separate occasions, the first of which was\n\nfive days before his surgical procedure.         During the five days\n\nbetween his signing of the \"Consent to Administer Anesthesia and\n\nConscious Sedation\" form and the \"Consent to Surgery\" form on the\n\nday of his operation, Rivera had the opportunity to consult an\n\nattorney regarding the forum selection clause, and to consider his\n\nassent to it outside the pressures of a hospital setting.        He also\n\nhad the option of going to another hospital.       Under all of these\n\ncircumstances,   we   reject   appellants'   argument   that   the   forum\n\nselection clause is unenforceable because the Hospital procured\n\nRivera's consent by unfairly exploiting its bargaining advantage.\n\nSee, e.g., Wilcox, 2005 WL 1964481, at *2-3 (rejecting plaintiff's\n\nargument that forum selection clause should not be enforced due to\n\n\"undue influence,\" and \"overweening bargaining power,\" where she\n\nhad the opportunity to read the consent form in advance of her\n\nsurgery and again on the day of the procedure, the clause was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fclearly   written,      and   plaintiff's    signature     appeared   directly\n\nunderneath the forum selection provision).\n\nD.   Public Policy\n\n            1. The General Argument\n\n            In their opening brief, appellants make the general\n\nargument that to enforce a forum selection clause like the one at\n\nissue here would \"go[] against the social order that as a civilized\n\nsociety, we are obligated to try to maintain.\" Elaborating on this\n\ncontention, they state that in the context of hospital consent\n\nforms, \"the application of a rule that a party has a duty to read\n\nthe provisions of a form before he signs it and hence is bound by\n\nall provisions therein raises significant public policy concerns.\"\n\nWe disagree.      It simply cannot be the case that, absent fraud,\n\ncoercion, or overreaching -- which we have determined were absent\n\nfrom this scenario -- it would violate public policy to hold an\n\nindividual to a clearly stated forum selection clause in a one-page\n\ndocument.\n\n            The fact that this document was signed in a health care\n\ncontext     is   not,    in   and    of    itself,    determinative.       \"It\n\nis . . . significant to note that no court has ever reached the\n\nbroad conclusion that public policy precludes the use of private\n\narbitration      agreements     in   the    area     of   medical   services.\"\n\nBuraczynski v. Eyring, 919 S.W.2d 314, 318 (Tenn. 1996) (citations\n\nomitted).    The clause at issue here merely provides an alternative\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fjudicial forum for appellants' complaint, rather than an entirely\n\ndifferent adjudicative process.               It would be a strange outcome\n\nindeed if we found that it violated public policy to require two\n\nparties to litigate their claims in the Commonwealth courts when\n\ntheir interactions took place exclusively in Puerto Rico and their\n\nrelationship was governed by the tort law of the Commonwealth.\n\n            2.    Regulation 7504\n\n            On May 12, 2008, after initial briefing in this case had\n\nbeen completed, the Office of the Patient's Advocate of Puerto Rico\n\n(OPA) passed Regulation No. 7504, entitled \"Regulation for the\n\nImplementation of the Provisions of Public Law Number 194, enacted\n\nAugust 25, 2000, as amended, 'Puerto Rico Patients' Bill of Rights\n\nand Responsibilities.'\"8             Among other things, this regulation\n\nprohibits a health care provider from including in informed consent\n\ndocuments    any      \"[a]spects      about     any   decision     regarding   the\n\npossibility of any act of malpractice by a provider\" or \"legal\n\nclauses     foreign      to   the     sphere     or   field   of    medicine    or\n\nhealth . . . such as, but not limited to, forum selection clauses.\"\n\nArticle 13, Section 8C of Regulation 7504 of May 12, 2008.                     The\n\nRegulation       specifically       provides,    as   a   rationale     for    this\n\nprohibition,       the   notion      that     decisions   regarding     potential\n\nmalpractice suits made by patients while signing informed consent\n\n\n\n     8\n         Public Law No. 194 of August 25, 2000, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n24, §§    3041-3058.\n\n                                        -26-\n\fdocuments    \"may    be   erroneous    in    the    face   of   a   moment   of\n\nvulnerability of the patient, given the health condition of the\n\npatient and dependence on the institution or provider at that given\n\nmoment.\"    In their Reply Brief, appellants attempt to use this\n\nregulation to argue that Puerto Rico public policy forbids HIMA's\n\nactions in this case.\n\n            This argument cuts both ways.          As HIMA points out in its\n\nsur-reply brief, the default position under Article 3 of the Puerto\n\nRico Code is that laws \"shall not have a retroactive effect unless\n\nthey expressly so decree.\"      P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3.           Neither\n\nRegulation 7504 nor its authorizing statute, the Patients' Bill of\n\nRights, purports to apply retroactively; to the contrary, Article\n\n26 of Regulation 7504 expressly provides for its immediate, but not\n\nretroactive, application.       This fact not only forbids appellants\n\nfrom explicitly relying on Regulation 7504 to render the forum\n\nselection clause illegal, but it further calls into question their\n\nassertion that the public policy of Puerto Rico at the time Rivera\n\nsigned the forum selection clause prohibited its inclusion in a\n\nconsent form.       Certainly, whatever its legal status or binding\n\neffect,9 the Regulation is persuasive evidence of Puerto Rico's\n\n\n     9\n       HIMA also argues at length in its sur-reply brief that\nRegulation 7504 is null and void because it was not properly\nadopted in compliance with the requirements of the Puerto Rico\nUniform Administrative Procedures Act, and because OPA did not have\nthe legal authority to issue such a regulation. HIMA has submitted\nan extensive supplemental appendix containing, inter alia, court\ndocuments, briefs, and case law supporting this contention.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fpublic      policy   today.   Given    that    the   regulation   is   neither\n\nretroactive nor written in terms indicating an intent to codify\n\nsome    pre-existing     public   policy     judgment,   it   does   not   help\n\nappellants here.\n\nE.   Waiver of Right to Jury\n\n              Finally, we reject appellants' argument that the forum\n\nselection clause is unenforceable because an individual's waiver of\n\nhis right to trial by jury must be unequivocal.               As the Supreme\n\nCourt held in Minneapolis & St. Louis R.R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241\n\nU.S. 211, 217 (1916), the Seventh Amendment does not apply to civil\n\nproceedings in state court.        For this reason, medical malpractice\n\ncases in the Commonwealth Courts of First Instance may be tried\n\nwithout a jury without offending the Fourteenth Amendment.10                For\n\nthis reason, courts have routinely enforced forum selection clauses\n\nconsenting to venue in jurisdictions where civil cases are not\n\ntried to juries.      See, e.g., Stephen J. Ware, Arbitration Clauses,\n\nJury-Waiver Clauses and Other Contractual Waivers of Constitutional\n\nRights, 67 Law & Contemp. Probs. 167, 189-93 & n. 147 (2004)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n\nBecause we conclude that Regulation 7504 does not apply to this\ncase, we need not consider its validity.\n       10\n        \"It bears noting that adoption of [plaintiffs'] Seventh\nAmendment argument would render contrary to public policy almost\nany forum selection clause providing for resolution in a foreign\nforum, as very few countries provide for jury trials in civil\ncases.\" Holland America Line, Inc. v. Wartsila N. Amer., Inc., 485\nF.3d 450, 457 n.4 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                      -28-\n\f                                        V.\n\n           The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has \"repeatedly recognized\"\n\nthat \"individuals who suffer distress because a relative or loved\n\none is tortiously injured have a cause of action under Article 1802\n\nagainst the tortfeasor.\" Mendez-Matos v. Municip. of Guaynabo, 557\n\nF. 3d 36, 57 (1st Cir. 2009) (quotation marks omitted).             To succeed\n\non such a claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she has suffered\n\nemotional harm caused by the tortious conduct of the defendant\n\ntowards the plaintiff's loved one.             Id.   \"The cause of action is\n\nderivative and depends on the viability of the underlying claim of\n\nthe relative or loved one.\"        Id.       This is the nature of the claim\n\nasserted by Carmen de León Rivera; the complaint alleged that she\n\nhas suffered \"by virtue of Mr. Rivera's conditions.\"\n\n           We have stated that \"claims involving the same operative\n\nfacts\" as a claim for breach of contract that is subject to a forum\n\nselection clause should also be litigated in the forum chosen by\n\nthe parties.   Lambert, 983 F.2d at 1121-22; see also Banco Popular\n\nde Puerto Rico v. Airborne Group PLC, 882 F. Supp. 1213, 1216-17\n\n(D.P.R. 1995) (same).       This is the only sensible outcome when the\n\nrelated cause of action is not only related to, but dependent upon,\n\nthe subject cause of action.        See, e.g., Perez v. Carnival Cruise\n\nLines,   993   F.   Supp.    39,   42    n.5     (D.P.R.   1998)   (dismissing\n\nplaintiff's claims against defendant's insurance companies because\n\nthey were derivative of the cause of action subject to the forum\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fselection clause).      To hold otherwise would be to ignore the\n\nfundamental principle of judicial economy.\n\n                                VI.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f",

The appellants, Florentino Rivera, his wife Carmen de León Rivera, and their conjugal partnership, filed suit against the Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc., which does business as HIMA San Pablo Caguas (\"HIMA\" or \"the hospital\"), in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging medical malpractice. HIMA moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that, pursuant to a forum selection clause contained in two preoperative consent forms signed by Rivera, the Commonwealth Court of First Instance was the exclusive venue for any claims against the hospital. The district court granted HIMA's motion to dismiss based on the forum selection clause. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>Since this appeal arises from a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts\" in the complaint and \"indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability.\" <i>Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On November 9, 2005, Rivera, a 65-year-old male, visited the office of Dr. Marcial Walker to discuss the results of a test indicating elevated levels of PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) in Rivera's blood. Based on the test results, the doctor scheduled Rivera for a prostate biopsy. The biopsy, performed on December 12, 2005, revealed a prostatic adenocarcinomaa tumor in Rivera's prostate. In an appointment after the biopsy, Dr. Walker recommended the surgical removal of Rivera's prostate. The procedure was scheduled for February 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Before the surgery, Rivera was examined by Dr. Lydia Díaz Borrás to determine whether he should receive medical clearance for the procedure. Dr. Díaz Borrás noted that the patient suffered from several medical conditions, including hypertension (high blood pressure) and hyperlipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood stream), and that he exhibited several risk factors for cardiac and pulmonary conditions. Nevertheless, she declared him to be clinically stable for surgery. On February 16, 2006, Rivera also passed a pre-anaesthesia screening.</p>\n<p>The surgery was performed as scheduled on February 21, 2006. However, due to significant blood loss resulting from a hemorrhage during surgery, Rivera required several blood transfusions. The next day, he developed weakness or paralysis on one side of his body and was diagnosed with a \"stroke in evolution,\" i.e., the preliminary stages of a stroke.</p>\n<p>Rivera was discharged on February 27 to an extended care facility, where he remained for five weeks of recovery and rehabilitation. During this time, he received a course of antibiotics to treat a postoperative infection that he had developed at the hospital. After his discharge from the rehabilitation center, Rivera had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Walker, who recommended a second operation to remedy some of the negative effects of the initial procedure. Rivera refused.</p>\n<p>Rivera alleges that, as a result of his treatment at HIMA, he is partially disabled and cannot enjoy life as he did before the surgery. Despite the aid of a leg <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> brace and a cane, he requires assistance to walk, as well as to perform daily tasks such as bathing and eating. When the complaint was filed, Rivera received physical and occupational therapy multiple times a week and expected the disability to be permanent. The complaint also alleges that both Rivera and his wife have endured significant mental anguish as a result of his medical condition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>On February 16, 2007, appellants filed a complaint in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging medical malpractice and breach of the duty of care, and asserting a right to recover damages under Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141 and 5142).<sup>[2]</sup> The complaint named as defendants the hospital, Drs. Walker and Díaz Borrás, several \"placeholder\" defendants representing unidentified individuals who may have contributed to Rivera's injuries, and unidentified insurance companies from whom the hospital had purchased malpractice coverage; the placeholder defendants were to be identified through discovery.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that Rivera had not been informed about many of the less radical alternatives to prostate removal or about the risks and benefits of each treatment option, and therefore that he never gave his informed consent to the operation. Rivera also accused the hospital and the doctors of negligence in the selection and execution of Rivera's course of treatment, including the preoperative evaluations, which the complaint characterized as \"substandard.\" In sum, Rivera claimed that the defendants were jointly and severally liable both for the treatment expenses arising from his postoperative complications and for damages sufficient to compensate him (and his wife) for their physical and mental suffering.</p>\n<p>The hospital filed a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause contained in two different consent forms that Rivera had signed prior to surgery. On February 16, 2006, five days before the operation, Rivera signed a form entitled \"Consent to Administer Anesthesia and Conscious Sedation.\" On February 26, 2006, the day of the procedure itself, he signed an additional \"Consent to Surgery\" form. Both documents contained the following identical clause: \"In the event that by act or omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to me, I expressly agree to submit to the Jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, for any possible claim.\" On both forms, this clause was in boldface type and surrounded by a box that set it apart from the rest of the text. Each document further required that Rivera specifically place his initials next to the forum selection clause and also that he separately sign under a certification that: \"this consent has been explained to me and to my entire satisfaction and that I understand the content of this form, that I have read and I have been given a copy of the same, thus, I accept its terms as patient....\"</p>\n<p>In its motion to dismiss, HIMA argued that, pursuant to the forum selection clause, the Commonwealth Court of First Instance was the exclusive venue for Rivera's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> claims against the hospital. In reply, Rivera argued that the consent forms should not be considered freely negotiated contracts; that, as a general matter, forum selection clauses should not be enforced in medical malpractice cases; and, in the alternative, that at least Rivera's wife, as a non-signatory, should not be bound by the forum selection clause in the consent form. The district court granted the motion to dismiss. Rivera appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In this circuit, we treat a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause as a motion alleging the failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Silva v. Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.,</i> 239 F.3d 385, 387 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.2001); <i>compare </i><i>Lipcon v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London,</i> 148 F.3d 1285, 1289-90 (11th Cir.1998) (describing the circuits' varying approaches to motions to dismiss on the basis of forum selection clauses and concluding that such motions are most properly brought under Rule 12(b)(3)). We review the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo. <i>Vernet v. Serrano-Torres,</i> 566 F.3d 254, 258 (1st Cir.2009). In such cases, the district court must \"accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" <i>LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 142 F.3d 507, 508 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The fact that a motion to dismiss on the basis of a forum selection clause is treated as a 12(b)(6) motion has certain consequences for the materials that a district court may appropriately consider when ruling on such a motion. \"Under Rule 12(b)(6), the district court may properly consider only facts and documents that are part of or incorporated into the complaint; if matters outside the pleadings are considered, the motion must be decided under the more stringent standards applicable to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Trans-Spec Truck Serv., Inc. v. Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> 524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) ..., matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\"). We have recognized an exception to this rule \"for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official public records; for documents central to plaintiffs' claim; or for documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,\" which courts may properly consider on 12(b)(6) motions. <i>Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). If, however, the supplemental materials submitted to the district court fall outside this narrow class of documents, and the court chooses to consider them using Rule 12(d)'s conversion procedure, \"[a]ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d).</p>\n<p>Here, appellants' original complaint did not mention the forum selection clause, nor did it include copies of the consent forms as an exhibit to the complaint. Instead, the consent forms containing the forum selection clause were first brought to the district court's attention on the hospital's motion to dismiss the complaint. In their opposition to the motion, appellants did not challenge the authenticity of the documents, but instead introduced allegations that Rivera's consent to the forum selection clause was obtained by fraud or overreaching. These allegations were supported <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> by affidavits from Mr. and Mrs. Rivera. Additionally, appellants argued that the court should treat the hospital's motion as one for summary judgment and allow appellants to conduct further discovery regarding the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p>The following week, appellants commendably sought leave to file an amended complaint that would, among other things, \"supplement the allegations [in the complaint] concerning lack of informed consent\" and include the affidavits from Rivera and his wife, \"so that [the] averments may be considered pleadings in the true sense of the word.\" It was not until months later, in its decision granting the motion to dismiss, that the district court also \"abstain[ed] from deciding\" on plaintiffs' pending motion to amend. Appellants do not now challenge this disposition indeed, it is unclear whether the decision to abstain would even be appealable as an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p>However, in spite of the district court's disposition of appellants' request to amend their pleadings and an explicit statement that it would consider only the factual summary in the plaintiffs' original complaint and the two consent forms themselves, the court's actions belied its statements. In fact, the court expressly considered the factual allegations of overreaching found in appellants' amended complaint and their opposition to the motion to dismiss. By considering appellants' factual allegations, the court effectively converted the hospital's motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. On appeal, neither side objects to the court's consideration of factual allegations beyond the complaint or to the fact that the parties did not receive notice, pursuant to Rule 12(d), that it intended to do so. Appellants continue to press the same factual allegations on appeal. Accordingly, while we do not endorse the district court's treatment of the motion to dismiss (i.e., its <i>sub silentio</i> conversion into a motion for summary judgment), we accept it for the purposes of this appeal. We are particularly comfortable doing so in this instance because, as we discuss below, even accepting the allegations in the affidavits as true, they would not suffice to prove the kind of fraud or overreaching required to render the forum selection clause unenforceable.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at 388 (\"[W]e are not bound by the label below, and agree that the case should have been dismissed.\") (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Although this is a suit based on diversity, we need not reach the unsettled issue of whether \"forum selection clauses are to be treated as substantive or procedural for <i>Erie</i> purposes.\" <i>Lambert v. Kysar,</i> 983 F.2d 1110, 1116 &amp; n. 10 (1st Cir.1993). This is because \"there is no conflict between federal common law and Puerto Rico law regarding the enforceability of forum-selection clauses.\" <i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> at 387 n. 1; <i>see also id.</i> (noting that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has adopted federal jurisprudence regarding the general enforceability of forum selection clauses). We therefore apply federal common law.</p>\n<p>Under federal law, the threshold question in interpreting a forum selection clause is whether the clause at issue is permissive or mandatory. \"Permissive forum selection clauses, often described as `consent to jurisdiction' clauses, authorize jurisdiction and venue in a designated forum, but do not prohibit litigation elsewhere... In contrast, mandatory forum selection clauses contain clear language indicating that jurisdiction and venue are appropriate exclusively in the designated forum.\" 14D Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 3803.1 (3d ed.1998). Rivera argues that the clause in HIMA's consent forms was permissive; that it was intended only to affirmatively confer jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth Court of First Instance, and should not be interpreted to limit the jurisdiction of federal district courts. We reject that assertion.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Redondo Constr. Corp. v. Banco Exterior de España, S.A.,</i> 11 F.3d 3 (1st Cir.1993), we considered language providing that \"each [party] hereby expressly submits to jurisdiction of all Federal and State Courts located in the State of Florida.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5 (emphasis omitted). We explained that \"[a]ffirmatively conferring Florida jurisdiction by consent does not negatively exclude any other proper jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. Similarly, in <i>Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica de Puerto Rico v. Ericsson, Inc.,</i> 201 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.2000), the clause at issue stated: \"This contract will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the Laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and <i>the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 18 (emphasis added). Citing <i>Redondo,</i> we again concluded that the contractual language was merely an affirmative conferral of jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth courts, particularly in light of the fact that Ericsson, which was not the originator of the provision, was incorporated and had its principal place of business outside of Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, it made sense that the drafter of the contract and eventual plaintiff, the Power Authority of Puerto Rico, would require Ericsson to consent to the jurisdiction of the Puerto Rico courts in the event of any dispute, thereby obviating the need for any personal jurisdiction analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the forum selection clause in HIMA's consent form shares the \"agree to submit\" language with the two cases invoked by appellants. However, \"words are not viewed in isolation within a contract.\" <i>McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 391 F.3d 287, 298 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability Plan,</i> 70 F.3d 173, 179 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that \"[a]ccepted canons of construction forbid the balkanization of contracts for interpretive purposes\" (citing <i>Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp.,</i> 892 F.2d 1076, 1084 (1st Cir.1989))). Moreover, there is no \"general rule for forum-selection clauses[;]\" rather, we \"base[ ] our conclusion on the specific language of the contract at issue.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> 388. Here, unlike in <i>Redondo</i> or <i>Ericsson,</i> the \"expressly agree to submit\" language is preceded and informed by a qualifying phrase: \"<i>In the event that by act or omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to me,</i> I expressly agree to submit ....\" (emphasis added). That is, the consent form required Rivera to <i>assert</i> any causes of action that he may have against the hospital in the Commonwealth courts. In contrast, by assenting to the clauses in <i>Redondo</i> and <i>Ericsson,</i> both of which lacked a similar introductory phrase, the signatories consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over themselves <i>as defendants</i> in order to avoid the personal jurisdiction analysis that would otherwise be required for out-of-state defendants. This difference in context is determinative, and we therefore conclude that the forum selection clause is mandatory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>\"Contractual provisions undertaking to provide where a suit may be brought in disputes arising out of the agreement are not uncommon.\" 14D <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 3803.1. It is well established that forum selection clauses \"are prima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to be `unreasonable' under the circumstances.\" <i>M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co.,</i> 407 U.S. 1, 10, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972); <i>see also </i><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at 386. More specifically, a forum selection clause should be enforced unless the resisting party can show \"that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching ... [or that] enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought, whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.\" <i>M/S Bremen,</i> 407 U.S. at 15, 92 S.Ct. 1907. We therefore inquire whether appellants have overcome this strong presumption of enforceability, considering each of their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Nature of Consent Form/Nature of Action</h2>\n<p>Appellants claim that forum selection clauses, which are contractual in nature, cannot be included in medical consent forms which are designed to comply with physicians' obligations under Puerto Rico law to obtain informed consent to medical procedures. They argue that the forum selection clause, thus placed in an informed consent form, is unreasonable and contrary to public policy for that reason alone and therefore should not be enforced.</p>\n<p>This argument is too broad. Appellants cite no legal authority so holding. The placement of the forum selection clause in a consent form is just one of the factors to be considered in assessing a claim that enforcement of the clause is unreasonable under the circumstances. Absent a finding of procedural or substantive unconscionability, courts have repeatedly enforced forum selection clauses and arbitration agreements found in consent forms and similar documents. <i>See, e.g., Wilcox v. Lexington Eye Inst.,</i> No. 53871-3-I, 2005 WL 1964481, at *8 (Wash. Ct.App. Aug.15, 2005) (enforcing forum selection clause in surgical consent form); <i>Covenant Health Rehab. of Picayune, L.P. v. Brown,</i> 949 So.2d 732, 741 (Miss.2007) (enforcing those provisions of arbitration agreement contained in nursing home admissions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> form that were not found to be unconscionable); <i>see also </i><i>Wilkerson ex rel. Estate of Wilkerson v. Nelson,</i> 395 F.Supp.2d 281, 284 (M.D.N.C.2005) (enforcing arbitration clause contained in \"a form typically furnished to and completed by patients while in the waiting room\" that also included statement of financial responsibility and insurance authorization).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, appellants argue that it would be inappropriate to hold Rivera to the forum selection clause because their lawsuit was a tort action and not a breach of contract action. They state that the district court's reliance on contract cases like <i>Silva</i><sup>[6]</sup> is unjustified because \"the present case is a tort case, which carries with it entirely different public policy considerationsa patient's life, health and well being.\" That argument is also unpersuasive. The applicability of a forum selection clause does not depend on the nature of the underlying action. One of the classic Supreme Court cases concerning forum selection clauses, <i>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute,</i> 499 U.S. 585, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991), enforced a non-negotiated forum selection provision contained in the passengers' cruise tickets in a personal injury action. Courts have routinely followed that example.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is the language of the forum selection clause itself that determines which claims fall within its scope. Here, the provision plainly requires that a suit sounding in tort must be brought according to its terms: \"In the event that by act or omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to me, I expressly agree to submit to the Jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, for any possible claim.\" Indeed, this language specifically contemplates its applicability to a malpractice claim. Accordingly, the nature of the instant action does not preclude enforcement of the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Forum Selection Clause as a Contract of Adhesion</h2>\n<p>Appellants claim that if it is proper for the consent forms to include contractual terms, then the forum selection clause is a contract of adhesion,<sup>[7]</sup> \"to be construed against [its] drafter, and [is] therefore invalid.\" The mere fact that a contract is one of adhesion does not render it per se unenforceable, as appellants' argument would suggest. \"[A]dhesion does not imply nullity of a contract.\" <i>Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co. of P.R.,</i> 964 F.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir.1992) (citation omitted). \"If the wording of the contract is explicit and its language is clear, its terms and conditions are binding on the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> (collecting Puerto Rico cases); <i>see also </i><i>Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson,</i> 229 F.3d 321, 331 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[O]f course, even a contract of adhesion is enforced unless unconscionable or unfair.\"). Here, because the import of the forum selection provision is clear, \"we do not have to address whether the ... doctrine of <i>contra preferentum</i> applies.\" <i>Pelletier v. Yellow Transp., Inc.,</i> 549 F.3d 578, 582 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. M.V. DSR Atl.,</i> 131 F.3d 1336, 1339 (9th Cir.1997) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> (\"As we find no ambiguity in the forum clause, whether or not [the contract] is a contract of adhesion is of no relevance to the result we reach in this matter.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Fraud and Overreaching</h2>\n<p>Appellants argue that \"the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.\" <i>M/S Bremen,</i> 407 U.S. at 15, 92 S.Ct. 1907. In support of this claim, they cite the affidavits submitted to the district court by Rivera and his wife, which were essentially identical. Florentino Rivera's affidavit stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>5. It was not explained to me by anyone at HIMA that by signing the ... documents I was renouncing to file a case before the Federal District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Said document does not state that I am renouncing to file a case before the Federal District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. When signing these forms I thought I was merely authorizing the anaesthesia and the operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. I do not know the difference between the Courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. I was not informed, at any time prior to the signing of these forms that I was waiving his [sic] right to a trial by jury, as I thought that the Courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have juries in all cases, as is my common knowledge of the Courts in the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. I was not advised that I could consult this waiver of my rights with an attorney, nor did I understand that I needed to do so, because in my mind I was not waiving any rights, I was simply consenting to the operation and the anaesthesia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. Should an opportunity been [sic] afforded for me to seek legal advice on the matter, I would not have signed either of the forms and would have either demanded that the waiver language be removed or gone elsewhere for the operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. I did not negotiate in any way, form or manner what is written in those documents, I was just demanded from the hospital personnel to sign in order to have the operation.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Fraud</h2>\n<p>A contract is voidable (and thus unenforceable) if \"a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 164 (1979) (cited in <i>Nash v. Trustees of Boston Univ.,</i> 946 F.2d 960, 967 (1st Cir.1991)). Rivera's averments do not describe fraud. They say only that (1) no one verbally explained the forum selection clause to appellants or told them that they could consult an attorney; (2) appellants did not attempt to negotiate the clause in any way, but, \"should an opportunity [have] been afforded\" to seek legal counsel, appellants would have either asked that the clause be removed or sought treatment elsewhere; and (3) appellants ultimately misunderstood the forms and their implications. In essence, the affidavit describes the absence of an explanation about the significance of the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p>This omission, in the circumstances here, cannot serve as a basis for a misrepresentation claim:</p>\n<blockquote>The assertion `I didn't know what was in the contract that I signed' is made by litigants frequently but almost never successfully. Absent fraud, a person is deemed to know the contents of a contract that he or she signs.... Thus whether plaintiffs actually knew of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> arbitration clause in their contracts is irrelevant; that knowledge is imputed as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Parler v. KFC Corp.,</i> 529 F.Supp.2d 1009, 1014 (D.Minn.2008) That logic applies here as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Overreaching</h2>\n<p>\"[A]lthough there is some ambiguity as to the precise boundaries of what constitutes `overreaching,' a nebulous concept at best,\" <i>Haynsworth v. The Corporation,</i> 121 F.3d 956, 965 (5th Cir.1997), we understand \"overreaching\" to refer to one party's unfair exploitation of its overwhelming bargaining power or influence over the other party. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at 389 (inquiring whether one party inappropriately used its bargaining power to coerce or exploit another); <i>Ginter ex rel. Ballard v. Belcher, Prendergast, &amp; Laporte,</i> 536 F.3d 439, 449 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2008) (Dennis, J., dissenting) (evidencing similar understanding of overreaching); <i>Outek Caribbean Distrib., Inc. v. Echo, Inc.,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d 263, 267 (D.P.R.2002) (same). But the mere fact of this inequality is not enough to render an agreement unenforceable. <i>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> 500 U.S. 20, 32, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) (making this observation in context of agreement to arbitrate); <i>Outek Caribbean,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 267. The reference in <i>M/S Bremen</i> to \"<i>undue</i> influence,\" and \"<i>overweening</i> bargaining power,\" 407 U.S. at 12, 92 S.Ct. 1907 (emphasis added), is instructive. There must be some evidence that the party has exploited this bargaining power in a way that the courts will not tolerate. <i>Outek Caribbean,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 267.</p>\n<p>Similarly, contrary to appellants' suggestion, \"overreaching must be based on something more than the mere fact that the clause was a `boilerplate' provision printed on the back of a form contract. As noted in our discussion of the contract of adhesion claim, it is not the law that one must bargain for each and every written term of a contract.\" <i>Lambert,</i> 983 F.2d at 1120 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For this reason, \"the fact that a contract was in boilerplate form will not, by itself, render it unfair or invalid.\" <i>Outek Caribbean,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 267; <i>see also </i><i>Carnival Cruise Lines,</i> 499 U.S. at 593, 111 S.Ct. 1522 (mere fact that term in contract was not negotiated does not make it unenforceable); <i>Diaz-Rosado v. Auto-Wax Co., Inc.,</i> No. Civ. 04-2296, 2005 WL 2138794, at *3 (D.P.R.2005). Put another way, although appellants emphasize \"the relative disparity in the bargaining positions of the parties ..., the presumption in favor of enforcing a forum selection clause applies even if the clause was not the product of negotiation.\" <i>2215 Fifth St. Assocs., LP v. U-Haul Intern., Inc.,</i> 148 F.Supp.2d 50, 56 (D.D.C.2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, the district court of Puerto Rico has enforced a forum selection clause printed in English on a cruise ticket where the passenger spoke only Spanish because \"[t]he examination of the circumstances surrounding the passengers' purchase and retention of the contract, does not depend upon actual knowledge of the terms in the contract of passage, but focuses instead on the opportunity for such knowledge.\" <i>De La Mota Estrella v. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Inc.,</i> 2006 WL 2601657, at *3 (D.P.R.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>There are certainly suggestions of overreaching here. Rivera's relationship with the hospital grew out of a grave medical condition. He was likely more focused on that medical condition than the significance of the documents that he was asked to sign. He was not thinking about possible lawsuits. This reality in cases like this one undoubtedly prompted the Puerto Rico Office of the Patient Advocate, subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> to the filing of this lawsuit, to promulgate a regulation prohibiting the practice of including a forum selection clause in an informed consent document. <i>See</i> Part IV. D.2, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite this regulatory initiative, the federal common law of overreaching as it presently stands convinces us that this is not a case where the presumption in favor of enforcing a forum selection clause is overcome. The language of the clause was clear. The clause was in bold print and marked off from the rest of the one-page form by a special box. It was not \"buried in fine print\" or otherwise obscured. The clause required the patient to signal his assent by placing his initials next to it. <i>See </i><i>Wilkerson,</i> 395 F.Supp.2d at 287 (rejecting plaintiff's argument that arbitration clause must be separately negotiated and finding \"no claim of ambiguity\" where \"[p]laintiff signed the form on the separate signature line before the arbitration clause\").</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Rivera signaled his assent to the forum selection clause on two separate occasions, the first of which was five days before his surgical procedure. During the five days between his signing of the \"Consent to Administer Anesthesia and Conscious Sedation\" form and the \"Consent to Surgery\" form on the day of his operation, Rivera had the opportunity to consult an attorney regarding the forum selection clause, and to consider his assent to it outside the pressures of a hospital setting. He also had the option of going to another hospital. Under all of these circumstances, we reject appellants' argument that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because the Hospital procured Rivera's consent by unfairly exploiting its bargaining advantage. <i>See, e.g., Wilcox,</i> 128 Wash.App. 1071, 2005 WL 1964481, at *2-3 (rejecting plaintiff's argument that forum selection clause should not be enforced due to \"undue influence,\" and \"overweening bargaining power,\" where she had the opportunity to read the consent form in advance of her surgery and again on the day of the procedure, the clause was clearly written, and plaintiff's signature appeared directly underneath the forum selection provision).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Public Policy</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The General Argument</h2>\n<p>In their opening brief, appellants make the general argument that to enforce a forum selection clause like the one at issue here would \"go[] against the social order that as a civilized society, we are obligated to try to maintain.\" Elaborating on this contention, they state that in the context of hospital consent forms, \"the application of a rule that a party has a duty to read the provisions of a form before he signs it and hence is bound by all provisions therein raises significant public policy concerns.\" We disagree. It simply cannot be the case that, absent fraud, coercion, or overreachingwhich we have determined were absent from this scenarioit would violate public policy to hold an individual to a clearly stated forum selection clause in a one-page document.</p>\n<p>The fact that this document was signed in a health care context is not, in and of itself, determinative. \"It is ... significant to note that no court has ever reached the broad conclusion that public policy precludes the use of private arbitration agreements in the area of medical services.\" <i>Buraczynski v. Eyring,</i> 919 S.W.2d 314, 318 (Tenn.1996) (citations omitted). The clause at issue here merely provides an alternative judicial forum for appellants' complaint, rather than an entirely different adjudicative process. It would be a strange outcome indeed if we found that it violated public policy to require two parties to litigate their claims in the Commonwealth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> courts when their interactions took place exclusively in Puerto Rico and their relationship was governed by the tort law of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Regulation 7504</h2>\n<p>On May 12, 2008, after initial briefing in this case had been completed, the Office of the Patient's Advocate of Puerto Rico (OPA) passed Regulation No. 7504, entitled \"Regulation for the Implementation of the Provisions of Public Law Number 194, enacted August 25, 2000, as amended, `Puerto Rico Patients' Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.'\"<sup>[8]</sup> Among other things, this regulation prohibits a health care provider from including in informed consent documents any \"[a]spects about any decision regarding the possibility of any act of malpractice by a provider\" or \"legal clauses foreign to the sphere or field of medicine or health ... such as, but not limited to, forum selection clauses.\" Article 13, Section 8C of Regulation 7504 of May 12, 2008. The Regulation specifically provides, as a rationale for this prohibition, the notion that decisions regarding potential malpractice suits made by patients while signing informed consent documents \"may be erroneous in the face of a moment of vulnerability of the patient, given the health condition of the patient and dependence on the institution or provider at that given moment.\" In their Reply Brief, appellants attempt to use this regulation to argue that Puerto Rico public policy forbids HIMA's actions in this case.</p>\n<p>This argument cuts both ways. As HIMA points out in its sur-reply brief, the default position under Article 3 of the Puerto Rico Code is that laws \"shall not have a retroactive effect unless they expressly so decree.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3. Neither Regulation 7504 nor its authorizing statute, the Patients' Bill of Rights, purports to apply retroactively; to the contrary, Article 26 of Regulation 7504 expressly provides for its immediate, but not retroactive, application. This fact not only forbids appellants from explicitly relying on Regulation 7504 to render the forum selection clause illegal, but it further calls into question their assertion that the public policy of Puerto Rico at the time Rivera signed the forum selection clause prohibited its inclusion in a consent form. Certainly, whatever its legal status or binding effect,<sup>[9]</sup> the Regulation is persuasive evidence of Puerto Rico's public policy <i>today.</i> Given that the regulation is neither retroactive nor written in terms indicating an intent to codify some pre-existing public policy judgment, it does not help appellants here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Waiver of Right to Jury</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reject appellants' argument that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because an individual's waiver of his right to trial by jury must be unequivocal. As the Supreme Court held in <i>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R.R. Co. v. Bombolis,</i> 241 U.S. 211, 217, 36 S.Ct. 595, 60 L.Ed. 961 (1916), the Seventh Amendment does not apply to civil proceedings in state court. For this reason, medical malpractice cases in the Commonwealth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> Courts of First Instance may be tried without a jury without offending the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[10]</sup> For this reason, courts have routinely enforced forum selection clauses consenting to venue in jurisdictions where civil cases are not tried to juries. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Stephen J. Ware, <i>Arbitration Clauses, Jury-Waiver Clauses and Other Contractual Waivers of Constitutional Rights,</i> 67 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 167, 189-93 &amp; n. 147 (2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has \"repeatedly recognized\" that \"individuals who suffer distress because a relative or loved one is tortiously injured have a cause of action under Article 1802 against the tortfeasor.\" <i>Mendez-Matos v. Municip. of Guaynabo,</i> 557 F.3d 36, 57 (1st Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). To succeed on such a claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she has suffered emotional harm caused by the tortious conduct of the defendant towards the plaintiff's loved one. <i>Id.</i> \"The cause of action is derivative and depends on the viability of the underlying claim of the relative or loved one.\" <i>Id.</i> This is the nature of the claim asserted by Carmen de León Rivera; the complaint alleged that she has suffered \"by virtue of Mr. Rivera's conditions.\"</p>\n<p>We have stated that \"claims involving the same operative facts\" as a claim for breach of contract that is subject to a forum selection clause should also be litigated in the forum chosen by the parties. <i>Lambert,</i> 983 F.2d at 1121-22; <i>see also </i><i>Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Airborne Group PLC,</i> 882 F.Supp. 1212, 1216-17 (D.P.R.1995) (same). This is the only sensible outcome when the related cause of action is not only related to, but dependent upon, the subject cause of action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Perez v. Carnival Cruise Lines,</i> 993 F.Supp. 39, 42 n. 5 (D.P.R.1998) (dismissing plaintiff's claims against defendant's insurance companies because they were derivative of the cause of action subject to the forum selection clause). To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fundamental principle of judicial economy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As we discuss below, certain procedural irregularities distinguish this case from the run-of-the-mill 12(b)(6) dismissal. Those irregularities do not affect this factual summary.</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 5141 provides generally that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" Section 5142 embodies the principle of respondeat superior, and provides, inter alia, that \"[t]he obligation imposed by § 5141 of this title is demandable, not only for personal acts and omissions, but also for those of the persons for whom they should be responsible.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Relatedly, appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to allow them to conduct additional discovery on the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of the forum selection clause in the consent documents. Even interpreting the district court's actions as a sua sponte conversion of the 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment, we find that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that additional discovery was unnecessary because we find that none of appellants' allegations, even if substantiated, would render the forum selection clause unenforceable. <i>Cf. </i><i>Adorno v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co.,</i> 443 F.3d 122, 127-8 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that, in the Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) context, a motion for additional discovery must establish that the facts sought would influence the outcome of the motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p>[4]  HIMA argues that Rivera waived this permissive/mandatory argument below. We disagree.</p>\n<p>[5]  For the same reason, we reject appellant's argument that the absence of \"typical mandatory terms\" such as \"shall,\" \"exclusive,\" \"only,\" or \"must\" requires a contrary result. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Summit Packaging Sys., Inc. v. Kenyon</i> <i>&amp; Kenyon,</i> 273 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that term in contract providing that parties \"will submit\" their dispute to a specified forum implied the exclusion of all other forums).</p>\n<p>[6]  In <i>Silva,</i> we held that a forum selection clause contained in an employment contract between a corporation and an independent contractor was mandatory, valid, and enforceable. 239 F.3d at 386.</p>\n<p>[7]  A contract of adhesion is a contract \"offered by the authoring party on a take it or leave it basis rather than being negotiated between the parties.\" <i>Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Donovan,</i> 916 F.2d 372, 377 (7th Cir.1990) (applying federal common law) (citing Todd S. Rakoff, <i>Contracts of Adhesion: An Essay in Reconstruction,</i> 96 Harv L.Rev. 1174, 1242-43 (1983)).</p>\n<p>[8]  Public Law No. 194 of August 25, 2000, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, §§ 3041-3058.</p>\n<p>[9]  HIMA also argues at length in its sur-reply brief that Regulation 7504 is null and void because it was not properly adopted in compliance with the requirements of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, and because OPA did not have the legal authority to issue such a regulation. HIMA has submitted an extensive supplemental appendix containing, inter alia, court documents, briefs, and case law supporting this contention. Because we conclude that Regulation 7504 does not apply to this case, we need not consider its validity.</p>\n<p>[10]  \"It bears noting that adoption of [plaintiffs'] Seventh Amendment argument would render contrary to public policy almost any forum selection clause providing for resolution in a foreign forum, as very few countries provide for jury trials in civil cases.\" <i>Holland America Line, Inc. v. Wartsila N. Amer., Inc.,</i> 485 F.3d 450, 457 n. 4 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n\n</div>",

The appellants, Florentino Rivera, his wife Carmen de León Rivera, and their conjugal partnership, filed suit against the Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc., which does business as HIMA San Pablo Caguas (\"HIMA\" or \"the hospital\"), in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging medical malpractice. HIMA moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that, pursuant to a forum selection clause contained in two preoperative consent forms signed by Rivera, the Commonwealth Court of First Instance was the exclusive venue for any claims against the hospital. The district court granted HIMA's motion to dismiss based on the forum selection clause. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>Since this appeal arises from a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we \"assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts\" in the complaint and \"indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability.\" <i>Centro Médico de Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/201545/centro-medico-del-v-feliciano-de-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On November 9, 2005, Rivera, a 65-year-old male, visited the office of Dr. Marcial Walker to discuss the results of a test indicating elevated levels of PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) in Rivera's blood. Based on the test results, the doctor scheduled Rivera for a prostate biopsy. The biopsy, performed on December 12, 2005, revealed a prostatic adenocarcinomaa tumor in Rivera's prostate. In an appointment after the biopsy, Dr. Walker recommended the surgical removal of Rivera's prostate. The procedure was scheduled for February 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Before the surgery, Rivera was examined by Dr. Lydia Díaz Borrás to determine whether he should receive medical clearance for the procedure. Dr. Díaz Borrás noted that the patient suffered from several medical conditions, including hypertension (high blood pressure) and hyperlipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood stream), and that he exhibited several risk factors for cardiac and pulmonary conditions. Nevertheless, she declared him to be clinically stable for surgery. On February 16, 2006, Rivera also passed a pre-anaesthesia screening.</p>\n<p>The surgery was performed as scheduled on February 21, 2006. However, due to significant blood loss resulting from a hemorrhage during surgery, Rivera required several blood transfusions. The next day, he developed weakness or paralysis on one side of his body and was diagnosed with a \"stroke in evolution,\" i.e., the preliminary stages of a stroke.</p>\n<p>Rivera was discharged on February 27 to an extended care facility, where he remained for five weeks of recovery and rehabilitation. During this time, he received a course of antibiotics to treat a postoperative infection that he had developed at the hospital. After his discharge from the rehabilitation center, Rivera had a follow-up appointment with Dr. Walker, who recommended a second operation to remedy some of the negative effects of the initial procedure. Rivera refused.</p>\n<p>Rivera alleges that, as a result of his treatment at HIMA, he is partially disabled and cannot enjoy life as he did before the surgery. Despite the aid of a leg <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> brace and a cane, he requires assistance to walk, as well as to perform daily tasks such as bathing and eating. When the complaint was filed, Rivera received physical and occupational therapy multiple times a week and expected the disability to be permanent. The complaint also alleges that both Rivera and his wife have endured significant mental anguish as a result of his medical condition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>On February 16, 2007, appellants filed a complaint in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging medical malpractice and breach of the duty of care, and asserting a right to recover damages under Articles 1802 and 1803 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141 and 5142).<sup>[2]</sup> The complaint named as defendants the hospital, Drs. Walker and Díaz Borrás, several \"placeholder\" defendants representing unidentified individuals who may have contributed to Rivera's injuries, and unidentified insurance companies from whom the hospital had purchased malpractice coverage; the placeholder defendants were to be identified through discovery.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that Rivera had not been informed about many of the less radical alternatives to prostate removal or about the risks and benefits of each treatment option, and therefore that he never gave his informed consent to the operation. Rivera also accused the hospital and the doctors of negligence in the selection and execution of Rivera's course of treatment, including the preoperative evaluations, which the complaint characterized as \"substandard.\" In sum, Rivera claimed that the defendants were jointly and severally liable both for the treatment expenses arising from his postoperative complications and for damages sufficient to compensate him (and his wife) for their physical and mental suffering.</p>\n<p>The hospital filed a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause contained in two different consent forms that Rivera had signed prior to surgery. On February 16, 2006, five days before the operation, Rivera signed a form entitled \"Consent to Administer Anesthesia and Conscious Sedation.\" On February 26, 2006, the day of the procedure itself, he signed an additional \"Consent to Surgery\" form. Both documents contained the following identical clause: \"In the event that by act or omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to me, I expressly agree to submit to the Jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, for any possible claim.\" On both forms, this clause was in boldface type and surrounded by a box that set it apart from the rest of the text. Each document further required that Rivera specifically place his initials next to the forum selection clause and also that he separately sign under a certification that: \"this consent has been explained to me and to my entire satisfaction and that I understand the content of this form, that I have read and I have been given a copy of the same, thus, I accept its terms as patient....\"</p>\n<p>In its motion to dismiss, HIMA argued that, pursuant to the forum selection clause, the Commonwealth Court of First Instance was the exclusive venue for Rivera's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> claims against the hospital. In reply, Rivera argued that the consent forms should not be considered freely negotiated contracts; that, as a general matter, forum selection clauses should not be enforced in medical malpractice cases; and, in the alternative, that at least Rivera's wife, as a non-signatory, should not be bound by the forum selection clause in the consent form. The district court granted the motion to dismiss. Rivera appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In this circuit, we treat a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause as a motion alleging the failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Silva v.

In such cases, the district court must \"accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" <i>LaChapelle v.

Caterpillar, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203275\"><a href=\"/opinion/203275/trans-spec-truck-service-inc-v-caterpillar-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 321 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) ..., matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\"). We have recognized an exception to this rule \"for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official public records; for documents central to plaintiffs' claim; or for documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,\" which courts may properly consider on 12(b)(6) motions. <i>Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins.

If, however, the supplemental materials submitted to the district court fall outside this narrow class of documents, and the court chooses to consider them using Rule 12(d)'s conversion procedure, \"[a]ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d).</p>\n<p>Here, appellants' original complaint did not mention the forum selection clause, nor did it include copies of the consent forms as an exhibit to the complaint. Instead, the consent forms containing the forum selection clause were first brought to the district court's attention on the hospital's motion to dismiss the complaint. In their opposition to the motion, appellants did not challenge the authenticity of the documents, but instead introduced allegations that Rivera's consent to the forum selection clause was obtained by fraud or overreaching. These allegations were supported <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> by affidavits from Mr. and Mrs. Rivera. Additionally, appellants argued that the court should treat the hospital's motion as one for summary judgment and allow appellants to conduct further discovery regarding the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p>The following week, appellants commendably sought leave to file an amended complaint that would, among other things, \"supplement the allegations [in the complaint] concerning lack of informed consent\" and include the affidavits from Rivera and his wife, \"so that [the] averments may be considered pleadings in the true sense of the word.\" It was not until months later, in its decision granting the motion to dismiss, that the district court also \"abstain[ed] from deciding\" on plaintiffs' pending motion to amend. Appellants do not now challenge this disposition indeed, it is unclear whether the decision to abstain would even be appealable as an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p>However, in spite of the district court's disposition of appellants' request to amend their pleadings and an explicit statement that it would consider only the factual summary in the plaintiffs' original complaint and the two consent forms themselves, the court's actions belied its statements. In fact, the court expressly considered the factual allegations of overreaching found in appellants' amended complaint and their opposition to the motion to dismiss. By considering appellants' factual allegations, the court effectively converted the hospital's motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. On appeal, neither side objects to the court's consideration of factual allegations beyond the complaint or to the fact that the parties did not receive notice, pursuant to Rule 12(d), that it intended to do so. Appellants continue to press the same factual allegations on appeal. Accordingly, while we do not endorse the district court's treatment of the motion to dismiss (i.e., its <i>sub silentio</i> conversion into a motion for summary judgment), we accept it for the purposes of this appeal. We are particularly comfortable doing so in this instance because, as we discuss below, even accepting the allegations in the affidavits as true, they would not suffice to prove the kind of fraud or overreaching required to render the forum selection clause unenforceable.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at 388 (\"[W]e are not bound by the label below, and agree that the case should have been dismissed.\") (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Although this is a suit based on diversity, we need not reach the unsettled issue of whether \"forum selection clauses are to be treated as substantive or procedural for <i>Erie</i> purposes.\" <i>Lambert v. Kysar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598967\"><a href=\"/opinion/598967/george-lambert-dba-rainbow-fruit-v-sam-kysar-and-joan-kysar-dba/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1116 &amp; n. 10 (1st Cir.1993). This is because \"there is no conflict between federal common law and Puerto Rico law regarding the enforceability of forum-selection clauses.\" <i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> at 387 n. 1; <i>see also id.</i> (noting that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has adopted federal jurisprudence regarding the general enforceability of forum selection clauses). We therefore apply federal common law.</p>\n<p>Under federal law, the threshold question in interpreting a forum selection clause is whether the clause at issue is permissive or mandatory. \"Permissive forum selection clauses, often described as `consent to jurisdiction' clauses, authorize jurisdiction and venue in a designated forum, but do not prohibit litigation elsewhere... In contrast, mandatory forum selection clauses contain clear language indicating that jurisdiction and venue are appropriate exclusively in the designated forum.\" 14D Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 3803.1 (3d ed.1998). Rivera argues that the clause in HIMA's consent forms was permissive; that it was intended only to affirmatively confer jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth Court of First Instance, and should not be interpreted to limit the jurisdiction of federal district courts. We reject that assertion.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Redondo Constr. Corp. v. Banco Exterior de España, S.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195055\"><a href=\"/opinion/195055/redondo-construction-v-banco-exterior/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), we considered language providing that \"each [party] hereby expressly submits to jurisdiction of all Federal and State Courts located in the State of Florida.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5 (emphasis omitted). We explained that \"[a]ffirmatively conferring Florida jurisdiction by consent does not negatively exclude any other proper jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6. Similarly, in <i>Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica de Puerto Rico v. Ericsson, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767329\"><a href=\"/opinion/767329/autoridad-de-energ-a-electrica-de-puerto-rico-v-ericsson-inc-fka/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000), the clause at issue stated: \"This contract will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the Laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and <i>the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 18 (emphasis added). Citing <i>Redondo,</i> we again concluded that the contractual language was merely an affirmative conferral of jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth courts, particularly in light of the fact that Ericsson, which was not the originator of the provision, was incorporated and had its principal place of business outside of Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, it made sense that the drafter of the contract and eventual plaintiff, the Power Authority of Puerto Rico, would require Ericsson to consent to the jurisdiction of the Puerto Rico courts in the event of any dispute, thereby obviating the need for any personal jurisdiction analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the forum selection clause in HIMA's consent form shares the \"agree to submit\" language with the two cases invoked by appellants. However, \"words are not viewed in isolation within a contract.\" <i>McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins.

Moreover, there is no \"general rule for forum-selection clauses[;]\" rather, we \"base[ ] our conclusion on the specific language of the contract at issue.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> 388. Here, unlike in <i>Redondo</i> or <i>Ericsson,</i> the \"expressly agree to submit\" language is preceded and informed by a qualifying phrase: \"<i>In the event that by act or omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to me,</i> I expressly agree to submit ....\" (emphasis added). That is, the consent form required Rivera to <i>assert</i> any causes of action that he may have against the hospital in the Commonwealth courts. In contrast, by assenting to the clauses in <i>Redondo</i> and <i>Ericsson,</i> both of which lacked a similar introductory phrase, the signatories consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over themselves <i>as defendants</i> in order to avoid the personal jurisdiction analysis that would otherwise be required for out-of-state defendants. This difference in context is determinative, and we therefore conclude that the forum selection clause is mandatory.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>\"Contractual provisions undertaking to provide where a suit may be brought in disputes arising out of the agreement are not uncommon.\" 14D <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> § 3803.1. It is well established that forum selection clauses \"are prima facie valid and should be enforced unless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to be `unreasonable' under the circumstances.\" <i>M/S Bremen v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span> (1972); <i>see also </i><i>Silva,</i> 239 F.3d at 386. More specifically, a forum selection clause should be enforced unless the resisting party can show \"that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching ... [or that] enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought, whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.\" <i>M/S Bremen,</i> 407 U.S. at 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108566\"><a href=\"/opinion/108566/the-bremen-v-zapata-off-shore-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1907</span></a></span>. We therefore inquire whether appellants have overcome this strong presumption of enforceability, considering each of their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Nature of Consent Form/Nature of Action</h2>\n<p>Appellants claim that forum selection clauses, which are contractual in nature, cannot be included in medical consent forms which are designed to comply with physicians' obligations under Puerto Rico law to obtain informed consent to medical procedures. They argue that the forum selection clause, thus placed in an informed consent form, is unreasonable and contrary to public policy for that reason alone and therefore should not be enforced.</p>\n<p>This argument is too broad. Appellants cite no legal authority so holding. The placement of the forum selection clause in a consent form is just one of the factors to be considered in assessing a claim that enforcement of the clause is unreasonable under the circumstances. Absent a finding of procedural or substantive unconscionability, courts have repeatedly enforced forum selection clauses and arbitration agreements found in consent forms and similar documents. <i>See, e.g., Wilcox v. Lexington Eye Inst.,</i> No. 53871-3-I, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1964481</span></span>, at *8 (Wash. Ct.App. Aug.15, 2005) (enforcing forum selection clause in surgical consent form); <i>Covenant Health Rehab. of Picayune, L.P. v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1800165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1800165/covenant-health-rehab-of-picayune-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span>, 741 (Miss.2007) (enforcing those provisions of arbitration agreement contained in nursing home admissions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> form that were not found to be unconscionable); <i>see also </i><i>Wilkerson ex rel. Estate of Wilkerson v. Nelson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427980\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427980/wilkerson-ex-rel-estate-of-wilkerson-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span>, 284 (M.D.N.C.2005) (enforcing arbitration clause contained in \"a form typically furnished to and completed by patients while in the waiting room\" that also included statement of financial responsibility and insurance authorization).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, appellants argue that it would be inappropriate to hold Rivera to the forum selection clause because their lawsuit was a tort action and not a breach of contract action. They state that the district court's reliance on contract cases like <i>Silva</i><sup>[6]</sup> is unjustified because \"the present case is a tort case, which carries with it entirely different public policy considerationsa patient's life, health and well being.\" That argument is also unpersuasive. The applicability of a forum selection clause does not depend on the nature of the underlying action. One of the classic Supreme Court cases concerning forum selection clauses, <i>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span> (1991), enforced a non-negotiated forum selection provision contained in the passengers' cruise tickets in a personal injury action. Courts have routinely followed that example.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is the language of the forum selection clause itself that determines which claims fall within its scope. Here, the provision plainly requires that a suit sounding in tort must be brought according to its terms: \"In the event that by act or omission I consider that physical, emotional or economic damages have been caused to me, I expressly agree to submit to the Jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, for any possible claim.\" Indeed, this language specifically contemplates its applicability to a malpractice claim. Accordingly, the nature of the instant action does not preclude enforcement of the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Forum Selection Clause as a Contract of Adhesion</h2>\n<p>Appellants claim that if it is proper for the consent forms to include contractual terms, then the forum selection clause is a contract of adhesion,<sup>[7]</sup> \"to be construed against [its] drafter, and [is] therefore invalid.\" The mere fact that a contract is one of adhesion does not render it per se unenforceable, as appellants' argument would suggest. \"[A]dhesion does not imply nullity of a contract.\" <i>Nieves v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1907</span></a></span>. In support of this claim, they cite the affidavits submitted to the district court by Rivera and his wife, which were essentially identical. Florentino Rivera's affidavit stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>5. It was not explained to me by anyone at HIMA that by signing the ... documents I was renouncing to file a case before the Federal District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Said document does not state that I am renouncing to file a case before the Federal District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. When signing these forms I thought I was merely authorizing the anaesthesia and the operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>6. I do not know the difference between the Courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>7. I was not informed, at any time prior to the signing of these forms that I was waiving his [sic] right to a trial by jury, as I thought that the Courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have juries in all cases, as is my common knowledge of the Courts in the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>8. I was not advised that I could consult this waiver of my rights with an attorney, nor did I understand that I needed to do so, because in my mind I was not waiving any rights, I was simply consenting to the operation and the anaesthesia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>9. Should an opportunity been [sic] afforded for me to seek legal advice on the matter, I would not have signed either of the forms and would have either demanded that the waiver language be removed or gone elsewhere for the operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>10. I did not negotiate in any way, form or manner what is written in those documents, I was just demanded from the hospital personnel to sign in order to have the operation.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Fraud</h2>\n<p>A contract is voidable (and thus unenforceable) if \"a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or material misrepresentation by the other party upon which the recipient is justified in relying.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts, § 164 (1979) (cited in <i>Nash v. Trustees of Boston Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570023\"><a href=\"/opinion/570023/paul-nash-v-trustees-of-boston-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">960</span></a></span>, 967 (1st Cir.1991)). Rivera's averments do not describe fraud. They say only that (1) no one verbally explained the forum selection clause to appellants or told them that they could consult an attorney; (2) appellants did not attempt to negotiate the clause in any way, but, \"should an opportunity [have] been afforded\" to seek legal counsel, appellants would have either asked that the clause be removed or sought treatment elsewhere; and (3) appellants ultimately misunderstood the forms and their implications. In essence, the affidavit describes the absence of an explanation about the significance of the forum selection clause.</p>\n<p>This omission, in the circumstances here, cannot serve as a basis for a misrepresentation claim:</p>\n<blockquote>The assertion `I didn't know what was in the contract that I signed' is made by litigants frequently but almost never successfully. Absent fraud, a person is deemed to know the contents of a contract that he or she signs.... Thus whether plaintiffs actually knew of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> arbitration clause in their contracts is irrelevant; that knowledge is imputed as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Parler v. KFC Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2354763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2354763/parler-v-kfc-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Overreaching</h2>\n<p>\"[A]lthough there is some ambiguity as to the precise boundaries of what constitutes `overreaching,' a nebulous concept at best,\" <i>Haynsworth v.

The reference in <i>M/S Bremen</i> to \"<i>undue</i> influence,\" and \"<i>overweening</i> bargaining power,\" 407 U.S. at 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108566\"><a href=\"/opinion/108566/the-bremen-v-zapata-off-shore-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1907</span></a></span> (emphasis added), is instructive. There must be some evidence that the party has exploited this bargaining power in a way that the courts will not tolerate. <i>Outek Caribbean,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 267.</p>\n<p>Similarly, contrary to appellants' suggestion, \"overreaching must be based on something more than the mere fact that the clause was a `boilerplate' provision printed on the back of a form contract. As noted in our discussion of the contract of adhesion claim, it is not the law that one must bargain for each and every written term of a contract.\" <i>Lambert,</i> 983 F.2d at 1120 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). For this reason, \"the fact that a contract was in boilerplate form will not, by itself, render it unfair or invalid.\" <i>Outek Caribbean,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d at 267; <i>see also </i><i>Carnival Cruise Lines,</i> 499 U.S. at 593, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span> (mere fact that term in contract was not negotiated does not make it unenforceable); <i>Diaz-Rosado v. Auto-Wax Co., Inc.,</i> No. Civ. 04-2296, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2138794</span></span>, at *3 (D.P.R.2005). Put another way, although appellants emphasize \"the relative disparity in the bargaining positions of the parties ..., the presumption in favor of enforcing a forum selection clause applies even if the clause was not the product of negotiation.\" <i>2215 Fifth St. Assocs., LP v. U-Haul Intern., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567827\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567827/2215-fifth-street-associates-v-u-haul-intern/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56 (D.D.C.2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Indeed, the district court of Puerto Rico has enforced a forum selection clause printed in English on a cruise ticket where the passenger spoke only Spanish because \"[t]he examination of the circumstances surrounding the passengers' purchase and retention of the contract, does not depend upon actual knowledge of the terms in the contract of passage, but focuses instead on the opportunity for such knowledge.\" <i>De La Mota Estrella v. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2601657</span></span>, at *3 (D.P.R.2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>There are certainly suggestions of overreaching here. Rivera's relationship with the hospital grew out of a grave medical condition. He was likely more focused on that medical condition than the significance of the documents that he was asked to sign. He was not thinking about possible lawsuits. This reality in cases like this one undoubtedly prompted the Puerto Rico Office of the Patient Advocate, subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> to the filing of this lawsuit, to promulgate a regulation prohibiting the practice of including a forum selection clause in an informed consent document. <i>See</i> Part IV. D.2, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite this regulatory initiative, the federal common law of overreaching as it presently stands convinces us that this is not a case where the presumption in favor of enforcing a forum selection clause is overcome. The language of the clause was clear. The clause was in bold print and marked off from the rest of the one-page form by a special box. It was not \"buried in fine print\" or otherwise obscured. The clause required the patient to signal his assent by placing his initials next to it. <i>See </i><i>Wilkerson,</i> 395 F.Supp.2d at 287 (rejecting plaintiff's argument that arbitration clause must be separately negotiated and finding \"no claim of ambiguity\" where \"[p]laintiff signed the form on the separate signature line before the arbitration clause\").</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Rivera signaled his assent to the forum selection clause on two separate occasions, the first of which was five days before his surgical procedure. During the five days between his signing of the \"Consent to Administer Anesthesia and Conscious Sedation\" form and the \"Consent to Surgery\" form on the day of his operation, Rivera had the opportunity to consult an attorney regarding the forum selection clause, and to consider his assent to it outside the pressures of a hospital setting. He also had the option of going to another hospital. Under all of these circumstances, we reject appellants' argument that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because the Hospital procured Rivera's consent by unfairly exploiting its bargaining advantage. <i>See, e.g., Wilcox,</i> 128 Wash.App. 1071, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1964481</span></span>, at *2-3 (rejecting plaintiff's argument that forum selection clause should not be enforced due to \"undue influence,\" and \"overweening bargaining power,\" where she had the opportunity to read the consent form in advance of her surgery and again on the day of the procedure, the clause was clearly written, and plaintiff's signature appeared directly underneath the forum selection provision).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Public Policy</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The General Argument</h2>\n<p>In their opening brief, appellants make the general argument that to enforce a forum selection clause like the one at issue here would \"go[] against the social order that as a civilized society, we are obligated to try to maintain.\" Elaborating on this contention, they state that in the context of hospital consent forms, \"the application of a rule that a party has a duty to read the provisions of a form before he signs it and hence is bound by all provisions therein raises significant public policy concerns.\" We disagree. It simply cannot be the case that, absent fraud, coercion, or overreachingwhich we have determined were absent from this scenarioit would violate public policy to hold an individual to a clearly stated forum selection clause in a one-page document.</p>\n<p>The fact that this document was signed in a health care context is not, in and of itself, determinative. \"It is ... significant to note that no court has ever reached the broad conclusion that public policy precludes the use of private arbitration agreements in the area of medical services.\" <i>Buraczynski v. Eyring,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459975\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459975/buraczynski-v-eyring/\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 318 (Tenn.1996) (citations omitted). The clause at issue here merely provides an alternative judicial forum for appellants' complaint, rather than an entirely different adjudicative process. It would be a strange outcome indeed if we found that it violated public policy to require two parties to litigate their claims in the Commonwealth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> courts when their interactions took place exclusively in Puerto Rico and their relationship was governed by the tort law of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Regulation 7504</h2>\n<p>On May 12, 2008, after initial briefing in this case had been completed, the Office of the Patient's Advocate of Puerto Rico (OPA) passed Regulation No. 7504, entitled \"Regulation for the Implementation of the Provisions of Public Law Number 194, enacted August 25, 2000, as amended, `Puerto Rico Patients' Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.'\"<sup>[8]</sup> Among other things, this regulation prohibits a health care provider from including in informed consent documents any \"[a]spects about any decision regarding the possibility of any act of malpractice by a provider\" or \"legal clauses foreign to the sphere or field of medicine or health ... such as, but not limited to, forum selection clauses.\" Article 13, Section 8C of Regulation 7504 of May 12, 2008. The Regulation specifically provides, as a rationale for this prohibition, the notion that decisions regarding potential malpractice suits made by patients while signing informed consent documents \"may be erroneous in the face of a moment of vulnerability of the patient, given the health condition of the patient and dependence on the institution or provider at that given moment.\" In their Reply Brief, appellants attempt to use this regulation to argue that Puerto Rico public policy forbids HIMA's actions in this case.</p>\n<p>This argument cuts both ways. As HIMA points out in its sur-reply brief, the default position under Article 3 of the Puerto Rico Code is that laws \"shall not have a retroactive effect unless they expressly so decree.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3. Neither Regulation 7504 nor its authorizing statute, the Patients' Bill of Rights, purports to apply retroactively; to the contrary, Article 26 of Regulation 7504 expressly provides for its immediate, but not retroactive, application. This fact not only forbids appellants from explicitly relying on Regulation 7504 to render the forum selection clause illegal, but it further calls into question their assertion that the public policy of Puerto Rico at the time Rivera signed the forum selection clause prohibited its inclusion in a consent form. Certainly, whatever its legal status or binding effect,<sup>[9]</sup> the Regulation is persuasive evidence of Puerto Rico's public policy <i>today.</i> Given that the regulation is neither retroactive nor written in terms indicating an intent to codify some pre-existing public policy judgment, it does not help appellants here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Waiver of Right to Jury</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reject appellants' argument that the forum selection clause is unenforceable because an individual's waiver of his right to trial by jury must be unequivocal. As the Supreme Court held in <i>Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R.R. Co. v. Bombolis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98733\"><a href=\"/opinion/98733/minneapolis-st-louis-r-co-v-bombolis/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 217, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></span> (1916), the Seventh Amendment does not apply to civil proceedings in state court. For this reason, medical malpractice cases in the Commonwealth <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> Courts of First Instance may be tried without a jury without offending the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[10]</sup> For this reason, courts have routinely enforced forum selection clauses consenting to venue in jurisdictions where civil cases are not tried to juries. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Stephen J. Ware, <i>Arbitration Clauses, Jury-Waiver Clauses and Other Contractual Waivers of Constitutional Rights,</i> 67 Law &amp; Contemp. Probs. 167, 189-93 &amp; n. 147 (2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has \"repeatedly recognized\" that \"individuals who suffer distress because a relative or loved one is tortiously injured have a cause of action under Article 1802 against the tortfeasor.\" <i>Mendez-Matos v. Municip. of Guaynabo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203690\"><a href=\"/opinion/203690/mendez-matos-v-municipality-of-guaynabo/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). To succeed on such a claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she has suffered emotional harm caused by the tortious conduct of the defendant towards the plaintiff's loved one. <i>Id.</i> \"The cause of action is derivative and depends on the viability of the underlying claim of the relative or loved one.\" <i>Id.</i> This is the nature of the claim asserted by Carmen de León Rivera; the complaint alleged that she has suffered \"by virtue of Mr. Rivera's conditions.\"</p>\n<p>We have stated that \"claims involving the same operative facts\" as a claim for breach of contract that is subject to a forum selection clause should also be litigated in the forum chosen by the parties. <i>Lambert,</i> 983 F.2d at 1121-22; <i>see also </i><i>Banco Popular de Puerto Rico v. Airborne Group PLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1603575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1603575/banco-popular-de-puerto-rico-v-airborne-group-plc/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span>, 1216-17 (D.P.R.1995) (same). This is the only sensible outcome when the related cause of action is not only related to, but dependent upon, the subject cause of action. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Perez v. Carnival Cruise Lines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286381\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286381/perez-v-carnival-cruise-lines/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 42 n. 5 (D.P.R.1998) (dismissing plaintiff's claims against defendant's insurance companies because they were derivative of the cause of action subject to the forum selection clause). To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fundamental principle of judicial economy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  As we discuss below, certain procedural irregularities distinguish this case from the run-of-the-mill 12(b)(6) dismissal. Those irregularities do not affect this factual summary.</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 5141 provides generally that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" Section 5142 embodies the principle of respondeat superior, and provides, inter alia, that \"[t]he obligation imposed by § 5141 of this title is demandable, not only for personal acts and omissions, but also for those of the persons for whom they should be responsible.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Relatedly, appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to allow them to conduct additional discovery on the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of the forum selection clause in the consent documents. Even interpreting the district court's actions as a sua sponte conversion of the 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment, we find that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that additional discovery was unnecessary because we find that none of appellants' allegations, even if substantiated, would render the forum selection clause unenforceable. <i>Cf. </i><i>Adorno v. Crowley Towing and Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202128\"><a href=\"/opinion/202128/ortiz-anglero-v-crowley-towing/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 127-8 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that, in the Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) context, a motion for additional discovery must establish that the facts sought would influence the outcome of the motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p>[4]  HIMA argues that Rivera waived this permissive/mandatory argument below. We disagree.</p>\n<p>[5]  For the same reason, we reject appellant's argument that the absence of \"typical mandatory terms\" such as \"shall,\" \"exclusive,\" \"only,\" or \"must\" requires a contrary result. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Summit Packaging Sys., Inc. v. Kenyon</i> <i>&amp; Kenyon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199711\"><a href=\"/opinion/199711/summit-packaging-v-kenyon-kenyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that term in contract providing that parties \"will submit\" their dispute to a specified forum implied the exclusion of all other forums).</p>\n<p>[6]  In <i>Silva,</i> we held that a forum selection clause contained in an employment contract between a corporation and an independent contractor was mandatory, valid, and enforceable. 239 F.3d at 386.</p>\n<p>[7]  A contract of adhesion is a contract \"offered by the authoring party on a take it or leave it basis rather than being negotiated between the parties.\" <i>Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Donovan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"549798\"><a href=\"/opinion/549798/northwestern-national-insurance-company-v-william-f-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 377 (7th Cir.1990) (applying federal common law) (citing Todd S. Rakoff, <i>Contracts of Adhesion: An Essay in Reconstruction,</i> 96 Harv L.Rev. 1174, 1242-43 (1983)).</p>\n<p>[8]  Public Law No. 194 of August 25, 2000, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, §§ 3041-3058.</p>\n<p>[9]  HIMA also argues at length in its sur-reply brief that Regulation 7504 is null and void because it was not properly adopted in compliance with the requirements of the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, and because OPA did not have the legal authority to issue such a regulation. HIMA has submitted an extensive supplemental appendix containing, inter alia, court documents, briefs, and case law supporting this contention. Because we conclude that Regulation 7504 does not apply to this case, we need not consider its validity.</p>\n<p>[10]  \"It bears noting that adoption of [plaintiffs'] Seventh Amendment argument would render contrary to public policy almost any forum selection clause providing for resolution in a foreign forum, as very few countries provide for jury trials in civil cases.\" <i>Holland America Line, Inc. v.
