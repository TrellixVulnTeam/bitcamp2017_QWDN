Disenchanted with its existing\n\nprocedural framework for the conduct of adjudicatory hearings, the\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) promulgated new\n\nrules designed to make its hearing processes more efficient. These\n\nnew   rules     greatly    reduce       the   level    of    formality       in    reactor\n\nlicensing      proceedings       but,    at   the     same    time,    place       certain\n\nunaccustomed restrictions upon the parties.                    The petitioners and\n\npetitioner-intervenors are public interest groups.                       Supported by\n\nthe Attorneys General of five states (who have filed a helpful\n\namicus brief), they claim that the new rules violate a statutory\n\nrequirement that all reactor licensing hearings be conducted in\n\naccordance with sections 554, 556, and 557 of the Administrative\n\nProcedure      Act    (APA),   5   U.S.C.     §§    554,     556   &   557.1       In    the\n\nalternative, they claim that the Commission has not put forth an\n\nadequate justification for so substantial a departure from prior\n\npractice and that, therefore, the new rules must be set aside as\n\narbitrary and capricious.           Fully cognizant of the gravity of our\n\ntask,     we   have    studied     the    complex     statutory        and     regulatory\n\nframework and scrutinized the plenitudinous administrative record.\n\nAfter     completing      that     perscrutation        and    grappling          with    an\n\nantecedent jurisdictional question, we find that the new procedures\n\nin fact comply with the relevant provisions of the APA and that the\n\n\n      1\n      In the pages that follow, we use the modifiers \"on the\nrecord\" and \"formal\" interchangeably to refer to adjudications\nconducted in accordance with sections 554, 556, and 557 of the APA.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fCommission has furnished an adequate explanation for the changes.\n\nConsequently, we deny the petitions for review.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The NRC is the federal agency charged with regulating the\n\nuse of nuclear energy, including the licensing of reactors used for\n\npower generation.       See 42 U.S.C. § 2201.         The Atomic Energy Act\n\nrequires the Commission to hold a hearing \"upon the request of any\n\nperson whose interest may be affected,\" id. § 2239(a)(1)(A), before\n\ngranting a new license, a license amendment, or a license renewal.\n\n           The    NRC's     predecessor     agency,    the     Atomic   Energy\n\nCommission     (AEC),    originally    interpreted      this    provision   as\n\nrequiring on-the-record hearings in accordance with the APA.                See\n\nHearings Before the Subcommittee on Legislation, Joint Committee on\n\nAtomic Energy, 87th Cong. 60 (1962) (letter of AEC Commissioner\n\nLoren K. Olsen).        These hearings closely resembled federal court\n\ntrials, complete with a full panoply of discovery devices and\n\ndirect and cross-examination of witnesses by advocates for the\n\nparties.     Such hearings proved to be very lengthy; some lasted as\n\nlong as seven years.\n\n             In 1982, the NRC relaxed its approach for certain types\n\nof licensing proceedings.       See, e.g., In re Kerr-McGee Corp., 15\n\nN.R.C. 232, 235 (1982) (determining that formal hearings are not\n\nnecessary in materials licensing cases). Although the results were\n\nheartening, the Commission nevertheless retained the full range of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\ftrial-like procedures for reactor licensing cases.              The passage of\n\ntime brought further changes:       faced with the prospect of hearings\n\non many license renewal applications in the near future — a large\n\nnumber of reactors were initially licensed in the decade from 1960\n\nto 1970 and the standard term for such licenses was forty years —\n\nthe   Commission   began   to   reassess    its   adjudicatory         processes,\n\nfocusing particularly on the procedures used in reactor licensing\n\ncases.   The NRC's issuance, in 1998, of a policy on the conduct of\n\nadjudicatory proceedings, 63 Fed. Reg. 41,872 (Aug. 5, 1998),\n\nmarked the inception of this process.               This policy statement\n\nreiterated the NRC's commitment to expeditious adjudication and\n\nurged hearing officers to employ a variety of innovative case-\n\nmanagement techniques in order to improve hearing efficiency.\n\n           While   encouraging      better    utilization         of     existing\n\nprocedures, the Commission also began pondering possible procedural\n\nrevisions.   In January of 1999, the NRC's general counsel drafted\n\na legal memorandum concluding that the Atomic Energy Act did not\n\nrequire reactor    licensing     hearings    to   be   on   the   record     and,\n\naccordingly, that the Commission had the option of replacing the\n\nexisting format with a truncated regime.               Later that year, the\n\nCommission held a widely attended workshop on hearing procedures.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the Commission published a notice of\n\nproposed rulemaking    on   April    16,    2001,   66   Fed.     Reg.    19,610,\n\nsuggesting a major revision of its hearing procedures.                     In an\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\faccompanying statement, the Commission took the position that\n\nsection 189 of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2239, does not\n\nrequire reactor licensing proceedings to be on the record.\n\n               On January 14, 2004, the NRC published a final rule,\n\nalong with a response to the comments that the proposed rule had\n\ngenerated.         See 69 Fed. Reg. 2,182.         With minor exceptions, the\n\nfinal      rule    replicated     the   proposed   rule.    The   statement    of\n\nconsiderations for the final rule reiterated the Commission's view\n\nthat reactor licensing hearings may be informal.\n\n               The new rules took effect on February 13, 2004. Although\n\nthey       apply   to   all    adjudications    conducted   by    the   NRC,   the\n\npetitioners only challenge their application to reactor licensing\n\nproceedings.        We therefore confine our ensuing discussion to that\n\naspect of the new rules.\n\n               Under the old protocol, all reactor licensing hearings\n\nwere conducted according to the procedures outlined in 10 C.F.R.\n\npart 2, subpart G.            The subpart G rules resemble those associated\n\nwith judicial proceedings.2             They include a complete armamentarium\n\nof traditional discovery devices (e.g., requests for document\n\nproduction, interrogatories, and depositions).              10 C.F.R. § 2.705.\n\nThe parties may make motions for summary disposition (although the\n\nhearing officer is not required to entertain them).                Id. § 2.710.\n\n\n\n       2\n      Subpart G was amended by the new rules, but the changes to it\nare not pertinent here.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fThere is an evidentiary hearing at which testimony is presented\n\nthrough direct and cross-examination of witnesses by the parties.\n\nId. § 2.711.\n\n          Under the new rules, reactor licensing hearings are, for\n\nthe most part, to be conducted according to a less elaborate set of\n\nprocedures described in 10 C.F.R. pt. 2, subpart L.3              The new\n\nsubpart — which differs materially from the old subpart L — limns\n\na streamlined hearing procedure.     Unlike subpart G, subpart L does\n\nnot provide    for   traditional   discovery.   10   C.F.R.   §   2.1203.\n\nInstead, parties in hearings governed by subpart L are required to\n\nmake certain mandatory disclosures (akin to \"open file\" discovery)\n\nanent expert witnesses, expert witness reports, relevant documents,\n\ndata compilations, and claims of privilege.      Id. § 2.336.\n\n          The hearings themselves also differ.        Under subpart L,\n\nthe presumption is that all interrogation of witnesses will be\n\nundertaken by the hearing officer, not the litigants.              Id. §\n\n2.1207.   Parties are allowed to submit proposed questions in\n\nadvance of the hearing, but the presiding officer is under no\n\ncompulsion to pose them.     Id.   Parties are not allowed to submit\n\n\n     3\n      We say \"for the most part\" because there are exceptions. The\nnew rules still provide for the use of subpart G procedures for,\ninter alia, reactor licensing hearings if the presiding officer\nfinds that the \"contested matter necessitates resolution of issues\nof material fact relating to the occurrence of a past activity,\nwhere the credibility of an eyewitness may reasonably be expected\nto be at issue, and/or issues of motive or intent of the party or\neyewitness [are] material to the resolution of the contested\nmatter.\" 10 C.F.R. § 2.310.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fproposed questions during the hearing unless requested to do so by\n\nthe presiding officer.        Id.    Cross-examination is not available as\n\nof right, although a party may request permission to conduct cross-\n\nexamination that it deems \"necessary to ensure the development of\n\nan adequate record for decision.\"             Id. § 2.1204.       A party seeking\n\nleave to conduct cross-examination must submit a cross-examination\n\nplan, which will be included in the record of the proceeding\n\nregardless of whether the request is allowed.                   Id.\n\n              The petitioners — we use that phrase broadly to include\n\nthe petitioner-intervenors — took umbrage at these changes and\n\nbrought these petitions for judicial review.                Their primary claim\n\nis that the Commission erred in its determination that reactor\n\nlicensing proceedings do not have to be fully formal adjudications.\n\nIn    their   view,   the   new     rules   do   not    comply    with      the   APA's\n\nrequirements for on-the-record adjudication and, therefore, cannot\n\nstand.    As a fallback, the petitioners assert that even if the new\n\nrules are not ultra vires, they must be set aside as arbitrary and\n\ncapricious.\n\nII.    APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n              The parties have operated on the assumption that this\n\ncourt has first-instance jurisdiction to hear and determine their\n\npetitions for judicial review.          We are not so sanguine — and we are\n\ncognizant that, as a court of limited jurisdiction, subject-matter\n\njurisdiction     will   not   accrete       to   us    either    by   the    parties'\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\facquiescence or by their consent.           Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto\n\nRico, 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir. 2003).           Consequently, we asked\n\nthe parties to address what we perceived to be a thorny question\n\nrelating to our authority to entertain these petitions.            Before\n\nproceeding to the merits of the petitioners' asseverational array,\n\nwe must resolve that question.\n\n            The facts are as follows.           The petitioners premise\n\njurisdiction on the Administrative Orders Review Act, 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n2341-2351, better known as the Hobbs Act.         In pertinent part, that\n\nstatute confers original jurisdiction on the courts of appeals to\n\nhear petitions for judicial review of \"all final orders of the\n\n[NRC] made reviewable by section 2239 of title 42.\"              Id. at §\n\n2342(4).    In turn, 42 U.S.C. § 2239(b) makes reviewable, inter\n\nalia, \"[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind\n\nspecified in subsection (a) of this section.\"            The proceedings\n\nenumerated in that subsection include those for \"the granting,\n\nsuspending, revoking, or amending of any license or construction\n\npermit, or application to transfer control, and in any proceeding\n\nfor the issuance or modification of rules and regulations dealing\n\nwith the activities of licensees.\"        Id. § 2239(a).\n\n            Read literally, these interlocking statutes would not\n\nseem   to   grant   jurisdiction   to    this   court.   After   all,   the\n\npetitioners are challenging a rule, not an order.          The APA, which\n\nis made applicable to the Commission by 42 U.S.C. § 2231, defines\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fan order as \"the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether\n\naffirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an\n\nagency in a matter other than rule making . . . .\" 5 U.S.C. §\n\n551(6) (emphasis supplied).           Thus, the action at issue here — a\n\nrulemaking — would appear to fall outside the scope of review\n\nprovided by the Hobbs Act.\n\n            Even if one were tempted to suppose that Congress simply\n\nmisspoke in limiting Hobbs Act jurisdiction to the review of\n\norders, other sections of the Act would seem to militate against a\n\njudicial    reconstruction      of     the    term   \"order\"    to    encompass\n\nrulemaking.      The Act explicitly provides for initial court of\n\nappeals review of \"all rules, regulations, or final orders\" of the\n\nSecretary of Transportation, the Federal Maritime Commission, and\n\nthe Surface Transportation Board.            42 U.S.C. §§ 2342(3), 2342(5).\n\nThe principle is clear that Congress's use of differential language\n\nin    various   sections   of   the    same   statute    is   presumed    to   be\n\nintentional and deserves interpretive weight.                  See Duncan v.\n\nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 173 (2001); In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship,\n\n262 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Were we writing on a pristine page, we would likely find\n\nthis careful parsing persuasive and thus dismiss the case so that\n\nthe   petitioners   could   seek      initial   review   in    an    appropriate\n\ndistrict court.      The page, however, is cluttered, not pristine.\n\nThere is a substantial body of precedent elaborating the scope of\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthe Hobbs Act with respect to both the NRC and other agencies to\n\nwhich it applies.\n\n             The key case is Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470\n\nU.S. 729 (1985), in which the Supreme Court determined that Hobbs\n\nAct jurisdiction existed in the courts of appeals for initial\n\nreview of the NRC's denial of citizen petitions to suspend or\n\nrevoke licenses.       Id. at 746.        In making this determination, the\n\nCourt declared that the language of section 2239 was ambiguous as\n\nto   whether   it    limited    judicial        review   to    orders   entered     in\n\nproceedings under that section.                 Id. at 736.         The Court then\n\ndeclared that the Hobbs Act should be interpreted broadly, so as to\n\nmaximize the availability of initial circuit court review of\n\nlicensing proceedings.         Id. at 745.\n\n           The      Court   laid   out    two    grounds      in   support   of   this\n\nreasoning.     First, it cited efficiency concerns.                 In this regard,\n\nthe Court deemed initial circuit court review the better use of\n\njudicial resources, observed that such a course eliminates one\n\nlayer of review, and stressed that there is usually no need for the\n\ncompilation of either a fresh or an augmented record in agency\n\nreview proceedings.         Id. at 744.          Second, the Court harangued\n\nagainst the evils of piecemeal review.               In this regard, it warned\n\nthat when Congress clearly places initial review of some agency\n\nactions in the courts of appeals, the jurisdictional provision\n\nshould not be interpreted narrowly to shunt review of other agency\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\factions to the district courts.      Id. at 741-42.   For these reasons,\n\nthe Court admonished that \"[a]bsent a firm indication that Congress\n\nintended to locate initial APA review of agency action in the\n\ndistrict courts, we will not presume that Congress intended to\n\ndepart from the sound policy of placing initial APA review in the\n\ncourts of appeals.\"    Id. at 745.\n\n          Lorion has displayed remarkable vitality.         The Seventh\n\nCircuit applied its teachings in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. NRC,\n\n830 F.2d 610 (7th Cir. 1987), finding jurisdiction to review the\n\nCommission's assessment of fees for the processing of a licensing\n\napplication.   Id. at 613.   In the court's view, the assessment was\n\nsufficiently related to a licensing proceeding to ground circuit\n\ncourt jurisdiction.     Id. at 612-13.        Pertinently for present\n\npurposes, the court, in the exercise of its discerned jurisdiction,\n\nreviewed the underlying rules on which the Commission had based its\n\nassessment.    Id. at 616.\n\n          Closer to home, this court has applied Lorion to find\n\njurisdiction when a contrary reading of the applicable statute\n\nwould, for no apparent reason, have divided judicial review between\n\nthe district courts and the courts of appeals.        See City of Boston\n\nv. HUD, 898 F.2d 828, 834-35 (1st Cir. 1990).         The Third Circuit\n\nhas gone even further, holding that Lorion creates a presumption of\n\ninitial circuit court review \"absent clear and convincing evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fof a contrary congressional intent.\"                   Conoco, Inc. v. Skinner, 970\n\nF.2d 1206, 1214 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\n            Although        the    question       is    close,    we    conclude     that\n\nappellate jurisdiction is proper in this case.                     In reaching this\n\nconclusion, we start with the premise that both the Hobbs Act and\n\nthe   Atomic       Energy    Act     are     ambiguous       as   to    their      reach.\n\nFurthermore, while the term \"order\" has a clear meaning for APA\n\npurposes, its placement in section 2239 of the Atomic Energy Act\n\nsuggests that Congress might not have used it with the same\n\nprecision in connection with the intersection of the Hobbs Act and\n\nthe Atomic Energy Act.            Cf. Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States, 880\n\nF.2d 1503, 1504 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that the same word may have\n\ndifferent meanings in different statutory contexts).                      That premise\n\nis bolstered by the fact that the Atomic Energy Act uses the terms\n\n\"order\" and \"rule\" inconsistently.                 For example, section 2239(b)\n\nrefers to \"[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind\n\nspecified     in    subsection       (a),\"    but       section    2239(a)      includes\n\nproceedings    \"for     the       issuance    or       modification     of   rules    and\n\nregulations dealing with the activities of licensees.\"                               This\n\ndisharmony     renders       the    meaning       of    \"order\"    in    this    context\n\nuncertain.\n\n            Given these amphibolies, we believe that the policies\n\nannounced by the Supreme Court in Lorion deserve special weight.\n\nWe interpret Lorion as holding that original jurisdiction in the\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fcourts of appeals is proper to review any NRC action that could be\n\ncognizable in a petition for review from a proceeding under section\n\n2239.     This interpretation is consistent with the Lorion Court's\n\ninstruction that jurisdictional statutes should be construed so\n\nthat agency actions will always be subject to initial review in the\n\nsame court, regardless of the procedural package in which they are\n\nwrapped.     Lorion, 470 U.S. at 742.          By like token, an affirmation\n\nof jurisdiction in this case is consistent with the Lorion Court's\n\nconclusion that judicial efficiency is best served by limiting the\n\nlayers of review.      Id. at 744-45.        On this basis, and in conformity\n\nwith our earlier decision in City of Boston, we conclude that we\n\nhave jurisdiction to entertain these petitions.\n\nIII.    THE MERITS\n\n            We    divide   our    discussion      of   the   merits   into   three\n\nsegments, corresponding with the petitioners' most lively bruited\n\npoints.\n\n                                 A.   Ultra Vires.\n\n            The    mainstay      of   the    petitioners'    challenge   is   the\n\nproposition that the new rules exceed the Commission's statutory\n\nauthority.       The petitioners start with the premise that 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2239 requires the NRC to conduct licensing hearings on the\n\nrecord, that is, in strict accordance with the relevant provisions\n\nof the APA.       See supra note 1.         In their view, the new rules fail\n\nto satisfy that requirement and, therefore, must be pole-axed.                 In\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fthe pages that follow, we examine both the petitioners' premise and\n\ntheir conclusion.\n\n          Section 2239 requires the Commission, \"upon the request\n\nof any person whose interest may be affected\" by certain agency\n\nactions, to hold \"a hearing.\"   It does not explicitly require that\n\nthe hearing be on the record.       We have held, however, that the\n\ndegree of formality that a hearing must afford does not necessarily\n\nturn on the presence or absence of an explicit statutory directive.\n\nIf, even absent such a directive, the nature of the hearing that\n\nCongress intended to grant is clear, then that intention governs.\n\nDantran, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor, 246 F.3d 36, 46 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nSeacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle, 572 F.2d 872, 876 (1st\n\nCir. 1978). We assume arguendo, favorably to the petitioners, that\n\nthe Seacoast rule still obtains.4\n\n          The petitioners advance several arguments for holding\n\nthat Congress, in enacting section 2239, purposed to require on-\n\nthe-record hearings in reactor licensing cases.      In addition to\n\n\n\n     4\n      Notwithstanding this assumption, we believe it prudent to\npoint out that Seacoast predates the Supreme Court's watershed\ndecision in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), and that Dantran merely\nfollowed Seacoast without assessing its vitality in the post-\nChevron era.    It seems clear that while the type of hearing\nrequired by a statute turns on congressional intent, Chevron adds\na new dimension, requiring that the agency's reasonable\ninterpretation be accorded deference if there is any ambiguity as\nto that intent. See id. at 843. To what extent (if at all) this\nreality erodes Seacoast's rationale is a question that we leave for\nanother day.\n\n                                -15-\n\fcanvassing the legislative history and cataloging the relevant\n\namendments to the statute, they point out that for approximately\n\nfour   decades    the   NRC   and   its   predecessor       agency,   the    AEC,\n\ninterpreted the statute as requiring on-the-record hearings in\n\nreactor licensing proceedings. In response, the NRC highlights the\n\nambiguity of the statute and attempts to situate the latest round\n\nof changes in a larger history of procedural experimentation.                 The\n\nCommission also notes that some courts have interpreted section\n\n2239 to allow informal hearings in licensing proceedings not\n\ninvolving reactors.     See, e.g., City of W. Chicago v. NRC, 701 F.2d\n\n632, 645 (7th Cir. 1983) (licensing of nuclear materials).                  Last —\n\nbut far from least — the Commission urges us to defer to its\n\njudgment that informal hearings are a suitable prophylactic for\n\nreactor licensing.      Cf. Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 19-20 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (deferring to the agency's judgment on the proper\n\napplication of a procedural statute).\n\n           For    years,   the   courts     of    appeals   have   avoided    the\n\nquestion   of    whether   section    2239       requires   reactor   licensing\n\nhearings to be on the record.        See, e.g., Kelley v. Selin, 42 F.3d\n\n1501, 1510-14 (6th Cir. 1995) (discussing, but not resolving, the\n\nissue while approving the use of informal hearings for materials\n\nstorage issues); Nuclear Info. & Res. Serv. v. NRC, 969 F.2d 1169,\n\n1180 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc) (deeming the issue forfeited and\n\ndeclining to decide it); Union of Concerned Scientists v. NRC, 920\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fF.2d 50, 53 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (finding the procedural rules at\n\nissue to comply with the APA and declining to decide whether formal\n\nhearings are required); City of W. Chicago, 701 F.2d at 642-43\n\n(distinguishing reactor licensing from materials licensing and\n\naddressing only the latter). We too decline to resolve this issue.\n\nBecause    the   new    rules   adopted    by   the   Commission   meet   the\n\nrequirements of the APA it does not matter what type of hearing the\n\nNRC is required to conduct in reactor licensing cases.\n\n            Before elaborating our reasoning on this point, we must\n\ndispense with a procedural theory advocated by the petitioner\n\nPublic Citizen.        It is a bedrock principle that a court may only\n\nuphold an administrative action on a rationale advanced by the\n\nagency in the administrative proceeding. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318\n\nU.S. 80, 95 (1943).         Embracing this principle, Public Citizen\n\nasserts that the Commission has waived the argument that the new\n\nrules satisfy the APA's requirements because, in promulgating the\n\nnew rules, it relied exclusively on its view that section 2239 does\n\nnot mandate on-the-record hearings.          Thus, it cannot now rely on a\n\ndifferent rationale to defend the rules in court.\n\n            This assertion reads the record through rose-colored\n\nglasses.    The Commission explicitly memorialized in the statement\n\nof considerations for the final rule the view that even if reactor\n\nlicensing hearings were required to be on the record, the new rules\n\nwould meet that requirement.              69 Fed. Reg. at 2,192 (\"[T]he\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fCommission believes that . . . the hearing procedures in each of\n\nthese subparts meets [sic] the requirements for an on-the-record\n\nhearing under the APA . . . .\").            No more was exigible to preserve\n\nthe point.       Accordingly, we turn to the merits of this rationale.\n\n               We     exercise   plenary     review    over   the     Commission's\n\ncompliance with the APA.           See Dantran, 246 F.3d at 48 (stating that\n\nagencies' interpretations of statutes they do not administer are\n\nnot entitled to particular deference).                The APA lays out only the\n\nmost       skeletal    framework    for   conducting     agency     adjudications,\n\nleaving broad discretion to the affected agencies in formulating\n\ndetailed procedural rules. See Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 627 F.2d 1313, 1321 (D.C. Cir. 1980).                 In specific terms,\n\nthe APA requires only that the agency provide a hearing before a\n\nneutral decisionmaker and allow each party an opportunity \"to\n\npresent his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to\n\nsubmit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as\n\nmay be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\"                    5\n\nU.S.C. § 556(d).5\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      The APA requires the presiding officer to be the agency, a\nmember of the agency, or an administrative law judge. 5 U.S.C. §\n556(b). In NRC hearings, 42 U.S.C. § 2241 explicitly authorizes\nthe Commission to empanel safety and licensing boards consisting of\none person \"qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings\"\nand two persons with \"such technical or other qualifications as the\nCommission deems appropriate\" to preside at hearings under section\n2239.\n\n                                          -18-\n\f            The petitioners urge that the magnitude of the risks\n\ninvolved in reactor licensing proceedings warrant the imposition of\n\na more elaborate set of safeguards.                It is beyond cavil, however,\n\nthat, short of constitutional constraints, a court may not impose\n\nprocedural requirements in administrative cases above and beyond\n\nthose mandated by statute (here, the APA).                   Vt. Yankee Nuclear\n\nPower Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 543-\n\n44   (1978);    Union      of   Concerned    Scientists,         920   F.2d   at   53.\n\nAccordingly, we are not at liberty to impress on the Commission (or\n\nany other agency, for that matter) a procedural regime not mandated\n\nby Congress.     The NRC's new rules will, therefore, succumb to the\n\npetitioners' first line of attack only if they fail to provide the\n\nminimal procedural safeguards actually demanded by the APA.                         See\n\nNat'l Classif. Comm. v. United States, 765 F.2d 1146, 1151 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1985).\n\n            We turn now from the general to the particular.                        The\n\nrulemaking      at   issue      here    effected     several      changes     in   the\n\nCommission's procedures.          The petitioners focus their challenge on\n\ntwo aspects of the newly minted process.              First, they object to the\n\nCommission's     decision       to     eliminate    discovery.         Second,     they\n\ncomplain    about    the    Commission's        decision    to   circumscribe       the\n\navailability of cross-examination.                 Because these are the only\n\nissues     on   which       the      petitioners     have    offered        developed\n\nargumentation, we confine our analysis to those portions of the new\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\frules.    Cf. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (holding that \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its\n\narguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace\"\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n            We begin with the question of whether the new rules fall\n\nbelow the APA's minimum requirements by eliminating discovery. The\n\nCommission    points   out,    and   the    petitioners     do    not   seriously\n\ncontest, that the APA does not explicitly require the provision of\n\nany discovery devices in formal adjudications. See 5 U.S.C. § 556;\n\nsee also Kelly v. EPA, 203 F.3d 519, 523 (7th Cir. 2000); Frilette\n\nv. Kimberlin, 508 F.2d 205, 208 (3d Cir. 1974).              Thus, if the APA\n\nrequires the Commission to provide any discovery to satisfy the\n\nstandards    for   formal     adjudications,       that   discovery     must   be\n\nnecessary    either    to   effectuate      some    other   procedural     right\n\nguaranteed by the APA or to ensure an adequate record for judicial\n\nreview.     Cf. U.S. Lines, Inc. v. Fed. Maritime Comm'n, 584 F.2d\n\n519, 540 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (stating that an agency charged with\n\nholding a hearing to determine the public interest must provide\n\nadequate means of public participation); Seacoast, 572 F.2d at 876-\n\n77 (noting that in some cases procedural requirements may be\n\nimplied to ensure adequate judicial review).\n\n            The petitioners suggest that discovery is necessary to\n\nrealize the right of citizen-intervenors to present their case and\n\nsubmit an informed rebuttal.         See 5 U.S.C. § 556.         If discovery is\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\funavailable, this thesis runs, citizen-intervenors will be unable\n\nto gather the evidence needed to support their contentions and,\n\nthus, will be shut out of meaningful participation in licensing\n\nhearings.\n\n            This thesis is composed of more cry than wool.                  The\n\npetitioners argue as if the new rules have eliminated all access to\n\ninformation from opposing parties — but that is a gross distortion.\n\nThe new rules provide meaningful access to information from adverse\n\nparties in the form of a system of mandatory disclosure.                 See 10\n\nC.F.R. § 2.336.         Although there might well be less information\n\navailable    to    citizen-intervenors       under   the   new    rules,    the\n\ndifference is one of degree.           There is simply no principled way\n\nthat we     can   say   that   the   difference   occasioned     by   replacing\n\ntraditional discovery methods with mandatory disclosure is such\n\nthat citizen-intervenors are left with no means of adequately\n\npresenting their case.\n\n            Nor do we think that full-dress discovery is essential to\n\nensure a satisfactory record for judicial review. The Commission's\n\nfinal decision in any hearing must survive review based on the\n\nevidence adduced in the hearing.         5 U.S.C. § 556(e).      The applicant\n\nbears the burden of proof in any licensing hearing, id. § 556(d),\n\nand it will have every incentive to proffer sufficient information\n\nto allow the agency to reach a reasoned decision.                     That same\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fquantum of information should be adequate for a reviewing court to\n\ndetermine whether the agency's action is supportable.\n\n            To say more on this point would be to paint the lily.\n\nThere is simply no discovery-linked conflict between the new rules\n\nand   the   APA's     on-the-record       adjudication       requirement.        The\n\npetitioners' first line of argument is, therefore, a dead end.\n\n            Turning      to      cross-examination,          the     petitioners'\n\ncontentions    fare    no     better:      the   new   rules      meet    the   APA's\n\nrequirements. To explain this conclusion, we first must strip away\n\nthe rhetorical flourishes in which the petitioners shroud their\n\nreasoning.\n\n            It is important to understand that, contrary to the\n\npetitioners' importunings, the new rules do not extirpate cross-\n\nexamination.    Rather, they restrict its use to situations in which\n\nit is \"necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision.\"                       10\n\nC.F.R. § 2.1204.         The legitimacy of this restriction must be\n\nweighed in light of the fact that the APA does not provide an\n\nabsolute right of cross-examination in on-the-record hearings.\n\nSeacoast, 572 F.2d at 880.           The APA affords a right only to such\n\ncross-examination      as     may   be    necessary    for    a    full   and   fair\n\nadjudication of the facts.          Id. Equally to the point, \"[t]he party\n\nseeking to cross-examine bears the burden of showing that cross-\n\nexamination is in fact necessary.\"              Id. at 880 n.16.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f            The Commission represents that, despite the difference in\n\nlanguage, it interprets the standard for allowing cross-examination\n\nunder the new rules to be equivalent to the APA standard.                      69 Fed.\n\nReg.   at   2,195-96.          When    an    agency        provides    a     plausible\n\ninterpretation of its own procedural rules and there is no record\n\nor pattern of contrary conduct a court has no right either to\n\nslough off that interpretation or to deem it disingenuous.                          Cf.\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 378-79 (1st Cir. 2003) (accepting\n\nthe agency's good faith in carrying out its procedures, while\n\nacknowledging that evidence to the contrary might warrant judicial\n\nintervention).    Given the Commission's stated interpretation, the\n\nnew rules on cross-examination cannot be termed inconsistent with\n\nthe dictates of the APA.           Nor do we see how cross-examination that\n\nis not \"necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision\" could\n\nbe necessary to ensure appropriate judicial review.\n\n            Because     we    find    that     the   new    rules     meet    the   APA\n\nrequirements for on-the-record adjudications, we hold that their\n\npromulgation     does        not    exceed     the    Commission's         authority.\n\nConsequently, the petitioners' ultra vires argument founders.\n\n                      B.      Arbitrary and Capricious.\n\n            Our labors are not yet done.              Even though we hold that\n\nthe new rules are within the ambit of the NRC's authority, we still\n\nmust consider whether its decision to discard the old in favor of\n\nthe new was arbitrary and capricious.                See 5 U.S.C. § 706.\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f           An agency's rules, once adopted, are not frozen in place.\n\nThe opposite is true:    an agency may alter its rules in light of\n\nits   accumulated   experience   in   administering   them.    Rust   v.\n\nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 186-87 (1991).       An agency must, however,\n\noffer a reasoned explanation for the change.      If the agency fails\n\nto furnish such an explanation, or if the proffered explanation\n\nfails to demonstrate that the agency fully considered its new\n\ncourse, the revised rules must be set aside.          See Motor Vehicle\n\nMfrs. Ass'n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n\n463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983) (\"If Congress established a presumption from\n\nwhich judicial review should start, that presumption . . . is . .\n\n. against changes in current policy that are not justified by the\n\nrulemaking record.\").\n\n           The petitioners begin this branch of their assault with\n\na global challenge to the rationality of departing from the NRC's\n\nforty-year-old procedural regime.       They do not suggest that the\n\nCommission's goal of improving hearing efficiency is impermissible;\n\nrather, they maintain that the current procedures worked well\n\nenough and that the Commission has made no showing that they were\n\nthe source of any past inefficiencies.       The petitioners further\n\nnote evidence in the rulemaking record suggesting that efficiency\n\ngains could be brought about through less drastic measures, such as\n\nmore aggressive case management.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f             To resolve this point, we first must determine what an\n\nagency must show to justify modifying its procedural rules.                      As a\n\ngeneral principle, agencies have broad authority to formulate their\n\nown procedures — and the NRC's authority in this respect has been\n\ntermed particularly great. Union of Concerned Scientists, 920 F.2d\n\nat 54; BPI v. Atomic Energy Comm'n, 502 F.2d 424, 428 n.3 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1974). A necessary corollary of this authority is the freedom\n\nto experiment with different procedural formats.                     Consequently,\n\ntinkering with rules is by no means a forbidden activity.\n\n             Of course, there are limits on this prerogative.                      An\n\nagency may not act precipitously or in an irrational manner in\n\nrevising its rules.       But so long as these limits are observed, it\n\nis not the place of a reviewing court to second-guess the agency's\n\ndecision as to when to make procedural changes.                It is enough that\n\nthe   agency   reasonably    determines        that    existing      processes   are\n\nunsatisfactory     and    takes   steps       that    are   fairly    targeted    at\n\nimproving the situation.\n\n             In this case, the NRC has determined that its existing\n\nrules   of     practice    lead   to     hearings       that   are     cumbersome,\n\nunnecessarily protracted, and wasteful of the resources of the\n\nparties and the Commission.            This determination warrants a high\n\ndegree of deference.       See Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 543-44 (holding\n\nthat agencies' evaluations of their procedural needs are entitled\n\nto great respect).        Although the petitioners may disagree, we\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fdescry nothing in the record that would support setting aside the\n\nrule on the basis that the agency should have left well enough\n\nalone. It would unfairly handcuff administrators if agencies could\n\nnot    change   their    procedures   simply    because    certain    of   their\n\nconstituencies admired the status quo.\n\n            That leaves the how of the Commission's new rules; that\n\nis, the question whether the Commission acted arbitrarily in making\n\na specific set of changes in order to achieve its goal of improved\n\nhearing efficiency. To clear this hurdle, the Commission must show\n\nboth that its new rules constitute a rational means for achieving\n\nits stated objective and that it sensibly rejected other options\n\nconsidered in the rulemaking proceeding (including the option of\n\nmaintaining the status quo).          See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43-44.\n\nThis    calculus   must    fairly   account    for   any   benefits   lost   by\n\nmodifying existing rules, as well as any advantages expected to be\n\ngained through the adoption of updated rules.              See id.\n\n            Here, too, we address only the NRC's decisions to replace\n\ntraditional discovery with mandatory disclosure and to restrict the\n\navailability of conventional cross-examination.               With regard to\n\ndiscovery, the NRC explained in its statement of considerations for\n\nthe final rule that the proposed substitute \"has the potential to\n\nsignificantly reduce delays and resources expended by all parties\n\nin discovery.\"          69 Fed. Reg. at 2,194.         The Commission also\n\nexpressed   the    view    that   replacing    traditional    discovery    with\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fmandatory disclosure would eliminate a substantial amount of motion\n\npractice    related   to   discovery    matters.         Id.     Finally,   the\n\nCommission determined that any prejudice to citizen-intervenors\n\nfrom eliminating traditional discovery would be offset by the\n\nmandatory    disclosure     requirements       and      the    general   public\n\navailability of NRC documents.         Id.\n\n            The petitioners renew their exhortation that discovery is\n\nnecessary for citizen-intervenors to participate effectively in\n\nreactor licensing hearings.      They speculate that without discovery\n\nthey will be without access to large amounts of detailed technical\n\ninformation (information that is available to the applicant and the\n\nCommission staff) and, thus, will be unable to respond adequately\n\nto technical and factual arguments.\n\n            We agree with the petitioners that the Commission's\n\nexplanation for the change in discovery practice is thin.                   The\n\nCommission baldly states its belief that eliminating traditional\n\ndiscovery will shorten hearings and conserve resources, but it\n\nprovides no empirical analysis of its experience with traditional\n\ndiscovery   from   which   an   outside      observer    can    determine   what\n\nbenefits the Commission might reasonably expect.               In a substantive\n\nrule, this omission might be fatal.            See, e.g., Portland Cement\n\nAss'n v. Ruckelhaus, 486 F.2d 375, 393 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (\"It is not\n\nconsonant with the purpose of a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\frules on the basis of inadequate data, or on data that, [in]\n\ncritical degree, is known only to the agency.\").\n\n            In the realm of procedure, however, agencies are presumed\n\nto have special competence and, accordingly, are held to less\n\nexacting    standards   of   explication.     See    Union    of   Concerned\n\nScientists, 920 F.2d at 54 (noting that procedural determinations\n\n\"fall uniquely within the expertise of the agency\").               To add to\n\nthis leeway, we are not willing to ignore matters that are common\n\nknowledge to courts of law.         Discovery, especially in complex\n\nmatters, is both time-consuming and costly.         We do not think it can\n\nreasonably be questioned that the replacement of discovery with\n\nmandatory disclosure will make reactor licensing hearings faster\n\nand less expensive.\n\n            The Commission also has explained that it believes any\n\nharm   to   citizen-intervenors   will   be   minimal.        Although   the\n\npetitioners offer some hypothetical examples of information that\n\nmay be unavailable under the new rules, they have not made a\n\npersuasive case that mandatory disclosure will undercompensate for\n\nthe loss of traditional discovery.          We thus find no basis for\n\nsetting aside the new rules on discovery-related grounds.\n\n            The new rules' outlook on cross-examination presents a\n\ncloser question.    The Commission reasons that restricting cross-\n\nexamination will reduce the amount of testimony taken and make\n\nhearings more efficient.      69 Fed. Reg. at 2,196.         The Commission\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\ffurther observes that, in its experience, cross-examination is not\n\nalways helpful to the resolution of scientific or technical issues.\n\nId.\n\n          The petitioners retort that cross-examination is a vital\n\ncomponent of a citizen-intervenor's case.         They note that citizen-\n\nintervenors often lack the resources to present their own expert\n\ntestimony and must rely on cross-questioning of the adverse party's\n\nexperts to make their case.      They also stress the value of cross-\n\nexamination   as   a   means   for   bolstering   public   confidence   in\n\nlicensing hearings. Tellingly, the Commission's own administrative\n\njudges agree that cross-examination is helpful for the resolution\n\nof issues raised in many licensing hearings.          In addition to the\n\nreasons advanced by the petitioners, the administrative judges note\n\nthat the prospect of cross-examination discourages exaggeration in\n\ndirect testimony because witnesses are aware that they will have to\n\ndefend their statements later.\n\n          Experience in the courts has left no doubt that cross-\n\nexamination can be a useful tool.           Had the new rules abolished\n\ncross-examination entirely, we might well find the Commission's\n\naction insupportable.     Importantly, however, the new rules do not\n\ncompletely do away with cross-examination.         Rather, they leave its\n\navailability to the discretion of the hearing officer.         Just as we\n\nwill not ignore the fact that discovery is resource-consuming, we\n\nwill not presume that all — or, perhaps, even most — cross-\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fexamination is essential to the just resolution of issues.               With\n\nthis in mind, we find no fault with the Commission's decision to\n\nattempt to curtail unnecessary cross-examination.            Cf. 5 U.S.C. §\n\n556(d) (\"[T]he agency as a matter of policy shall provide for the\n\nexclusion    of    irrelevant,     immaterial,    or   unduly    repetitious\n\nevidence.\").      Accordingly, we cannot say that it is arbitrary and\n\ncapricious for the Commission to leave the determination of whether\n\ncross-examination will further the truth-seeking process in a\n\nparticular proceeding to the discretion of the individual hearing\n\nofficer.\n\n            We do, however, add a caveat.        The APA does require that\n\ncross-examination be available when \"required for a full and true\n\ndisclosure of the facts.\"        Id.   If the new procedures are to comply\n\nin practice with the APA, cross-examination must be allowed in\n\nappropriate instances.       Should the agency's administration of the\n\nnew rules contradict its present representations or otherwise flout\n\nthis principle, nothing in this opinion will inoculate the rules\n\nagainst future challenges.\n\n                       C.    Constitutional Claims.\n\n            One petitioner, Citizens Awareness Network (CAN), charges\n\nthat the new rules are unconstitutional because they deprive\n\ncitizen-intervenors         of   fundamental     political      rights    and\n\ndiscriminate against them in violation of the Fifth Amendment.             We\n\nexplore these charges.\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\f          CAN's   first   charge    implodes   because   there   is    no\n\nfundamental right to participate in administrative adjudications.\n\nReactor licensing (unlike, say, voting) is not \"preservative of\n\nother basic civil and political rights.\"        Reynolds v. Sims, 377\n\nU.S. 533, 562 (1964). Assuming, for argument's sake, that citizen-\n\nintervenors have a protected liberty interest in the outcome of\n\nreactor licensing proceedings — a proposition that we consider\n\nextremely dubious, see City of W. Chicago, 701 F.2d at 645 — the\n\nquantum of process required before the government may deprive\n\ncitizen-intervenors of that interest would depend on the three-part\n\nanalysis adumbrated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335\n\n(1976).   CAN makes no effort to apply the Mathews rubric to the\n\nrules at issue, and we will not do CAN's homework for it.             The\n\nissue is, therefore, forfeit.      See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n          As for equal protection, CAN claims that we should apply\n\nstrict scrutiny because citizen-intervenors are a \"discrete and\n\ninsular minority.\" This claim is meritless. The Supreme Court has\n\nmade it crystal clear that the criteria for deeming a class suspect\n\nare both rigorous and specific.      Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361,\n\n375 n.14 (1974); San Antonio Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S.\n\n1, 28 (1973). As a class, citizen-intervenors cannot begin to meet\n\nthose criteria.   They are not \"saddled with such disabilities, or\n\nsubjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or\n\nrelegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fcommand extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political\n\nprocess,\"   Rodriguez,   411    U.S.   at   28,   nor   do   they    share   any\n\n\"immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of\n\nbirth,\" Johnson, 415 U.S. at 375 n.14.\n\n            Belaboring this point would serve no useful purpose.\n\nWhatever legitimate grievances citizen-intervenors may have, it is\n\nabsurd to equate discrimination against them with the historic\n\ndiscrimination against racial and other minorities that lies at the\n\ncore of suspectedness. The bottom line is that citizen-intervenors\n\nare not a suspect class.       We so hold.\n\n            This holding means, of course, that rational basis review\n\napplies, not strict scrutiny.       See Boivin v. Black, 225 F.3d 36, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).    Thus, CAN bears the burden of demonstrating that\n\nno plausible set of facts exists that could forge a rational\n\nrelationship between the challenged rules and the government's\n\nlegitimate goals.    Id. at 44; Montalvo-Huertas v. Rivera-Cruz, 885\n\nF.2d 971, 978-79 (1st Cir. 1989).       For the reasons set forth above,\n\nsee supra Part III(B), there can be no doubt that the Commission's\n\naction is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\n\nIt    follows   inexorably,    as   night    follows     day,       that   CAN's\n\nconstitutional argument is meritless.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.     Procedural flexibility is one of\n\nthe great hallmarks of the administrative process — and it is a\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\ffeature that courts must be reluctant to curtail.                  Though the\n\nCommission's new rules may approach the outer bounds of what is\n\npermissible under the APA, we find the statute sufficiently broad\n\nto accommodate them.      Similarly, the Commission's judgments as to\n\nwhen its     procedures   need   fine-tuning   and   how   they     should    be\n\nretooled are ones to which we accord great respect.              We cannot say\n\nthat the Commission's desire for more expeditious adjudications is\n\nunreasonable, nor can we say that the changes embodied in the new\n\nrules are an eccentric or a plainly inadequate means for achieving\n\nthe Commission's goals. Accordingly, both of the instant petitions\n\nmust be denied.\n\n\n\n           The    petitions   for   judicial   review      are    denied     and\n\ndismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                    — Concurring Opinion Follows —\n\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.       Although I concur fully in Judge\n\nSelya's thoughtful and comprehensive opinion, I write separately to\n\ndescribe     some   oddities   about    this    case   which   should    not   go\n\nunnoticed.     The basic proposition of Judge Selya's decision is\n\nindisputably correct: the new rules promulgated by the Nuclear\n\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) to reduce the level of formality in\n\nreactor licensing      proceedings      comply    with   the   \"on-the-record\"\n\nrequirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).                 Yet that\n\nlegal proposition was largely an afterthought of the NRC in the\n\neffort to justify its new rules.               Instead, the NRC principally\n\nargued in the long run-up to this case that 42 U.S.C. § 2239, which\n\nsimply requires the Commission to hold a hearing \"upon the request\n\nof any person whose interest may be affected\" before granting a new\n\nlicense, did not invoke the requirements for formal adjudication\n\n(commonly referred to as \"on-the-record\" hearings) under the APA.\n\n             It is striking that so many smart people at the NRC could\n\nbe so wrong for so long about the requirements of the APA.\n\nAlthough this history does not affect the outcome of this case, it\n\nshould be noted as a cautionary tale about the power of analogy and\n\nthe endurance of unexamined legal theories.                This history also\n\nserves to explain some of the legitimate frustrations of the\n\npetitioners, who felt that they were dealing with a moving target\n\nas the NRC tried to justify its new regulations.               With so much at\n\nstake   in    these   nuclear    reactor       licensing   proceedings,        the\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\frulemaking process should have followed a steadier course.                       For\n\nreasons I shall explain, this was not the rulemaking process at its\n\nbest.\n\n                               Terminology\n\n           The   terminology       for    hearings    under   the    APA   can    be\n\nimprecise and confusing.           The everyday meaning of terms like\n\n\"formal\" and \"informal\" sometimes creeps into the discussion,\n\nalthough those terms have specific, functional definitions under\n\nthe APA.   As Judge Selya notes, the terms \"formal\" and \"on-the-\n\nrecord\" are generally used as shorthand for hearings that must be\n\nconducted pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. §§ 554, 556, and\n\n557 of the APA.      Other terms, too, are sometimes used to refer to\n\nsuch procedures -- \"trial-type\" and \"quasi-judicial.\"                 These vague\n\nand indefinite terms are particularly mischievous because they\n\nevoke images of courtroom trials, and they have contributed to the\n\nfalse   impression    that   the    APA's       requirement   of    on-the-record\n\nhearings involves procedures more akin to civil trials than is\n\nactually the case.\n\n           To be specific, § 554 requires that, in cases of an\n\n“adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record\n\nafter opportunity for an agency hearing,” the agency must follow\n\nthe procedures outlined in §§ 556 and 557.             Although the statutory\n\ntext at issue here is itself rather pithy, these procedures can be\n\nusefully condensed into the following ten points:\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\f     1. The agency must give notice of legal authority and\n     matters of fact and law asserted. § 554(b).\n\n     2. The oral evidentiary hearing must be presided over by\n     an officer who can be disqualified for bias. § 556(b).\n\n     3. Presiding officers cannot have ex       parte\n     communications. §§ 554(d), 557(d)(1).\n\n     4. Parties are entitled to be represented by attorneys.\n     § 555(b).\n\n     5. The proponent of an order has the burden of proof.\n     § 556(d).\n\n     6. A party is entitled to present oral or documentary\n     evidence. § 556(d).\n\n     7. A party is entitled \"to conduct such cross-examination\n     as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the\n     facts.\" § 556(d).\n\n     8. Orders can be issued only on consideration of the\n     record of the hearing. § 556(d).\n\n     9. The transcript of testimony and exhibits is the\n     exclusive record for decision and shall be made available\n     to parties. § 556(e).\n\n     10. The decision must include \"findings and conclusions,\n     and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material\n     issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the\n     record.\" § 557(c)(3)(A).\n\nSee Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 8.1 (4th\n\ned. 2002). Strikingly, there is no reference to discovery in these\n\nstatutory provisions of the APA, and cross-examination is assured\n\nonly if necessary \"for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\"\n\n5 U.S.C. § 556(d).   Most of these provisions relate to the conduct\n\nand responsibilities of the presiding officer or the basis for\n\nagency orders (on the record).   Only a few relate to the conduct of\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fthe hearing itself.        These APA requirements leave agencies with a\n\ngreat   deal    of   flexibility   in    tailoring    on-the-record    hearing\n\nprocedures to suit their perceived needs.\n\n            If hearings are not required to be “on the record,” the\n\nprocedures of §§ 556 and 557 are not triggered; the only section of\n\nthe APA applicable to the proceedings is § 555, titled \"Ancillary\n\nmatters.\"      Section 555(b) entitles a party to be represented by a\n\nlawyer, §      555(c)   entitles   people     who   have   submitted   data   or\n\nevidence to retain copies of their submissions, and § 555(e)\n\nrequires agencies to give prompt notice when they deny a petition\n\nmade in connection with a proceeding, and to give a brief statement\n\nof the grounds for denial.         Additionally, subsections (c) and (d)\n\nrequire that process, subpoenas, and other investigative demands\n\nmust be made in accordance with law.           Of course, these “informal”\n\nhearings must also comply with basic due process requirements.\n\n            From the beginning of its proposed rulemaking, the NRC\n\nrepeatedly      referred    to   the    procedures    outlined   in    the    new\n\nregulations as \"informal,\" as opposed to the outmoded formal\n\nprocedures of the past.          The clear implication was that the new\n\ninformal procedures would not meet the APA’s requirements for\n\nformal, on-the-record hearings.           Thus, the NRC believed that it\n\nfirst had to establish that its authorizing statute, the Atomic\n\nEnergy Act (AEA), did not require it to hold on-the-record hearings\n\nfor reactor licensing.\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\f                     Background to Rulemaking\n\n          Judge Selya outlines some of the important history of the\n\nrulemaking in this case.     However, there is more to this curious\n\nhistory that is worth telling.    From the 1998 Policy Statement to\n\nthe Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the NRC barely contemplated the\n\npossibility that it could reform its hearing procedures to its\n\nliking and still comply with the APA after all.       Indeed, at first,\n\nthe NRC did not propose any dramatic changes to its hearing\n\nprocedures. In its August 5, 1998 Policy Statement, the NRC stated\n\nthat it hoped to encourage a renewed vigor in the enforcement of\n\nalready-existing   hearing   procedures   by   the   Atomic   Safety   and\n\nLicensing Boards (ASLBs).6   To expedite hearings, the NRC advocated\n\ngreater adherence to schedules, more rigorous enforcement of time\n\nlimits for filing (for example, allowing extensions of time only in\n\n\"unavoidable and extreme circumstances\"), more rigorous enforcement\n\nof contention requirements,7 and tighter management of discovery.\n\n\n     6\n      On-the-record hearings at most agencies must be presided over\nby the agency, one of the members of the body that comprises the\nagency, or an administrative law judge (ALJ). 5 U.S.C. § 556(b).\nBecause of the highly technical nature of hearings before the NRC,\nhowever, Congress authorized the NRC \"to establish one or more\natomic safety and licensing boards, each comprised of three\nmembers, one of whom shall be qualified in the conduct of\nadministrative proceedings and two of whom shall have such\ntechnical or other qualifications as the Commission deems\nappropriate to the issues to be decided.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2241. These\nASLBs now preside over the bulk of licensing hearings at the NRC.\n     7\n      A request for hearing or a petition for leave to intervene in\na licensing hearing must set forth with particularity the\ncontentions sought to be litigated in the hearing.            These\n\n                                 -38-\n\fIt also announced that the NRC \"may consider further changes to the\n\nRules of Practice as appropriate to enable additional improvements\n\nto the adjudicatory process.\"\n\n          True to its word, the NRC issued a Staff Requirements\n\nMemorandum to its Office of General Counsel (OGC) on July 22, 1999,\n\ndirecting it to develop a proposed rulemaking.        At the same time,\n\nthe Commission noted that it would also pursue a legislative\n\nsolution by lobbying Congress to confirm its authority to reform\n\nlicensing hearings as it wished.         Again, the Staff Requirements\n\nMemorandum never suggested that the NRC could reduce the formality\n\nof its hearing procedures while staying within the strictures of\n\nthe APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings.        Instead, the\n\nNRC apparently still believed that the more informal licensing\n\nprocedures it sought would not comply with the APA, and that it had\n\nto establish its freedom from the APA's strictest requirements.\n\n          The Staff Requirements Memorandum also directed the NRC's\n\nOGC to solicit the views of interested parties on the proposed\n\nrulemaking.   Consequently, the general counsel held a two-day\n\nmeeting in October 1999, called a \"hearing process workshop,\" with\n\nrepresentatives   from   the   nuclear    industry,   citizens'   groups\n\n(including the petitioners in this case), other federal agencies,\n\nacademia, and the NRC's Atomic Safety Board and Licensing Panel.\n\nAlthough the OGC encouraged a wide-ranging conversation, no one\n\n\nrequirements were further tightened by the rulemaking.\n\n                                 -39-\n\fraised the possibility that the NRC licensing procedures could be\n\nmore informal yet still comply with the APA.\n\n          In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking itself, 66 Fed. Reg.\n\n19,610 (April 16, 2001), which for the first time proposed specific\n\nchanges to   the   NRC's    hearing   procedures,    there   was   still    no\n\nargument that the proposed procedures complied with the APA's\n\nrequirements.   Instead, the notice offered pages of legal analysis\n\non the history of the AEA, all intended to justify the NRC's\n\nability to promulgate new hearing procedures that are not subject\n\nto the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings.\n\n           Other choices made by the NRC in its regulatory overhaul\n\nfurther   emphasize   the    firmness    of   its   conviction     that    the\n\nsupposedly “informal” procedures it was proposing did not comply\n\nwith the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. In the one\n\ninstance where no one disputes that the NRC must hold on-the-record\n\nhearings -- the licensing of construction and operation of uranium\n\nenrichment facilities, see 42 U.S.C. § 2243(b) -- the Notice\n\ndescribed this process as \"requiring formal trial-type hearing\n\nprocedures to be used.\"     66 Fed. Reg. at 19,623.     Consequently, the\n\nNRC believed that it could not use new subpart L for these hearings\n\nbut had to resort to the more formal procedures of subpart G.8\n\n\n\n     8\n      Public Citizen emphasizes this point in its reply brief,\nstating: “The retention of Subpart G procedures for enrichment\nfacility hearings confirms that the NRC concluded in the rulemaking\nthat only Subpart G provided on-the-record hearing procedures.”\n\n                                  -40-\n\f          Strikingly, in the entire record of this rulemaking prior\n\nto the promulgation of the Final Rule, I can find only one footnote\n\nhinting that anyone at the NRC thought that it could reduce the\n\nformality of its procedures while at the same time complying with\n\nthe strictures of the APA.    In a footnote in its January 1999 memo,\n\nthe OGC acknowledged the possibility of eliminating the \"elements\n\nof Subpart G that go beyond the Administrative Procedure Act's\n\nrequirements for 'on-the-record' hearings.           One immediate effect\n\nwould be to eliminate formal discovery in NRC adjudications.\"             The\n\nmemo contains no further discussion of how far beyond the APA's\n\nrequirements the OGC understood Subpart G to go.\n\n          Not until publication of the Final Rule itself did the\n\nNRC assert for the first time that the new procedures comply with\n\nthe APA's requirements for an on-the-record hearing -- and even\n\nhere, the NRC devotes only a few sentences to the issues of cross-\n\nexamination, discovery, and the presiding officer.9           Indeed, the\n\nNRC's few statements are easily reproduced in their entirety.              In\n\nresponse to concerns about the reforms to cross-examination, the\n\nNRC stated: \"The Commission believes that this approach strikes an\n\nappropriate   balance   in   the   use    of   cross-examination,   and    is\n\n\n\n     9\n      The APA has various provisions intended to keep the presiding\nofficer independent of the parties and of the agency. See 5 U.S.C.\n§§ 554(d), 556(b), and 557(d)(1). ALJs' compensation is handled by\nthe Office of Personnel Management, not the agency appointing them\nfor adjudications. This arrangement is designed to keep them free\nof any undue influence from the agency.\n\n                                   -41-\n\fconsistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure\n\nAct (APA), which does not require cross-examination for on-the-\n\nrecord proceedings unless necessary for a 'fair and true disclosure\n\nof the facts.'\"    69 Fed. Reg. 2182, 2188 (Jan. 14, 2004).   A little\n\nlater, the NRC states: \"The Commission's consideration of cross-\n\nexamination in the hearing process begins with the observation that\n\nparties have no fundamental right to cross-examination, even in the\n\nmost formal hearing procedures provided in Subpart G.\"        69 Fed.\n\nReg. at 2195-96.\n\n          As for concerns about the availability of discovery, the\n\nNRC stated: \"Thus, the mandatory disclosure requirement in subpart\n\nC, the hearing file provision in subparts G, L, and N[,] and the\n\nrequirement for an LSN and 'electronic docket' in subpart J, go\n\nwell beyond the 'discovery' provisions for full, on-the-record\n\nadjudicatory hearings under the APA.\"10    69 Fed. Reg. at 2189.   As\n\n\n     10\n      The Final Rule explains elsewhere some of this passage’s more\nobscure terms. For hearings conducted under subpart J, the NRC and\npotential parties must\n\n     disclose pertinent documents by participating in the\n     \"Licensing Support Network\" (LSN) before an application\n     is filed. In addition, under subparts G, L, and N the NRC\n     staff is required to prepare, make available, and update\n     a \"hearing file\" consisting of the application and any\n     amendments, NRC safety and environmental reports relating\n     to the application, and any correspondence between the\n     NRC and the applicant that is relevant to the\n     application. A parallel concept is provided in subpart J\n     by the requirement for the NRC staff to maintain an\n     \"electronic docket.\"\n\n69 Fed. Reg. at 2189.\n\n                                 -42-\n\ffor presiding officers, the NRC described how the new regulations\n\nprovided for either an ALJ or a three-member ASLB to preside over\n\nthe hearing, and then stated: \"The Commission has taken this step\n\nto ensure that all of these proceedings meet the requirements with\n\nregard to a presiding officer for an on-the-record hearing under\n\nthe APA.\"       69 Fed. Reg. at 2191.       However, despite these few\n\nreferences in the Final Rule to meeting the APA’s requirements for\n\non-the-record hearings, the NRC's primary rationale for its new\n\nprocedures      remained   its   long-standing   position   that   reactor\n\nlicensing hearings did not have to comply with the on-the-record\n\nrequirements of the APA.11\n\n             In considerable part, administrative agencies set the\n\nterms of the debate in the rulemaking process with the arguments\n\nthey advance in support of their rulemaking initiatives.                If\n\ncertain arguments are unmistakably primary, those arguments will\n\ndraw most of the attention during the administrative process, and\n\nduring    the   judicial   review   that   follows.   Not   surprisingly,\n\nopponents will believe that the primacy of the argument means that\n\nit is the most important argument to address.         If, in the end, the\n\ndispositive issue on appeal is a different issue, addressed only\n\nglancingly in the administrative process, there has been enormous\n\nwasted effort, and the courts of appeal will be poorly served by\n\n\n     11\n      As Public Citizen says, the NRC filled both the Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking and the Final Rule with “page after page of\nargument” meant to establish this proposition.\n\n                                    -43-\n\fappellate briefing that reflects the outdated emphases of the\n\nadministrative process.     That is precisely what happened here.\n\n          In their petition for review, petitioners never even\n\nmentioned the argument of the NRC that its new procedures complied\n\nwith the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. Not one of\n\nthe petitioners addressed the argument in their opening briefs.12\n\nIndeed, the NRC tried to exploit this omission by arguing that\n\npetitioners had thereby waived the issue.         In response, Public\n\nCitizen stated that the NRC argued from the beginning of the\n\nrulemaking   that    its   freedom   from   the   APA's   on-the-record\n\nrequirements was essential to its ability to fashion informal\n\nprocedures, and “[t]here would have been no need for page after\n\npage of argument that Section 189 does not require on-the-record\n\nhearing procedures in reactor licensing cases if the NRC had\n\nbelieved that the new Subpart L procedures conformed to these\n\nrequirements.”13    Public Citizen added that the few references to\n\nAPA-compliance in the Final Rule were nothing more than \"stray\n\nremarks\" when weighed against the overwhelming number of statements\n\nto the contrary made by the NRC throughout the rulemaking.       Public\n\n\n\n     12\n      However, the amici States did devote a section of their\nbrief, filed before the NRC's opposition, to arguing that the new\nprocedures fail to meet the APA's requirements for on-the-record\nhearings.\n     13\n      Public Citizen refers to § 189 of the AEA, now codified at\n42 U.S.C. § 2239, which provides for hearings in licensing\ndecisions and judicial review.\n\n                                 -44-\n\fCitizen then tried to turn this lament into a legal argument based\n\nupon SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80 (1943).   Although the lament\n\nis a fair one, the legal argument does not work.\n\n                          SEC v. Chenery\n\n          In Chenery, the Supreme Court warned courts that they\n\nmust not substitute their own policy judgments for those of the\n\nadministrative agencies whose decisions they review.      The Court\n\nexplained that this rule did not disturb the settled rule that\n\nappellate courts can affirm trial court decisions that are right\n\nfor the wrong reasons:\n\n     In confining our review to a judgment upon the validity\n     of the grounds upon which the Commission itself based its\n     action, we do not disturb the settled rule that, in\n     reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be\n     affirmed if the result is correct although the lower\n     court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.\n     The reason for this rule is obvious.        It would be\n     wasteful to send a case back to a lower court to\n     reinstate a decision which it had already made but which\n     the appellate court concluded should properly be based on\n     another ground within the power of the appellate court to\n     formulate. But it is also familiar appellate procedure\n     that where the correctness of the lower court's decision\n     depends upon a determination of fact which only a jury\n     could make but which has not been made, the appellate\n     court cannot take the place of the jury. Like\n     considerations govern review of administrative orders. If\n     an order is valid only as a determination of policy or\n     judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and\n     which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made\n     to do service for an administrative judgment. For\n     purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders,\n     an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which\n     Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative\n     agency.\n\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\fSEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (Chenery I).14\n\n                The dispute in Chenery came before the Court again in\n\n1947, after         the   SEC   had   \"reexamined     the   problem,     recast   its\n\nrationale and reached the same result.\"               SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332\n\nU.S. 194, 196 (1947) (Chenery II).                    Accepting the SEC's new\n\ndecision as justified by an administrative determination that \"is\n\nbased        upon   substantial   evidence      and   is    consistent    with    the\n\nauthority granted by Congress,\" id. at 207, the Court noted the\n\n\"important corollary\" to Chenery's rule of judicial review of\n\nagency decisions:\n\n        If the administrative action is to be tested by the basis\n        upon which it purports to rest, that basis must be set\n        forth with such clarity as to be understandable. It will\n        not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory\n        underlying the agency's action; nor can a court be\n        expected to chisel that which must be precise from what\n        the agency has left vague and indecisive.       In other\n        words, 'We must know what a decision means before the\n        duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.'\n\n\n\n        14\n      Citing broad equitable principles of fiduciary duty taken\nfrom case law, the SEC had refused to approve a stock\nreorganization plan until it was amended to eliminate the effect of\nsome suspect stock purchases by the company's management.       The\ncompany amended the plan accordingly and the SEC approved it. The\nCourt found that the case law cited by the SEC, however, did not\nsupport its decision.    Rather than deciding whether the SEC's\ndecision could be sustained on a second basis -- that of the\nspecial authority given by Congress to the SEC to administer the\nsecurities laws -- the Court remanded the case to the agency for\nfurther proceedings. If the SEC had intended to invoke that second\nbasis as an alternative ground, it had not done so with sufficient\nclarity to allow the Court to review its action.\n\n\n                                         -46-\n\fId. at 196 (quoting United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R.R.\n\nCo., 294 U.S. 499, 511 (1935)).                 The Chenery decisions have\n\ncontinuing vitality today. See, e.g., NLRB v. K. River Cmty. Care,\n\nInc., 532 U.S. 706, 721 (2001); Nat'l Tower, LLC v. Plainville\n\nZoning Bd. of Appeals, 297 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2002); Rizek v.\n\nSEC,   215      F.3d    157,     161    (1st     Cir.        2000)   (citing      the\n\n\"well-established rule that agencies must sufficiently articulate\n\nthe grounds of their decisions so that appellate courts are able to\n\nperform their function of judicial review meaningfully.\")\n\n             Despite   the     NRC's   disproportionate         attention   to    its\n\noriginal premise       that    it   could   alter     its     procedures    for   the\n\nlicensing     of     nuclear     reactors      free     of    the    on-the-record\n\nrequirements of the APA, and its scant attention to the APA-\n\ncompliance argument that prevails here (found primarily in several\n\nsentences placed in the Final Rule), I agree with Judge Selya that\n\nthe NRC preserved the rationale that has become the basis for\n\naffirming its rulemaking initiative. However, if the Chenery cases\n\nhave a spirit, the NRC came perilously close to violating it here,\n\nwith the unfortunate consequences for efficient administrative\n\nprocess   and      effective    appellate      review    that    I   have   already\n\ndescribed.      Although, to quote Chenery II, we did not have \"to\n\nguess at the theory underlying the agency's action,\" 332 U.S. at\n\n197, we had to find it with too little help from the parties\n\nbecause of the NRC's failure to understand the APA's flexibility.\n\n\n                                       -47-\n\f                                  Further History\n\n               The NRC's belated recognition that the new licensing\n\nprocedures might in fact comply with the on-the-record requirements\n\nof     the     APA   is   all   the   more     surprising     because      sources\n\ncontemporaneous with the APA's passage suggest that flexibility has\n\nalways been a hallmark of the APA, and that agencies have always\n\nhad considerable discretion to structure on-the-record hearings to\n\nsuit their particular needs.            This flexibility is nowhere more\n\nevident than in determining the role of cross-examination in on-\n\nthe-record hearings.\n\n               The   Attorney   General's     Manual   on   the    Administrative\n\nProcedure Act (1947) is a \"key document\" for interpreting the APA,\n\nAm. Min. Cong. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1109\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1993).         We have described it as containing the \"most\n\nauthoritative\" account of the history of the Act's passage, Warder\n\nv. Shalala, 149 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir. 1998).                See also V. Yankee\n\nNuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S.\n\n519,     546     (1978)    (the     Attorney     General's        Manual   is   \"a\n\ncontemporaneous interpretation previously given some deference by\n\nthis Court because of the role played by the Department of Justice\n\nin drafting the legislation\").                The Attorney General’s Manual\n\noffers a vision of cross-examination entirely consistent with that\n\nadvanced by the NRC in this rulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\f          The Manual begins by stressing the general importance of\n\ncross-examination in on-the-record hearings, cautioning that \"it is\n\nclear that the 'right to present his case or defense by oral or\n\ndocumentary evidence' does not extend to presenting evidence in\n\naffidavit or other written form so as to deprive the agency or\n\nopposing parties of opportunity for cross-examination.\"                   AG's\n\nManual at 77. Technical evidence may be introduced in written form\n\nas long as its admission \"would not prejudicially deprive other\n\nparties or the agency of opportunity for cross-examination.              Thus,\n\ntechnical and statistical data may be introduced in convenient\n\nwritten form subject to adequate opportunity for cross-examination\n\nand rebuttal.\"    Id.\n\n          The    Attorney    General's       Manual   goes   on,   however,   to\n\nacknowledge   that   the    general    opportunity     to    cross-examine    is\n\nsubject to restrictions which become more salient as the complexity\n\nof the hearing's subject matter increases.               On this point, the\n\nManual quotes from the Report of the House Committee on the\n\nJudiciary on the APA. The Report cautions that the APA's provision\n\nfor \"such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true\n\ndisclosure of the facts\" does not\n\n     confer     a    right     of     so-called   'unlimited'\n     cross-examination. Presiding officers will have to make\n     the   necessary   initial    determination  whether   the\n     cross-examination is pressed to unreasonable lengths by\n     a party or whether it is required for the 'full and true\n     disclosure of the facts' stated in the provision. Nor is\n     it the intention to eliminate the authority of agencies\n     to confer sound discretion upon presiding officers in the\n\n                                      -49-\n\f      matter of its extent.    The test is -- as the section\n      states -- whether it is required 'for a full and true\n      disclosure of the facts.'        In many rule making\n      proceedings where the subject matter and evidence are\n      broadly economic or statistical in character and the\n      parties or witnesses numerous, the direct or rebuttal\n      evidence may be of such a nature that cross-examination\n      adds nothing substantial to the record and unnecessarily\n      prolongs the hearings.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 37.\n\n             The Attorney General’s Manual and the House Report serve\n\nas   good   indicators   that    Congress,       when   it    passed    the     APA,\n\nunderstood     that   agencies    needed     a     considerable        amount    of\n\nflexibility in fashioning hearing procedures for on-the-record\n\nhearings.    Despite the frequent use of terms like \"trial-type\" and\n\n\"quasi-judicial\" over the years to refer to on-the-record hearings,\n\nagencies have always been able to adapt their procedures for on-\n\nthe-record hearings under the APA.          Today, this statute of general\n\napplicability governs the procedures for an enormous variety of\n\nhearings -- everything from relatively simple claims for workers'\n\ncompensation, to enforcement proceedings under the National Labor\n\nRelations Act or the Occupational Health and Safety Act, to complex\n\nrate-setting     hearings   before     the    Federal        Energy    Regulatory\n\nCommission. See Manual for Administrative Law Judges (ALJ Manual),\n\n49-51.\n\n            This historical flexibility is confirmed by a modern-day\n\nguide to the conduct of on-the-record hearings, the Manual for\n\nAdministrative Law Judges, which provides a thorough overview of\n\n\n                                     -50-\n\fthe current state of on-the-record procedures.15          Although the\n\nManual is primarily designed as a practical aid for ALJs, it also\n\noffers an analysis of the fundamental requirements of the APA,\n\nincluding a section on the special problems presented by complex\n\nhearings at both the agency and ALJ levels.     See ALJ Manual at 49-\n\n70.   Ultimately, if the ALJ Manual tells us anything about what a\n\ntypical on-the-record hearing looks like, it is that there is no\n\ntypical hearing.\n\n           In its section on complex hearings, the ALJ Manual begins\n\nby noting that the term \"quasi-judicial\" is most often used to\n\nrefer to \"relatively simple cases.\"    Id. at 50.   \"Typically, these\n\nquasi-judicial   proceedings   are   nearly   identical   to   a   formal\n\nadjudication without a jury,\" with the full panoply of pleadings,\n\npre-hearing discovery, and witnesses who testify orally on direct\n\nand cross-examination.    Id. at 49.    Complex cases, however, are\n\n\n\n      15\n      See http://www.oalj.dol.gov/public/apa/refrnc/malj.pdf. The\ncurrent edition of the Manual is not an official government\npublication. Previous editions of this Manual, however, had been\npublished by the Administrative Conference of the United States\n(ACUS), a government body.      Prof. Morell E. Mullins of the\nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law was the\nprincipal editor and revisor of the third edition in 1990. After\nCongress eliminated funding for the ACUS in the 1990s, Prof.\nMullins took it upon himself in 2001 to reproduce the Manual on the\nweb in somewhat updated form.       Recently, this 2001 \"interim\nInternet edition,\" as he called it, was published in substantially\nunchanged form in the journal of the National Association of\nAdministrative Law Judges, a nonprofit professional organization.\nAlso, the website of the Office of Administrative Law Judges, U.S.\nDepartment of Labor, links to the Manual (while not guaranteeing\nits accuracy or expressing a view on its contents).\n\n                                -51-\n\f\"another matter,\" bearing less resemblance to our traditional\n\nconcept of a civil trial.         Id. at 51.     The ALJ Manual cites the\n\nNRC's use of ASLBs as an \"innovative approach to complex cases\"\n\nwith highly technical subject matter.          Id. at 52.   In general, the\n\nALJ Manual emphasizes the use of written submissions of direct and\n\nrebuttal evidence: \"Typically, much of the testimony is highly\n\ntechnical and lengthy, and is submitted in written form prior to\n\nthe hearing.\"       Id. at 51.   \"Preparation and exchange of direct and\n\nrebuttal evidence is usually beneficial in complex cases.\"               Id. at\n\n56.16\n\n             Like   the   Attorney   General's   Manual,    the    ALJ   Manual\n\nemphasizes the basic importance of the opportunity to cross-examine\n\nin on-the-record hearings, noting that \"judges should be extremely\n\ncautious about denying parties an opportunity to cross-examine\n\nwitnesses.\"    Id. at 55 n.149.      In the end, however, and again like\n\nthe Attorney General's Manual, the ALJ Manual also acknowledges the\n\nagencies' need to adapt hearing procedures to suit especially\n\ncomplex cases, observing that \"[u]nless witness credibility is\n\ninvolved, cross-examination is frequently confined to clarifying\n\nthe exhibits, determining the source of the material, and testing\n\nthe basis for the witness's conclusions.\"         Id. at 83.      In fact, the\n\n\n\n        16\n      Of course, 5 U.S.C. § 556(d) provides that, in deciding\napplications for initial licenses, all evidence may be submitted in\nwritten form only so long as \"a party will not be prejudiced\nthereby.\"\n\n                                     -52-\n\fALJ Manual even notes a proposal by one legal commentator that \"the\n\nmajor rebuttal of expert opinion testimony should take place not by\n\ncross-examination but by submission, prior to the hearing, of\n\nrebuttal testimony prepared by the opponent's experts.\"        Id.\n\n           These   sources,   both   contemporaneous   with   the   APA's\n\npassage and modern, show that procedures in on-the-record hearings,\n\ndespite sometimes being described as \"trial-type\" procedures, can\n\nin fact stray considerably from the procedures found in civil\n\ntrials as the subjects of the administrative proceedings become\n\nmore complex and more technical.      This flexibility is inherent in\n\nthe APA, and has been acknowledged by commentators and by courts.\n\nSee Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle, 572 F.2d 872, 880\n\n(1st Cir. 1978) (finding no basis to petitioners' argument that the\n\nAPA required presiding officer to afford opportunity for cross-\n\nexamination); Cellular Mobile Systems of Pa., Inc. v. FCC, 782 F.2d\n\n182, 198 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (\"Cross-examination is therefore not an\n\nautomatic right conferred by the APA; instead, its necessity must\n\nbe established under specific circumstances by the party seeking\n\nit.\").17   With these abundant sources pointing the way, the NRC's\n\nbelated recognition that the APA could, in fact, accommodate its\n\nprocedural reforms is all the more puzzling.\n\n\n\n     17\n      Of course, it hardly needs repeating that \"[n]aturally, the\nAdministrator's decision regarding the necessity of holding\ncross-examination will be subject to judicial review. 5 U.S.C. §\n706(2)(A).\" Seacoast, 572 F.2d at 880 n.18.\n\n                                 -53-\n\f                             Conclusion\n\n           For most of the history of this rulemaking, the NRC\n\nargued that it did not have to comply with the APA's on-the-record\n\nrequirements in refashioning its procedures for reactor licensing\n\nhearings. Belatedly, and then only sketchily, the NRC advanced the\n\nalternative argument that its proposed procedures complied with\n\nthose   on-the-record   requirements.        The    staying   power   of   old\n\ntheories and flawed analogies (the repeated references to trial-\n\ntype proceedings) may account for some of this delay. Whatever the\n\nreasons, the   deleterious   effect     of   this    late   insight   on   the\n\nrulemaking process and our review of it is undeniable.            Countless\n\nhours were wasted during the administrative process fighting over\n\nthe tired issue of whether 42 U.S.C. § 2239 requires reactor\n\nlicensing hearings to be on the record.            This tired issue dogged\n\njudicial review as well.       Although we have done what Chenery\n\nrequires -- affirming on a basis advanced by the agency itself\n\nduring the administrative process -- we got there with too little\n\nhelp from the parties.   There is a victory here for the NRC, but it\n\nshould be a cause for self-examination rather than jubilation.\n\n\n\n\n                                -54-\n\f",

These new rules greatly reduce the level of formality in reactor licensing proceedings but, at the same time, place certain unaccustomed restrictions upon the parties. The petitioners and petitioner-intervenors are public interest groups. Supported by the Attorneys General of five states (who have filed a helpful amicus brief), they claim that the new rules violate a statutory requirement that all reactor licensing hearings be conducted in accordance with sections 554, 556, and 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 554, 556 &amp; 557.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In the alternative, they claim that the Commission has not put forth an adequate justification for so substantial a departure from prior practice and that, therefore, the new rules must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious. Fully cognizant of the gravity of our task, we have studied the complex statutory and regulatory framework and scrutinized the plenitudinous administrative record. After completing that perscrutation and grappling with an antecedent jurisdictional question, we find that the new procedures in fact comply with the relevant provisions of the APA and that the Commission has furnished an adequate explanation for the changes. Consequently, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The NRC is the federal agency charged with regulating the use of nuclear energy, including the licensing of reactors used for power generation. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2201. The Atomic Energy Act requires the Commission to hold a hearing \"upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2239(a)(1)(A), before granting a new license, a license amendment, or a license renewal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The NRC's predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), originally interpreted this provision as requiring on-the-record hearings in accordance with the APA. <i>See</i> Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Legislation, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, 87th Cong. 60 (1962) (letter of AEC Commissioner Loren K. Olsen). These hearings closely resembled federal court trials, complete with a full panoply of discovery devices and direct and cross-examination of witnesses by advocates for the parties. Such hearings proved to be very lengthy; some lasted as long as seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, the NRC relaxed its approach for certain types of licensing proceedings. <i>See, e.g., In re Kerr-McGee Corp.,</i> 15 N.R.C. 232, 235, 1982 WL 31680 (1982) (determining that formal hearings are not necessary in materials licensing cases). Although the results were heartening, the Commission nevertheless retained the full range of trial-like procedures for reactor licensing cases. The passage of time brought further changes: faced with the prospect of hearings on many license renewal applications in the near future &#8212; a large number of reactors were initially licensed in the decade from 1960 to 1970 and the standard term for such licenses was forty years &#8212; the Commission began to reassess its adjudicatory processes, focusing particularly on the procedures used in reactor licensing cases. The NRC's issuance, in 1998, of a policy on the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings, 63 Fed.Reg. 41,872 (Aug. 5, 1998), marked the inception of this process. This policy statement reiterated the NRC's commitment to expeditious adjudication and urged hearing officers to employ a variety of innovative case-management techniques in order to improve hearing efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While encouraging better utilization of existing procedures, the Commission also began pondering possible procedural revisions. In January of 1999, the NRC's general counsel drafted a legal memorandum concluding that the Atomic Energy Act did not require reactor licensing hearings to be on the record and, accordingly, that the Commission had the option of replacing the existing format with a truncated regime. Later that year, the Commission held a widely attended workshop on hearing procedures. Building on this foundation, the Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking on April 16, 2001, 66 Fed.Reg. 19,610, suggesting a major revision of its hearing procedures. In an accompanying statement, the Commission took the position that section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239, does not require reactor licensing proceedings to be on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 2004, the NRC published a final rule, along with a response to the comments that the proposed rule had generated. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. 2,182. With minor exceptions, the final rule replicated the proposed rule. The statement of considerations for the final rule reiterated the Commission's view that reactor licensing hearings may be informal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new rules took effect on February 13, 2004. Although they apply to all adjudications conducted by the NRC, the petitioners only challenge their application to reactor licensing proceedings. We therefore confine our ensuing discussion to that aspect of the new rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the old protocol, all reactor licensing hearings were conducted according to the procedures outlined in 10 C.F.R. part 2, subpart G. The subpart G rules resemble those associated with judicial proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> They include a complete armamentarium of traditional discovery devices (e.g., requests for document production, interrogatories, and depositions). 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.705. The parties may make motions for summary disposition (although the hearing officer is not required to entertain them). <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.710. There is an evidentiary hearing at which testimony is presented through direct and cross-examination of witnesses by the parties. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.711.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the new rules, reactor licensing hearings are, for the most part, to be conducted according to a less elaborate set of procedures described in 10 C.F.R. pt. 2, subpart L.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The new subpart &#8212; which differs materially from the old subpart L &#8212; limns a streamlined hearing procedure. Unlike subpart G, subpart L does not provide for traditional discovery. 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.1203. Instead, parties in hearings governed by subpart L are required to make certain mandatory disclosures (akin to \"open file\" discovery) anent expert witnesses, expert witness reports, relevant documents, data compilations, and claims of privilege. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearings themselves also differ. Under subpart L, the presumption is that all interrogation of witnesses will be undertaken by the hearing officer, not the litigants. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.1207. Parties are allowed to submit proposed questions in advance of the hearing, but the presiding officer is under no compulsion to pose them. <i>Id.</i> Parties are not allowed to submit proposed questions during the hearing unless requested to do so by the presiding officer. <i>Id.</i> Cross-examination is not available as of right, although a party may request permission to conduct cross-examination that it deems \"necessary to ensure the development of an adequate record for decision.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.1204. A party seeking leave to conduct cross-examination must submit a cross-examination plan, which will be included in the record of the proceeding regardless of whether the request is allowed. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners &#8212; we use that phrase broadly to include the petitioner-intervenors &#8212; took umbrage at these changes and brought these petitions for judicial review. Their primary claim is that the Commission erred in its determination that reactor licensing proceedings do not have to be fully formal adjudications. In their view, the new rules do not comply with the APA's requirements for on-the-record adjudication and, therefore, cannot stand. As a fallback, the petitioners assert that even if the new rules are not ultra vires, they must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have operated on the assumption that this court has first-instance jurisdiction to hear and determine their petitions for judicial review. We are not so sanguine &#8212; and we are cognizant that, as a court of limited jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction will not accrete to us either by the parties' acquiescence or by their consent. <i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.2003). Consequently, we asked the parties to address what we perceived to be a thorny question relating to our authority to entertain these petitions. Before proceeding to the merits of the petitioners' asseverational array, we must resolve that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are as follows. The petitioners premise jurisdiction on the Administrative Orders Review Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2341-2351, better known as the Hobbs Act. In pertinent part, that statute confers original jurisdiction on the courts of appeals to hear petitions for judicial review of \"all final orders of the [NRC] made reviewable by section 2239 of title 42.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 2342(4). In turn, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239(b) makes reviewable, inter alia, \"[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a) of this section.\" The proceedings enumerated in that subsection include those for \"the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license or construction permit, or application to transfer control, and in any proceeding for the issuance or modification of rules and regulations dealing with the activities of licensees.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2239(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read literally, these interlocking statutes would not seem to grant jurisdiction to this court. After all, the petitioners are challenging a rule, not an order. The APA, which is made applicable to the Commission by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2231, defines an order as \"the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency <i>in a matter other than rule making</i>....\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(6) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the action at issue here &#8212; a rulemaking &#8212; would appear to fall outside the scope of review provided by the Hobbs Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if one were tempted to suppose that Congress simply misspoke in limiting Hobbs Act jurisdiction to the review of orders, other sections of the Act would seem to militate against a judicial reconstruction of the term \"order\" to encompass rulemaking. The Act explicitly provides for initial court of appeals review of \"all rules, regulations, or final orders\" of the Secretary of Transportation, the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Surface Transportation Board. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2342(3), 2342(5). The principle is clear that Congress's use of differential language in various sections of the same statute is presumed to be intentional and deserves interpretive weight. <i>See Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 173, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001); <i>In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship,</i> 262 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were we writing on a pristine page, we would likely find this careful parsing persuasive and thus dismiss the case so that the petitioners could seek initial review in an appropriate district court. The page, however, is cluttered, not pristine. There is a substantial body of precedent elaborating the scope of the Hobbs Act with respect to both the NRC and other agencies to which it applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key case is <i>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion,</i> 470 U.S. 729, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985), in which the Supreme Court determined that Hobbs Act jurisdiction existed in the courts of appeals for initial review of the NRC's denial of citizen petitions to suspend or revoke licenses. <i>Id.</i> at 746, 105 S.Ct. 1598. In making this determination, the Court declared that the language of section 2239 was ambiguous as to whether it limited judicial review to orders entered in proceedings under that section. <i>Id.</i> at 736, 105 S.Ct. 1598. The Court then declared that the Hobbs Act should be interpreted broadly, so as to maximize the availability of initial circuit court review of licensing proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 745, 105 S.Ct. 1598.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court laid out two grounds in support of this reasoning. First, it cited efficiency concerns. In this regard, the Court deemed initial circuit court review the better use of judicial resources, observed that such a course eliminates one layer of review, and stressed that there is usually no need for the compilation of either a fresh or an augmented record in agency review proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 744, 105 S.Ct. 1598. Second, the Court harangued against the evils of piecemeal review. In this regard, it warned that when Congress clearly places initial review of some agency actions in the courts of appeals, the jurisdictional provision should not be interpreted narrowly to shunt review of other agency actions to the district courts. <i>Id.</i> at 741-42, 105 S.Ct. 1598. For these reasons, the Court admonished that \"[a]bsent a firm indication that Congress intended to locate initial APA review of agency action in the district courts, we will not presume that Congress intended to depart from the sound policy of placing initial APA review in the courts of appeals.\" <i>Id.</i> at 745, 105 S.Ct. 1598.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lorion</i> has displayed remarkable vitality. The Seventh Circuit applied its teachings in <i>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. U.S. NRC,</i> 830 F.2d 610 (7th Cir.1987), finding jurisdiction to review the Commission's assessment of fees for the processing of a licensing application. <i>Id.</i> at 613. In the court's view, the assessment was sufficiently related to a licensing proceeding to ground circuit court jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 612-13. Pertinently for present purposes, the court, in the exercise of its discerned jurisdiction, reviewed the underlying rules on which the Commission had based its assessment. <i>Id.</i> at 616.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closer to home, this court has applied <i>Lorion</i> to find jurisdiction when a contrary reading of the applicable statute would, for no apparent reason, have divided judicial review between the district courts and the courts of appeals. <i>See City of Boston v. U.S. HUD,</i> 898 F.2d 828, 834-35 (1st Cir.1990). The Third Circuit has gone even further, holding that <i>Lorion</i> creates a presumption of initial circuit court review \"absent clear and convincing evidence of a contrary congressional intent.\" <i>Conoco, Inc. v. Skinner,</i> 970 F.2d 1206, 1214 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the question is close, we conclude that appellate jurisdiction is proper in this case. In reaching this conclusion, we start with the premise that both the Hobbs Act and the Atomic Energy Act are ambiguous as to their reach. Furthermore, while the term \"order\" has a clear meaning for APA purposes, its placement in section 2239 of the Atomic Energy Act suggests that Congress might not have used it with the same precision in connection with the intersection of the Hobbs Act and the Atomic Energy Act. <i>Cf. Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States,</i> 880 F.2d 1503, 1504 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the same word may have different meanings in different statutory contexts). That premise is bolstered by the fact that the Atomic Energy Act uses the terms \"order\" and \"rule\" inconsistently. For example, section 2239(b) refers to \"[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a),\" but section 2239(a) includes proceedings \"for the issuance or modification of rules and regulations dealing with the activities of licensees.\" This disharmony renders the meaning of \"order\" in this context uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these amphibolies, we believe that the policies announced by the Supreme Court in <i>Lorion</i> deserve special weight. We interpret <i>Lorion</i> as holding that original jurisdiction in the courts of appeals is proper to review any NRC action that could be cognizable in a petition for review from a proceeding under section 2239. This interpretation is consistent with the <i>Lorion</i> Court's instruction that jurisdictional statutes should be construed so that agency actions will always be subject to initial review in the same court, regardless of the procedural package in which they are wrapped. <i>Lorion,</i> 470 U.S. at 742, 105 S.Ct. 1598. By like token, an affirmation of jurisdiction in this case is consistent with the <i>Lorion</i> Court's conclusion that judicial efficiency is best served by limiting the layers of review. <i>Id.</i> at 744-45, 105 S.Ct. 1598. On this basis, and in conformity with our earlier decision in <i>City of Boston,</i> we conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain these petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the merits into three segments, corresponding with the petitioners' most lively bruited points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Ultra Vires.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mainstay of the petitioners' challenge is the proposition that the new rules exceed the Commission's statutory authority. The petitioners start with the premise that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239 requires the NRC to conduct licensing hearings on the record, that is, in strict accordance with the relevant provisions of the APA. <i>See supra</i> note 1. In their view, the new rules fail to satisfy that requirement and, therefore, must be pole-axed. In the pages that follow, we examine both the petitioners' premise and their conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2239 requires the Commission, \"upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected\" by certain agency actions, to hold \"a hearing.\" It does not explicitly require that the hearing be on the record. We have held, however, that the degree of formality that a hearing must afford does not necessarily turn on the presence or absence of an explicit statutory directive. If, even absent such a directive, the nature of the hearing that Congress intended to grant is clear, then that intention governs. <i>Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor,</i> 246 F.3d 36, 46 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle,</i> 572 F.2d 872, 876 (1st Cir.1978). We assume arguendo, favorably to the petitioners, that the <i>Seacoast</i> rule still obtains.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners advance several arguments for holding that Congress, in enacting section 2239, purposed to require on-the-record hearings in reactor licensing cases. In addition to canvassing the legislative history and cataloging the relevant amendments to the statute, they point out that for approximately four decades the NRC and its predecessor agency, the AEC, interpreted the statute as requiring on-the-record hearings in reactor licensing proceedings. In response, the NRC highlights the ambiguity of the statute and attempts to situate the latest round of changes in a larger history of procedural experimentation. The Commission also notes that some courts have interpreted section 2239 to allow informal hearings in licensing proceedings not involving reactors. <i>See, e.g., City of W. Chicago v. U.S. NRC,</i> 701 F.2d 632, 645 (7th Cir.1983) (licensing of nuclear materials). Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the Commission urges us to defer to its judgment that informal hearings are a suitable prophylactic for reactor licensing. <i>Cf. Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> 384 F.3d 8, 19-20 (1st Cir.2004) (deferring to the agency's judgment on the proper application of a procedural statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For years, the courts of appeals have avoided the question of whether section 2239 requires reactor licensing hearings to be on the record. <i>See, e.g., Kelley v. Selin,</i> 42 F.3d 1501, 1510-14 (6th Cir.1995) (discussing, but not resolving, the issue while approving the use of informal hearings for materials storage issues); <i>Nuclear Info. &amp; Res. Serv. v. NRC,</i> 969 F.2d 1169, 1180 (D.C.Cir.1992) (en banc) (deeming the issue forfeited and declining to decide it); <i>Union of Concerned Scientists v. U.S. NRC,</i> 920 F.2d 50, 53 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1990) (finding the procedural rules at issue to comply with the APA and declining to decide whether formal hearings are required); <i>City of W. Chicago,</i> 701 F.2d at 642-43 (distinguishing reactor licensing from materials licensing and addressing only the latter). We too decline to resolve this issue. Because the new rules adopted by the Commission meet the requirements of the APA it does not matter what type of hearing the NRC is required to conduct in reactor licensing cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before elaborating our reasoning on this point, we must dispense with a procedural theory advocated by the petitioner Public Citizen. It is a bedrock principle that a court may only uphold an administrative action on a rationale advanced by the agency in the administrative proceeding. <i>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</i> 318 U.S. 80, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Embracing this principle, Public Citizen asserts that the Commission has waived the argument that the new rules satisfy the APA's requirements because, in promulgating the new rules, it relied exclusively on its view that section 2239 does not mandate on-the-record hearings. Thus, it cannot now rely on a different rationale to defend the rules in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion reads the record through rose-colored glasses. The Commission explicitly memorialized in the statement of considerations for the final rule the view that even if reactor licensing hearings were required to be on the record, the new rules would meet that requirement. 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,192 (\"[T]he Commission believes that ... the hearing procedures in each of these subparts meets [sic] the requirements for an on-the-record hearing under the APA....\"). No more was exigible to preserve the point. Accordingly, we turn to the merits of this rationale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We exercise plenary review over the Commission's compliance with the APA. <i>See Dantran,</i> 246 F.3d at 48 (stating that agencies' interpretations of statutes they do not administer are not entitled to particular deference). The APA lays out only the most skeletal framework for conducting agency adjudications, leaving broad discretion to the affected agencies in formulating detailed procedural rules. <i>See Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. United States,</i> 627 F.2d 1313, 1321 (D.C.Cir.1980). In specific terms, the APA requires only that the agency provide a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker and allow each party an opportunity \"to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners urge that the magnitude of the risks involved in reactor licensing proceedings warrant the imposition of a more elaborate set of safeguards. It is beyond cavil, however, that, short of constitutional constraints, a court may not impose procedural requirements in administrative cases above and beyond those mandated by statute (here, the APA). <i>Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 435 U.S. 519, 543-44, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978); <i>Union of Concerned Scientists,</i> 920 F.2d at 53. Accordingly, we are not at liberty to impress on the Commission (or any other agency, for that matter) a procedural regime not mandated by Congress. The NRC's new rules will, therefore, succumb to the petitioners' first line of attack only if they fail to provide the minimal procedural safeguards actually demanded by the APA. <i>See Nat'l Classif. Comm. v. United States,</i> 765 F.2d 1146, 1151 (D.C.Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now from the general to the particular. The rulemaking at issue here effected several changes in the Commission's procedures. The petitioners focus their challenge on two aspects of the newly minted process. First, they object to the Commission's decision to eliminate discovery. Second, they complain about the Commission's decision to circumscribe the availability of cross-examination. Because these are the only issues on which the petitioners have offered developed argumentation, we confine our analysis to those portions of the new rules. <i>Cf. United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the question of whether the new rules fall below the APA's minimum requirements by eliminating discovery. The Commission points out, and the petitioners do not seriously contest, that the APA does not explicitly require the provision of any discovery devices in formal adjudications. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556; <i>see also Kelly v. U.S. EPA,</i> 203 F.3d 519, 523 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Frilette v. Kimberlin,</i> 508 F.2d 205, 208 (3d Cir.1974). Thus, if the APA requires the Commission to provide any discovery to satisfy the standards for formal adjudications, that discovery must be necessary either to effectuate some other procedural right guaranteed by the APA or to ensure an adequate record for judicial review. <i>Cf. U.S. Lines, Inc. v. Fed. Maritime Comm'n,</i> 584 F.2d 519, 540 (D.C.Cir.1978) (stating that an agency charged with holding a hearing to determine the public interest must provide adequate means of public participation); <i>Seacoast,</i> 572 F.2d at 876-77 (noting that in some cases procedural requirements may be implied to ensure adequate judicial review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners suggest that discovery is necessary to realize the right of citizen-intervenors to present their case and submit an informed rebuttal. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556. If discovery is unavailable, this thesis runs, citizen-intervenors will be unable to gather the evidence needed to support their contentions and, thus, will be shut out of meaningful participation in licensing hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This thesis is composed of more cry than wool. The petitioners argue as if the new rules have eliminated all access to information from opposing parties &#8212; but that is a gross distortion. The new rules provide meaningful access to information from adverse parties in the form of a system of mandatory disclosure. <i>See</i> 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.336. Although there might well be less information available to citizen-intervenors under the new rules, the difference is one of degree. There is simply no principled way that we can say that the difference occasioned by replacing traditional discovery methods with mandatory disclosure is such that citizen-intervenors are left with no means of adequately presenting their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think that full-dress discovery is essential to ensure a satisfactory record for judicial review. The Commission's final decision in any hearing must survive review based on the evidence adduced in the hearing. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(e). The applicant bears the burden of proof in any licensing hearing, <i>id.</i> &#167; 556(d), and it will have every incentive to proffer sufficient information to allow the agency to reach a reasoned decision. That same quantum of information should be adequate for a reviewing court to determine whether the agency's action is supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be to paint the lily. There is simply no discovery-linked conflict between the new rules and the APA's on-the-record adjudication requirement. The petitioners' first line of argument is, therefore, a dead end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to cross-examination, the petitioners' contentions fare no better: the new rules meet the APA's requirements. To explain this conclusion, we first must strip away the rhetorical flourishes in which the petitioners shroud their reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to understand that, contrary to the petitioners' importunings, the new rules do not extirpate cross-examination. Rather, they restrict its use to situations in which it is \"necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision.\" 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.1204. The legitimacy of this restriction must be weighed in light of the fact that the APA does not provide an absolute right of cross-examination in on-the-record hearings. <i>Seacoast,</i> 572 F.2d at 880. The APA affords a right only to such cross-examination as may be necessary for a full and fair adjudication of the facts. <i>Id.</i> Equally to the point, \"[t]he party seeking to cross-examine bears the burden of showing that cross-examination is in fact necessary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 880 n. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission represents that, despite the difference in language, it interprets the standard for allowing cross-examination under the new rules to be equivalent to the APA standard. 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,195-96. When an agency provides a plausible interpretation of its own procedural rules and there is no record or pattern of contrary conduct a court has no right either to slough off that interpretation or to deem it disingenuous. <i>Cf. Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 378-79 (1st Cir.2003) (accepting the agency's good faith in carrying out its procedures, while acknowledging that evidence to the contrary might warrant judicial intervention). Given the Commission's stated interpretation, the new rules on cross-examination cannot be termed inconsistent with the dictates of the APA. Nor do we see how cross-examination that is not \"necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision\" could be necessary to ensure appropriate judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that the new rules meet the APA requirements for on-the-record adjudications, we hold that their promulgation does not exceed the Commission's authority. Consequently, the petitioners' ultra vires argument founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Arbitrary and Capricious.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our labors are not yet done. Even though we hold that the new rules are within the ambit of the NRC's authority, we still must consider whether its decision to discard the old in favor of the new was arbitrary and capricious. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agency's rules, once adopted, are not frozen in place. The opposite is true: an agency may alter its rules in light of its accumulated experience in administering them. <i>Rust v. Sullivan,</i> 500 U.S. 173, 186-87, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991). An agency must, however, offer a reasoned explanation for the change. If the agency fails to furnish such an explanation, or if the proffered explanation fails to demonstrate that the agency fully considered its new course, the revised rules must be set aside. <i>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 463 U.S. 29, 42, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (\"If Congress established a presumption from which judicial review should start, that presumption ... is ... <i>against</i> changes in current policy that are not justified by the rulemaking record.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners begin this branch of their assault with a global challenge to the rationality of departing from the NRC's forty-year-old procedural regime. They do not suggest that the Commission's goal of improving hearing efficiency is impermissible; rather, they maintain that the current procedures worked well enough and that the Commission has made no showing that they were the source of any past inefficiencies. The petitioners further note evidence in the rulemaking record suggesting that efficiency gains could be brought about through less drastic measures, such as more aggressive case management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve this point, we first must determine what an agency must show to justify modifying its procedural rules. As a general principle, agencies have broad authority to formulate their own procedures &#8212; and the NRC's authority in this respect has been termed particularly great. <i>Union of Concerned Scientists,</i> 920 F.2d at 54; <i>BPI v. Atomic Energy Comm'n,</i> 502 F.2d 424, 428 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1974). A necessary corollary of this authority is the freedom to experiment with different procedural formats. Consequently, tinkering with rules is by no means a forbidden activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there are limits on this prerogative. An agency may not act precipitously or in an irrational manner in revising its rules. But so long as these limits are observed, it is not the place of a reviewing court to second-guess the agency's decision as to <i>when</i> to make procedural changes. It is enough that the agency reasonably determines that existing processes are unsatisfactory and takes steps that are fairly targeted at improving the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the NRC has determined that its existing rules of practice lead to hearings that are cumbersome, unnecessarily protracted, and wasteful of the resources of the parties and the Commission. This determination warrants a high degree of deference. <i>See Vt. Yankee,</i> 435 U.S. at 543-44, 98 S.Ct. 1197 (holding that agencies' evaluations of their procedural needs are entitled to great respect). Although the petitioners may disagree, we descry nothing in the record that would support setting aside the rule on the basis that the agency should have left well enough alone. It would unfairly handcuff administrators if agencies could not change their procedures simply because certain of their constituencies admired the status quo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves the <i>how</i> of the Commission's new rules; that is, the question whether the Commission acted arbitrarily in making a specific set of changes in order to achieve its goal of improved hearing efficiency. To clear this hurdle, the Commission must show both that its new rules constitute a rational means for achieving its stated objective and that it sensibly rejected other options considered in the rulemaking proceeding (including the option of maintaining the status quo). <i>See State Farm,</i> 463 U.S. at 43-44, 103 S.Ct. 2856. This calculus must fairly account for any benefits lost by modifying existing rules, as well as any advantages expected to be gained through the adoption of updated rules. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, too, we address only the NRC's decisions to replace traditional discovery with mandatory disclosure and to restrict the availability of conventional cross-examination. With regard to discovery, the NRC explained in its statement of considerations for the final rule that the proposed substitute \"has the potential to significantly reduce delays and resources expended by all parties in discovery.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,194. The Commission also expressed the view that replacing traditional discovery with mandatory disclosure would eliminate a substantial amount of motion practice related to discovery matters. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the Commission determined that any prejudice to citizen-intervenors from eliminating traditional discovery would be offset by the mandatory disclosure requirements and the general public availability of NRC documents. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners renew their exhortation that discovery is necessary for citizen-intervenors to participate effectively in reactor licensing hearings. They speculate that without discovery they will be without access to large amounts of detailed technical information (information that is available to the applicant and the Commission staff) and, thus, will be unable to respond adequately to technical and factual arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the petitioners that the Commission's explanation for the change in discovery practice is thin. The Commission baldly states its belief that eliminating traditional discovery will shorten hearings and conserve resources, but it provides no empirical analysis of its experience with traditional discovery from which an outside observer can determine what benefits the Commission might reasonably expect. In a substantive rule, this omission might be fatal. <i>See, e.g., Portland Cement Ass'n v. Ruckelshaus,</i> 486 F.2d 375, 393 (D.C.Cir.1973) (\"It is not consonant with the purpose of a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate rules on the basis of inadequate data, or on data that, [in] critical degree, is known only to the agency.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the realm of procedure, however, agencies are presumed to have special competence and, accordingly, are held to less exacting standards of explication. <i>See Union of Concerned Scientists,</i> 920 F.2d at 54 (noting that procedural determinations \"fall uniquely within the expertise of the agency\"). To add to this leeway, we are not willing to ignore matters that are common knowledge to courts of law. Discovery, especially in complex matters, is both time-consuming and costly. We do not think it can reasonably be questioned that the replacement of discovery with mandatory disclosure will make reactor licensing hearings faster and less expensive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission also has explained that it believes any harm to citizen-intervenors will be minimal. Although the petitioners offer some hypothetical examples of information that may be unavailable under the new rules, they have not made a persuasive case that mandatory disclosure will undercompensate for the loss of traditional discovery. We thus find no basis for setting aside the new rules on discovery-related grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new rules' outlook on cross-examination presents a closer question. The Commission reasons that restricting cross-examination will reduce the amount of testimony taken and make hearings more efficient. 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,196. The Commission further observes that, in its experience, cross-examination is not always helpful to the resolution of scientific or technical issues. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners retort that cross-examination is a vital component of a citizen-intervenor's case. They note that citizen-intervenors often lack the resources to present their own expert testimony and must rely on cross- questioning of the adverse party's experts to make their case. They also stress the value of cross-examination as a means for bolstering public confidence in licensing hearings. Tellingly, the Commission's own administrative judges agree that cross-examination is helpful for the resolution of issues raised in many licensing hearings. In addition to the reasons advanced by the petitioners, the administrative judges note that the prospect of cross-examination discourages exaggeration in direct testimony because witnesses are aware that they will have to defend their statements later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Experience in the courts has left no doubt that cross-examination can be a useful tool. Had the new rules abolished cross-examination entirely, we might well find the Commission's action insupportable. Importantly, however, the new rules do not completely do away with cross-examination. Rather, they leave its availability to the discretion of the hearing officer. Just as we will not ignore the fact that discovery is resource-consuming, we will not presume that all &#8212; or, perhaps, even most &#8212; cross-examination is essential to the just resolution of issues. With this in mind, we find no fault with the Commission's decision to attempt to curtail unnecessary cross-examination. <i>Cf.</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(d) (\"[T]he agency as a matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.\"). Accordingly, we cannot say that it is arbitrary and capricious for the Commission to leave the determination of whether cross-examination will further the truth-seeking process in a particular proceeding to the discretion of the individual hearing officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do, however, add a caveat. The APA does require that cross-examination be available when \"required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" <i>Id.</i> If the new procedures are to comply in practice with the APA, cross-examination must be allowed in appropriate instances. Should the agency's administration of the new rules contradict its present representations or otherwise flout this principle, nothing in this opinion will inoculate the rules against future challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Constitutional Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One petitioner, Citizens Awareness Network (CAN), charges that the new rules are unconstitutional because they deprive citizen-intervenors of fundamental political rights and discriminate against them in violation of the Fifth Amendment. We explore these charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAN's first charge implodes because there is no fundamental right to participate in administrative adjudications. Reactor licensing (unlike, say, voting) is not \"preservative of other basic civil and political rights.\" <i>Reynolds v. Sims,</i> 377 U.S. 533, 562, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964). Assuming, for argument's sake, that citizen-intervenors have a protected liberty interest in the outcome of reactor licensing proceedings &#8212; a proposition that we consider extremely dubious, <i>see City of W. Chicago,</i> 701 F.2d at 645 &#8212; the quantum of process required before the government may deprive citizen-intervenors of that interest would depend on the three-part analysis adumbrated in <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). CAN makes no effort to apply the <i>Mathews</i> rubric to the rules at issue, and we will not do CAN's homework for it. The issue is, therefore, forfeit. <i>See Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for equal protection, CAN claims that we should apply strict scrutiny because citizen-intervenors are a \"discrete and insular minority.\" This claim is meritless. The Supreme Court has made it crystal clear that the criteria for deeming a class suspect are both rigorous and specific. <i>Johnson v. Robison,</i> 415 U.S. 361, 375 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974); <i>San Antonio Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). As a class, citizen-intervenors cannot begin to meet those criteria. They are not \"saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process,\" <i>Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. at 28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, nor do they share any \"immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth,\" <i>Johnson,</i> 415 U.S. at 375 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 1160.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Belaboring this point would serve no useful purpose. Whatever legitimate grievances citizen-intervenors may have, it is absurd to equate discrimination against them with the historic discrimination against racial and other minorities that lies at the core of suspectedness. The bottom line is that citizen-intervenors are not a suspect class. We so hold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding means, of course, that rational basis review applies, not strict scrutiny. <i>See Boivin v. Black,</i> 225 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2000). Thus, CAN bears the burden of demonstrating that no plausible set of facts exists that could forge a rational relationship between the challenged rules and the government's legitimate goals. <i>Id.</i> at 44; <i>Montalvo-Huertas v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 885 F.2d 971, 978-79 (1st Cir.1989). For the reasons set forth above, <i>see supra</i> Part III(B), there can be no doubt that the Commission's action is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that CAN's constitutional argument is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Procedural flexibility is one of the great hallmarks of the administrative process-and it is a feature that courts must be reluctant to curtail. Though the Commission's new rules may approach the outer bounds of what is permissible under the APA, we find the statute sufficiently broad to accommodate them. Similarly, the Commission's judgments as to when its procedures need fine-tuning and how they should be retooled are ones to which we accord great respect. We cannot say that the Commission's desire for more expeditious adjudications is unreasonable, nor can we say that the changes embodied in the new rules are an eccentric or a plainly inadequate means for achieving the Commission's goals. Accordingly, both of the instant petitions must be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petitions for judicial review are denied and dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In the pages that follow, we use the modifiers \"on the record\" and \"formal\" interchangeably to refer to adjudications conducted in accordance with sections 554, 556, and 557 of the APA</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Subpart G was amended by the new rules, but the changes to it are not pertinent here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We say \"for the most part\" because there are exceptions.

Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and that <i>Dantran</i> merely followed <i>Seacoast</i> without assessing its vitality in the post-<i>Chevron</i> era. It seems clear that while the type of hearing required by a statute turns on congressional intent, <i>Chevron</i> adds a new dimension, requiring that the agency's reasonable interpretation be accorded deference if there is any ambiguity as to that intent. <i>See id.</i> at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778 To what extent (if at all) this reality erodes <i>Seacoast's</i> rationale is a question that we leave for another day.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The APA requires the presiding officer to be the agency, a member of the agency, or an administrative law judge. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(b). In NRC hearings, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 explicitly authorizes the Commission to empanel safety and licensing boards consisting of one person \"qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings\" and two persons with \"such technical or other qualifications as the Commission deems appropriate\" to preside at hearings under section 2239</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I concur fully in Judge Selya's thoughtful and comprehensive opinion, I write separately to describe some oddities about this case which should not go unnoticed. The basic proposition of Judge Selya's decision is indisputably correct: the new rules promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to reduce the level of formality in reactor licensing proceedings comply with the \"on-the-record\" requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Yet that legal proposition was largely an afterthought of the NRC in the effort to justify its new rules. Instead, the NRC principally argued in the long run-up to this case that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239, which simply requires the Commission to hold a hearing \"upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected\" before granting a new license, did not invoke the requirements for formal adjudication (commonly referred to as \"on-the-record\" hearings) under the APA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is striking that so many smart people at the NRC could be so wrong for so long about the requirements of the APA. Although this history does not affect the outcome of this case, it should be noted as a cautionary tale about the power of analogy and the endurance of unexamined legal theories. This history also serves to explain some of the legitimate frustrations of the petitioners, who felt that they were dealing with a moving target as the NRC tried to justify its new regulations. With so much at stake in these nuclear reactor licensing proceedings, the rulemaking process should have followed a steadier course. For reasons I shall explain, this was not the rulemaking process at its best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Terminology</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The terminology for hearings under the APA can be imprecise and confusing. The everyday meaning of terms like \"formal\" and \"informal\" sometimes creeps into the discussion, although those terms have specific, functional definitions under the APA. As Judge Selya notes, the terms \"formal\" and \"on-the-record\" are generally used as shorthand for hearings that must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 554, 556, and 557 of the APA. Other terms, too, are sometimes used to refer to such procedures &#8212; \"trial-type\" and \"quasi-judicial.\" These vague and indefinite terms are particularly mischievous because they evoke images of courtroom trials, and they have contributed to the false impression that the APA's requirement of on-the-record hearings involves procedures more akin to civil trials than is actually the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be specific, &#167; 554 requires that, in cases of an \"adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,\" the agency must follow the procedures outlined in &#167;&#167; 556 and 557. Although the statutory text at issue here is itself rather pithy, these procedures can be usefully condensed into the following ten points:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

The decision must include \"findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record.\" &#167; 557(c)(3)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See</i> Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 8.1 (4th ed.2002). Strikingly, there is no reference to discovery in these statutory provisions of the APA, and cross-examination is assured only if necessary \"for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(d). Most of these provisions relate to the conduct and responsibilities of the presiding officer or the basis for agency orders (on the record). Only a few relate to the conduct of the hearing itself. These APA requirements leave agencies with a great deal of flexibility in tailoring on-the-record hearing procedures to suit their perceived needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If hearings are not required to be \"on the record,\" the procedures of &#167;&#167; 556 and 557 are not triggered; the only section of the APA applicable to the proceedings is &#167; 555, titled \"Ancillary matters.\" Section 555(b) entitles a party to be represented by a lawyer, &#167; 555(c) entitles people who have submitted data or evidence to retain copies of their submissions, and &#167; 555(e) requires agencies to give prompt notice when they deny a petition made in connection with a proceeding, and to give a brief statement of the grounds for denial. Additionally, subsections (c) and (d) require that process, subpoenas, and other investigative demands must be made in accordance with law. Of course, these \"informal\" hearings must also comply with basic due process requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of its proposed rulemaking, the NRC repeatedly referred to the procedures outlined in the new regulations as \"informal,\" as opposed to the outmoded formal procedures of the past. The clear implication was that the new informal procedures would not meet the APA's requirements for formal, on-the-record hearings. Thus, the NRC believed that it first had to establish that its authorizing statute, the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), did not require it to hold on-the-record hearings for reactor licensing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background to Rulemaking</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Selya outlines some of the important history of the rulemaking in this case. However, there is more to this curious history that is worth telling. From the 1998 Policy Statement to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the NRC barely contemplated the possibility that it could reform its hearing procedures to its liking and still comply with the APA after all. Indeed, at first, the NRC did not propose any dramatic changes to its hearing procedures. In its August 5, 1998 Policy Statement, the NRC stated that it hoped to encourage a renewed vigor in the enforcement of already-existing hearing procedures by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards (ASLBs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To expedite hearings, the NRC advocated greater adherence to schedules, more rigorous enforcement of time limits for filing (for example, allowing extensions of time only in \"unavoidable and extreme circumstances\"), more rigorous enforcement of contention requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and tighter management of discovery. It also announced that the NRC \"may consider further changes to the Rules of Practice as appropriate to enable additional improvements to the adjudicatory process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True to its word, the NRC issued a Staff Requirements Memorandum to its Office of General Counsel (OGC) on July 22, 1999, directing it to develop a proposed rulemaking. At the same time, the Commission noted that it would also pursue a legislative solution by lobbying Congress to confirm its authority to reform licensing hearings as it wished. Again, the Staff Requirements Memorandum never suggested that the NRC could reduce the formality of its hearing procedures while staying within the strictures of the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. Instead, the NRC apparently still believed that the more informal licensing procedures it sought would not comply with the APA, and that it had to establish its freedom from the APA's strictest requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Staff Requirements Memorandum also directed the NRC's OGC to solicit the views of interested parties on the proposed rulemaking. Consequently, the general counsel held a two-day meeting in October 1999, called a \"hearing process workshop,\" with representatives from the nuclear industry, citizens' groups (including the petitioners in this case), other federal agencies, academia, and the NRC's Atomic Safety Board and Licensing Panel. Although the OGC encouraged a wide-ranging conversation, no one raised the possibility that the NRC licensing procedures could be more informal yet still comply with the APA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking itself, 66 Fed.Reg. 19,610 (April 16, 2001), which for the first time proposed specific changes to the NRC's hearing procedures, there was still no argument that the proposed procedures complied with the APA's requirements. Instead, the notice offered pages of legal analysis on the history of the AEA, all intended to justify the NRC's ability to promulgate new hearing procedures that are not subject to the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other choices made by the NRC in its regulatory overhaul further emphasize the firmness of its conviction that the supposedly \"informal\" procedures it was proposing did not comply with the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. In the one instance where no one disputes that the NRC must hold on-the-record hearings &#8212; the licensing of construction and operation of uranium enrichment facilities, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2243(b) &#8212; the Notice described this process as \"requiring formal trial-type hearing procedures to be used.\" 66 Fed.Reg. at 19,623. Consequently, the NRC believed that it could not use new subpart L for these hearings but had to resort to the more formal procedures of subpart G.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strikingly, in the entire record of this rulemaking prior to the promulgation of the Final Rule, I can find only one footnote hinting that anyone at the NRC thought that it could reduce the formality of its procedures while at the same time complying with the strictures of the APA. In a footnote in its January 1999 memo, the OGC acknowledged the possibility of eliminating the \"elements of Subpart G that go beyond the Administrative Procedure Act's requirements for `on-the-record' hearings. One immediate effect would be to eliminate formal discovery in NRC adjudications.\" The memo contains no further discussion of how far beyond the APA's requirements the OGC understood Subpart G to go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not until publication of the Final Rule itself did the NRC assert for the first time that the new procedures comply with the APA's requirements for an on-the-record hearing-and even here, the NRC devotes only a few sentences to the issues of cross-examination, discovery, and the presiding officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Indeed, the NRC's few statements are easily reproduced in their entirety. In response to concerns about the reforms to cross-examination, the NRC stated: \"The Commission believes that this approach strikes an appropriate balance in the use of cross-examination, and is consistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which does not require cross-examination for on-the-record proceedings unless necessary for a `fair and true disclosure of the facts.'\" 69 Fed.Reg. 2182, 2188 (Jan. 14, 2004). A little later, the NRC states: \"The Commission's consideration of cross-examination in the hearing process begins with the observation that parties have no fundamental right to cross-examination, even in the most formal hearing procedures provided in Subpart G.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 2195-96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for concerns about the availability of discovery, the NRC stated: \"Thus, the mandatory disclosure requirement in subpart C, the hearing file provision in subparts G, L, and N[,] and the requirement for an LSN and `electronic docket' in subpart J, go well beyond the `discovery' provisions for full, on-the-record adjudicatory hearings under the APA.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> 69 Fed.Reg. at 2189. As for presiding officers, the NRC described how the new regulations provided for either an ALJ or a three-member ASLB to preside over the hearing, and then stated: \"The Commission has taken this step to ensure that all of these proceedings meet the requirements with regard to a presiding officer for an on-the-record hearing under the APA.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 2191. However, despite these few references in the Final Rule to meeting the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings, the NRC's primary rationale for its new procedures remained its long-standing position that reactor licensing hearings did not have to comply with the on-the-record requirements of the APA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considerable part, administrative agencies set the terms of the debate in the rulemaking process with the arguments they advance in support of their rulemaking initiatives. If certain arguments are unmistakably primary, those arguments will draw most of the attention during the administrative process, and during the judicial review that follows. Not surprisingly, opponents will believe that the primacy of the argument means that it is the most important argument to address. If, in the end, the dispositive issue on appeal is a different issue, addressed only glancingly in the administrative process, there has been enormous wasted effort, and the courts of appeal will be poorly served by appellate briefing that reflects the outdated emphases of the administrative process. That is precisely what happened here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their petition for review, petitioners never even mentioned the argument of the NRC that its new procedures complied with the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. Not one of the petitioners addressed the argument in their opening briefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Indeed, the NRC tried to exploit this omission by arguing that petitioners had thereby waived the issue. In response, Public Citizen stated that the NRC argued from the beginning of the rulemaking that its freedom from the APA's on-the-record requirements was essential to its ability to fashion informal procedures, and \"[t]here would have been no need for page after page of argument that Section 189 does not require on-the-record hearing procedures in reactor licensing cases if the NRC had believed that the new Subpart L procedures conformed to these requirements.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Public Citizen added that the few references to APA- compliance in the Final Rule were nothing more than \"stray remarks\" when weighed against the overwhelming number of statements to the contrary made by the NRC throughout the rulemaking. Public Citizen then tried to turn this lament into a legal argument based upon <i>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</i> 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Although the lament is a fair one, the legal argument does not work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>SEC v. Chenery</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Chenery,</i> the Supreme Court warned courts that they must not substitute their own policy judgments for those of the administrative agencies whose decisions they review. The Court explained that this rule did not disturb the settled rule that appellate courts can affirm trial court decisions that are right for the wrong reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In confining our review to a judgment upon the validity of the grounds upon which the Commission itself based its action, we do not disturb the settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the result is correct although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason. The reason for this rule is obvious. It would be wasteful to send a case back to a lower court to reinstate a decision which it had already made but which the appellate court concluded should properly be based on another ground within the power of the appellate court to formulate. But it is also familiar appellate procedure that where the correctness of the lower court's decision depends upon a determination of fact which only a jury could make but which has not been made, the appellate court cannot take the place of the jury. Like considerations govern review of administrative orders. If an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment. For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>SEC v.

Accepting the SEC's new decision as justified by an administrative determination that \"is based upon substantial evidence and is consistent with the authority granted by Congress,\" <i>id.</i> at 207, 67 S.Ct. 1575, the Court noted the \"important corollary\" to <i>Chenery's</i> rule of judicial review of agency decisions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the administrative action is to be tested by the basis upon which it purports to rest, that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable. It will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency's action; nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive. In other words, `We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575 (quoting <i>United States v.

However, if the <i>Chenery</i> cases have a spirit, the NRC came perilously close to violating it here, with the unfortunate consequences for efficient administrative process and effective appellate review that I have already described. Although, to quote <i>Chenery II</i>, we did not have \"to guess at the theory underlying the agency's action,\" 332 U.S. at 197, 67 S.Ct. 1575, we had to find it with too little help from the parties because of the NRC's failure to understand the APA's flexibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Further History</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The NRC's belated recognition that the new licensing procedures might in fact comply with the on-the-record requirements of the APA is all the more surprising because sources contemporaneous with the APA's passage suggest that flexibility has always been a hallmark of the APA, and that agencies have always had considerable discretion to structure on-the-record hearings to suit their particular needs. This flexibility is nowhere more evident than in determining the role of cross-examination in on-the-record hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act (1947) is a \"key document\" for interpreting the APA, <i>Am. Min. Cong. v. Mine Safety &amp; Health Admin.,</i> 995 F.2d 1106, 1109 (D.C.Cir.1993). We have described it as containing the \"most authoritative\" account of the history of the Act's passage, <i>Warder v. Shalala,</i> 149 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir.1998). <i>See also V. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 435 U.S. 519, 546, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978) (the Attorney General's Manual is \"a contemporaneous interpretation previously given some deference by this Court because of the role played by the Department of Justice in drafting the legislation\"). The Attorney General's Manual offers a vision of cross-examination entirely consistent with that advanced by the NRC in this rulemaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manual begins by stressing the general importance of cross-examination in on-the-record hearings, cautioning that \"it is clear that the `right to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence' does not extend to presenting evidence in affidavit or other written form so as to deprive the agency or opposing parties of opportunity for cross-examination.\" AG's Manual at 77. Technical evidence may be introduced in written form as long as its admission \"would not prejudicially deprive other parties or the agency of opportunity for cross-examination. Thus, technical and statistical data may be introduced in convenient written form subject to adequate opportunity for cross-examination and rebuttal.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's Manual goes on, however, to acknowledge that the general opportunity to cross-examine is subject to restrictions which become more salient as the complexity of the hearing's subject matter increases. On this point, the Manual quotes from the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary on the APA. The Report cautions that the APA's provision for \"such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts\" does not</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">confer a right of so-called `unlimited' cross-examination. Presiding officers will have to make the necessary initial determination whether the cross-examination is pressed to unreasonable lengths by a party or whether it is required for the `full and true disclosure of the facts' stated in the provision. Nor is it the intention to eliminate the authority of agencies to confer sound discretion upon presiding officers in the matter of its extent. The test is &#8212; as the section states &#8212; whether it is required `for a full and true disclosure of the facts.' In many rule making proceedings where the subject matter and evidence are broadly economic or statistical in character and the parties or witnesses numerous, the direct or rebuttal evidence may be of such a nature that cross-examination adds nothing substantial to the record and unnecessarily prolongs the hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep.

Despite the frequent use of terms like \"trial-type\" and \"quasi-judicial\" over the years to refer to on-the-record hearings, agencies have always been able to adapt their procedures for on-the-record hearings under the APA. Today, this statute of general applicability governs the procedures for an enormous variety of hearings &#8212; everything from relatively simple claims for workers' compensation, to enforcement proceedings under the National Labor Relations Act or the Occupational Health and Safety Act, to complex rate-setting hearings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. <i>See</i> Manual for Administrative Law Judges (ALJ Manual), 49-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This historical flexibility is confirmed by a modern-day guide to the conduct of on-the-record hearings, the Manual for Administrative Law Judges, which provides a thorough overview of the current state of on-the-record procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Although the Manual is primarily designed as a practical aid for ALJs, it also offers an analysis of the fundamental requirements of the APA, including a section on the special problems presented by complex hearings at both the agency and ALJ levels. <i>See</i> ALJ Manual at 49-70. Ultimately, if the ALJ Manual tells us anything about what a typical on-the-record hearing looks like, it is that there is no typical hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its section on complex hearings, the ALJ Manual begins by noting that the term \"quasi-judicial\" is most often used to refer to \"relatively simple cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50. \"Typically, these quasi-judicial proceedings are nearly identical to a formal adjudication without a jury,\" with the full panoply of pleadings, pre-hearing discovery, and witnesses who testify orally on direct and cross-examination. <i>Id.</i> at 49. Complex cases, however, are \"another matter,\" bearing less resemblance to our traditional concept of a civil trial. <i>Id.</i> at 51. The ALJ Manual cites the NRC's use of ASLBs as an \"innovative approach to complex cases\" with highly technical subject matter. <i>Id.</i> at 52. In general, the ALJ Manual emphasizes the use of written submissions of direct and rebuttal evidence: \"Typically, much of the testimony is highly technical and lengthy, and is submitted in written form prior to the hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 51. \"Preparation and exchange of direct and rebuttal evidence is usually beneficial in complex cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the Attorney General's Manual, the ALJ Manual emphasizes the basic importance of the opportunity to cross-examine in on-the-record hearings, noting that \"judges should be extremely cautious about denying parties an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55 n. 149. In the end, however, and again like the Attorney General's Manual, the ALJ Manual also acknowledges the agencies' need to adapt hearing procedures to suit especially complex cases, observing that \"[u]nless witness credibility is involved, cross-examination is frequently confined to clarifying the exhibits, determining the source of the material, and testing the basis for the witness's conclusions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83. In fact, the ALJ Manual even notes a proposal by one legal commentator that \"the major rebuttal of expert opinion testimony should take place not by cross-examination but by submission, prior to the hearing, of rebuttal testimony prepared by the opponent's experts.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These sources, both contemporaneous with the APA's passage and modern, show that procedures in on-the-record hearings, despite sometimes being described as \"trial-type\" procedures, can in fact stray considerably from the procedures found in civil trials as the subjects of the administrative proceedings become more complex and more technical. This flexibility is inherent in the APA, and has been acknowledged by commentators and by courts. <i>See Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle,</i> 572 F.2d 872, 880 (1st Cir.1978) (finding no basis to petitioners' argument that the APA required presiding officer to afford opportunity for cross-examination); <i>Cellular Mobile Systems of Pa., Inc. v. FCC,</i> 782 F.2d 182, 198 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\"Cross-examination is therefore not an automatic right conferred by the APA; instead, its necessity must be established under specific circumstances by the party seeking it.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> With these abundant sources pointing the way, the NRC's belated recognition that the APA could, in fact, accommodate its procedural reforms is all the more puzzling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For most of the history of this rulemaking, the NRC argued that it did not have to comply with the APA's on-the-record requirements in refashioning its procedures for reactor licensing hearings. Belatedly, and then only sketchily, the NRC advanced the alternative argument that its proposed procedures complied with those on-the-record requirements. The staying power of old theories and flawed analogies (the repeated references to trial-type proceedings) may account for some of this delay. Whatever the reasons, the deleterious effect of this late insight on the rulemaking process and our review of it is undeniable. Countless hours were wasted during the administrative process fighting over the tired issue of whether 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239 requires reactor licensing hearings to be on the record. This tired issue dogged judicial review as well. Although we have done what <i>Chenery</i> requires &#8212; affirming on a basis advanced by the agency itself during the administrative process &#8212; we got there with too little help from the parties. There is a victory here for the NRC, but it should be a cause for self-examination rather than jubilation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> On-the-record hearings at most agencies must be presided over by the agency, one of the members of the body that comprises the agency, or an administrative law judge (ALJ). 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(b).

These new rules greatly reduce the level of formality in reactor licensing proceedings but, at the same time, place certain unaccustomed restrictions upon the parties. The petitioners and petitioner-intervenors are public interest groups. Supported by the Attorneys General of five states (who have filed a helpful amicus brief), they claim that the new rules violate a statutory requirement that all reactor licensing hearings be conducted in accordance with sections 554, 556, and 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 554, 556 &amp; 557.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In the alternative, they claim that the Commission has not put forth an adequate justification for so substantial a departure from prior practice and that, therefore, the new rules must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious. Fully cognizant of the gravity of our task, we have studied the complex statutory and regulatory framework and scrutinized the plenitudinous administrative record. After completing that perscrutation and grappling with an antecedent jurisdictional question, we find that the new procedures in fact comply with the relevant provisions of the APA and that the Commission has furnished an adequate explanation for the changes. Consequently, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The NRC is the federal agency charged with regulating the use of nuclear energy, including the licensing of reactors used for power generation. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2201. The Atomic Energy Act requires the Commission to hold a hearing \"upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2239(a)(1)(A), before granting a new license, a license amendment, or a license renewal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The NRC's predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), originally interpreted this provision as requiring on-the-record hearings in accordance with the APA. <i>See</i> Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Legislation, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, 87th Cong. 60 (1962) (letter of AEC Commissioner Loren K. Olsen). These hearings closely resembled federal court trials, complete with a full panoply of discovery devices and direct and cross-examination of witnesses by advocates for the parties. Such hearings proved to be very lengthy; some lasted as long as seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, the NRC relaxed its approach for certain types of licensing proceedings. <i>See, e.g., In re Kerr-McGee Corp.,</i> 15 N.R.C. 232, 235, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31680</span></span> (1982) (determining that formal hearings are not necessary in materials licensing cases). Although the results were heartening, the Commission nevertheless retained the full range of trial-like procedures for reactor licensing cases. The passage of time brought further changes: faced with the prospect of hearings on many license renewal applications in the near future &#8212; a large number of reactors were initially licensed in the decade from 1960 to 1970 and the standard term for such licenses was forty years &#8212; the Commission began to reassess its adjudicatory processes, focusing particularly on the procedures used in reactor licensing cases. The NRC's issuance, in 1998, of a policy on the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings, 63 Fed.Reg. 41,872 (Aug. 5, 1998), marked the inception of this process. This policy statement reiterated the NRC's commitment to expeditious adjudication and urged hearing officers to employ a variety of innovative case-management techniques in order to improve hearing efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While encouraging better utilization of existing procedures, the Commission also began pondering possible procedural revisions. In January of 1999, the NRC's general counsel drafted a legal memorandum concluding that the Atomic Energy Act did not require reactor licensing hearings to be on the record and, accordingly, that the Commission had the option of replacing the existing format with a truncated regime. Later that year, the Commission held a widely attended workshop on hearing procedures. Building on this foundation, the Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking on April 16, 2001, 66 Fed.Reg. 19,610, suggesting a major revision of its hearing procedures. In an accompanying statement, the Commission took the position that section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239, does not require reactor licensing proceedings to be on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 2004, the NRC published a final rule, along with a response to the comments that the proposed rule had generated. <i>See</i> 69 Fed.Reg. 2,182. With minor exceptions, the final rule replicated the proposed rule. The statement of considerations for the final rule reiterated the Commission's view that reactor licensing hearings may be informal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new rules took effect on February 13, 2004. Although they apply to all adjudications conducted by the NRC, the petitioners only challenge their application to reactor licensing proceedings. We therefore confine our ensuing discussion to that aspect of the new rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the old protocol, all reactor licensing hearings were conducted according to the procedures outlined in 10 C.F.R. part 2, subpart G. The subpart G rules resemble those associated with judicial proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> They include a complete armamentarium of traditional discovery devices (e.g., requests for document production, interrogatories, and depositions). 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.705. The parties may make motions for summary disposition (although the hearing officer is not required to entertain them). <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.710. There is an evidentiary hearing at which testimony is presented through direct and cross-examination of witnesses by the parties. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.711.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the new rules, reactor licensing hearings are, for the most part, to be conducted according to a less elaborate set of procedures described in 10 C.F.R. pt. 2, subpart L.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The new subpart &#8212; which differs materially from the old subpart L &#8212; limns a streamlined hearing procedure. Unlike subpart G, subpart L does not provide for traditional discovery. 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.1203. Instead, parties in hearings governed by subpart L are required to make certain mandatory disclosures (akin to \"open file\" discovery) anent expert witnesses, expert witness reports, relevant documents, data compilations, and claims of privilege. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearings themselves also differ. Under subpart L, the presumption is that all interrogation of witnesses will be undertaken by the hearing officer, not the litigants. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.1207. Parties are allowed to submit proposed questions in advance of the hearing, but the presiding officer is under no compulsion to pose them. <i>Id.</i> Parties are not allowed to submit proposed questions during the hearing unless requested to do so by the presiding officer. <i>Id.</i> Cross-examination is not available as of right, although a party may request permission to conduct cross-examination that it deems \"necessary to ensure the development of an adequate record for decision.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2.1204. A party seeking leave to conduct cross-examination must submit a cross-examination plan, which will be included in the record of the proceeding regardless of whether the request is allowed. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners &#8212; we use that phrase broadly to include the petitioner-intervenors &#8212; took umbrage at these changes and brought these petitions for judicial review. Their primary claim is that the Commission erred in its determination that reactor licensing proceedings do not have to be fully formal adjudications. In their view, the new rules do not comply with the APA's requirements for on-the-record adjudication and, therefore, cannot stand. As a fallback, the petitioners assert that even if the new rules are not ultra vires, they must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have operated on the assumption that this court has first-instance jurisdiction to hear and determine their petitions for judicial review. We are not so sanguine &#8212; and we are cognizant that, as a court of limited jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction will not accrete to us either by the parties' acquiescence or by their consent. <i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200783\"><a href=\"/opinion/200783/espinal-dominguez-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 495 (1st Cir.2003). Consequently, we asked the parties to address what we perceived to be a thorny question relating to our authority to entertain these petitions. Before proceeding to the merits of the petitioners' asseverational array, we must resolve that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are as follows. The petitioners premise jurisdiction on the Administrative Orders Review Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2341-2351, better known as the Hobbs Act. In pertinent part, that statute confers original jurisdiction on the courts of appeals to hear petitions for judicial review of \"all final orders of the [NRC] made reviewable by section 2239 of title 42.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 2342(4). In turn, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239(b) makes reviewable, inter alia, \"[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a) of this section.\" The proceedings enumerated in that subsection include those for \"the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license or construction permit, or application to transfer control, and in any proceeding for the issuance or modification of rules and regulations dealing with the activities of licensees.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2239(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read literally, these interlocking statutes would not seem to grant jurisdiction to this court. After all, the petitioners are challenging a rule, not an order. The APA, which is made applicable to the Commission by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2231, defines an order as \"the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency <i>in a matter other than rule making</i>....\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551(6) (emphasis supplied). Thus, the action at issue here &#8212; a rulemaking &#8212; would appear to fall outside the scope of review provided by the Hobbs Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if one were tempted to suppose that Congress simply misspoke in limiting Hobbs Act jurisdiction to the review of orders, other sections of the Act would seem to militate against a judicial reconstruction of the term \"order\" to encompass rulemaking. The Act explicitly provides for initial court of appeals review of \"all rules, regulations, or final orders\" of the Secretary of Transportation, the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Surface Transportation Board. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2342(3), 2342(5). The principle is clear that Congress's use of differential language in various sections of the same statute is presumed to be intentional and deserves interpretive weight. <i>See Duncan v.

In making this determination, the Court declared that the language of section 2239 was ambiguous as to whether it limited judicial review to orders entered in proceedings under that section. <i>Id.</i> at 736, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court then declared that the Hobbs Act should be interpreted broadly, so as to maximize the availability of initial circuit court review of licensing proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 745, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, it cited efficiency concerns. In this regard, the Court deemed initial circuit court review the better use of judicial resources, observed that such a course eliminates one layer of review, and stressed that there is usually no need for the compilation of either a fresh or an augmented record in agency review proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 744, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1598</span></a></span>. Second, the Court harangued against the evils of piecemeal review. In this regard, it warned that when Congress clearly places initial review of some agency actions in the courts of appeals, the jurisdictional provision should not be interpreted narrowly to shunt review of other agency actions to the district courts. <i>Id.</i> at 741-42, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1598</span></a></span>. For these reasons, the Court admonished that \"[a]bsent a firm indication that Congress intended to locate initial APA review of agency action in the district courts, we will not presume that Congress intended to depart from the sound policy of placing initial APA review in the courts of appeals.\" <i>Id.</i> at 745, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Seventh Circuit applied its teachings in <i>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. U.S. NRC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495251\"><a href=\"/opinion/495251/commonwealth-edison-co-v-united-states-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1987), finding jurisdiction to review the Commission's assessment of fees for the processing of a licensing application. <i>Id.</i> at 613. In the court's view, the assessment was sufficiently related to a licensing proceeding to ground circuit court jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 612-13. Pertinently for present purposes, the court, in the exercise of its discerned jurisdiction, reviewed the underlying rules on which the Commission had based its assessment. <i>Id.</i> at 616.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closer to home, this court has applied <i>Lorion</i> to find jurisdiction when a contrary reading of the applicable statute would, for no apparent reason, have divided judicial review between the district courts and the courts of appeals. <i>See City of Boston v. U.S. HUD,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538480\"><a href=\"/opinion/538480/city-of-boston-v-united-states-department-of-housing-and-urban-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span>, 834-35 (1st Cir.1990). The Third Circuit has gone even further, holding that <i>Lorion</i> creates a presumption of initial circuit court review \"absent clear and convincing evidence of a contrary congressional intent.\" <i>Conoco, Inc. v. Skinner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587602\"><a href=\"/opinion/587602/conoco-inc-ei-du-pont-de-nemours-and-co-in-no-91-3589-v-samuel-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span>, 1214 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the question is close, we conclude that appellate jurisdiction is proper in this case. In reaching this conclusion, we start with the premise that both the Hobbs Act and the Atomic Energy Act are ambiguous as to their reach. Furthermore, while the term \"order\" has a clear meaning for APA purposes, its placement in section 2239 of the Atomic Energy Act suggests that Congress might not have used it with the same precision in connection with the intersection of the Hobbs Act and the Atomic Energy Act. <i>Cf. Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526972\"><a href=\"/opinion/526972/hanover-insurance-company-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1503</span></a></span>, 1504 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the same word may have different meanings in different statutory contexts). That premise is bolstered by the fact that the Atomic Energy Act uses the terms \"order\" and \"rule\" inconsistently. For example, section 2239(b) refers to \"[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a),\" but section 2239(a) includes proceedings \"for the issuance or modification of rules and regulations dealing with the activities of licensees.\" This disharmony renders the meaning of \"order\" in this context uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these amphibolies, we believe that the policies announced by the Supreme Court in <i>Lorion</i> deserve special weight. We interpret <i>Lorion</i> as holding that original jurisdiction in the courts of appeals is proper to review any NRC action that could be cognizable in a petition for review from a proceeding under section 2239. This interpretation is consistent with the <i>Lorion</i> Court's instruction that jurisdictional statutes should be construed so that agency actions will always be subject to initial review in the same court, regardless of the procedural package in which they are wrapped. <i>Lorion,</i> 470 U.S. at 742, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1598</span></a></span>. By like token, an affirmation of jurisdiction in this case is consistent with the <i>Lorion</i> Court's conclusion that judicial efficiency is best served by limiting the layers of review. <i>Id.</i> at 744-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On this basis, and in conformity with our earlier decision in <i>City of Boston,</i> we conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain these petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the merits into three segments, corresponding with the petitioners' most lively bruited points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Ultra Vires.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mainstay of the petitioners' challenge is the proposition that the new rules exceed the Commission's statutory authority. The petitioners start with the premise that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239 requires the NRC to conduct licensing hearings on the record, that is, in strict accordance with the relevant provisions of the APA. <i>See supra</i> note 1. In their view, the new rules fail to satisfy that requirement and, therefore, must be pole-axed. In the pages that follow, we examine both the petitioners' premise and their conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2239 requires the Commission, \"upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected\" by certain agency actions, to hold \"a hearing.\" It does not explicitly require that the hearing be on the record. We have held, however, that the degree of formality that a hearing must afford does not necessarily turn on the presence or absence of an explicit statutory directive. If, even absent such a directive, the nature of the hearing that Congress intended to grant is clear, then that intention governs. <i>Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199369\"><a href=\"/opinion/199369/holmes-v-united-states-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v.

We assume arguendo, favorably to the petitioners, that the <i>Seacoast</i> rule still obtains.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners advance several arguments for holding that Congress, in enacting section 2239, purposed to require on-the-record hearings in reactor licensing cases. In addition to canvassing the legislative history and cataloging the relevant amendments to the statute, they point out that for approximately four decades the NRC and its predecessor agency, the AEC, interpreted the statute as requiring on-the-record hearings in reactor licensing proceedings. In response, the NRC highlights the ambiguity of the statute and attempts to situate the latest round of changes in a larger history of procedural experimentation. The Commission also notes that some courts have interpreted section 2239 to allow informal hearings in licensing proceedings not involving reactors. <i>See, e.g., City of W. Chicago v. U.S. NRC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415261\"><a href=\"/opinion/415261/city-of-west-chicago-illinois-v-united-states-nuclear-regulatory/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, 645 (7th Cir.1983) (licensing of nuclear materials). Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the Commission urges us to defer to its judgment that informal hearings are a suitable prophylactic for reactor licensing. <i>Cf. Lattab v.

Chicago,</i> 701 F.2d at 642-43 (distinguishing reactor licensing from materials licensing and addressing only the latter). We too decline to resolve this issue. Because the new rules adopted by the Commission meet the requirements of the APA it does not matter what type of hearing the NRC is required to conduct in reactor licensing cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before elaborating our reasoning on this point, we must dispense with a procedural theory advocated by the petitioner Public Citizen.

Embracing this principle, Public Citizen asserts that the Commission has waived the argument that the new rules satisfy the APA's requirements because, in promulgating the new rules, it relied exclusively on its view that section 2239 does not mandate on-the-record hearings. Thus, it cannot now rely on a different rationale to defend the rules in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion reads the record through rose-colored glasses. The Commission explicitly memorialized in the statement of considerations for the final rule the view that even if reactor licensing hearings were required to be on the record, the new rules would meet that requirement. 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,192 (\"[T]he Commission believes that ... the hearing procedures in each of these subparts meets [sic] the requirements for an on-the-record hearing under the APA....\"). No more was exigible to preserve the point.

The APA lays out only the most skeletal framework for conducting agency adjudications, leaving broad discretion to the affected agencies in formulating detailed procedural rules. <i>See Am.

In specific terms, the APA requires only that the agency provide a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker and allow each party an opportunity \"to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners urge that the magnitude of the risks involved in reactor licensing proceedings warrant the imposition of a more elaborate set of safeguards. It is beyond cavil, however, that, short of constitutional constraints, a court may not impose procedural requirements in administrative cases above and beyond those mandated by statute (here, the APA). <i>Vt.

Accordingly, we are not at liberty to impress on the Commission (or any other agency, for that matter) a procedural regime not mandated by Congress. The NRC's new rules will, therefore, succumb to the petitioners' first line of attack only if they fail to provide the minimal procedural safeguards actually demanded by the APA. <i>See Nat'l Classif. Comm. v.

The rulemaking at issue here effected several changes in the Commission's procedures. The petitioners focus their challenge on two aspects of the newly minted process. First, they object to the Commission's decision to eliminate discovery. Second, they complain about the Commission's decision to circumscribe the availability of cross-examination. Because these are the only issues on which the petitioners have offered developed argumentation, we confine our analysis to those portions of the new rules. <i>Cf. United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that \"a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the question of whether the new rules fall below the APA's minimum requirements by eliminating discovery. The Commission points out, and the petitioners do not seriously contest, that the APA does not explicitly require the provision of any discovery devices in formal adjudications. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556; <i>see also Kelly v. U.S. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767622\"><a href=\"/opinion/767622/thomas-kelly-and-jonathan-prisk-v-united-states-environmental-protection/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 523 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Frilette v.

Thus, if the APA requires the Commission to provide any discovery to satisfy the standards for formal adjudications, that discovery must be necessary either to effectuate some other procedural right guaranteed by the APA or to ensure an adequate record for judicial review. <i>Cf. U.S. Lines, Inc. v. Fed. Maritime Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359862\"><a href=\"/opinion/359862/united-states-lines-inc-v-federal-maritime-commission-and-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 540 (D.C.Cir.1978) (stating that an agency charged with holding a hearing to determine the public interest must provide adequate means of public participation); <i>Seacoast,</i> 572 F.2d at 876-77 (noting that in some cases procedural requirements may be implied to ensure adequate judicial review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners suggest that discovery is necessary to realize the right of citizen-intervenors to present their case and submit an informed rebuttal. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556. If discovery is unavailable, this thesis runs, citizen-intervenors will be unable to gather the evidence needed to support their contentions and, thus, will be shut out of meaningful participation in licensing hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This thesis is composed of more cry than wool. The petitioners argue as if the new rules have eliminated all access to information from opposing parties &#8212; but that is a gross distortion. The new rules provide meaningful access to information from adverse parties in the form of a system of mandatory disclosure. <i>See</i> 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.336. Although there might well be less information available to citizen-intervenors under the new rules, the difference is one of degree. There is simply no principled way that we can say that the difference occasioned by replacing traditional discovery methods with mandatory disclosure is such that citizen-intervenors are left with no means of adequately presenting their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think that full-dress discovery is essential to ensure a satisfactory record for judicial review. The Commission's final decision in any hearing must survive review based on the evidence adduced in the hearing. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(e). The applicant bears the burden of proof in any licensing hearing, <i>id.</i> &#167; 556(d), and it will have every incentive to proffer sufficient information to allow the agency to reach a reasoned decision. That same quantum of information should be adequate for a reviewing court to determine whether the agency's action is supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be to paint the lily. There is simply no discovery-linked conflict between the new rules and the APA's on-the-record adjudication requirement. The petitioners' first line of argument is, therefore, a dead end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to cross-examination, the petitioners' contentions fare no better: the new rules meet the APA's requirements. To explain this conclusion, we first must strip away the rhetorical flourishes in which the petitioners shroud their reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to understand that, contrary to the petitioners' importunings, the new rules do not extirpate cross-examination. Rather, they restrict its use to situations in which it is \"necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision.\" 10 C.F.R. &#167; 2.1204. The legitimacy of this restriction must be weighed in light of the fact that the APA does not provide an absolute right of cross-examination in on-the-record hearings. <i>Seacoast,</i> 572 F.2d at 880. The APA affords a right only to such cross-examination as may be necessary for a full and fair adjudication of the facts. <i>Id.</i> Equally to the point, \"[t]he party seeking to cross-examine bears the burden of showing that cross-examination is in fact necessary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 880 n. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission represents that, despite the difference in language, it interprets the standard for allowing cross-examination under the new rules to be equivalent to the APA standard. 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,195-96. When an agency provides a plausible interpretation of its own procedural rules and there is no record or pattern of contrary conduct a court has no right either to slough off that interpretation or to deem it disingenuous. <i>Cf. Albathani v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, 378-79 (1st Cir.2003) (accepting the agency's good faith in carrying out its procedures, while acknowledging that evidence to the contrary might warrant judicial intervention). Given the Commission's stated interpretation, the new rules on cross-examination cannot be termed inconsistent with the dictates of the APA. Nor do we see how cross-examination that is not \"necessary to ensure an adequate record for decision\" could be necessary to ensure appropriate judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that the new rules meet the APA requirements for on-the-record adjudications, we hold that their promulgation does not exceed the Commission's authority. Consequently, the petitioners' ultra vires argument founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Arbitrary and Capricious.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our labors are not yet done. Even though we hold that the new rules are within the ambit of the NRC's authority, we still must consider whether its decision to discard the old in favor of the new was arbitrary and capricious. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agency's rules, once adopted, are not frozen in place. The opposite is true: an agency may alter its rules in light of its accumulated experience in administering them. <i>Rust v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span>, 186-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span> (1991). An agency must, however, offer a reasoned explanation for the change. If the agency fails to furnish such an explanation, or if the proffered explanation fails to demonstrate that the agency fully considered its new course, the revised rules must be set aside. <i>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

They do not suggest that the Commission's goal of improving hearing efficiency is impermissible; rather, they maintain that the current procedures worked well enough and that the Commission has made no showing that they were the source of any past inefficiencies. The petitioners further note evidence in the rulemaking record suggesting that efficiency gains could be brought about through less drastic measures, such as more aggressive case management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve this point, we first must determine what an agency must show to justify modifying its procedural rules. As a general principle, agencies have broad authority to formulate their own procedures &#8212; and the NRC's authority in this respect has been termed particularly great. <i>Union of Concerned Scientists,</i> 920 F.2d at 54; <i>BPI v. Atomic Energy Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321244\"><a href=\"/opinion/321244/bpi-and-james-t-nodland-v-the-atomic-energy-commission-and-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 428 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1974). A necessary corollary of this authority is the freedom to experiment with different procedural formats. Consequently, tinkering with rules is by no means a forbidden activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there are limits on this prerogative. An agency may not act precipitously or in an irrational manner in revising its rules. But so long as these limits are observed, it is not the place of a reviewing court to second-guess the agency's decision as to <i>when</i> to make procedural changes. It is enough that the agency reasonably determines that existing processes are unsatisfactory and takes steps that are fairly targeted at improving the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the NRC has determined that its existing rules of practice lead to hearings that are cumbersome, unnecessarily protracted, and wasteful of the resources of the parties and the Commission. This determination warrants a high degree of deference. <i>See Vt. Yankee,</i> 435 U.S. at 543-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109827\"><a href=\"/opinion/109827/vermont-yankee-nuclear-power-corp-v-natural-resources-defense-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span> (holding that agencies' evaluations of their procedural needs are entitled to great respect). Although the petitioners may disagree, we descry nothing in the record that would support setting aside the rule on the basis that the agency should have left well enough alone. It would unfairly handcuff administrators if agencies could not change their procedures simply because certain of their constituencies admired the status quo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That leaves the <i>how</i> of the Commission's new rules; that is, the question whether the Commission acted arbitrarily in making a specific set of changes in order to achieve its goal of improved hearing efficiency. To clear this hurdle, the Commission must show both that its new rules constitute a rational means for achieving its stated objective and that it sensibly rejected other options considered in the rulemaking proceeding (including the option of maintaining the status quo). <i>See State Farm,</i> 463 U.S. at 43-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110991\"><a href=\"/opinion/110991/motor-vehicle-mfrs-assn-of-united-states-inc-v-state-farm-mut/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2856</span></a></span>. This calculus must fairly account for any benefits lost by modifying existing rules, as well as any advantages expected to be gained through the adoption of updated rules. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, too, we address only the NRC's decisions to replace traditional discovery with mandatory disclosure and to restrict the availability of conventional cross-examination. With regard to discovery, the NRC explained in its statement of considerations for the final rule that the proposed substitute \"has the potential to significantly reduce delays and resources expended by all parties in discovery.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,194. The Commission also expressed the view that replacing traditional discovery with mandatory disclosure would eliminate a substantial amount of motion practice related to discovery matters. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the Commission determined that any prejudice to citizen-intervenors from eliminating traditional discovery would be offset by the mandatory disclosure requirements and the general public availability of NRC documents. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners renew their exhortation that discovery is necessary for citizen-intervenors to participate effectively in reactor licensing hearings. They speculate that without discovery they will be without access to large amounts of detailed technical information (information that is available to the applicant and the Commission staff) and, thus, will be unable to respond adequately to technical and factual arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the petitioners that the Commission's explanation for the change in discovery practice is thin. The Commission baldly states its belief that eliminating traditional discovery will shorten hearings and conserve resources, but it provides no empirical analysis of its experience with traditional discovery from which an outside observer can determine what benefits the Commission might reasonably expect. In a substantive rule, this omission might be fatal. <i>See, e.g., Portland Cement Ass'n v. Ruckelshaus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"314135\"><a href=\"/opinion/314135/portland-cement-association-v-ruckelshaus/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 393 (D.C.Cir.1973) (\"It is not consonant with the purpose of a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate rules on the basis of inadequate data, or on data that, [in] critical degree, is known only to the agency.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the realm of procedure, however, agencies are presumed to have special competence and, accordingly, are held to less exacting standards of explication. <i>See Union of Concerned Scientists,</i> 920 F.2d at 54 (noting that procedural determinations \"fall uniquely within the expertise of the agency\"). To add to this leeway, we are not willing to ignore matters that are common knowledge to courts of law. Discovery, especially in complex matters, is both time-consuming and costly. We do not think it can reasonably be questioned that the replacement of discovery with mandatory disclosure will make reactor licensing hearings faster and less expensive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission also has explained that it believes any harm to citizen-intervenors will be minimal. Although the petitioners offer some hypothetical examples of information that may be unavailable under the new rules, they have not made a persuasive case that mandatory disclosure will undercompensate for the loss of traditional discovery. We thus find no basis for setting aside the new rules on discovery-related grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new rules' outlook on cross-examination presents a closer question. The Commission reasons that restricting cross-examination will reduce the amount of testimony taken and make hearings more efficient. 69 Fed.Reg. at 2,196. The Commission further observes that, in its experience, cross-examination is not always helpful to the resolution of scientific or technical issues. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners retort that cross-examination is a vital component of a citizen-intervenor's case. They note that citizen-intervenors often lack the resources to present their own expert testimony and must rely on cross- questioning of the adverse party's experts to make their case. They also stress the value of cross-examination as a means for bolstering public confidence in licensing hearings. Tellingly, the Commission's own administrative judges agree that cross-examination is helpful for the resolution of issues raised in many licensing hearings. In addition to the reasons advanced by the petitioners, the administrative judges note that the prospect of cross-examination discourages exaggeration in direct testimony because witnesses are aware that they will have to defend their statements later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Experience in the courts has left no doubt that cross-examination can be a useful tool. Had the new rules abolished cross-examination entirely, we might well find the Commission's action insupportable. Importantly, however, the new rules do not completely do away with cross-examination. Rather, they leave its availability to the discretion of the hearing officer. Just as we will not ignore the fact that discovery is resource-consuming, we will not presume that all &#8212; or, perhaps, even most &#8212; cross-examination is essential to the just resolution of issues. With this in mind, we find no fault with the Commission's decision to attempt to curtail unnecessary cross-examination. <i>Cf.</i> 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(d) (\"[T]he agency as a matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.\"). Accordingly, we cannot say that it is arbitrary and capricious for the Commission to leave the determination of whether cross-examination will further the truth-seeking process in a particular proceeding to the discretion of the individual hearing officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do, however, add a caveat. The APA does require that cross-examination be available when \"required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" <i>Id.</i> If the new procedures are to comply in practice with the APA, cross-examination must be allowed in appropriate instances. Should the agency's administration of the new rules contradict its present representations or otherwise flout this principle, nothing in this opinion will inoculate the rules against future challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Constitutional Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One petitioner, Citizens Awareness Network (CAN), charges that the new rules are unconstitutional because they deprive citizen-intervenors of fundamental political rights and discriminate against them in violation of the Fifth Amendment. We explore these charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAN's first charge implodes because there is no fundamental right to participate in administrative adjudications.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Procedural flexibility is one of the great hallmarks of the administrative process-and it is a feature that courts must be reluctant to curtail. Though the Commission's new rules may approach the outer bounds of what is permissible under the APA, we find the statute sufficiently broad to accommodate them. Similarly, the Commission's judgments as to when its procedures need fine-tuning and how they should be retooled are ones to which we accord great respect. We cannot say that the Commission's desire for more expeditious adjudications is unreasonable, nor can we say that the changes embodied in the new rules are an eccentric or a plainly inadequate means for achieving the Commission's goals. Accordingly, both of the instant petitions must be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petitions for judicial review are denied and dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In the pages that follow, we use the modifiers \"on the record\" and \"formal\" interchangeably to refer to adjudications conducted in accordance with sections 554, 556, and 557 of the APA</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Subpart G was amended by the new rules, but the changes to it are not pertinent here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We say \"for the most part\" because there are exceptions.

In NRC hearings, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 explicitly authorizes the Commission to empanel safety and licensing boards consisting of one person \"qualified in the conduct of administrative proceedings\" and two persons with \"such technical or other qualifications as the Commission deems appropriate\" to preside at hearings under section 2239</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I concur fully in Judge Selya's thoughtful and comprehensive opinion, I write separately to describe some oddities about this case which should not go unnoticed. The basic proposition of Judge Selya's decision is indisputably correct: the new rules promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to reduce the level of formality in reactor licensing proceedings comply with the \"on-the-record\" requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Yet that legal proposition was largely an afterthought of the NRC in the effort to justify its new rules. Instead, the NRC principally argued in the long run-up to this case that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239, which simply requires the Commission to hold a hearing \"upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected\" before granting a new license, did not invoke the requirements for formal adjudication (commonly referred to as \"on-the-record\" hearings) under the APA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is striking that so many smart people at the NRC could be so wrong for so long about the requirements of the APA. Although this history does not affect the outcome of this case, it should be noted as a cautionary tale about the power of analogy and the endurance of unexamined legal theories. This history also serves to explain some of the legitimate frustrations of the petitioners, who felt that they were dealing with a moving target as the NRC tried to justify its new regulations. With so much at stake in these nuclear reactor licensing proceedings, the rulemaking process should have followed a steadier course. For reasons I shall explain, this was not the rulemaking process at its best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Terminology</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The terminology for hearings under the APA can be imprecise and confusing. The everyday meaning of terms like \"formal\" and \"informal\" sometimes creeps into the discussion, although those terms have specific, functional definitions under the APA. As Judge Selya notes, the terms \"formal\" and \"on-the-record\" are generally used as shorthand for hearings that must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 554, 556, and 557 of the APA. Other terms, too, are sometimes used to refer to such procedures &#8212; \"trial-type\" and \"quasi-judicial.\" These vague and indefinite terms are particularly mischievous because they evoke images of courtroom trials, and they have contributed to the false impression that the APA's requirement of on-the-record hearings involves procedures more akin to civil trials than is actually the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be specific, &#167; 554 requires that, in cases of an \"adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,\" the agency must follow the procedures outlined in &#167;&#167; 556 and 557. Although the statutory text at issue here is itself rather pithy, these procedures can be usefully condensed into the following ten points:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 8.1 (4th ed.2002). Strikingly, there is no reference to discovery in these statutory provisions of the APA, and cross-examination is assured only if necessary \"for a full and true disclosure of the facts.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(d). Most of these provisions relate to the conduct and responsibilities of the presiding officer or the basis for agency orders (on the record). Only a few relate to the conduct of the hearing itself. These APA requirements leave agencies with a great deal of flexibility in tailoring on-the-record hearing procedures to suit their perceived needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If hearings are not required to be \"on the record,\" the procedures of &#167;&#167; 556 and 557 are not triggered; the only section of the APA applicable to the proceedings is &#167; 555, titled \"Ancillary matters.\" Section 555(b) entitles a party to be represented by a lawyer, &#167; 555(c) entitles people who have submitted data or evidence to retain copies of their submissions, and &#167; 555(e) requires agencies to give prompt notice when they deny a petition made in connection with a proceeding, and to give a brief statement of the grounds for denial. Additionally, subsections (c) and (d) require that process, subpoenas, and other investigative demands must be made in accordance with law. Of course, these \"informal\" hearings must also comply with basic due process requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the beginning of its proposed rulemaking, the NRC repeatedly referred to the procedures outlined in the new regulations as \"informal,\" as opposed to the outmoded formal procedures of the past. The clear implication was that the new informal procedures would not meet the APA's requirements for formal, on-the-record hearings. Thus, the NRC believed that it first had to establish that its authorizing statute, the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), did not require it to hold on-the-record hearings for reactor licensing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background to Rulemaking</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Selya outlines some of the important history of the rulemaking in this case. However, there is more to this curious history that is worth telling. From the 1998 Policy Statement to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the NRC barely contemplated the possibility that it could reform its hearing procedures to its liking and still comply with the APA after all. Indeed, at first, the NRC did not propose any dramatic changes to its hearing procedures. In its August 5, 1998 Policy Statement, the NRC stated that it hoped to encourage a renewed vigor in the enforcement of already-existing hearing procedures by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Boards (ASLBs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To expedite hearings, the NRC advocated greater adherence to schedules, more rigorous enforcement of time limits for filing (for example, allowing extensions of time only in \"unavoidable and extreme circumstances\"), more rigorous enforcement of contention requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and tighter management of discovery. It also announced that the NRC \"may consider further changes to the Rules of Practice as appropriate to enable additional improvements to the adjudicatory process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True to its word, the NRC issued a Staff Requirements Memorandum to its Office of General Counsel (OGC) on July 22, 1999, directing it to develop a proposed rulemaking. At the same time, the Commission noted that it would also pursue a legislative solution by lobbying Congress to confirm its authority to reform licensing hearings as it wished. Again, the Staff Requirements Memorandum never suggested that the NRC could reduce the formality of its hearing procedures while staying within the strictures of the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. Instead, the NRC apparently still believed that the more informal licensing procedures it sought would not comply with the APA, and that it had to establish its freedom from the APA's strictest requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Staff Requirements Memorandum also directed the NRC's OGC to solicit the views of interested parties on the proposed rulemaking. Consequently, the general counsel held a two-day meeting in October 1999, called a \"hearing process workshop,\" with representatives from the nuclear industry, citizens' groups (including the petitioners in this case), other federal agencies, academia, and the NRC's Atomic Safety Board and Licensing Panel. Although the OGC encouraged a wide-ranging conversation, no one raised the possibility that the NRC licensing procedures could be more informal yet still comply with the APA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking itself, 66 Fed.Reg. 19,610 (April 16, 2001), which for the first time proposed specific changes to the NRC's hearing procedures, there was still no argument that the proposed procedures complied with the APA's requirements. Instead, the notice offered pages of legal analysis on the history of the AEA, all intended to justify the NRC's ability to promulgate new hearing procedures that are not subject to the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other choices made by the NRC in its regulatory overhaul further emphasize the firmness of its conviction that the supposedly \"informal\" procedures it was proposing did not comply with the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. In the one instance where no one disputes that the NRC must hold on-the-record hearings &#8212; the licensing of construction and operation of uranium enrichment facilities, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2243(b) &#8212; the Notice described this process as \"requiring formal trial-type hearing procedures to be used.\" 66 Fed.Reg. at 19,623. Consequently, the NRC believed that it could not use new subpart L for these hearings but had to resort to the more formal procedures of subpart G.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strikingly, in the entire record of this rulemaking prior to the promulgation of the Final Rule, I can find only one footnote hinting that anyone at the NRC thought that it could reduce the formality of its procedures while at the same time complying with the strictures of the APA. In a footnote in its January 1999 memo, the OGC acknowledged the possibility of eliminating the \"elements of Subpart G that go beyond the Administrative Procedure Act's requirements for `on-the-record' hearings. One immediate effect would be to eliminate formal discovery in NRC adjudications.\" The memo contains no further discussion of how far beyond the APA's requirements the OGC understood Subpart G to go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not until publication of the Final Rule itself did the NRC assert for the first time that the new procedures comply with the APA's requirements for an on-the-record hearing-and even here, the NRC devotes only a few sentences to the issues of cross-examination, discovery, and the presiding officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Indeed, the NRC's few statements are easily reproduced in their entirety. In response to concerns about the reforms to cross-examination, the NRC stated: \"The Commission believes that this approach strikes an appropriate balance in the use of cross-examination, and is consistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which does not require cross-examination for on-the-record proceedings unless necessary for a `fair and true disclosure of the facts.'\" 69 Fed.Reg. 2182, 2188 (Jan. 14, 2004). A little later, the NRC states: \"The Commission's consideration of cross-examination in the hearing process begins with the observation that parties have no fundamental right to cross-examination, even in the most formal hearing procedures provided in Subpart G.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 2195-96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for concerns about the availability of discovery, the NRC stated: \"Thus, the mandatory disclosure requirement in subpart C, the hearing file provision in subparts G, L, and N[,] and the requirement for an LSN and `electronic docket' in subpart J, go well beyond the `discovery' provisions for full, on-the-record adjudicatory hearings under the APA.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> 69 Fed.Reg. at 2189. As for presiding officers, the NRC described how the new regulations provided for either an ALJ or a three-member ASLB to preside over the hearing, and then stated: \"The Commission has taken this step to ensure that all of these proceedings meet the requirements with regard to a presiding officer for an on-the-record hearing under the APA.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 2191. However, despite these few references in the Final Rule to meeting the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings, the NRC's primary rationale for its new procedures remained its long-standing position that reactor licensing hearings did not have to comply with the on-the-record requirements of the APA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considerable part, administrative agencies set the terms of the debate in the rulemaking process with the arguments they advance in support of their rulemaking initiatives. If certain arguments are unmistakably primary, those arguments will draw most of the attention during the administrative process, and during the judicial review that follows. Not surprisingly, opponents will believe that the primacy of the argument means that it is the most important argument to address. If, in the end, the dispositive issue on appeal is a different issue, addressed only glancingly in the administrative process, there has been enormous wasted effort, and the courts of appeal will be poorly served by appellate briefing that reflects the outdated emphases of the administrative process. That is precisely what happened here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their petition for review, petitioners never even mentioned the argument of the NRC that its new procedures complied with the APA's requirements for on-the-record hearings. Not one of the petitioners addressed the argument in their opening briefs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Indeed, the NRC tried to exploit this omission by arguing that petitioners had thereby waived the issue. In response, Public Citizen stated that the NRC argued from the beginning of the rulemaking that its freedom from the APA's on-the-record requirements was essential to its ability to fashion informal procedures, and \"[t]here would have been no need for page after page of argument that Section 189 does not require on-the-record hearing procedures in reactor licensing cases if the NRC had believed that the new Subpart L procedures conformed to these requirements.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Public Citizen added that the few references to APA- compliance in the Final Rule were nothing more than \"stray remarks\" when weighed against the overwhelming number of statements to the contrary made by the NRC throughout the rulemaking. Public Citizen then tried to turn this lament into a legal argument based upon <i>SEC v.

The Court explained that this rule did not disturb the settled rule that appellate courts can affirm trial court decisions that are right for the wrong reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In confining our review to a judgment upon the validity of the grounds upon which the Commission itself based its action, we do not disturb the settled rule that, in reviewing the decision of a lower court, it must be affirmed if the result is correct although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason. The reason for this rule is obvious. It would be wasteful to send a case back to a lower court to reinstate a decision which it had already made but which the appellate court concluded should properly be based on another ground within the power of the appellate court to formulate. But it is also familiar appellate procedure that where the correctness of the lower court's decision depends upon a determination of fact which only a jury could make but which has not been made, the appellate court cannot take the place of the jury. Like considerations govern review of administrative orders. If an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment. For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>SEC v.

Technical evidence may be introduced in written form as long as its admission \"would not prejudicially deprive other parties or the agency of opportunity for cross-examination.

On this point, the Manual quotes from the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary on the APA. The Report cautions that the APA's provision for \"such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts\" does not</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">confer a right of so-called `unlimited' cross-examination. Presiding officers will have to make the necessary initial determination whether the cross-examination is pressed to unreasonable lengths by a party or whether it is required for the `full and true disclosure of the facts' stated in the provision. Nor is it the intention to eliminate the authority of agencies to confer sound discretion upon presiding officers in the matter of its extent. The test is &#8212; as the section states &#8212; whether it is required `for a full and true disclosure of the facts.' In many rule making proceedings where the subject matter and evidence are broadly economic or statistical in character and the parties or witnesses numerous, the direct or rebuttal evidence may be of such a nature that cross-examination adds nothing substantial to the record and unnecessarily prolongs the hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep.

Despite the frequent use of terms like \"trial-type\" and \"quasi-judicial\" over the years to refer to on-the-record hearings, agencies have always been able to adapt their procedures for on-the-record hearings under the APA. Today, this statute of general applicability governs the procedures for an enormous variety of hearings &#8212; everything from relatively simple claims for workers' compensation, to enforcement proceedings under the National Labor Relations Act or the Occupational Health and Safety Act, to complex rate-setting hearings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. <i>See</i> Manual for Administrative Law Judges (ALJ Manual), 49-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This historical flexibility is confirmed by a modern-day guide to the conduct of on-the-record hearings, the Manual for Administrative Law Judges, which provides a thorough overview of the current state of on-the-record procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Although the Manual is primarily designed as a practical aid for ALJs, it also offers an analysis of the fundamental requirements of the APA, including a section on the special problems presented by complex hearings at both the agency and ALJ levels. <i>See</i> ALJ Manual at 49-70. Ultimately, if the ALJ Manual tells us anything about what a typical on-the-record hearing looks like, it is that there is no typical hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its section on complex hearings, the ALJ Manual begins by noting that the term \"quasi-judicial\" is most often used to refer to \"relatively simple cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50. \"Typically, these quasi-judicial proceedings are nearly identical to a formal adjudication without a jury,\" with the full panoply of pleadings, pre-hearing discovery, and witnesses who testify orally on direct and cross-examination. <i>Id.</i> at 49. Complex cases, however, are \"another matter,\" bearing less resemblance to our traditional concept of a civil trial. <i>Id.</i> at 51. The ALJ Manual cites the NRC's use of ASLBs as an \"innovative approach to complex cases\" with highly technical subject matter. <i>Id.</i> at 52. In general, the ALJ Manual emphasizes the use of written submissions of direct and rebuttal evidence: \"Typically, much of the testimony is highly technical and lengthy, and is submitted in written form prior to the hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 51. \"Preparation and exchange of direct and rebuttal evidence is usually beneficial in complex cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the Attorney General's Manual, the ALJ Manual emphasizes the basic importance of the opportunity to cross-examine in on-the-record hearings, noting that \"judges should be extremely cautious about denying parties an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55 n. 149. In the end, however, and again like the Attorney General's Manual, the ALJ Manual also acknowledges the agencies' need to adapt hearing procedures to suit especially complex cases, observing that \"[u]nless witness credibility is involved, cross-examination is frequently confined to clarifying the exhibits, determining the source of the material, and testing the basis for the witness's conclusions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83. In fact, the ALJ Manual even notes a proposal by one legal commentator that \"the major rebuttal of expert opinion testimony should take place not by cross-examination but by submission, prior to the hearing, of rebuttal testimony prepared by the opponent's experts.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These sources, both contemporaneous with the APA's passage and modern, show that procedures in on-the-record hearings, despite sometimes being described as \"trial-type\" procedures, can in fact stray considerably from the procedures found in civil trials as the subjects of the administrative proceedings become more complex and more technical. This flexibility is inherent in the APA, and has been acknowledged by commentators and by courts. <i>See Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v.

Belatedly, and then only sketchily, the NRC advanced the alternative argument that its proposed procedures complied with those on-the-record requirements. The staying power of old theories and flawed analogies (the repeated references to trial-type proceedings) may account for some of this delay. Whatever the reasons, the deleterious effect of this late insight on the rulemaking process and our review of it is undeniable. Countless hours were wasted during the administrative process fighting over the tired issue of whether 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2239 requires reactor licensing hearings to be on the record. This tired issue dogged judicial review as well. Although we have done what <i>Chenery</i> requires &#8212; affirming on a basis advanced by the agency itself during the administrative process &#8212; we got there with too little help from the parties. There is a victory here for the NRC, but it should be a cause for self-examination rather than jubilation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> On-the-record hearings at most agencies must be presided over by the agency, one of the members of the body that comprises the agency, or an administrative law judge (ALJ). 5 U.S.C. &#167; 556(b).

Rather than deciding whether the SEC's decision could be sustained on a second basis &#8212; that of the special authority given by Congress to the SEC to administer the securities laws &#8212; the Court remanded the case to the agency for further proceedings.

The current edition of the Manual is not an official government publication. Previous editions of this Manual, however, had been published by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), a government body. Prof. Morell E. Mullins of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law was the principal editor and revisor of the third edition in 1990. After Congress eliminated funding for the ACUS in the 1990s, Prof. Mullins took it upon himself in 2001 to reproduce the Manual on the web in somewhat updated form. Recently, this 2001 \"interim Internet edition,\" as he called it, was published in substantially unchanged form in the journal of the National Association of Administrative Law Judges, a nonprofit professional organization.
