At issue in this case of\n\nfirst impression is whether the Bankruptcy Code's protection of\n\nmortgage lenders against modification of claims secured by a\n\nprincipal residence applies when the residence in fact lies mostly\n\non a lot abutting the mortgaged property.             This case arises out of\n\na bizarre set of facts.      The debtor in this case and his then-wife\n\nmistakenly built a house on the property line between two lots\n\nowned by the debtor's ex-wife, a fact which was not discovered\n\nuntil after a mortgage on the lot believed to include the house had\n\nalready been granted.       Compounding this problem is the fact that\n\neveryone -- the debtor, the bank, and the bankruptcy court -- was\n\nmistaken   as   to   who   owned   what    property    when.    Despite   this\n\nconfusion, the bankruptcy court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\n\nthoroughly addressed the dispositive issues, and we affirm.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           The issues here center around two contiguous pieces of\n\nproperty: 26 Jasper St. (the \"Jasper Lot\")1 and 31 Enfield Ave.\n\n(the \"Enfield Lot\") in Methuen, Massachusetts. Vito Anthony LaFata\n\n(the \"Debtor\") resides in a house that straddles the property line\n\nbetween the Jasper Lot and the Enfield Lot, with the majority of\n\nthe house on the Enfield Lot, but with a street address of 26\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      It appears from the record that the Jasper Lot is actually\ntwo separate parcels, one of which is a five-foot-wide strip. For\nsimplicity, we will refer to them collectively as the \"Jasper Lot.\"\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJasper St.2       Both properties were originally owned by a realty\n\ntrust controlled by Gail Ness,3 formerly the wife of the Debtor.\n\nAs part of an earlier divorce settlement, Ness deeded the Jasper\n\nLot to the Debtor.      Importantly, both Ness and the Debtor had the\n\nmistaken belief at the time of the deed that the house lay entirely\n\non the Jasper Lot.        This erroneous belief was the first of two\n\nmistakes that resulted in this case being before us today.\n\n               In July 2003, still with the mistaken belief that his\n\nhouse was entirely on the Jasper Lot, the Debtor mortgaged the\n\nproperty to Eastern Savings Bank, FSB (\"Eastern\"), the appellant\n\nhere.       Eastern's title work did not disclose that the majority of\n\nthe Debtor's residence actually lay on the Enfield Lot.4            In\n\nconnection with the mortgage, the Debtor executed a note for\n\n$165,000, secured solely by the Jasper Lot.        It appears that he\n\nnever made any of the payments due on the note.\n\n               Following the grant of the mortgage to Eastern, Ness\n\nagreed to transfer the Enfield Lot to the Debtor in exchange for\n\nmoney owed to Ness by the Debtor under their original divorce\n\n\n     2\n      The Enfield Lot also contains other structures, which are not\nrelevant to the issues here.\n     3\n      Gail Ness is also referred to in the record as Gail LaFata\nand Gail Raulinaitis.     We will refer to her as \"Ness\" for\nsimplicity.\n        4\n      It is unclear what the source of the mistake was. There is\nsome indication in the record that an erroneous plot plan existed,\na fact which may have been discovered when the Debtor applied for\nwork permits from the city.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsettlement, apparently unaware of the title issue.                  Pursuant to\n\nthis       agreement,   Ness   executed   a    deed,   dated    June   4,   2004,\n\npurporting to transfer the Enfield Lot to the Debtor.                    However,\n\nbecause the payments were never made, the deed was never actually\n\ndelivered to the Debtor for recording purposes.                  Instead it was\n\nheld in escrow by Ness's attorney pending the payment of the\n\nadditional funds owed by the Debtor to Ness.                   According to the\n\nrecord, because of nonpayment of the agreed-upon amount, Ness\n\nremains the owner of the Enfield Lot today.                Hence the second\n\nmistake:       the   Debtor    seemed     to   misunderstand      this      escrow\n\narrangement, and during his bankruptcy proceedings operated with\n\nthe mistaken belief that he was the fee simple owner of the Enfield\n\nLot.\n\n               On August 5, 2004, the Debtor filed for Chapter 13\n\nbankruptcy protection, claiming as assets both the Jasper Lot and\n\nthe Enfield Lot.         At some point not clear from the record the\n\nDebtor had become aware that his residence was not entirely on the\n\nJasper Lot, but was instead mostly on the Enfield Lot.5                       This\n\nencroachment made the Jasper Lot noncompliant with zoning, which\n\nessentially destroyed its value.          An appraisal commissioned by the\n\nDebtor noted that, if compliant, the land would probably be worth\n\naround $100,000, but in its current state the property was worth\n\n\n       5\n      According to the record, Eastern also became aware of this\nfact as early as March 2004, when it first filed a claim with its\ntitle insurance company.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fonly \"what the neighbor will pay for it\" -- a value the appraiser\n\nestimated at $18,500.\n\n            Eastern filed a proof of claim for the full value of its\n\nmortgage,   which   it    placed    at    $195,340,    including   delinquent\n\ninterest and collection fees. On August 18, 2004, the Debtor filed\n\nan objection to this proof of claim, as well as a motion for\n\ndetermination of secured status under 11 U.S.C. ยง 506 and a\n\nproposed Chapter 13 plan.\n\n            As part of his proposed Chapter 13 plan, the Debtor\n\nsought to bifurcate Eastern Bank's claim into secured and unsecured\n\nportions,   with    the   secured    portion     worth   only   $18,500,   the\n\nappraised value of the collateral.            That left, according to the\n\nDebtor, $131,500 in unsecured debt,6 for which the Debtor proposed\n\nto pay 10 cents on the dollar.           Eastern thus stood to receive only\n\n$31,650 on a claim that may have been worth as much as $195,340.\n\nEastern understandably objected to this.              On August 27, 2004, it\n\nfiled a response to the objection to the proof of claim, an\n\nobjection to the motion for determination of secured status, and an\n\nobjection to confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan.\n\n            Further complicating matters, the City of Methuen also\n\nfiled an objection to the Debtor's motion for determination of\n\nsecured status on or around August 20, in which it stated that,\n\n\n     6\n      This would place the total value of Eastern's claim at\n$150,000. It's not clear from the record how the Debtor arrived at\nthis figure, given that the face value of the note was $165,000.\n\n                                     -6-\n\faccording to the registry of deeds, the Enfield Lot was actually\n\nowned by Ness.         The Debtor responded on August 27 by providing the\n\ncourt with a copy of the July 4, 2004, deed of the Enfield Lot from\n\nNess       to   the   Debtor   --   the   same   deed   that   was   subsequently\n\ndiscovered to be still in escrow. The bankruptcy court and Eastern\n\nappeared to believe the Debtor's assurances that he owned the\n\nproperty and did not pursue the issue of ownership further.7\n\n                The three objections raised by Eastern each depend on\n\nwhether 11 U.S.C. ยง 1322(b)(2) would allow Eastern's claim to be\n\nbifurcated as proposed by the Debtor.              The bankruptcy court ruled\n\nin favor of the Debtor on December 8, 2004, and allowed the\n\nbifurcation of the claim into a secured claim of $18,500 and an\n\nunsecured claim for the balance of the note.               Eastern appealed to\n\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court on July 7, 2005, without opinion.\n\nEastern appeals from the district court's decision, and that appeal\n\nis the first of the two appeals before us today.\n\n                Following the bankruptcy court orders, Eastern began an\n\nadversarial action against the Debtor in bankruptcy court on\n\nJanuary 19, 2005, seeking to reform the mortgage so as to include\n\nat least that portion of the Enfield Lot that included the Debtor's\n\n\n       7\n      Eastern justifies its reliance on what it knew to be an\nunrecorded deed by pointing out that, even if the deed was not\nrecorded, it would still be valid as against the Debtor and Ness.\nOf course, this assumes that the deed was at least validly\ndelivered, which it was not.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fresidence.    During depositions for that proceeding, Ness and the\n\nDebtor both testified that the Enfield Lot was actually still owned\n\nby Ness.     At that point Eastern moved for relief from judgment\n\nunder Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.8      Eastern\n\nasked that the bankruptcy court vacate the three orders it had\n\nearlier decided in favor of the Debtor, citing newly discovered\n\nevidence and fraud on the court.\n\n            The bankruptcy court held a show cause hearing on October\n\n7, 2005, to confirm whether the deed was in fact in escrow and\n\nwhether it could be delivered to the Debtor.       The court concluded\n\nthat it could not be delivered.         On October 21, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt denied the Rule 60(b) motion, saying only that Eastern\n\n\"failed to meet its burden.\"\n\n            Eastern appealed the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion to\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") for the First Circuit, which\n\naffirmed.    Eastern appealed to us, and that appeal makes up the\n\nsecond of the two appeals before us.\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\nA. The Bankruptcy Court's Orders\n\n            On appeal from a district court's review of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt decision, we review the bankruptcy court's legal conclusions\n\nde novo and its factual conclusions for clear error.          Brandt v.\n\n\n\n     8\n      Bankruptcy    Rule   9024   makes   Rule   60(b)   applicable   in\nbankruptcy.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fRepco Printers & Lithographics, Inc. (In re Healthco Int'l Inc.),\n\n132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n               Eastern's       appeal      from    the    bankruptcy       court's        orders\n\nraises       three     issues:      whether       the    bankruptcy      court          correctly\n\ninterpreted        ยง      1322(b)(2)      of   the      Bankruptcy      Code       as   allowing\n\nbifurcation          here;    whether       Eastern       was    allowed       a    reasonable\n\nopportunity          to    object    to     the    valuation       of    the       Jasper       Lot\n\ncollateral; and whether the bankruptcy court correctly applied the\n\nburden of proof.9\n\n               1. Section 1322(b)(2)\n\n               Section 1322(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code states that a\n\nChapter 13 plan may:\n\n               modify the rights of holders of secured\n               claims, other than a claim secured only by a\n               security interest in real property that is the\n               debtor's principal residence, or of holders of\n               unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the\n               rights of holders of any class of claims.\n\n11 U.S.C. ยง 1322(b)(2).                Prior to Nobelman v. American Savings\n\nBank, 508 U.S. 324 (1993), there was some disagreement among the\n\ncircuits as to whether ยง 1322(b)(2) allowed for bifurcation of\n\nundersecured homestead mortgages, such as the one at issue here.\n\nSee,       e.g.,   Bellamy     v.    Fed.      Home     Loan    Mortgage       Corp.      (In    re\n\n\n       9\n      Eastern also raises a fourth issue: whether the bankruptcy\ncourt properly relied on Eastern's failure to attempt to reform the\nmortgage when it allowed the bifurcation. That rationale is only\nrelevant in the case where the Debtor owns the Enfield Lot -- which\nhe does not. Therefore, we do not consider the issue, nor do we\nplace any weight on it in our analysis of the bifurcation issue.\n\n                                               -9-\n\fBellamy),     962   F.2d   176,   179   (2d    Cir.    1992)   (holding   that   ยง\n\n1322(b)(2) only prohibits modification of the secured claim, but\n\nthat the existence and size of the secured claim must be determined\n\naccording to ยง 506(a)).       In Nobelman, the Supreme Court held that\n\nยง 1322(b)(2) barred modification of the entire claim -- secured and\n\nunsecured portions -- if the claim is secured by the debtor's\n\nprincipal residence.10      508 U.S. at 332.          Therefore, in the instant\n\ncase, if Eastern's claim is secured by the Debtor's principal\n\nresidence, then the claim cannot be modified by bifurcating it into\n\nsecured and unsecured claims, even though the value of the security\n\nis roughly one-tenth the value of the claim.\n\n             Despite mistakenly believing that the Debtor owned the\n\nEnfield Lot, the bankruptcy court did still rule on this question\n\nunder the correct set of facts. Ironically, this confusing case is\n\nhelped somewhat by confusion on a related issue: should a court\n\nmake the determination of what is the debtor's \"primary residence\"\n\n\n\n     10\n          Justice Stevens explained the policy behind ยง 1322(b)(2):\n\n             At first blush it seems somewhat strange that\n             the Bankruptcy Code should provide less\n             protection to an individual's interest in\n             retaining possession of his or her home than\n             of other assets. The anomaly is, however,\n             explained   by    the    legislative    history\n             indicating   that   favorable    treatment   of\n             residential   mortgagees    was   intended   to\n             encourage the flow of capital into the home\n             lending market.\n\nNobelman, 508 U.S. at 332 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffor purposes of ยง 1322(b)(2) at the time of the mortgage, the time\n\nof the petition for bankruptcy protection, or some other time?\n\nCompare In re Smart, 214 B.R. 63, 68 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1997)\n\n(mortgage date), with In re Wetherbee, 164 B.R. 212, 215 (Bankr.\n\nD.N.H. 1994) (petition date); see also GMAC Mortgage Corp. v.\n\nMarenaro (In re Marenaro), 217 B.R. 358, 360 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(noting the uncertainty).      Because the issue is not settled, the\n\nbankruptcy court analyzed the applicability of ยง 1322(b)(2) from\n\nboth the mortgage date and the petition date.11\n\n             The un-transferred deed from Ness to the Debtor was dated\n\nafter the Debtor mortgaged the property to Eastern.       Therefore, at\n\nthe time of the mortgage, the Debtor owned the Jasper Lot and did\n\nnot claim to own the Enfield Lot.        In analyzing the applicability\n\nof ยง 1322(b)(2) at that point in time, the bankruptcy court said\n\nthat:\n\n             the Bank had and continues to have a mortgage\n             on the [Jasper Lot] which is burdened with an\n             encroachment. Assuming without deciding that\n             the physical presence of a significant amount\n             [of] the residence on the [Jasper Lot] would\n             be sufficient to bring the [Jasper Lot] within\n             the rubric of \"primary residence,\" [Eastern]\n             has failed to prove that an eight to ten foot\n             encroachment is the main part, the principal\n             part, or even an important part of the\n             Debtor's residence. Indeed, from the pictures\n             provided to the Court by the Debtor, it\n\n\n        11\n      Because in fact the ownership did not change between the time\nof the mortgage and the time of the petition, the issue of what\npoint in time to determine the \"principal residence\" is not\nrelevant to this appeal.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            appears that the encroachment may only be an\n            unenclosed deck.    This is not a situation\n            where a mortgagee has a lien on the primary\n            residence that is comprised of two separately\n            deeded parcels and the debtor is attempting to\n            sell the unimproved lot. This is a case where\n            the Bank did not take a mortgage on the\n            improved lot.   To hold that the Bank has a\n            mortgage on the primary residence when\n            admittedly it does not hold a mortgage on the\n            [Enfield Lot] is akin to the tail wagging the\n            dog.\n\nEastern does not challenge the bankruptcy court's finding that the\n\nencroachment is not \"the main part, the principal part, or even an\n\nimportant part\" of the residence.           Therefore, the question before\n\nus   is   whether   even   some   nominal    encroachment   by    a   debtor's\n\nprincipal residence on a mortgaged property will trigger the anti-\n\nmodification protections of ยง 1322(b)(2).            We hold that it does\n\nnot.\n\n            We begin with the language of the statute.           See Consumer\n\nProd. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980)\n\n(\"the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of\n\nthe statute itself\").       The key phrase in the statute is \"secured\n\nonly by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's\n\nprincipal residence.\" 11 U.S.C. ยง 1322(b)(2). Eastern argues that\n\nthe statute is satisfied as long as the debtor resides on the\n\nmortgaged property.        But that simply begs the question of what\n\nconstitutes \"residing\" when a party actually resides mostly on the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fadjacent property.12       The text of the statute provides little help\n\nin answering this question.            See Lomas Mortgage, Inc. v. Louis, 82\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding the text of the statute\n\nambiguous   as   to    whether     ยง   1322(b)(2)    bars    modification     of    a\n\nmortgage secured by a multi-family dwelling).\n\n            In Lomas, we also reviewed the legislative history of ยง\n\n1322(b)(2), which we do not repeat here.             See id. at 4-6.      In that\n\ncase, we noted that the most that could be said of the legislative\n\nhistory was that \"Congress wanted to benefit the residential\n\nmortgage market as opposed to the entire real estate mortgage\n\nmarket.\"     Id.      at   5.      The   concern    was     that    without   these\n\nprotections, mortgage lenders would be too conservative in their\n\nlending. Id. This dovetails with Justice Stevens's concurrence in\n\nNobelman,   where     he   notes    that   ยง    1322(b)(2)    was    \"intended     to\n\nencourage the flow of capital into the home lending market.\"                     508\n\nU.S. at 332 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n            This policy of preferring mortgage lenders to other\n\nlenders in bankruptcy does not necessarily extend to those cases\n\nwhere the lender has failed to exercise reasonable due diligence,\n\n\n     12\n      Eastern's argument here is that the Debtor should be estopped\nfrom denying his \"judicial admission\" that he resides at, in the\nDebtor's words, \"26 Jasper St.\" This is without merit. First, the\nrecord is clear that his residence has a street address of 26\nJasper St., even if the majority of the house actually lies on the\nEnfield Lot.   Second, there is no dispute that this house is,\nindeed, his principal residence.    The question is only whether\nenough of that principal residence lies on the Jasper Lot to\ntrigger ยง 1322(b)(2).\n\n                                         -13-\n\fhowever.    Congress's concern is with a well-functioning home\n\nlending market, and that market depends in part on mortgage lenders\n\nworking with due diligence to minimize risk for themselves, and the\n\nmortgage market in general.       The problem Eastern faces here is as\n\na result of its own failure to properly examine the title to the\n\nJasper Lot before taking the mortgage from the Debtor.13            Had it\n\ndone so, it would have found the cloud on the title and dealt with\n\nit accordingly.       We see no reason why ยง 1322(b)(2) should be used\n\nto correct this error.\n\n           We   and    other   courts   have   interpreted   ยง   1322(b)(2)\n\nnarrowly, even after the Nobelman decision. See, e.g., Scarborough\n\nv. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp. (In re Scarborough), 461 F.3d\n\n406, 411 (3d Cir. 2006) (ยง 1322(b)(2) does not bar modification\n\nwhere claim secured by multifamily dwelling, and noting policy of\n\nreading ยง 1322(b)(2) \"literally and narrowly\"); Zimmer v. PSB\n\nLending Corp. (In re Zimmer), 313 F.3d 1220, 1226-27 (9th Cir.\n\n2002) (ยง 1322(b)(2) does not bar modification where claim is wholly\n\nunsecured because of prior lien on primary residence); In re Mann,\n\n\n\n     13\n      We understand that the diligence is often delegated to other\nparties, and that the risk of situations like this are usually\ncovered by title insurance policies. For whatever reason, those\nsystems broke down here. Regardless of whether Eastern may have\nclaims against other parties, it nonetheless must still bear the\nprimary loss for that breakdown. Cf. Focus Inv. Assocs., Inc. v.\nAm. Title Ins. Co., 992 F.2d 1231, 1236 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting\ncases holding that mortgagees and other title insurance holders\ncannot recover their loan losses from title insurance companies on\nthe basis of a negligent title search by the insurer).\n\n                                   -14-\n\f249 B.R. 831, 835-37 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2000) (same, and collecting\n\ncases); Lomas, 82 F.3d at 4.           The policy of encouraging mortgage\n\nlending     does    not   require      ยง    1322(b)(2)         to     be    interpreted\n\nexpansively.       Indeed, if we were to allow Eastern's more expansive\n\nreading of ยง 1322(b)(2) here, we could face cases in the future of\n\nlenders seeking its protection even when they had never intended to\n\nlend against a debtor's principal residence.               For example, suppose\n\nEastern and the debtor had a different mistaken belief at the time\n\nof the mortgage: that the residence was entirely on the un-\n\nmortgaged    Enfield      Lot,   not       the   Jasper        Lot.         Under      such\n\ncircumstances, where Eastern intended to take a mortgage only on\n\nthe undeveloped lot, should it be allowed then to claim the\n\nbenefits of ยง 1322(b)(2) upon discovering that the residence\n\nactually encroached on the mortgaged property?                      The policy behind\n\nยง 1322(b)(2) would not be served, since Eastern would not have\n\ntaken the mortgage as a home lender.                 But the arguments that\n\nEastern has presented here would be equally as applicable in that\n\nsituation;    the    mortgaged   property        would    be    just       as   much   the\n\nDebtor's \"principal residence\" as it is in the instant case.                           The\n\nonly difference we can see is that the parties had intended the\n\nloan in this case to be a home mortgage loan when it was granted.\n\nBut the statute is silent as to intent and as to type of mortgage;\n\nit asks only the objective question of whether the mortgaged\n\nproperty \"is the debtor's principal residence.\"                       Furthermore, we\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fare loath to create a rule that would require courts in the future\n\nto have to inquire into the parties' subjective beliefs as to\n\nwhether a particular mortgage of real property was intended to be\n\na home mortgage or not, especially when the costs of an alternative\n\nrule are small and contained.\n\n                Our ruling today does no more than say that the anti-\n\nmodification provisions of ยง 1322(b)(2) will not apply if the\n\ndebtor's principal residence only encroaches on the mortgaged\n\nproperty.14 Lenders can easily avoid this if they do what they have\n\nalways had the responsibility to do: perform proper due diligence,\n\ntitle examination, and, if necessary, a land survey. The result of\n\nour holding is, of course, a windfall for the Debtor.      If the facts\n\nwere as he believed them to be when he took the mortgage loan, he\n\nwould not be able to strip the loan down by over $100,000.      But if\n\nwe held in Eastern's favor, there would instead be a windfall for\n\nthe bank.       This is not a case where a lender has watched the value\n\nof its collateral go down gradually until it is worth less than the\n\nloan.        Here, the property was never worth as much as Eastern's\n\nloan.        If it had foreclosed the day after granting the loan, it\n\nwould have received roughly the same as it receives now: collateral\n\nworth $18,500 and an unsecured claim for the balance of the loan.\n\n\n\n        14\n      We have no view on the question of how much of a residence\nmust be on the secured property for it to no longer be an\n\"encroachment,\" except to say that it is more than appears in this\ncase.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fGiven its lack of due diligence, we see no reason why the result\n\nshould be otherwise.15\n\n           2. Collateral Valuation\n\n           Eastern also claims that it did not receive adequate\n\nnotice of an intent to value the collateral.       It raises this\n\nargument because it failed to object during the valuation hearing,\n\nand ordinarily that means that the Debtor's valuation is upheld by\n\ndefault.   See Enewally v. Wash. Mut. Bank (In re Enewally), 368\n\nF.3d 1165, 1173 (9th Cir. 2004); In re Brown, 244 B.R. 603, 611\n\n(Bankr. W.D. Va. 2000); see also Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 95\n\n(issues raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived).   It\n\njustifies its lack of objection by saying that it never had the\n\nnotice due under Bankruptcy Rule 3012 that an evidentiary hearing\n\non valuation was going to take place.\n\n           Bankruptcy Rule 3012 states:\n\n           The court may determine the value of a claim\n           secured by a lien on property in which the\n           estate has an interest on motion of any party\n           in interest and after a hearing on notice to\n           the holder of the secured claim and any other\n           entity as the court may direct.\n\nEastern cites the case of Piedmont Trust Bank v. Linkous (In re\n\nLinkous), 990 F.2d 160 (4th Cir. 1993), for the proposition that,\n\n\n     15\n      Eastern also argues that the Debtor should be viewed as\nholding an easement on so much of the Enfield Lot upon which the\nDebtor's house sits. It says that this would essentially bring all\nof the house under the mortgage on the Jasper Lot. Because Eastern\nraises this argument for the first time on appeal, it is deemed\nwaived. Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                               -17-\n\fin order to satisfy the rule, the court must provide creditors with\n\nspecific notice that a ยง 506 valuation hearing is to be held.   Id.\n\nat 162-63.\n\n          However, there is some split of authority, with courts in\n\nthis circuit and others holding that the filing of a Chapter 13\n\nplan is sufficient notice of an intent to strip down and revalue\n\ncollateral, and no separate motion or hearing is required.      See\n\nCurtis v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank (In re Curtis), 322 B.R. 470, 481\n\n(Bankr. D. Mass. 2005); McDonough v. Plaistow Coop. Bank (In re\n\nMcDonough), 166 B.R. 9, 14 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1994); Lee Servicing\n\nCo. v. Wolf (In re Wolf), 162 B.R. 98, 107-08 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1993).\n\nHowever, even assuming that the specific notice that Linkous calls\n\nfor is required in this circuit, it was provided.\n\n          The hearing that was held on November 23, 2004, covered,\n\nin part, the Debtor's motion for secured status under 11 U.S.C. ยง\n\n506, and Eastern had notice that that was to be the subject.    The\n\nhearing was described as \"nonevidentiary,\" but, Eastern argues,\n\nthe hearing implicitly became evidentiary, without notice, because\n\nthe court expected Eastern to provide evidence to refute the\n\nDebtor's valuation of the Jasper Lot.\n\n          At the hearing in question, the bankruptcy judge made\n\nvery clear that, if valuation were in dispute, then an evidentiary\n\nhearing would be necessary.     He said that the issue would be\n\ndecided as a matter of law, without a separate evidentiary hearing,\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fso long as the valuation was unopposed by Eastern.                 Eastern then\n\nargued the legal issue of the interpretation of ยง 1322(b)(2), but\n\ndid not argue the actual valuation of the Jasper Lot.                  At the end\n\nof the argument, the bankruptcy judge said, \"So that's why you've\n\nnot raised and spent a lot of time on the valuation issue because\n\nyou say it doesn't matter.\"        Counsel for Eastern responded, \"Yes,\n\nYour Honor.      We don't think we ever get there.            They can't modify\n\nthe mortgage.\"\n\n              Eastern was thus given several opportunities to request\n\nan evidentiary hearing to challenge the valuation of the Jasper\n\nLot, and had sufficient notice that the valuation was likely to\n\nstand if it lost on the ยง 1322(b)(2) issue.                  It appears to have\n\nmade a strategic decision not to argue valuation, or at least to\n\nfocus   all    of   its   energy   on    the   legal   issue.      Under      these\n\ncircumstances, we see no violation of Rule 3012.\n\n              3. Burden of Proof\n\n              Eastern's   final    argument     in     its    appeal   from    the\n\nbankruptcy court's orders is that the court improperly applied the\n\nburden of proof.      The court held that Eastern,\n\n              as the party objecting to confirmation, must\n              prove it is entitled to the protection it\n              claims under section 1322(b)(2). The mortgage\n              document as well as the deed conveying the\n              [Enfield Lot] from Ms. Ness to the Debtor\n              constitute sufficient evidence to call into\n              doubt [Eastern's] proof of claim, in which it\n              asserts a secured claim in the full amount of\n              the note.     Thus the ultimate burden to\n              establish its claim has been shifted back to\n\n                                        -19-\n\f            [Eastern]. The Court must now decide whether\n            [Eastern] has met its burden.\n\nThis    holding,   the   bankruptcy   court    said,   followed   from   the\n\nprinciple that,\n\n            [a]lthough a properly executed and filed proof\n            of claim is prima facie evidence of the\n            validity and amount of the claim (Bankruptcy\n            Rule 3001(f)), once the objecting party\n            submits sufficient evidence to place the\n            claimant's entitlement in issue, the ultimate\n            burden of proof or persuasion is upon the\n            creditor to establish its claim.\n\n(quoting Brown, 244 B.R. at 608).              Eastern argues that this\n\nprinciple is applicable only to situations where the issue is the\n\n\"value\" or \"extent\" of a claim, but not to where the issue is one\n\nof the applicability of a statute.16          It cites the case of In re\n\nZiegler, which held that, \"in a ยง 1322(b) context, the initial\n\nburden of production falls on the creditor, with the ultimate\n\nburden of persuasion resting on the debtor.\"              88 B.R. 67, 69\n\n(Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1988).\n\n            Even assuming that Ziegler's burden-shifting approach\n\napplies in this circuit, we do not see a conflict here.           The issue\n\nin Ziegler was whether a pledge of proceeds from a contingent,\n\nunliquidated state lawsuit could be sufficient to cure default on\n\na mortgage secured only by a debtor's residence.         The court in that\n\ncase held that the debtor had not met his burden to show that the\n\n\n       16\n      Bankruptcy Rule 3001(f) states: \"A proof of claim executed\nand filed in accordance with these rules shall constitute prima\nfacie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.\"\n\n                                  -20-\n\flawsuit proceeds were more than just speculative.              In discussing\n\nthe burden of proof, the court was referring to proof of the\n\ndebtor's ability to satisfy claims from particular income streams.17\n\nThis is a subset of the broader principle that the debtor bears the\n\nburden of proving that a Chapter 13 plan is feasible                See First\n\nNat'l Bank of Boston v. Fantasia (In re Fantasia), 211 B.R. 420,\n\n423 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1997).     This is not in conflict with the point\n\nthat a creditor bears the burden of persuasion as to its proofs of\n\nclaim.    See In re Durastone Co, Inc., 223 B.R. 396, 397-98 (Bankr.\n\nD.R.I. 1998).      Furthermore, even if it were error to place the\n\nburden of persuasion on Eastern with respect to the interpretation\n\nof ยง 1322(b)(2), any error was harmless since the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's interpretation was the correct one.\n\nB. Rule 60(b) Motions\n\n            We   review   decisions    granting     or   denying   Rule   60(b)\n\nmotions for abuse of discretion.             Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes &\n\nSon, Ltd., 427 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            After discovering that the Debtor did not in fact own the\n\nEnfield Lot, Eastern moved for reconsideration of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's orders under Rules 60(b)(2) (newly discovered evidence);\n\n(b)(3) (fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct); and (b)(6)\n\n\n     17\n      In Ziegler, the court's principal authority in deciding the\nburden of proof was In re Fries, 68 B.R. 676 (Bankr. E.D. Pa.\n1986), which also dealt with the issue of whether certain income\nstreams were adequate to satisfy claims. Ziegler, 88 B.R. at 68-\n69.\n\n                                      -21-\n\f(any other reason justifying relief).   The bankruptcy court denied\n\nthe motions without opinion, and Eastern appealed to the BAP.    The\n\nBAP thoroughly addressed the arguments and affirmed the bankruptcy\n\ncourt.   Eastern Sav. Bank, FSB v. Lafata (In re Lafata), 344 B.R.\n\n715, 723-26 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2006).   We agree with the BAP, and add\n\nthe following additional reason for denying the motions.\n\n          While Eastern is outraged over what it perceives to be\n\nbad behavior by the Debtor, it has not articulated how it was\n\nprejudiced.   The fact remains that the Debtor does not own the\n\nEnfield Lot, and knowing this at the time of the trial would not\n\nchange the fact that Eastern has no claim on the property.      The\n\nissue of whether ยง 1322(b)(2) applied to bar modification was fully\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court, which examined both the case in which\n\nthe Debtor owned the Enfield Lot, and the case in which he did not.\n\nThe court's analysis, and ours today, would have applied just as\n\nmuch if the court had known with certainty that the Debtor did not\n\nown the Enfield Lot.    Indeed, Eastern would arguably have been\n\nbetter off in the case where the Debtor owned both.   Then it could\n\n-- as it did -- plausibly seek reformation of the mortgage, or\n\nsomething similar.   With that option off the table, we do not see\n\nhow Eastern can now claim that it would be more likely to succeed.\n\n          Under Rule 60(b)(2), a movant must show, inter alia, that\n\nthe newly discovered evidence \"is of such a nature that it would\n\nprobably change the result were a new trial to be granted.\"     U.S.\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fSteel v. M. DeMatteo Const. Co., 315 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nUnder Rule 60(b)(3), a movant must show, inter alia, that any\n\nmisconduct \"foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of\n\nhis case.\"    Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)   (internal   quotation   marks,   citations,   and   alterations\n\nomitted).    Since Eastern has not presented an argument, nor do we\n\nsee one, as to how the bankruptcy court would have reached a\n\ndifferent result, neither of these standards were met.         For the\n\nsame reason, Eastern has not shown the \"exceptional circumstances\n\njustifying extraordinary relief\" that must obtain for Rule 60(b)(6)\n\nrelief to be granted.   Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).    Therefore, the bankruptcy court and the BAP did not\n\nabuse their discretion in denying the motions.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n            For the forgoing reasons, the decision of the district\n\ncourt affirming the bankruptcy court's orders and the decision of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirming the bankruptcy court's\n\ndenial of Eastern's Rule 60(b) motion are affirmed.           Costs to\n\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f",

At issue in this case of\n\nfirst impression is whether the Bankruptcy Code's protection of\n\nmortgage lenders against modification of claims secured by a\n\nprincipal residence applies when the residence in fact lies mostly\n\non a lot abutting the mortgaged property.             This case arises out of\n\na bizarre set of facts.      The debtor in this case and his then-wife\n\nmistakenly built a house on the property line between two lots\n\nowned by the debtor's ex-wife, a fact which was not discovered\n\nuntil after a mortgage on the lot believed to include the house had\n\nalready been granted.       Compounding this problem is the fact that\n\neveryone -- the debtor, the bank, and the bankruptcy court -- was\n\nmistaken   as   to   who   owned   what    property    when.    Despite   this\n\nconfusion, the bankruptcy court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\n\nthoroughly addressed the dispositive issues, and we affirm.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           The issues here center around two contiguous pieces of\n\nproperty: 26 Jasper St. (the \"Jasper Lot\")1 and 31 Enfield Ave.\n\n(the \"Enfield Lot\") in Methuen, Massachusetts. Vito Anthony LaFata\n\n(the \"Debtor\") resides in a house that straddles the property line\n\nbetween the Jasper Lot and the Enfield Lot, with the majority of\n\nthe house on the Enfield Lot, but with a street address of 26\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      It appears from the record that the Jasper Lot is actually\ntwo separate parcels, one of which is a five-foot-wide strip. For\nsimplicity, we will refer to them collectively as the \"Jasper Lot.\"\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJasper St.2       Both properties were originally owned by a realty\n\ntrust controlled by Gail Ness,3 formerly the wife of the Debtor.\n\nAs part of an earlier divorce settlement, Ness deeded the Jasper\n\nLot to the Debtor.      Importantly, both Ness and the Debtor had the\n\nmistaken belief at the time of the deed that the house lay entirely\n\non the Jasper Lot.        This erroneous belief was the first of two\n\nmistakes that resulted in this case being before us today.\n\n               In July 2003, still with the mistaken belief that his\n\nhouse was entirely on the Jasper Lot, the Debtor mortgaged the\n\nproperty to Eastern Savings Bank, FSB (\"Eastern\"), the appellant\n\nhere.       Eastern's title work did not disclose that the majority of\n\nthe Debtor's residence actually lay on the Enfield Lot.4            In\n\nconnection with the mortgage, the Debtor executed a note for\n\n$165,000, secured solely by the Jasper Lot.        It appears that he\n\nnever made any of the payments due on the note.\n\n               Following the grant of the mortgage to Eastern, Ness\n\nagreed to transfer the Enfield Lot to the Debtor in exchange for\n\nmoney owed to Ness by the Debtor under their original divorce\n\n\n     2\n      The Enfield Lot also contains other structures, which are not\nrelevant to the issues here.\n     3\n      Gail Ness is also referred to in the record as Gail LaFata\nand Gail Raulinaitis.     We will refer to her as \"Ness\" for\nsimplicity.\n        4\n      It is unclear what the source of the mistake was. There is\nsome indication in the record that an erroneous plot plan existed,\na fact which may have been discovered when the Debtor applied for\nwork permits from the city.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsettlement, apparently unaware of the title issue.                  Pursuant to\n\nthis       agreement,   Ness   executed   a    deed,   dated    June   4,   2004,\n\npurporting to transfer the Enfield Lot to the Debtor.                    However,\n\nbecause the payments were never made, the deed was never actually\n\ndelivered to the Debtor for recording purposes.                  Instead it was\n\nheld in escrow by Ness's attorney pending the payment of the\n\nadditional funds owed by the Debtor to Ness.                   According to the\n\nrecord, because of nonpayment of the agreed-upon amount, Ness\n\nremains the owner of the Enfield Lot today.                Hence the second\n\nmistake:       the   Debtor    seemed     to   misunderstand      this      escrow\n\narrangement, and during his bankruptcy proceedings operated with\n\nthe mistaken belief that he was the fee simple owner of the Enfield\n\nLot.\n\n               On August 5, 2004, the Debtor filed for Chapter 13\n\nbankruptcy protection, claiming as assets both the Jasper Lot and\n\nthe Enfield Lot.         At some point not clear from the record the\n\nDebtor had become aware that his residence was not entirely on the\n\nJasper Lot, but was instead mostly on the Enfield Lot.5                       This\n\nencroachment made the Jasper Lot noncompliant with zoning, which\n\nessentially destroyed its value.          An appraisal commissioned by the\n\nDebtor noted that, if compliant, the land would probably be worth\n\naround $100,000, but in its current state the property was worth\n\n\n       5\n      According to the record, Eastern also became aware of this\nfact as early as March 2004, when it first filed a claim with its\ntitle insurance company.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fonly \"what the neighbor will pay for it\" -- a value the appraiser\n\nestimated at $18,500.\n\n            Eastern filed a proof of claim for the full value of its\n\nmortgage,   which   it    placed    at    $195,340,    including   delinquent\n\ninterest and collection fees. On August 18, 2004, the Debtor filed\n\nan objection to this proof of claim, as well as a motion for\n\ndetermination of secured status under 11 U.S.C. ยง 506 and a\n\nproposed Chapter 13 plan.\n\n            As part of his proposed Chapter 13 plan, the Debtor\n\nsought to bifurcate Eastern Bank's claim into secured and unsecured\n\nportions,   with    the   secured    portion     worth   only   $18,500,   the\n\nappraised value of the collateral.            That left, according to the\n\nDebtor, $131,500 in unsecured debt,6 for which the Debtor proposed\n\nto pay 10 cents on the dollar.           Eastern thus stood to receive only\n\n$31,650 on a claim that may have been worth as much as $195,340.\n\nEastern understandably objected to this.              On August 27, 2004, it\n\nfiled a response to the objection to the proof of claim, an\n\nobjection to the motion for determination of secured status, and an\n\nobjection to confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan.\n\n            Further complicating matters, the City of Methuen also\n\nfiled an objection to the Debtor's motion for determination of\n\nsecured status on or around August 20, in which it stated that,\n\n\n     6\n      This would place the total value of Eastern's claim at\n$150,000. It's not clear from the record how the Debtor arrived at\nthis figure, given that the face value of the note was $165,000.\n\n                                     -6-\n\faccording to the registry of deeds, the Enfield Lot was actually\n\nowned by Ness.         The Debtor responded on August 27 by providing the\n\ncourt with a copy of the July 4, 2004, deed of the Enfield Lot from\n\nNess       to   the   Debtor   --   the   same   deed   that   was   subsequently\n\ndiscovered to be still in escrow. The bankruptcy court and Eastern\n\nappeared to believe the Debtor's assurances that he owned the\n\nproperty and did not pursue the issue of ownership further.7\n\n                The three objections raised by Eastern each depend on\n\nwhether 11 U.S.C. ยง 1322(b)(2) would allow Eastern's claim to be\n\nbifurcated as proposed by the Debtor.              The bankruptcy court ruled\n\nin favor of the Debtor on December 8, 2004, and allowed the\n\nbifurcation of the claim into a secured claim of $18,500 and an\n\nunsecured claim for the balance of the note.               Eastern appealed to\n\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court on July 7, 2005, without opinion.\n\nEastern appeals from the district court's decision, and that appeal\n\nis the first of the two appeals before us today.\n\n                Following the bankruptcy court orders, Eastern began an\n\nadversarial action against the Debtor in bankruptcy court on\n\nJanuary 19, 2005, seeking to reform the mortgage so as to include\n\nat least that portion of the Enfield Lot that included the Debtor's\n\n\n       7\n      Eastern justifies its reliance on what it knew to be an\nunrecorded deed by pointing out that, even if the deed was not\nrecorded, it would still be valid as against the Debtor and Ness.\nOf course, this assumes that the deed was at least validly\ndelivered, which it was not.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fresidence.    During depositions for that proceeding, Ness and the\n\nDebtor both testified that the Enfield Lot was actually still owned\n\nby Ness.     At that point Eastern moved for relief from judgment\n\nunder Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.8      Eastern\n\nasked that the bankruptcy court vacate the three orders it had\n\nearlier decided in favor of the Debtor, citing newly discovered\n\nevidence and fraud on the court.\n\n            The bankruptcy court held a show cause hearing on October\n\n7, 2005, to confirm whether the deed was in fact in escrow and\n\nwhether it could be delivered to the Debtor.       The court concluded\n\nthat it could not be delivered.         On October 21, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt denied the Rule 60(b) motion, saying only that Eastern\n\n\"failed to meet its burden.\"\n\n            Eastern appealed the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion to\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") for the First Circuit, which\n\naffirmed.    Eastern appealed to us, and that appeal makes up the\n\nsecond of the two appeals before us.\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\nA. The Bankruptcy Court's Orders\n\n            On appeal from a district court's review of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt decision, we review the bankruptcy court's legal conclusions\n\nde novo and its factual conclusions for clear error.

In Nobelman, the Supreme Court held that\n\nยง 1322(b)(2) barred modification of the entire claim -- secured and\n\nunsecured portions -- if the claim is secured by the debtor's\n\nprincipal residence.10      508 U.S. at 332.          Therefore, in the instant\n\ncase, if Eastern's claim is secured by the Debtor's principal\n\nresidence, then the claim cannot be modified by bifurcating it into\n\nsecured and unsecured claims, even though the value of the security\n\nis roughly one-tenth the value of the claim.\n\n             Despite mistakenly believing that the Debtor owned the\n\nEnfield Lot, the bankruptcy court did still rule on this question\n\nunder the correct set of facts.

Because the issue is not settled, the\n\nbankruptcy court analyzed the applicability of ยง 1322(b)(2) from\n\nboth the mortgage date and the petition date.11\n\n             The un-transferred deed from Ness to the Debtor was dated\n\nafter the Debtor mortgaged the property to Eastern.       Therefore, at\n\nthe time of the mortgage, the Debtor owned the Jasper Lot and did\n\nnot claim to own the Enfield Lot.        In analyzing the applicability\n\nof ยง 1322(b)(2) at that point in time, the bankruptcy court said\n\nthat:\n\n             the Bank had and continues to have a mortgage\n             on the [Jasper Lot] which is burdened with an\n             encroachment. Assuming without deciding that\n             the physical presence of a significant amount\n             [of] the residence on the [Jasper Lot] would\n             be sufficient to bring the [Jasper Lot] within\n             the rubric of \"primary residence,\" [Eastern]\n             has failed to prove that an eight to ten foot\n             encroachment is the main part, the principal\n             part, or even an important part of the\n             Debtor's residence. Indeed, from the pictures\n             provided to the Court by the Debtor, it\n\n\n        11\n      Because in fact the ownership did not change between the time\nof the mortgage and the time of the petition, the issue of what\npoint in time to determine the \"principal residence\" is not\nrelevant to this appeal.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            appears that the encroachment may only be an\n            unenclosed deck.    This is not a situation\n            where a mortgagee has a lien on the primary\n            residence that is comprised of two separately\n            deeded parcels and the debtor is attempting to\n            sell the unimproved lot. This is a case where\n            the Bank did not take a mortgage on the\n            improved lot.   To hold that the Bank has a\n            mortgage on the primary residence when\n            admittedly it does not hold a mortgage on the\n            [Enfield Lot] is akin to the tail wagging the\n            dog.\n\nEastern does not challenge the bankruptcy court's finding that the\n\nencroachment is not \"the main part, the principal part, or even an\n\nimportant part\" of the residence.           Therefore, the question before\n\nus   is   whether   even   some   nominal    encroachment   by    a   debtor's\n\nprincipal residence on a mortgaged property will trigger the anti-\n\nmodification protections of ยง 1322(b)(2).            We hold that it does\n\nnot.\n\n            We begin with the language of the statute.           See Consumer\n\nProd. Safety Comm'n v.

The key phrase in the statute is \"secured\n\nonly by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's\n\nprincipal residence.\" 11 U.S.C. ยง 1322(b)(2). Eastern argues that\n\nthe statute is satisfied as long as the debtor resides on the\n\nmortgaged property.

See id. at 4-6.      In that\n\ncase, we noted that the most that could be said of the legislative\n\nhistory was that \"Congress wanted to benefit the residential\n\nmortgage market as opposed to the entire real estate mortgage\n\nmarket.\"     Id.      at   5.      The   concern    was     that    without   these\n\nprotections, mortgage lenders would be too conservative in their\n\nlending. Id. This dovetails with Justice Stevens's concurrence in\n\nNobelman,   where     he   notes    that   ยง    1322(b)(2)    was    \"intended     to\n\nencourage the flow of capital into the home lending market.\"                     508\n\nU.S. at 332 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n            This policy of preferring mortgage lenders to other\n\nlenders in bankruptcy does not necessarily extend to those cases\n\nwhere the lender has failed to exercise reasonable due diligence,\n\n\n     12\n      Eastern's argument here is that the Debtor should be estopped\nfrom denying his \"judicial admission\" that he resides at, in the\nDebtor's words, \"26 Jasper St.\" This is without merit. First, the\nrecord is clear that his residence has a street address of 26\nJasper St., even if the majority of the house actually lies on the\nEnfield Lot.   Second, there is no dispute that this house is,\nindeed, his principal residence.    The question is only whether\nenough of that principal residence lies on the Jasper Lot to\ntrigger ยง 1322(b)(2).\n\n                                         -13-\n\fhowever.    Congress's concern is with a well-functioning home\n\nlending market, and that market depends in part on mortgage lenders\n\nworking with due diligence to minimize risk for themselves, and the\n\nmortgage market in general.       The problem Eastern faces here is as\n\na result of its own failure to properly examine the title to the\n\nJasper Lot before taking the mortgage from the Debtor.13            Had it\n\ndone so, it would have found the cloud on the title and dealt with\n\nit accordingly.       We see no reason why ยง 1322(b)(2) should be used\n\nto correct this error.\n\n           We   and    other   courts   have   interpreted   ยง   1322(b)(2)\n\nnarrowly, even after the Nobelman decision.

The policy of encouraging mortgage\n\nlending     does    not   require      ยง    1322(b)(2)         to     be    interpreted\n\nexpansively.       Indeed, if we were to allow Eastern's more expansive\n\nreading of ยง 1322(b)(2) here, we could face cases in the future of\n\nlenders seeking its protection even when they had never intended to\n\nlend against a debtor's principal residence.               For example, suppose\n\nEastern and the debtor had a different mistaken belief at the time\n\nof the mortgage: that the residence was entirely on the un-\n\nmortgaged    Enfield      Lot,   not       the   Jasper        Lot.         Under      such\n\ncircumstances, where Eastern intended to take a mortgage only on\n\nthe undeveloped lot, should it be allowed then to claim the\n\nbenefits of ยง 1322(b)(2) upon discovering that the residence\n\nactually encroached on the mortgaged property?                      The policy behind\n\nยง 1322(b)(2) would not be served, since Eastern would not have\n\ntaken the mortgage as a home lender.                 But the arguments that\n\nEastern has presented here would be equally as applicable in that\n\nsituation;    the    mortgaged   property        would    be    just       as   much   the\n\nDebtor's \"principal residence\" as it is in the instant case.                           The\n\nonly difference we can see is that the parties had intended the\n\nloan in this case to be a home mortgage loan when it was granted.\n\nBut the statute is silent as to intent and as to type of mortgage;\n\nit asks only the objective question of whether the mortgaged\n\nproperty \"is the debtor's principal residence.\"                       Furthermore, we\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fare loath to create a rule that would require courts in the future\n\nto have to inquire into the parties' subjective beliefs as to\n\nwhether a particular mortgage of real property was intended to be\n\na home mortgage or not, especially when the costs of an alternative\n\nrule are small and contained.\n\n                Our ruling today does no more than say that the anti-\n\nmodification provisions of ยง 1322(b)(2) will not apply if the\n\ndebtor's principal residence only encroaches on the mortgaged\n\nproperty.14 Lenders can easily avoid this if they do what they have\n\nalways had the responsibility to do: perform proper due diligence,\n\ntitle examination, and, if necessary, a land survey. The result of\n\nour holding is, of course, a windfall for the Debtor.      If the facts\n\nwere as he believed them to be when he took the mortgage loan, he\n\nwould not be able to strip the loan down by over $100,000.      But if\n\nwe held in Eastern's favor, there would instead be a windfall for\n\nthe bank.       This is not a case where a lender has watched the value\n\nof its collateral go down gradually until it is worth less than the\n\nloan.        Here, the property was never worth as much as Eastern's\n\nloan.        If it had foreclosed the day after granting the loan, it\n\nwould have received roughly the same as it receives now: collateral\n\nworth $18,500 and an unsecured claim for the balance of the loan.\n\n\n\n        14\n      We have no view on the question of how much of a residence\nmust be on the secured property for it to no longer be an\n\"encroachment,\" except to say that it is more than appears in this\ncase.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fGiven its lack of due diligence, we see no reason why the result\n\nshould be otherwise.15\n\n           2. Collateral Valuation\n\n           Eastern also claims that it did not receive adequate\n\nnotice of an intent to value the collateral.       It raises this\n\nargument because it failed to object during the valuation hearing,\n\nand ordinarily that means that the Debtor's valuation is upheld by\n\ndefault.   See Enewally v. Wash. Mut.

The\n\nhearing was described as \"nonevidentiary,\" but, Eastern argues,\n\nthe hearing implicitly became evidentiary, without notice, because\n\nthe court expected Eastern to provide evidence to refute the\n\nDebtor's valuation of the Jasper Lot.\n\n          At the hearing in question, the bankruptcy judge made\n\nvery clear that, if valuation were in dispute, then an evidentiary\n\nhearing would be necessary.     He said that the issue would be\n\ndecided as a matter of law, without a separate evidentiary hearing,\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fso long as the valuation was unopposed by Eastern.                 Eastern then\n\nargued the legal issue of the interpretation of ยง 1322(b)(2), but\n\ndid not argue the actual valuation of the Jasper Lot.                  At the end\n\nof the argument, the bankruptcy judge said, \"So that's why you've\n\nnot raised and spent a lot of time on the valuation issue because\n\nyou say it doesn't matter.\"        Counsel for Eastern responded, \"Yes,\n\nYour Honor.      We don't think we ever get there.            They can't modify\n\nthe mortgage.\"\n\n              Eastern was thus given several opportunities to request\n\nan evidentiary hearing to challenge the valuation of the Jasper\n\nLot, and had sufficient notice that the valuation was likely to\n\nstand if it lost on the ยง 1322(b)(2) issue.                  It appears to have\n\nmade a strategic decision not to argue valuation, or at least to\n\nfocus   all    of   its   energy   on    the   legal   issue.      Under      these\n\ncircumstances, we see no violation of Rule 3012.\n\n              3. Burden of Proof\n\n              Eastern's   final    argument     in     its    appeal   from    the\n\nbankruptcy court's orders is that the court improperly applied the\n\nburden of proof.      The court held that Eastern,\n\n              as the party objecting to confirmation, must\n              prove it is entitled to the protection it\n              claims under section 1322(b)(2). The mortgage\n              document as well as the deed conveying the\n              [Enfield Lot] from Ms. Ness to the Debtor\n              constitute sufficient evidence to call into\n              doubt [Eastern's] proof of claim, in which it\n              asserts a secured claim in the full amount of\n              the note.     Thus the ultimate burden to\n              establish its claim has been shifted back to\n\n                                        -19-\n\f            [Eastern]. The Court must now decide whether\n            [Eastern] has met its burden.\n\nThis    holding,   the   bankruptcy   court    said,   followed   from   the\n\nprinciple that,\n\n            [a]lthough a properly executed and filed proof\n            of claim is prima facie evidence of the\n            validity and amount of the claim (Bankruptcy\n            Rule 3001(f)), once the objecting party\n            submits sufficient evidence to place the\n            claimant's entitlement in issue, the ultimate\n            burden of proof or persuasion is upon the\n            creditor to establish its claim.\n\n(quoting Brown, 244 B.R. at 608).              Eastern argues that this\n\nprinciple is applicable only to situations where the issue is the\n\n\"value\" or \"extent\" of a claim, but not to where the issue is one\n\nof the applicability of a statute.16          It cites the case of In re\n\nZiegler, which held that, \"in a ยง 1322(b) context, the initial\n\nburden of production falls on the creditor, with the ultimate\n\nburden of persuasion resting on the debtor.\"              </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1999495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1999495/in-re-ziegler/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69\n\n(Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1988).\n\n            Even assuming that Ziegler's burden-shifting approach\n\napplies in this circuit, we do not see a conflict here.           The issue\n\nin Ziegler was whether a pledge of proceeds from a contingent,\n\nunliquidated state lawsuit could be sufficient to cure default on\n\na mortgage secured only by a debtor's residence.         The court in that\n\ncase held that the debtor had not met his burden to show that the\n\n\n       16\n      Bankruptcy Rule 3001(f) states: \"A proof of claim executed\nand filed in accordance with these rules shall constitute prima\nfacie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.\"\n\n                                  -20-\n\flawsuit proceeds were more than just speculative.              In discussing\n\nthe burden of proof, the court was referring to proof of the\n\ndebtor's ability to satisfy claims from particular income streams.17\n\nThis is a subset of the broader principle that the debtor bears the\n\nburden of proving that a Chapter 13 plan is feasible                See First\n\nNat'l Bank of Boston v. Fantasia (In re Fantasia), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1978483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1978483/in-re-fantasia/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n423 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1997).

We agree with the BAP, and add\n\nthe following additional reason for denying the motions.\n\n          While Eastern is outraged over what it perceives to be\n\nbad behavior by the Debtor, it has not articulated how it was\n\nprejudiced.   The fact remains that the Debtor does not own the\n\nEnfield Lot, and knowing this at the time of the trial would not\n\nchange the fact that Eastern has no claim on the property.      The\n\nissue of whether ยง 1322(b)(2) applied to bar modification was fully\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court, which examined both the case in which\n\nthe Debtor owned the Enfield Lot, and the case in which he did not.\n\nThe court's analysis, and ours today, would have applied just as\n\nmuch if the court had known with certainty that the Debtor did not\n\nown the Enfield Lot.    Indeed, Eastern would arguably have been\n\nbetter off in the case where the Debtor owned both.   Then it could\n\n-- as it did -- plausibly seek reformation of the mortgage, or\n\nsomething similar.   With that option off the table, we do not see\n\nhow Eastern can now claim that it would be more likely to succeed.\n\n          Under Rule 60(b)(2), a movant must show, inter alia, that\n\nthe newly discovered evidence \"is of such a nature that it would\n\nprobably change the result were a new trial to be granted.\"     U.S.\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fSteel v.

Since Eastern has not presented an argument, nor do we\n\nsee one, as to how the bankruptcy court would have reached a\n\ndifferent result, neither of these standards were met.         For the\n\nsame reason, Eastern has not shown the \"exceptional circumstances\n\njustifying extraordinary relief\" that must obtain for Rule 60(b)(6)\n\nrelief to be granted.   Ahmed v.

Therefore, the bankruptcy court and the BAP did not\n\nabuse their discretion in denying the motions.\n\n                           III. Conclusion\n\n            For the forgoing reasons, the decision of the district\n\ncourt affirming the bankruptcy court's orders and the decision of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirming the bankruptcy court's\n\ndenial of Eastern's Rule 60(b) motion are affirmed.
