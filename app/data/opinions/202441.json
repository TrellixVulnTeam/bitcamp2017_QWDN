Petitioners David Eduardo\n\nCastañeda-Castillo (\"Castañeda\"), his wife, and two daughters1 ask\n\nus to review a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndenying their applications for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nThe BIA based its decision on a finding that the petitioners were\n\nbarred from being granted asylum or withholding of removal because\n\nCastañeda had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution\n\nof others on the basis of their political opinion.     See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i) and 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). After careful review, we\n\ngrant the petition for review and reverse the decision of the BIA.\n\n               I.   Facts and Procedural Background2\n\n\n1\n   Castañeda's wife and daughters were included in his asylum\napplication.\n2\n    The dissent claims that our discussion of the facts is\n\"materially incomplete\" and proceeds to submit its own version of\nthe facts. Although it is certainly entitled to do so, we have\nsome basic disagreements with this rendition both by reason of its\ncontent and its emphasis.     With due respect, we believe that\ncertain parts of its recitation are either irrelevant or taken out\nof context and clearly the subject of explanation. Perhaps a more\negregious problem is presented by the inclusion of certain\nadditional details, particularly those contained in page 9, line\n11, through page 10, line 4, of the dissent, which recount the\nactions of persons for whom Castañeda was not responsible and who\nwere without his command or authority, and additionally, for which\nCastañeda was absolved of responsibility. The inclusion of this\ninformation in the dissent's recount is thus not only unnecessary\nand irrelevant to a discussion of the issues before us, but also is\nunduly inflammatory and distracts from the proper focus of the\nlegal issues raised by this appeal. The offending facts, although\npart of the decisions below, and undoubtedly an improper factor in\nthe erroneous outcome reached, add nothing material to the appeal\nbefore us.    Throughout this opinion we will, in footnotes and\nelsewhere, explain where we have disagreement with the dissent's\nrecitation of these and other matters.\n\n                                -2-\n\f              Castañeda is a native and citizen of Perú and was an\n\nofficer in the Peruvian army.          He and his family entered the United\n\nStates with tourist visas at Miami, Florida, on August 19, 1991.\n\nThey overstayed, and Castañeda applied for asylum in January 1993,\n\nclaiming      that   he   and   his   family   had    been   persecuted   by   the\n\nterrorist group Sendero Luminoso (\"Shining Path\") while they were\n\nin   Perú.3      Castañeda      was   interviewed     at   the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service's (\"INS\")4 asylum office on May 19, 1999.\n\nThe asylum officer referred the application to an Immigration Judge\n\nafter finding that Castañeda had not met his burden of proof for\n\nestablishing eligibility for asylum.                 On July 7, 1999, the INS\n\nissued Notices to Appear (\"NTA\") to Castañeda and his family,\n\n\n3\n   The Shining Path is a Maoist guerrilla group that \"is among the\nworld's most ruthless guerrilla organizations\" and \"[e]ngages in\nparticularly    brutal   forms    of    terrorism,    including the\nindiscriminate use of bombs.\" The Institute for Counter-Terrorism,\navailable at http://www.ict.org.il/inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=40\n(last visited on August 2, 2006).         The State Department has\ndesignated the Shining Path as a foreign terrorist organization.\nSee United States Dept. of State, Country Reports on Terrorism,\n2 0 0 4     ( A p r i l     2 0 0 5 ) ,      a v a i l a b l e  a t\nhttp://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/45394.htm (describing the Shining\nPath as \"one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the Western\nHemisphere\" and noting that \"[a]pproximately 30,000 persons have\ndied since Shining Path took up arms in 1980\"). The Shining Path\nhas perpetrated mass executions and committed \"numerous massacres\nof entire families including young children and the elderly.\"\nAnthony James Joes, Resisting Rebellion: The History and Politics\nof Counterinsurgency, 117 (2004).\n4\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fcharging them with removability under Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B),\n\nfor   remaining    in   the   United   States   for    a   time   longer   than\n\npermitted.\n\n           Beginning February 16, 2000, Castañeda and his family\n\nappeared     at   twelve   different    hearings      before   two   different\n\nImmigration Judges.5       Castañeda was the only person to testify at\n\nthe hearings.6     We glean the following facts from his testimony and\n\nthe evidence presented at the hearings.\n\n           Castañeda joined the Peruvian military in 1979. In 1983,\n\nupon graduation from military academy, he was commissioned as a\n\nsecond lieutenant and assigned to a motorized infantry battalion.\n\n\n\n5\n   The first Immigration Judge left the bench after Castañeda had\nalready presented his entire testimony but before making a\ndecision. The second Immigration Judge decided to hear Castañeda's\ntestimony again \"in order to make [my] own determination of not\nonly the lead respondent's credibility, but the facts before [me].\"\n6\n   Castañeda testified in Spanish. His testimony was translated\ninto English by an interpreter. During the government's cross-\nexamination of Castañeda, the interpreter participated in the\nhearing via telephone and was not actually in the courtroom. This\ncaused problems during the testimony, as the interpreter often had\nto ask Castañeda to repeat his answers or the government to repeat\nits questions so that she could interpret them and often had to\nclarify or correct the original interpretations. We think it is\nimportant to note this fact because, in our view, some of the\nsupposed inconsistencies or evasiveness mentioned by the dissent\nwere more likely than not simple problems in translation.       For\nexample, when asked whether he could contact other patrols by radio\nduring a military operation on August 5, 1985, Castañeda originally\nreplied \"No. I did not on my radio.\" The Immigration Judge then\nstated \"That's not what I asked\" and asked the question again, to\nwhich Castañeda replied \"No. I could not.\"\n\n                                       -4-\n\fHis original duties included teaching military training, such as\n\nthe use of weaponry, handling of prisoners, community service, and\n\nguarding equipment. After twelve months, Castañeda was transferred\n\nto another unit in Tumbes, a region in northern Perú near the\n\nborder with Ecuador.       Castañeda testified that, during this time,\n\nthe military was fighting the Shining Path. Most of this fighting,\n\nhowever,     occurred     in   the   Ayacucho   region   in   the   Andes,\n\napproximately 400 miles to the south of Tumbes.          While at Tumbes,\n\nCastañeda was a platoon commander and his duties included training\n\nand instructing the men in his section.\n\n           In January 1985, Castañeda was transferred to Battalion\n\n34, an anti-terrorist battalion.        Battalion 34 was located in the\n\nAyacucho region, which is the birthplace of the Shining Path, and\n\nwas referred to as the \"emergency zone\" due to the Shining Path's\n\npresence in the region.7       The battalion was divided into different\n\nbases.   Each base was led by a captain or lieutenant.        According to\n\nCastañeda,    each      base   had   around   forty   men.    Castañeda's\n\nresponsibilities increased in Battalion 34, as his duties included\n\nboth training and leading troops out on patrols.         Upon his arrival\n\nat Battalion 34, Castañeda was assigned to a base in Sacchaeamba,\n\na rural mountainous area.        Castañeda was the head of a twenty-man\n\n\n\n7\n   According to the State Department's 1985 Country Reports on\nHuman Rights Practices in Perú, the emergency zone was an area in\nwhich there was a declaration of a state of emergency and the armed\nforces were given full civil and military authority.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpatrol, and went out on his first patrol one day after arriving at\n\nSacchaeamba.\n\n           Castañeda testified that a major whose code name was Wolf\n\ninstructed him on what areas to patrol.            Wolf, who was not at\n\nCastañeda's    base,   would   communicate   the   patrol   area   to   the\n\ncommander of the base by radio.          The base commander would then\n\nrelay that information to Castañeda.       Castañeda testified that, at\n\ntimes, the patrol route was very specific, while at other times the\n\npatrol route was general and it was left up to Castañeda to decide\n\nthe route.     Castañeda also testified that his patrol sometimes\n\noperated independently of other patrols, while at other times his\n\npatrol's movements were coordinated with the movements of other\n\npatrols.\n\n           Castañeda testified that when he was on an independent\n\npatrol his base commander would inform him of other patrols'\n\npositions via radio in order to avoid overlapping.                 He also\n\ntestified that he sometimes made direct radio contact with other\n\npatrols, and that it was important to know the location of other\n\npatrols in the area in order to coordinate movement.8         When there\n\n\n8\n   The dissent states that Castañeda said it was \"'very important\nto coordinate the movement.' Castañeda said his patrol would 'keep\ncontact with the base by radio,' and at least sometimes would make\ndirect radio contact with other patrols in the area.\" One possible\nimplication of the dissent's phrasing is that Castañeda was stating\nthat radio contact with other patrols was important to coordinate\nthe movement. However, we wish to be clear that Castañeda was not\ntestifying that radio contact with other patrols was important to\ncoordinate movement. Rather, his statement that it was \"important\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwere several patrols conducting a mission, Castañeda testified that\n\neach patrol leader responded to his base commander, who in turn\n\nresponded to the battalion commander, who coordinated the mission\n\nwith other base commanders.\n\n          According to Castañeda, before going out on any patrol,\n\nhe was briefed on the mission of the patrol by the base commander.\n\nHe was given an order that explained the situation on the ground,\n\nthe possible location of the enemy, what the patrol would be doing\n\non the mission, what route to take, and what equipment to carry.\n\nIf, while on patrol, one of his men was injured, Castañeda was\n\ninstructed to radio the base so that the man could be evacuated.\n\nHe also had flares in the event that radio communication was down.\n\nCastañeda testified that at times he had difficulty making radio\n\ncontact due to interference caused by the dense terrain.\n\n          There   were   two     types   of   patrols,    combat    and\n\nreconnaissance.     Combat     patrols   engaged   the   enemy,    while\n\nreconnaissance patrols gathered information.       Most of the patrols\n\nwere conducted at night in order to avoid detection by the Shining\n\nPath.   Castañeda testified that if, while on a reconnaissance\n\n\nto coordinate the movement\" was in response to the question \"Was it\nimportant to know the location of other[s] in your area?\" From the\nfull context of the statement, it is clear that Castañeda was\nsimply stating that it was important to know the location of other\npatrols to coordinate movement, not to have actual radio contact\nwith them. Castañeda had already testified that he kept in radio\ncontact with his base and that his base commander would let him\nknow where other patrols were, although he also sometimes had\ndirect radio contact with the other patrols.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fpatrol, he received intelligence that the Shining Path was in the\n\narea,   he    would   immediately   radio   the   base   commander   for\n\ninstructions on what action to take.      He could not engage the enemy\n\nwithout approval from his commander unless the patrol was being\n\nattacked or was in some sort of danger.      Castañeda testified that,\n\nduring his time at Sacchaeamba, he went on approximately twenty-\n\nfive patrols, most of them reconnaissance. He never had any direct\n\ncontact with the Shining Path.\n\n             Sometime in June or July of 1985, Castañeda, while still\n\nin Battalion 34, was transferred to a base in Vilcashuan, where he\n\nremained the head of a patrol.       He testified that the procedures\n\nand missions were the same as they had been at the base in\n\nSacchaeamba.\n\n             Castañeda further testified that he was involved in a\n\nsignificant operation (the \"Operation\") in August 1985, about a\n\nmonth after he arrived at the base in Vilcashuan.         The Operation\n\ninvolved four patrols.     Two patrols, code-named Links 6 and Links\n\n7, were to enter a village named Llocllapampa in the Accomarca\n\nzone9 to search for Shining Path members.      Links 7 was led by Sub-\n\nLieutenant Telmo Hurtado (\"Hurtado\"), and Links 6 was led by\n\nLieutenant Riveri Rondón (\"Rondón\").          Two other patrols were\n\n\n\n\n9\n   This zone was located within the Ayacucho region, i.e., the\nemergency zone.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fassigned to block escape routes from the village.10                 Castañeda led\n\none of these blocking patrols, code-named Tiger.                 Castañeda could\n\nnot remember the name of the leader of the other blocking patrol,\n\ncode-named Wolf.     According to Castañeda, he received his orders a\n\nfew hours before his patrol left from his base commander, who\n\nreceived them from the command of the division located in the city\n\nof Humanaga.       Castañeda testified that he was briefed on the\n\nmission of the other patrols before he left.                 He was told that\n\nthere were between forty and sixty Shining Path guerrillas in the\n\nvillage. Castañeda's patrol took vehicles part of the way and went\n\non foot the rest of the way.        Castañeda and his men were armed with\n\nmachine guns and a rocket launcher.           They wore Peruvian military\n\nuniforms and also had masks on, both to avoid recognition by the\n\nShining Path and to keep their faces warm.            One of Castañeda's men\n\nhad a radio to contact their base commander.               Castañeda testified\n\nthat he was near his radio operator during the Operation.\n\n           Castañeda's     patrol    was    the    first    to   arrive   at    its\n\ndestination.      Once at the assigned location, which was three to\n\nfive miles away from the village, Castañeda separated his men into\n\nthree   groups.     They   hid   themselves       about    thirty    meters    from\n\ndifferent sides of the path.         Castañeda testified that he was the\n\none who would have made the decision whether to open fire if anyone\n\n\n\n10\n   Apparently, Llocllapampa is located between two mountains, and\nthere were very few paths into or out of the village.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcame down the path.   He testified that he was in radio contact with\n\nhis base commander, who relayed any information Castañeda provided\n\nback to the division headquarters. Castañeda testified that he was\n\nnot informed when the other patrols were ready to attack and he did\n\nnot know when the attack began.     Castañeda testified that he was\n\nonly able to communicate with his base; he did not have the\n\nfrequencies for any of the other patrols and therefore could not\n\nhear any of their communications.11 Castañeda also stated that none\n\nof the other patrols had his frequency, although each of the two\n\nattacking patrols had the other's frequency.\n\n          Apparently, the Wolf blocking patrol got lost and never\n\nreached its assigned destination. Castañeda testified that the two\n\nother patrols, Links 6 and 7, entered the village and massacred\n\ncivilians.12   A subsequent report by a Peruvian Senate Human Rights\n\n\n11\n    The dissent states that, when asked if he was informed what\nfrequencies the two attack patrols were using, Castañeda replied\n\"That's correct.\"    However, the dissent leaves out the rest of\nCastañeda's reply. The full quote is \"That's correct, but both\npatrols entered from the same place and where those patrols are\ndirected, four patrols are directed from the same head of unit, but\nthese orders came from the division. I was directly directed by\nthe head of commander of base.\" From this full quote, it is clear\nthat Castañeda misunderstood the question, and was explaining that\nthe four patrols were directed by a division head, and that his\norders during the Operation came directly from the head commander\nof his case. A few questions later, Castañeda explicitly clarified\nthat he could not contact the other patrols because he did not have\ntheir frequency.\n12\n   The dissent notes that, when asked what happened in the village,\nCastañeda originally stated that \"[o]ne of the patrols . . .\ncommitted excesses.\" The implication behind the inclusion of this\nfact is that Castañeda was being evasive. This is not the case.\n\n                                -10-\n\fCommission (\"Human Rights Commission\") found that up to sixty-nine\n\ncivilians   were   killed,   including   many     women   and   children.\n\nAccording to Castañeda, he did not find out about the massacre\n\nuntil nearly three weeks after the Operation, when he heard that\n\nHurtado had admitted to executing civilians.         He stated that he\n\nheard this news on conventional radio.     He testified that he did\n\nnot learn exactly how many civilians were killed because different\n\nreports contained different estimates.13        According to Castañeda,\n\nhe and his men stayed in their positions until his base commander\n\ntold him the Operation was over and ordered him to return to base.\n\nCastañeda testified that he and his men never saw anyone come down\n\n\n\n\nFrom the transcript, it appears that, after Castañeda testified\nabout \"excesses,\" the Immigration Judge interjected to ask the\ninterpreter what she had said. The government then asked Castañeda\nif he could be more specific, and Castañeda immediately replied\nthat the patrol had executed civilians. We do not think that this\nsequence of events indicates any evasiveness on Castañeda's part.\n13\n   The dissent argues that Castañeda's testimony shows that he was\nevasive regarding his knowledge of the number of civilians killed\nin Llocllapampa. This is incorrect. The Human Rights Commission\nnoted that there were three different reports regarding the number\nof civilians killed: twenty-five, forty, and sixty-nine. It also\nnoted that the exact number could not be determined. To this day\nthe exact number of civilians killed is unknown. Castañeda was\ntherefore entirely correct in stating that he never learned the\nexact number of people killed.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fthe path and never fired any shots.14        Once back at base, he was\n\ndebriefed.15\n\n           News of the massacre was eventually reported by various\n\nmedia outlets and a formal investigation followed.            Castañeda\n\ntestified before a Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission on\n\nSeptember 26, 1985.     He was represented by a military lawyer at the\n\nhearing.   The Human Rights Commission concluded that what occurred\n\nduring the Operation amounted to genocide.           It noted that the\n\nprobable number of people killed in the massacre was sixty-nine,\n\nbut that it was hard to determine the exact number because many of\n\nthe bodies had been destroyed by explosions from grenades. It also\n\nnoted that Castañeda's patrol, Tiger, was \"not involved in any\n\nconfrontations   with    fugitive    civilians.\"16   The   Human   Rights\n\n\n14\n    This testimony is supported by other aspects of the record,\nwhich we discuss infra.\n15\n   The dissent makes much of the fact that Castañeda was debriefed,\narguing that the debriefing means it is unlikely that he did not\nfind out about the massacre until three weeks later, as he claimed.\nWe have two responses.        First, Castañeda stated that the\n\"debriefing\" simply meant that he gave a report to his base\ncommander.   He gave no indication that he met with the other\npatrols or discussed what the other patrols did, and there is no\nevidence in the record to controvert that testimony. Second, it\nwould make sense that those who slaughtered the civilians would not\ntell other soldiers who were not involved. One would expect that\nthose who participate in the murder of innocent civilians would not\nopenly discuss what they have done with others who did not engage\nin such atrocities.\n16\n    As previously noted, we are concerned that the dissent's\ndescription of the murders of the villagers is inflammatory, and we\ntherefore want to emphasize that it is undisputed that Castañeda\nwas not involved in the killing of any civilians.      He was also\n\n                                    -12-\n\fCommission found that Links 7, under Hurtado's command, was the\n\ngroup that carried out the massacre.17\n\n          The   massacre   was   also    documented   by   the   State\n\nDepartment's 1985 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for\n\nPerú. The 1985 State Department Report states that \"[a]n Army sub-\n\n\nlater absolved of responsibility by a military court, a fact which\nwe discuss in more detail below.\n\nThe dissent is equally inflammatory in speculating, in footnote 3,\nthat \"if Hurtado was acting on orders, rather than in the heat of\nthe moment, it is much more likely that Castañeda would have known\nabout the massacre before it happened\". Such speculation loses\nsight of the facts of the case: there is no evidence that Hurtado\nwas acting on orders to commit the massacre, and there is no\nevidence that Castañeda would have known of these hypothetical\norders had they ever been given.\n17\n   The dissent notes that the Human Rights Commission stated that\nHurtado \"is only a piece of the larger picture and it is necessary\nto study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders.\"\nOne possible implication of this isolated fact is that Castañeda\nwas perhaps part of the \"larger picture.\"     However, taking the\nstatement within the context of the report, it is clear that the\nCommission was concerned that persons with a higher military rank\nhad ordered Hurtado to kill the civilians.         In particular,\nelsewhere in the report the Commission refers to possible \"verbal\norders\" given to Hurtado by a general named Wilfredo Mori Orzo.\nNothing in the report indicates Castañeda had any orders beyond\nthose to watch the path for any Shining Path guerrillas or that\nCastañeda was somehow part of the \"larger picture.\"\n\nA more egregious misconstruction of the facts of the case is the\ndissent's statement that \"[i]t is disputed whether [Castañeda] knew\nabout the massacre before or while it took place.\" Again, there is\nno evidence that the massacre was planned or that Castañeda had\nknowledge of these plans if they ever existed. The IJ did dispute\nwhether Castañeda learned, via radio contact, of the massacre as it\ntook place. However, this dispute is irrelevant. Castañeda did\nnot have authority over Hurtado and he was located 3 to 5 miles\noutside of Llocllapampa. Had Castañeda learned of the massacre as\nit transpired, he would not have been able to either assist or stop\nit.\n\n                                 -13-\n\flieutenant and three other officers were responsible for the\n\nAccomarca   massacre       of   some   25   to   69   peasants.      A   separate\n\ninvestigation by the Senate Human Rights Commission supported these\n\nconclusions.\"      Castañeda admitted that he was one of the officers\n\nreferred to in the 1985 State Department Report.                  The 1985 State\n\nDepartment Report indicated that the men involved in the massacre\n\nwere charged in the military and civilian systems, and that the\n\nPeruvian Supreme Court would decide final jurisdiction.18\n\n            The    Human    Rights     Commission     recommended    that   those\n\ninvolved be tried in civilian -- as opposed to military -- court.\n\nHowever, the Peruvian Supreme Court decided that the military\n\ncourts had jurisdiction.          Castañeda, along with Hurtado, Rondón,\n\nand the officer who led the missing Wolf patrol, was charged in a\n\nmilitary court martial in March or April 1986.                    Castañeda was\n\ncharged with first degree murder, homicide, and abuse of authority.\n\nIn connection with the court martial, Castañeda appeared in a\n\nmilitary court four or five times.                  He was represented by a\n\ncivilian lawyer that he paid for.                A judge presided over the\n\nproceedings.      At the court martial, Castañeda testified in his own\n\n\n\n18\n    In stating that \"three officers [including Castañeda] were\nresponsible\" for the massacres, the report was drawing from initial\nreports by the Peruvian military and the Human Rights Commission.\nIt should not be taken as a definitive finding that Castañeda was\nresponsible for the massacre, especially since it was released in\nFebruary 1986 and thus does not take into account Castañeda's\nsubsequent acquittal by the Peruvian military court system\nfollowing a formal proceeding. We discuss the acquittal below.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fdefense, answering questions from the judge and the prosecutor. He\n\nstated that he did not know if he had the right to examine other\n\nwitnesses and did not remember if he was told that he had that\n\nright, but that no witnesses testified at any of the hearings.\n\nWhen   asked   by   the   government   what   evidence   the   prosecution\n\npresented against him, Castañeda stated that \"[t]hey didn't show me\n\nevidence regarding the patrol that I had.\"         Castañeda's evidence\n\nincluded the presentation of an operation chart that specified the\n\nposition of each patrol.\n\n            Castañeda stated that he was found innocent of all\n\ncharges.    In support of this, he produced a document from the\n\nSupreme Council of Military Justice showing that the Appeals\n\nDivision affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him.19\n\nCastañeda provided no other evidence related to his court martial.\n\nHowever, the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human Rights\n\nPractices for Perú indicates that Castañeda was in fact acquitted.\n\n            Hurtado was the only officer convicted by the military\n\ntribunal.      Castañeda testified that Hurtado was convicted of\n\n\"participating in the assassination of those village people.\"          The\n\ngovernment's attorney then asked \"[s]o [Hurtado] was convicted of\n\nmurder?,\" to which Castañeda replied, \"[y]es.\"            Castañeda also\n\ntestified that Hurtado was incarcerated in a military prison, but\n\n\n19\n   From the record, it appears that the Peruvian military justice\nsystem has three levels: a trial level, an appeals level, and the\nSupreme Council of Military Justice as the highest level.\n\n                                   -15-\n\fthat he did not know the length of Hurtado's sentence.          When asked\n\nwhether Hurtado was ever discharged from the military, Castañeda\n\ntestified that he thought so, because that was the result required\n\nby Perú's military code, but he could not be sure.20\n\n              The government then introduced evidence -- in the form of\n\nthe   State    Department's   1995   Country    Report   on   Human   Rights\n\nPractices for Perú -- that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty\n\nand had been promoted to captain.       When asked if he had heard about\n\nthis, Castañeda stated \"I did not know,\" and later testified that\n\nit would surprise him to know that Hurtado had been promoted after\n\nhe was convicted and sentenced.21           At this point, the government\n\nintroduced the 1999 State Department Report, which indicated that\n\nHurtado had been convicted only for abuse of authority; had been\n\npromoted to captain at some point between the massacre and 1993,\n\nwhen he was finally sentenced; and had been released from prison\n\nunder a general amnesty passed in 1995 by then President Alberto\n\nFujimori and the Peruvian Congress. When asked if Hurtado had been\n\nconvicted only for abuse of authority, Castañeda replied: \"Clearly,\n\nI don't know.       What I manifested what I know is that the court\n\nfound him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on the law,\n\n\n20\n   The record indicates that Hurtado's case was still pending when\nCastañeda left Perú in 1991. A final disposition of Hurtado's case\ndid not occur until 1993.\n21\n   Castañeda did testify that, after he came to the United States,\nhe had heard rumors that Hurtado had been promoted to captain, but\nhe did not know if they were true.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fbut maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, the\n\nabuse of authority.\"\n\n            Castañeda testified that he was aware of atrocities\n\ncommitted by the Shining Path against police officers, soldiers,\n\nand civilians.    He admitted that he was aware that, prior to August\n\n1985, the Peruvian military had at times engaged in extrajudicial\n\nkillings,    torture,   and   arbitrary   detentions.      When    asked   to\n\nexplain, he stated that he had heard of officers who had detained\n\nterrorists or possible terrorists in an unjust manner, and had also\n\nheard of detained prisoners being executed.           Castañeda testified\n\nthat he had not heard about any civilians being detained or killed.\n\nAccording to Castañeda, some of these actions by the Peruvian\n\nmilitary occurred in the emergency zone, but it \"was not the norm.\"\n\nAt one point, the government presented Castañeda with a portion\n\nfrom the 1985 State Department Report, which stated that \"[t]otal\n\ndeaths related to antiterrorist operations of the security forces\n\nare estimated by human rights groups as being in the thousands for\n\n1980-85.\"    Castañeda testified that the number sounded incorrect.\n\n            Castañeda also testified that the Peruvian military had\n\na   good   reputation   for   investigating    and   prosecuting   military\n\nmembers for human rights violations.          In an attempt to rebut this\n\ntestimony, the government introduced evidence that in 2004 the\n\ncurrent Peruvian Prime Minister had called for the annulment of\n\nprevious rulings by the military justice system \"that breach human\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\frights, so that there can be in the future no further excuses or\n\npretexts to avoid persecution.\"                 Castañeda denied having any\n\nknowledge of these developments, and stated that he did not know\n\nwhether any annulment of prior rulings would affect his case.\n\n              After the court martial hearings concluded, Castañeda\n\nreturned to duty.          He experienced no professional problems as a\n\nresult of the charges brought against him.             In January 1991, he was\n\npromoted to the rank of captain.               However, due to the publicity\n\nsurrounding the massacre and the court martial, Castañeda's name\n\nand    face   had     appeared     in   certain   newspapers       detailing    the\n\nallegations against him.           As a result, he and his family began to\n\nreceive death threats and to experience other problems from the\n\nShining Path.       In April or May of 1986, Shining Path members set\n\noff    explosives     in   front   of   the    home   of   Castañeda's     parents.\n\nCastañeda knew the Shining Path set off the explosives because they\n\nleft pamphlets with the Shining Path's seal.                  In June of 1986,\n\nShining Path members allegedly shot at Castañeda and set off an\n\nexplosive device while he was waiting for public transportation\n\nnear    his   home.        On   other   occasions,    the    Shining    Path    left\n\npropaganda     containing       written   threats     at    the    homes   of   both\n\nCastañeda and his parents.          Castañeda stated in an affidavit that\n\nhe had been threatened on over twenty occasions.                  In 1989, Shining\n\nPath members allegedly attempted to kidnap one of Castañeda's\n\ndaughters from school.             Finally, in 1990, one of Castañeda's\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fneighbors, who was also in the military and had been receiving\n\nthreats from the Shining Path for several years, was murdered in\n\nhis home and in front of his family by the Shining Path.\n\n           Following his neighbor's murder, Castañeda decided to\n\ntake his family and leave Perú.             He obtained tourist visas for\n\nhimself and his family, retired from the military, and came to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           On October 4, 2004, the Immigration Judge found that\n\nCastañeda was barred from applying for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval because he had assisted or otherwise participated in the\n\npersecution of others on account of their political opinion.                      In\n\nsupport of this determination, the Immigration Judge first found\n\nthat Castañeda was not credible.          The Immigration Judge also found\n\nthat, even if Castañeda were credible, he had assisted or otherwise\n\nparticipated in the persecution of others on account of their\n\npolitical opinion.\n\n           Castañeda    appealed     to    the     BIA,    which       affirmed   the\n\nImmigration Judge on September 9, 2005.             Writing its own opinion,\n\nthe BIA affirmed the adverse credibility finding and stated that,\n\neven if Castañeda were credible, he had assisted or otherwise\n\nparticipated in the persecution of others.                 Castañeda has timely\n\nappealed   to   this   court.      He     argues    that    the    BIA's    adverse\n\ncredibility     determination   is        not    supported        by    substantial\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fevidence,22 that the BIA erred in disregarding the decision by the\n\nSupreme Council of Military Justice purporting to affirm the\n\ndismissal of charges against him, and that the BIA erred in finding\n\nthat he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution\n\nof others on account of their political opinion.\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.   Standard of Review and Legal Standard\n\n           Under the INA, an alien is ineligible for asylum or\n\nwithholding of removal if he or she \"ordered, incited, assisted, or\n\notherwise participated in the persecution of an individual because\n\nof the individual's race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular   social   group,   or    political   opinion.\"     8   U.S.C.\n\n§§   1158(b)(2)(A)(i),   1231(b)(3)(B)(i).       Under   the   applicable\n\nregulations, if evidence is produced showing that the alien engaged\n\nin such persecution, the alien must prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he or she did not engage in such persecution.            8\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c)(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2).23\n\n\n22\n   Castañeda's petition was filed after the passage of the Real ID\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302.

Gonzáles, 416 F.3d 92, 95 n.3 (1st Cir.\n2005). However, because Castañeda's asylum application was filed\nwell before the effective date of these provisions of the Act, the\nprovisions are inapplicable here.\n23\n    The regulations dealing with asylum applications filed on or\nafter April 1, 1997 do not explicitly contain this burden shifting\nprovision.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(c)(1).      However, because\nCastañeda's application was filed in 1993, there is no issue\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           \"Where the BIA does not adopt an IJ's opinion but instead\n\nmakes an independent, superceding decision, we review the decision\n\nof the BIA, and not that of the IJ.\"            Xu v.

Gonzáles, 412 F.3d 202, 204 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nB.   Credibility Determination\n\n           1.     The BIA's Findings\n\n           The BIA gave five different reasons for its affirmation\n\nof the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determination: (1)\n\nthat the military tribunals appeared to be fraudulent and Castañeda\n\nfailed to submit documentary evidence of the proceedings beyond the\n\ndocument   that    showed   his    acquittal;     (2)   that   Castañeda   gave\n\n\n\nregarding what the burden should have been before the Immigration\nJudge.\n\n                                     -21-\n\finconsistent testimony regarding whether or not he was in radio\n\ncontact with the other patrols during the Operation; (3) that\n\nCastañeda's demeanor during questioning on radio communications\n\nindicated a lack of veracity; (4) that Castañeda was evasive\n\nregarding the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian\n\nmilitary; and (5) that Castañeda was not forthcoming about what\n\nhappened to Hurtado.          Having carefully reviewed these reasons,\n\nalong with the record, we believe that the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination was not supported by substantial evidence.                      We\n\naddress each reason in turn.\n\n           The      BIA    first    faulted   Castañeda   for   not   providing\n\ndocumentary evidence of what happened at his military court martial\n\nother than the document -- which the BIA found was not properly\n\nauthenticated -- from the Clerk's Office of the Supreme Council of\n\nMilitary Justice showing that the Appeals Division had affirmed the\n\ndismissal of the charges against him.              The BIA also stated that\n\nthere was \"evidence that the military tribunal was a way in which\n\nto grant impunity to the alleged persecutors who took part\" in the\n\nOperation.\n\n           We begin by noting that the document from the Clerk's\n\nOffice of the Supreme Council of Military Justice is not the only\n\nevidence supporting a finding that Castañeda was acquitted.                  The\n\n1999 State Department Report specifically states that, except for\n\nHurtado,     \"all    the    other    defendants\"   were   acquitted     of   any\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\finvolvement in the massacre.     Given Castañeda's testimony and this\n\ndocumentary evidence, coupled with the lack of any evidence to the\n\ncontrary, we conclude that it is uncontroverted that he was in fact\n\nacquitted.24\n\n           The Immigration Judge concluded -- and the BIA agreed --\n\nthat the military tribunals were a fraud on the basis of two\n\ndocuments: (1) the 1995 State Department Report, which stated that\n\nthe   military   tribunal   system    often   accorded   impunity   to   the\n\nperpetrators of human rights abuses; and (2) an article from Latin\n\nAmerican Weekly Report, dated August 31, 2004 (the \"Article\").\n\n           We begin our discussion of the military tribunals by\n\nnoting that the Supreme Council of Military Justice, along with its\n\nlower tribunals, is a duly constituted judicial body in Perú. This\n\n\n24\n    The BIA also stated that \"the respondent's evidence of his\ndismissal is not necessarily the legal equivalent of a criminal\nfinding that he was innocent.\" This statement is belied by the\nrecord, as the 1999 State Department Report specifically notes that\nall the defendants (including Castañeda) except Hurtado were\n\"acquitted.\" To the extent the BIA was requiring an actual finding\nof \"innocent,\" in our view such a requirement would be unreasonable\nas it goes beyond what even our own justice system offers. Under\nour own justice system, defendants who are \"acquitted\" are found\n\"not guilty,\" they are not found \"innocent.\"\n\n     The dissent argues that the BIA did not require an actual\nfinding of innocence, but simply required Castañeda to show his\ninnocence through court documents or otherwise. We disagree. The\nBIA specifically discounted Castañeda's evidence because it was not\n\"the legal equivalent of a criminal finding that he was innocent.\"\n(emphasis supplied).    Our point is that, under our own justice\nsystem, it would have been impossible for Castañeda to provide such\na finding, and it was therefore unreasonable to discount the\nevidence of his acquittal simply because it is not a criminal\nfinding of innocence.\n\n                                     -23-\n\fmilitary system, which was granted jurisdiction over Castañeda's\n\ncase by the Peruvian Supreme Court, acquitted Castañeda.25                  In\n\ngeneral, American courts will give deference to decisions of\n\nforeign tribunals. See, e.g., Finanz AG Zurich v. Banco Económico,\n\n192   F.3d   240,   246    (2d   Cir.    1999)   (discussing   deference    to\n\ndeterminations      made   by    foreign   courts   due   to   principles   of\n\ninternational comity); Casey v. Dep't of State, 980 F.2d 1472, 1477\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1992) (discussing deference to a determination of a\n\nforeign court in an extradition proceeding); Chiaramonte v. INS,\n\n626 F.2d 1093, 1098 (2d Cir. 1980) (discussing the principle of\n\ninternational comity in relation to criminal convictions obtained\n\nin a foreign country); Restatement 2d, Conflict of Laws § 98.               In\n\nthe instant case, the Immigration Judge and BIA chose not to give\n\nany weight whatsoever to Castañeda's acquittal. That determination\n\nwas not supported by substantial evidence.\n\n             As for the Article, it reported on a conflict between\n\nPerú's civilian and military justice systems following the Peruvian\n\nSupreme Court's ruling that the military system's jurisdiction\n\n\n\n25\n   There is some indication that the Immigration Judge, and perhaps\nthe BIA, faulted Castañeda for not providing evidence of an\nacquittal from the civilian court system of Perú. We wish to note\nthat, to the extent that the decision rested on these grounds, it\nwas erroneous. The highest body of the civilian court system, the\nSupreme Court of Perú, determined that the military system had\njurisdiction over Castañeda's case. There is therefore no doubt\nthat the case was properly before the military courts, and there is\nsimply no reason to fault Castañeda for not providing evidence of\nacquittal in the civilian system.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fextended only to offenses committed in the furtherance of military\n\nduties (and not to human rights violations).            It also contained a\n\nquote from the Peruvian Prime Minister calling for \"the annulment\n\nof [military] rulings that breach human rights,           so that there can\n\nbe   in   the    future   no   further   excuses   or   pretexts   to   avoid\n\nprosecution.\"      We note that there is absolutely no indication that\n\nthe Prime Minister considered the ruling in Castañeda's case to\n\nhave breached human rights.        Further, the Article appears to only\n\ntalk about events that occurred in the 1990s under the regime of\n\nformer President Fujimori.        The Article does not make any allusion\n\nto events that occurred in the 1980s.              Finally, although the\n\nPeruvian Prime Minister at the time of the Article called for the\n\nannulment of certain rulings, there is no evidence whatsoever that\n\nany rulings were annulled, much less Castañeda's acquittal.               In\n\nsum, there is no indication that the Article is in any way\n\napplicable to Castañeda's particular case, nor that the Peruvian\n\nPrime Minister's statements were anything more than pure rhetoric.\n\nWe do not think that the Article was enough to overcome the\n\ndeference ordinarily due a decision by a duly constituted foreign\n\ntribunal.       In fact, it is nothing short of anomalous that undue\n\nweight is given to a magazine \"article\", yet no weight is given to\n\na finding of a duly constituted tribunal.\n\n            Regarding the 1995 State Department Report, we note that\n\nit does mention that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty after\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fserving some jail time.           However, other parts of the record\n\nindicate that in 1995, then-President Fujimori and Perú's Congress\n\npassed a law extending amnesty to military members convicted of\n\nhuman rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.          Thus, it appears that\n\nHurtado was released from jail because he had been granted amnesty,\n\nnot   because    the   original   trial    and   conviction   were   somehow\n\nfraudulent.      We certainly do not see how a grant of amnesty to\n\nHurtado several years after Castañeda left Perú should affect\n\nCastañeda's original acquittal, nor do we think that it should\n\novercome the deference we usually give to the judgment of a foreign\n\ntribunal.       We therefore conclude that the BIA's finding that\n\nCastañeda's trial was a fraud is not supported by any evidence,\n\nmuch less substantial evidence.\n\n            Second, the BIA found that Castañeda \"gave inconsistent\n\ntestimony regarding whether and when he was in radio contact with\n\nthe other patrols involved\" in the Operation.            According to the\n\nBIA, Castañeda indicated that it was important to have radio\n\ncontact, but later specifically testified that he was not in\n\ncontact with other patrols on the day of the massacre.               The BIA\n\nalso rejected Castañeda's argument that the Immigration Judge had\n\ngone beyond the area of its expertise and \"ventured into the realm\n\nof Peruvian military tactics,\" because Castañeda's own testimony\n\nmade it \"clear that radio contact was important for purposes of\n\ncoordination as well as efficiency and protection.\"\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f              There are several problems with the BIA's reasoning.\n\nFirst, while Castañeda testified early on that it was important to\n\nhave radio contact, his testimony indicates that he was referring\n\nto radio contact with his base, not other patrols.                      Castañeda\n\ntestified that he only sometimes had contact with other patrols.\n\nFurther, Castañeda specifically testified about the coordination of\n\npatrols for a mission:\n\n              Each head of a patrol will respond to the\n              immediate boss, the head of base. The head of\n              base at the attack, they will inform the\n              command of the battalion who can communicate\n              and coordinate directly with the head of\n              patrol and give another specific order or can\n              get contact among heads of patrols.\n\nIn other words, Castañeda testified at the outset -- before he was\n\nasked about whether he had any radio contact with other patrols the\n\nday of the Operation -- (1) that it was important to have radio\n\ncontact with his base commander, (2) that in coordinating attacks,\n\nthe    base   commander     would    contact   a   battalion    commander       who\n\ncoordinated the various patrols, and (3) that he only sometimes had\n\ndirect     contact   with    other     patrols.        We   therefore    see     no\n\ninconsistency in Castañeda's testimony that, while he had radio\n\ncontact with his base commander during the Operation, he did not\n\nhave radio contact with the other patrols on the day in question.\n\n              It also appears from the record that the Immigration\n\nJudge, and perhaps the BIA, simply found this testimony illogical.\n\nSuch   a   finding   deserves       less   deference   than    other    types   of\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fcredibility findings because it is based on an analysis of the\n\ntestimony.   Cordero-Trejo, 40 F.3d at 487.      To the extent that the\n\nBIA's   finding   rested   on   this   ground,   we   would   agree   with\n\nCastañeda's point that the BIA ventured outside the area of its\n\nexpertise and into the realm of Peruvian military tactics.              As\n\nsuch, we think the BIA's finding on this point is not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n           Third, the BIA accorded weight to the Immigration Judge's\n\nfinding that during testimony about radio communication, Castañeda\n\nwas \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate.\" While demeanor\n\nevidence is peculiarly within the purview of the trier of fact, we\n\nare not persuaded -- given the problems we have found with the\n\nother aspects of the credibility findings -- that rapid blinking\n\nalone is enough to find Castañeda not credible.26\n\n\n26\n   The dissent seizes on the both the Immigration Judge's and BIA's\nuse of the word \"demeanor,\" noting in several places that Castañeda\nwas found not credible based on \"observations\" of his demeanor.\nThe implication of the dissent's emphasis on demeanor evidence is\nthat the Immigration Judge and BIA based the adverse credibility\nfinding on numerous problems with Castañeda's demeanor.         For\nexample, the dissent notes that the Immigration Judge stated that\nhe had \"carefully observed [Castañeda's] demeanor . . . and found\nhim vague, evasive, and non-responsive.\" However, as the dissent\nalso notes, a hearing officer who makes an adverse credibility\ndetermination must support the determination with specific findings\nin order to be accorded deference. Aguilar-Solís v. INS, 168 F.3d\n565, 570 (1st Cir. 1999).     The only specific finding that the\nImmigration Judge made regarding Castañeda's demeanor -- as opposed\nto the content of his testimony -- was that during testimony about\nradio communication, Castañeda was \"blinking his eyes in an\nunusually rapid rate.\" We readily agree that demeanor evidence is\npeculiarly within the purview of the trier of fact.        However,\nabsent other evidence of a lack of credibility, we cannot affirm an\n\n                                  -28-\n\f          Fourth, the BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge's finding\n\nthat Castañeda was evasive regarding the extent of human rights\n\nviolations committed by the Peruvian military.          From our review of\n\nthe record, this finding mischaracterizes Castañeda's testimony.\n\nHe was not evasive when confronted with statistics from State\n\nDepartment Reports.     Castañeda readily admitted that he was aware\n\nof   instances    in   which   the    Peruvian   army    had   engaged   in\n\nextrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary\n\ndetentions.      He simply disagreed with the numbers.           Castañeda\n\nconsistently testified that abuses by the Peruvian army were not\n\nthe norm and that only a minority of the military engaged in such\n\npractices.    When confronted with the 1985 State Department Report\n\nindicating that \"[t]otal deaths related to antiterrorist operations\n\nof the security forces are estimated by human rights groups as\n\nbeing in the thousands between 1980-1985,\" Castañeda took issue\n\nwith those numbers.      We note that, to the extent the government\n\noffered the report as evidence that thousands of people had been\n\nkilled due to abuses by the Peruvian military, Castañeda appears to\n\nhave been at least correct.           In a portion of the report the\n\ngovernment failed to read at the hearing, the State Department\n\nnoted that, out of these thousands of total deaths, \"[p]recise\n\ninformation is lacking on the number of civilian victims and their\n\n\nadverse credibility finding based solely on a person's \"blinking\"\nduring a portion of their testimony. Such ambiguous indicia are\nsimply too thin to support such a conclusion.\n\n                                     -29-\n\fidentities (terrorist or non-terrorist) as well as the identity of\n\ntheir assailants (terrorists, security forces, or peasant self-\n\ndefense forces).\"     In other words, the \"thousands\" of deaths that\n\nresulted     from   antiterrorist    operations     included   deaths    of\n\nterrorists, as well as civilians killed by terrorists and other\n\npeasant forces.     Therefore, it is quite likely that there were not\n\nthousands of deaths related to abuses by the Peruvian military, and\n\nin that sense, Castañeda was correct.27\n\n           Having considered the entire record, we do not think that\n\nsubstantial    evidence   supports    the   BIA's    determination      that\n\nCastañeda was evasive on the issue of human rights abuses by the\n\nmilitary. He testified consistently throughout the hearings before\n\nthe Immigration Judge, and although he disagreed at times with the\n\ngovernment's assertions, this can hardly be considered evasive\n\ntestimony.    We therefore find that the BIA's finding on this issue\n\nis not supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n27\n   Further, the 1985 Report notes elsewhere that \"[b]eginning in\n1983, some members of the security forces responded to [the Shining\nPath] with violence of their own, engaging in extrajudicial\nkillings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. Most\nof these violations occurred in 1983 and 1984 in the Ayacucho\nEmergency Zone . . . . During 1985, reports of such abuses by\nsecurity forces dropped sharply . . . .\"        In 1983 and 1984,\nCastañeda was serving in Tumbes, around 400 miles away from the\nemergency zone.     It is therefore likely that he heard only\noccasional reports of abuses occurring in the emergency zone.\nFurther, as indicated by the State Department, by the time he was\ntransferred into the emergency zone in 1985, the number of abuses\ndecreased sharply.     This further bol a.      Whether sters his\ntestimony that he only rarely heard of abuses by the military.\n\n                                    -30-\n\f           The   fifth    reason    for   the    BIA's   adverse    credibility\n\nfinding was that Castañeda allegedly was \"not forthcoming about the\n\njudgment   entered       against\"     Hurtado.          This,    again,   is   a\n\nmischaracterization of Castañeda's testimony.                There are several\n\naspects of Castañeda's testimony on the subject of Hurtado, and we\n\ndeal with each in turn.\n\n                    a.    Whether Hurtado was imprisoned\n\n           During cross-examination, the government's attorney asked\n\nCastañeda what happened to Hurtado.             Castañeda replied, \"[a]fter\n\n[Hurtado] admitted [to his involvement in the massacre] and the\n\ncourt found him guilty, he was placed in a military prison.\"               This\n\nstatement is borne out by the record; all of the documents indicate\n\nthat Hurtado was found guilty and placed in prison for a period of\n\ntime.\n\n                    b.    Hurtado's conviction\n\n           Later on in questioning, the following exchange occurred:\n\n           Q.   Sir, my question is, what was [Hurtado]\n           found guilty of?\n\n           A.   He was found guilty of participating in\n           the assassination of those village people.\n\n           Q.    So he was convicted of murder?\n\n           A.    Yes.    That's what I know.\n\n           Q.    Was he sentenced to prison?\n\n           A.   Yes.       He   was   recluded     in    a   military\n           prison.\n\n           Q.    Do you know what his sentence was?\n\n                                      -31-\n\f               A.    I do not know the amount of years.\n\nThe latter part of Castañeda's answer is supported by the record,\n\nas the 1999 State Department Report indicates that Hurtado was not\n\nfinally sentenced until 1993, two years after Castañeda left Perú.\n\nIt is perfectly plausible that Castañeda did not know the length of\n\nHurtado's sentence, since Hurtado had not been sentenced when\n\nCastañeda and his family left Perú.\n\n               Regarding the first part of Castañeda's response, the\n\ngovernment later asked Castañeda if Hurtado was convicted only of\n\nabuse of authority.                  Castañeda stated that \"[c]learly, I don't\n\nknow.    What I manifested what I know is that [t]he court found him\n\nguilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on law, but maybe the\n\nmurder    is    instead         of    the    disobedience,         sorry,   the    abuse    of\n\nauthority.\"              On appeal, the government argues that Castañeda\n\ntestified inconsistently about what crimes Hurtado was convicted\n\nof.      This       is    incorrect,        for    two   reasons.      First,      Castañeda\n\ntestified that Hurtado was convicted of killing the villagers.                              He\n\nreferred to the killings as \"that murder\" and an \"assassination.\"\n\nIt is obvious that, in Castañeda's untrained legal mind, Hurtado\n\nmurdered civilians, and this is what he was convicted of.                               Second,\n\nHurtado was in fact charged with murder, and, at the time of\n\nCastañeda's          acquittal,        the    case       against     Hurtado      was    still\n\nproceeding.               The   document          confirming   Castañeda's         acquittal\n\nspecifically states that the case would continue against Hurtado\n\n\n                                                  -32-\n\f\"for crimes against life, body, and health, first degree murder.\"\n\nHurtado, however, was not sentenced until 1993, and was sentenced\n\nonly for abuse of authority.             This again occurred after Castañeda\n\nhad left Perú.       We see no reason to find that Castañeda was not\n\ncredible as to his knowledge and participation in the Operation\n\nsimply because he thought Hurtado was convicted of murder and not\n\nabuse of authority, when (1) Hurtado was originally charged with\n\nmurder, (2) still faced a murder charge at the time of Castañeda's\n\nacquittal,     and   (3)   was     not   sentenced    until    two   years   after\n\nCastañeda had left the country.\n\n                     c.    Whether Hurtado was discharged or promoted\n\n              When asked if Hurtado was discharged from the army,\n\nCastañeda testified that he thought so, since that was the usual\n\nmilitary practice for an officer in such a situation, but did not\n\nknow for sure.        This apparently was not good enough for the\n\ngovernment attorney, who commented that Castañeda seemed to not\n\nknow   many    details     about    what   happened    to   Hurtado    given   the\n\nsignificance the court martial had on his life.                Castañeda replied\n\n              You're right. That is a very important -- in\n              my life.   What I know is that that officer\n              acted outside the rules that are breach of the\n              army. He was found guilty . . . . I did not\n              try to find out what privileges he might have\n              had and what had happened to his life.\n\nIn other words, Castañeda testified that he knew Hurtado went to\n\nprison, thought he was discharged from the army, and did not try to\n\nfind out what happened to Hurtado afterwards.                 Instead, like many\n\n                                         -33-\n\fpeople would, he tried to resume his normal life.              We see nothing\n\nto indicate that Castañeda was not forthcoming about Hurtado's\n\nfate.28\n\n             During cross examination, the government also introduced\n\na 1995 State Department Report indicating that there were reports\n\nthat Hurtado had reappeared on active duty and been promoted to\n\ncaptain.     When asked about this, Castañeda testified \"I did not\n\nknow that.\"       When asked if it would surprise him to know that\n\nHurtado was promoted after his conviction and sentence, Castañeda\n\nanswered that it would. The record supports Castañeda's testimony.\n\nFirst,     the   1999   State   Department   Report   indicates      that   \"the\n\nMilitary Code states that any conviction that entails a sentence of\n\n2    or   more   years'    imprisonment   must   result   in   the   officer's\n\nimmediate discharge.\" Thus, Castañeda was correct in his testimony\n\nthat the usual practice was for an officer in Hurtado's situation\n\nto be discharged.         The 1999 Report also indicates that Hurtado was\n\nnot released from prison until 1995 under the general amnesty, four\n\nyears after Castañeda had left Perú.             It therefore is entirely\n\nconsistent with Castañeda's testimony that he had no idea Hurtado\n\nhad not been discharged and had in fact been released from prison\n\n\n\n28\n    We also note that Castañeda's knowledge, or lack thereof,\nregarding Hurtado is a red herring. Castañeda was denied asylum\nbecause of what he allegedly did, not because of what Hurtado did.\nAs we previously noted, Castañeda's case is based on his\ndisassociation from Hurtado's actions, actions over which Castañeda\nhad no control or knowledge.\n\n                                      -34-\n\fand promoted, because when Castañeda left Perú, Hurtado's case was\n\nstill ongoing and he was in prison.                Again, we find no basis for\n\nthe adverse credibility finding.\n\n             We also wish to emphasize several key pieces of evidence\n\nthat supported Castañeda's story.                First, as we noted above, the\n\n1999 State Department report indicates that Castañeda was acquitted\n\nof any involvement in the massacre.                Second, the report from the\n\nHuman Rights Commission specifically found that Castañeda's patrol\n\nwas \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"\n\nThis is an extremely important piece of evidence because it goes to\n\nthe heart of the issue: the extent of Castañeda's participation in\n\nthe massacre of the villagers.                 Further, while the Commission\n\nreport     mentioned    Castañeda's       name    twice,     it    did    so    only    in\n\nreference to the fact that he led one of the non-infringing\n\npatrols.        The report clearly holds Hurtado to blame for the\n\nmassacre. It mentions Hurtado's testimony in depth and also refers\n\nto   him   as    \"the   perpetrator\"      --     as   opposed      to    \"one   of     the\n\nperpetrators\"      --   of    the   massacre.         The   1995    and   1999    State\n\nDepartment Reports single out Hurtado and his patrol as the ones\n\nresponsible      for    the   massacre.        For    example,     the    1999    State\n\nDepartment Report states that \"Hurtado commanded the army unit\n\nresponsible for the 1985 Accomarca massacre.\"                     Neither Castañeda\n\nnor any of the other patrol leaders' names are ever mentioned.                          In\n\nour view the record, when viewed as a whole, indicates that Hurtado\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fand   his   patrol   were    responsible       for   the   massacre,      and   that\n\nCastañeda's patrol, which was three to five miles distant, took no\n\npart in it.     After a trial by the military court, Hurtado -- the\n\nman responsible -- was convicted29 and the charges against Castañeda\n\nwere dismissed.      The fact that Hurtado was later released due to a\n\ngeneral declaration of amnesty by the President and Congress should\n\nnot affect the legitimacy of the original trial and conviction, and\n\nit especially should not be held against Castañeda.\n\n            In sum, the evidence indicates that Castañeda credibly\n\ntestified that (1) he never had any contact with any villagers\n\nduring the Operation, (2) he was acquitted of any involvement in\n\nthe massacre by a duly constituted body of the Peruvian military,\n\nwhich was given jurisdiction over his case by the Peruvian Supreme\n\nCourt, and (3) Hurtado, the leader of the Links 7 patrol, was the\n\none found responsible for the massacre by a military court.                     This\n\nevidence, combined with the problems we have discussed related to\n\nthe   reasons   relied      upon   by   the    BIA   in    making   its    adverse\n\ncredibility finding, sound the death knell for that finding.\n\nSubstantial evidence does not support a finding that Castañeda was\n\nnot credible regarding his involvement in the massacre, and we\n\ntherefore reverse the BIA's credibility determination.\n\n\n\n\n29\n   The fact that there was a conviction in the case should further\nboost Castañeda's credibility.\n\n                                        -36-\n\f          2.   The \"Ordinary Remand Rule\"\n\n          The dissent, invoking the \"ordinary remand rule\" argues\n\nthat we must remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings.\n\nWe reject the dissent's reasoning for several reasons which we\n\nbriefly explain.\n\n          In INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12 (2002), a Supreme Court\n\ncase invoked by the dissent, the Court reversed a judgment of the\n\nNinth Circuit.   The Ninth Circuit had reversed the BIA based on a\n\n\"changed circumstances\" argument that the government had made to an\n\nImmigration Judge, but which the BIA had never addressed.        On\n\nappeal, the Supreme Court stated that, under the ordinary remand\n\nrule, \"[a] court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct\n\na de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its\n\nown conclusions based on such an inquiry.        Rather, the proper\n\ncourse, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency\n\nfor additional investigation or explanation.\"    Id. at 16 (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).     The Court then reversed,\n\nstating that the Ninth Circuit had erred by deciding the \"changed\n\ncircumstances\" issue \"without giving the BIA the opportunity to\n\naddress the matter in the first instance.\"    Id. at 17.\n\n          The Supreme Court has also recently applied the ordinary\n\nremand rule in Gonzáles v. Thomas, __ U.S. __, 126 S. Ct. 1613\n\n(2006).   In Thomas, the Immigration Judge denied a petitioner's\n\nasylum claim without considering her alleged fear of persecution\n\n\n                               -37-\n\fbased on membership in a particular social group.         The BIA then\n\nsummarily affirmed.     The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that\n\nThomas was in fact persecuted as a member of a social group even\n\nthough the BIA had not yet addressed the issue.          On appeal, the\n\nSupreme Court reversed and remanded to the BIA for consideration of\n\nthe issue, stating that \"[t]he agency has not yet considered\n\nwhether [petitioner's father-in-law's] family presents the kind of\n\nkinship ties that constitute a particular social group.\"       Id., 126\n\nS. Ct. at 1615.\n\n          While   we   do   not   quarrel   with   the   general    legal\n\nproposition regarding the ordinary remand rule advanced by the\n\ndissent and found in Thomas and Ventura, we believe that the facts\n\nof this case take it outside of the purview of that rule.          In both\n\nThomas and Ventura, the court of appeals considered an issue that\n\nthe BIA never addressed in the first instance.      Here, by contrast,\n\nthe Immigration Judge and BIA both thoroughly considered the\n\ncredibility issue based on a fully developed record.       In reversing\n\nthe credibility determination, we are not conducting a de novo\n\nreview of the record, but rather are reviewing the reasons set\n\nforth by the BIA in light of the record.    Under the ordinary remand\n\nrule, while we could remand the case for further factfinding, we\n\nare not required to do so since the BIA has already thoroughly\n\n\n\n\n                                  -38-\n\f\"evaluat[ed] the evidence\" and brought \"its expertise to bear upon\n\nthe matter.\"   Ventura, 537 U.S. at 16.30\n\n          We note that this approach is in accord with other\n\ncircuits that have interpreted Ventura and Thomas.     For example,\n\nthe Seventh Circuit has stated that \"we do not agree that Ventura\n\nstands for the broad proposition that a court of appeals must\n\nremand a case for additional investigation or explanation once an\n\nerror is identified.\"   Ghebremedhin v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d 241, 243\n\n(7th Cir. 2004).     Several other circuits have adopted a similar\n\nline of reasoning.    See, e.g.,   Almaghzar v. Gonzáles, 450 F.3d\n\n415, 423 n.11 (9th Cir. 2006) (\"Neither Ventura nor Thomas requires\n\nus to remand an issue to the agency when the agency has already\n\nconsidered the issue.\"); Zhao v. Gonzáles, 404 F.3d 295, 311 (5th\n\nCir. 2005) (stating that the court was not required to remand under\n\nthe ordinary remand rule because the BIA had already decided the\n\nissue).\n\n          The dissent also argues that our decision to reverse\n\nviolates the law of our own circuit.   However, the cases cited by\n\nthe dissent are clearly distinguishable.    For example, the dissent\n\nrelies on Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 1998) and Cordero-\n\n\n\n30\n   The dissent's analysis would require us to remand whenever we\nfound an error in the BIA's factual decisions, even if the BIA had\nclearly decided the issue based on a fully developed record. This\nwould transform the \"ordinary remand\" rule into an \"automatic\nremand\" rule, something we do not believe is required by either the\nSupreme Court or our own precedents.\n\n                                -39-\n\fTrejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482 (1st Cir. 1994).               In Gailius, the\n\nImmigration Judge did not address whether alleged threats had\n\noccurred as the petitioner described because it found that a\n\nreasonable person in the petitioner's situation would not fear\n\npersecution on account of such threats.         We disagreed with this\n\nlatter finding and stated that \"[i]f the threats are real . . .\n\nGailius may well have had a well-founded fear.\"          Gailius, 147 F.3d\n\nat 44.   We remanded so that the BIA -- which ignored the evidence\n\nof the threats based on reasons not having to do with credibility\n\n-- could explain why it found the threats not credible.           One of our\n\nmain   reasons   for   remand   was   that   \"the   IJ   did   not   make   a\n\ndetermination of the credibility and authenticity of Gailius'\n\nevidence of threats.\"     Id. at 47.     We have a different case here,\n\nbecause the IJ and BIA made specific credibility findings; those\n\nfindings simply are not supported by substantial evidence.                  In\n\nCordero-Trejo, the BIA first found the petitioner not credible,\n\nthen made an alternative holding that the petitioner was ineligible\n\nfor asylum based on three reasons.       Cordero-Trejo, 40 F.3d at 485.\n\nWe found two of these reasons invalid under the INA, and the third\n\ndepended on the adverse credibility finding, which we found was not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.       Id. at 485, 488.      We also found\n\nthat the BIA failed to consider certain general country condition\n\nevidence offered by the petitioner.       Id. at 485.     In reversing the\n\nadverse credibility finding, we noted that \"it is difficult to\n\n\n                                  -40-\n\fascertain from what sort of evidence the IJ drew his credibility\n\nconclusions.\"    Id. at 491.      Given this fact, along with the fact\n\nthat the Immigration Judge and BIA had failed to address any of the\n\npetitioner's documentary evidence, we remanded.               Castañeda's case\n\nis obviously distinguishable because it is clear what evidence the\n\nImmigration   Judge   and   BIA    relied      on    in   drawing   the   adverse\n\ncredibility determination, and the BIA did not simply ignore all of\n\nCastañeda's documentary evidence.31\n\nC.   Whether Castañeda Was a Persecutor\n\n            As we noted above, the Immigration Judge also found that,\n\neven assuming Castañeda had testified credibly -- i.e., even\n\nassuming that he and his patrol were several miles away from the\n\nvillage during the Operation, did not encounter a single villager,\n\nand did not know what was happening in the village or have any\n\ncontrol over what was taking place there -- he still \"assisted or\n\notherwise     participated\"       in     the        persecution     of    others.\n\nSpecifically, the Immigration Judge concluded that\n\n\n31\n   The dissent also cites Seavy v. Barnhart, 276 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n2001).   However, that case actually supports our decision to\nreverse. In Seavy, which involved an agency's denial of social\nsecurity benefits, we remanded to the agency for further\nconsideration. However, we noted that \"if the evidence and law\ncompelled one conclusion or the other, then [we] could order an\naward of benefits or affirm a denial of benefits.\"     Id. at 11.\nHere, under substantial evidence review, we may reverse the\ndecision of the BIA only if we are compelled by the evidence. In\ndeciding that the BIA's determination is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence, we are in reality stating that the evidence\ncompels a contrary conclusion. Thus, under the language of Seavy,\nwe may simply reverse the agency's decision.\n\n                                       -41-\n\f          the   objective   effect    of   [Castañeda's]\n          participation in the Accomarca operation would\n          have been to aid even in some small measure in\n          the confinement of villagers to the combat\n          area and therefore aid even in some small\n          measure with the execution and murder and rape\n          of those unarmed men, women, and children.\n\nThe BIA, citing to the above portion of the Immigration Judge's\n\nopinion as well as In re Rodríguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (BIA\n\n1988), affirmed this finding, stating that\n\n          we find no error in the Immigration Judge's\n          conclusion that [Castañeda] failed to meet his\n          burden of proving that he did not assist or\n          otherwise participate in the persecution of\n          villagers   in   Accomarca    based    on   their\n          political   opinion;    even    if    [Castañeda]\n          testified credibly that he did not harm or\n          execute anyone on August 8, 1985, there is\n          substantial    evidence    to      support    the\n          Immigration     Judge's      conclusion      that\n          [Castañeda] did aid in the persecution of\n          others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as\n          his   patrol was charged with blocking an\n          escape route for the villagers and people\n          located in the emergency zone.32\n\n\n32\n   The dissent argues that this portion of the BIA's opinion was\nnot an alternate holding and that we should remand to the BIA so\nthat it can address in the first instance whether Castañeda's\nactions amounted to assistance or participation in persecution. In\nessence, the dissent believes that the BIA did not assume the\ncredibility of all of Castañeda's testimony and that the quoted\nportion of the BIA's opinion does not adequately explain the BIA's\nreasoning. It bases this argument in part on the BIA's statement\nthat \"even if [Castañeda] testified credibly that he did not harm\nor execute anyone on August 8, 1985,\" (emphasis supplied), he\nassisted or otherwise participated in persecution.\n\n     We disagree with the dissent's characterization of the ruling\nbelow. The context of the BIA's statement, especially its citation\nto, and affirmation of, a portion of the Immigration Judge's\ndecision where the Immigration Judge explicitly makes an alternate\nholding, as well as its citation to In re Rodríguez-Majano, one of\n\n                                -42-\n\f           An alien is ineligible for asylum or withholding of\n\nremoval if he or she \"ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\n\nparticipated in the persecution of an individual because of the\n\nindividual's    race,      religion,   nationality,       membership     in   a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\"              8 U.S.C. §§ 1158\n\n(b)(2)(A)(i),    1231(b)(3)(B)(i).          In   the   instant   case,   it   is\n\nundisputed that Castañeda did not order or incite the persecution\n\nof anyone.     It is also undisputed that the villagers massacred\n\nduring   the   Operation    were   killed    because    of   their   political\n\nopinion, i.e., their support of or suspected involvement with the\n\nShining Path.     Therefore, the only issue is whether Castañeda\n\n\"assisted or otherwise participated in\" the persecution of the\n\nvillagers.\n\n           Castañeda's main argument is that he could not have\n\n\"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution because the\n\n\nthe BIA's seminal opinions on the issue of whether an alien\nassisted or participated in persecution, leaves us with no doubt\nthe BIA was making an alternate holding. This alternate holding\nwas that, even if Castañeda were credible, his actions constituted\nassistance or participation in persecution.     Further, although\nbrief, the BIA's reasoning is crystal clear: it believed that the\nact of blocking a path during the Operation had the objective\neffect of assisting in the massacre by helping to confine the\nvillagers. Given these considerations, we are convinced that this\nalternate holding is ripe for review. See Xu v. Gonzáles, 424 F.3d\n45, 49 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that \"[w]hen considering . . . the\nclarity of an administrative decision . . ., we are not blind to\nthe context in which the decision is made or oblivious of the\nrecord on which it is based\"). The fact that the BIA has already\ndecided the issue also takes this case outside of the dissent's\narguments about the ordinary remand rule, which we have already\naddressed above.\n\n                                    -43-\n\fmassacre took place without his control and awareness, and because\n\nhe had no connection to the massacre beyond being a member of the\n\nmilitary at the time it occurred.33    The government, following the\n\nreasoning of the BIA, argues that Castañeda's actions in blocking\n\nan escape path furthered the massacre and therefore demands a\n\nfinding that he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution.\n\nAfter careful review of the record and various cases interpreting\n\nthe phrase \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" the persecution\n\nof others, we are compelled to reverse the BIA's decision in this\n\nrespect.\n\n           We begin our discussion by looking to the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. 490 (1981).34   In\n\nFedorenko, the Court interpreted a provision of the Displaced\n\n\n33\n    Castañeda also briefly argues that his actions were directed\ntoward the defense of the government, and therefore any harm that\nresulted from such behavior would not amount to persecution. See\nIn re Rodríguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811, 815 (BIA 1988)\n(stating that \"harm which may result incidentally from behavior\ndirected at . . . the defense of [a] government against an\nopponent\" does not amount to persecution.). However, the massacre\nof the villagers during the Operation went well beyond that which\nwas incidental to the defense of the Peruvian government. See,\ne.g., Miranda Alvarado v. Gonzáles, No. 03-70165, 2006 WL 1512077,\nat *14 (9th Cir. June 2, 2006) (stating that \"torturing individuals\nselected for their affiliation with an opposition group is not\ninherent in armed conflict, any more than is 'ethnic cleansing'\").\nTherefore, if Castañeda assisted or otherwise participated in the\nmassacre, he should be barred as a persecutor.\n34\n   This is the course taken by most of the circuit courts that have\nconsidered issues similar to the one before us today. See, e.g.,\nMiranda Alvarado, 2006 WL 1512077, at *8-9; Xie v. INS, 434 F.3d\n136, 140-42 (2d Cir. 2006); Hernández v. Reno, 258 F.3d 806, 812-13\n(8th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                -44-\n\fPersons Act of 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-774, 62 Stat. 1009 (\"DPA\"),\n\nwhich     excluded    from     the    definition      of     \"displaced   persons\"\n\nindividuals    who     had     \"assisted    the      enemy    in   persecution      of\n\ncivil[ians]' or had 'voluntarily assisted the enemy forces . . . in\n\ntheir operations . . .\"              Fedorenko, 449 U.S. at 495 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\n\n            Fedorenko     was    admitted      to    the     United   States   as    a\n\ndisplaced person following World War II after stating in his\n\napplication that he had been a farmer in Poland from 1937 until\n\nMarch 1942, then had been deported to Germany and forced to work in\n\na factory until the end of the war.                 In reality, Fedorenko was a\n\nRussian soldier who had been captured by the German army and forced\n\nto serve as a guard at the Nazi concentration camp in Treblinka,\n\nPoland,    where     several    hundred    thousand     Jewish     civilians     were\n\nmurdered.    When the falsehoods on his application were discovered,\n\nthe government filed an action to have Fedorenko's citizenship\n\nrevoked. At the resulting trial, Fedorenko admitted to his service\n\nat Treblinka and admitted that he knew that thousands of Jewish\n\ncivilians were being murdered there, but claimed that his service\n\nas a guard was involuntary and that he did not have any personal\n\ninvolvement in the atrocities committed.                Fedorenko also admitted\n\nthat he had \"shot in the general direction of escaping inmates\"\n\nduring a prison uprising, id. at 500, \"that the Russian armed\n\nguards significantly outnumbered the German soldiers at the camp,\n\n\n                                        -45-\n\fthat he was paid a stipend and received a good service stripe from\n\nthe Germans, and that he was allowed to leave the camp regularly\n\nbut never tried to escape.\"     Id.\n\n          The Court found that Fedorenko had assisted in the\n\npersecution   of   civilians.    In   doing   so,   the   Court   rejected\n\nFedorenko's argument that he did not assist in any persecution\n\nbecause his actions were involuntary.          It noted that the DPA\n\nincorporated the definition of \"displaced person\" contained in the\n\nConstitution of the International Refugee Organization of the\n\nUnited Nations (\"IRO Constitution\").          Id. at 496 n.3.        While\n\nsection 2(a) of the IRO Constitution provided that persons who\n\n\"assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations\" were excluded\n\nfrom the definition of \"displaced persons,\" section 2(b) of the IRO\n\nConstitution excluded only those persons who \"voluntarily assisted\n\nthe enemy forces . . . in their operations.\"        Id. at 496 n.4.    The\n\nCourt found that \"[u]nder traditional principles of statutory\n\nconstruction, the deliberate omission of the word 'voluntary' from\n\n§ 2(a) compels the conclusion that the statute made all those who\n\nassisted in the persecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\"\n\nId. at 512 (emphasis in original).\n\n          After rejecting Fedorenko's involuntariness defense, the\n\nCourt found that his actions constituted assistance in persecution.\n\nIn an oft-cited footnote, the Court described a continuum of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\fconduct along which an individual's actions should be considered in\n\ndetermining whether he or she assisted in persecution:\n\n          Thus, an individual who did no more than cut\n          the hair of female inmates before they were\n          executed cannot be found to have assisted in\n          the persecution of civilians.    On the other\n          hand, there can be no question that a guard\n          who was issued a uniform and armed with a\n          rifle and a pistol, who was paid a stipend and\n          was   regularly    allowed   to    leave   the\n          concentration camp to visit a nearby village,\n          and who admitted to shooting at escaping\n          inmates on orders from the commandant of the\n          camp, fits within the statutory language about\n          persons who assisted in the persecution of\n          civilians. Other cases may present more\n          difficult line-drawing problems but we need\n          decide only this case.\n\nId. at 512 n.34.\n\n          In   cases    involving   \"more   difficult   line-drawing\n\nproblems,\" courts have relied on Fedorenko's \"continuum of conduct\"\n\nfootnote and BIA precedent to determine whether an alien \"assisted\n\nor otherwise participated in\" persecution.     Following Fedorenko,\n\nthe BIA has held that\n\n          The participation or assistance of an alien in\n          persecution need not be of his own volition to\n          bar him from relief. However, mere membership\n          in an organization, even one which engages in\n          persecution, is not sufficient to bar one from\n          relief, but only if one's action or inaction\n          furthers that persecution in some way. It is\n          the objective effect of an alien's actions\n          which is controlling.\n\nRodríguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 814-15; see also Miranda\n\nAlvarado v.

See Miranda Alvarado, 2006 WL 1512077, at *9;                           Xie v.\n\nINS, 434 F.3d 136, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2006) (stating that the court\n\n\"focused on the nature of [the alien's] conduct as a whole\"); In Re\n\nA-H-, 23 I. & N.

Some courts have also considered the\n\nrepetitive nature of the alien's actions.      See, e.g., Miranda\n\nAlvarado, 2006 WL 1512077, at *11; Singh, 417 F.3d at 740 (in\n\ndiscounting petitioner's \"protestations of case-specific ignorance\"\n\nof persecutory acts, noting \"the repetition of [petitioner's]\n\nconduct over an extended period\").35\n\n\n35\n   We note that the courts have been in less agreement regarding\nthe subjective aspects of an alien's actions. In Fedorenko, the\nSupreme Court held that, in the context of the DPA, the\nvoluntariness of an alien's actions was irrelevant. 449 U.S. at\n512-13.

See Xie, 434 F.3d at 141-42 (stating that \"we find it\nunlikely that the phrase 'assisted in persecution' implicitly\nincludes a voluntariness requirement\" in the INA but not the DPA\nand noting that, in prior cases, the court had \"deemed irrelevant\n[the alien's] personal motivation or intent\"); Singh, 417 F.3d at\n740 (stating that an alien's personal motivation for his or her\nactions is irrelevant); Bah v.

Dec. at 815 (\"It is\nthe objective effect of an alien's actions which is controlling.\").\nOther courts appear to be more willing to look into the alien's\nintent. See Miranda Alvarado, 2006 WL 1512077, at *10 (stating\nthat a court should evaluate an alien's \"purposeful assistance\");\n\n                               -49-\n\f             Turning now to Castañeda's particular case, we conclude\n\nthat substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determination\n\nthat   he   \"assisted     or   otherwise       participated    in\"   persecution.\n\nTaking Castañeda's testimony as true, we are presented with the\n\nfollowing set of facts: (1) the uncontradicted evidence is that the\n\npurpose     of   the   Operation    was    directed    at     the    Shining   Path\n\nguerrillas in the village, not civilians;36 (2) Castañeda and his\n\nmen were hidden in the jungle three to five miles from the village\n\nand about thirty meters from the path they were guarding; (3)\n\nduring the time they were there, they did not see or hear anyone,\n\nnor did they fire any shots; (4) they never entered the village and\n\nnever directly or indirectly participated in the killings of the\n\nvillagers, which was carried out by a rogue patrol led by Hurtado\n\nin a previously unplanned manner; (5) Castañeda and his men lacked\n\nany control or authority over this rogue patrol; and (6) they did\n\nnot know what occurred in the village during the Operation.\n\n             Given     these   facts,   and     considering    the    totality   of\n\nrelevant conduct, we are compelled to conclude that Castañeda did\n\n\nHernández, 258 F.3d at 814 (faulting the BIA for not considering\nthe alien's testimony that his actions were involuntary and\nmotivated by fear for his own life). We need not decide that issue\ntoday because, even without considering the motivation or intent\nbehind Castañeda's actions, we do not think his actions had any\nobjective effect on the persecution of the villagers.\n36\n   We again emphasize that there is no evidence in the record to\nsupport the dissent's intimation, see footnote 3, to the effect\nthat the massacre was pre-planned or that Castañeda had prior\nknowledge that it would take place.\n\n                                        -50-\n\fnot assist or otherwise participate in the persecution of the\n\nvillagers.   First, Castañeda's personal involvement in the murder\n\nof the villagers was non-existent.         Compare Miranda Alvarado, 441\n\nF.3d at 762 (noting that petitioner, who served as an interpreter\n\nfor the Peruvian army while officer tortured suspected Shining Path\n\nmember, was personally involved in the persecution because he was\n\npresent and active during the interrogation); Singh, 417 F.3d at\n\n740   (finding   that   the   petitioner    had   assisted   or   otherwise\n\nparticipated in persecution where the petitioner \"took innocent\n\nSikhs into custody . . . and transported them to the police\n\nstation, where he knew they would be subjected to unjustified\n\nphysical abuse[,]\" and \"participated in raids on the homes of\n\ninnocent Sikh families\").       Second, Castañeda's conduct -- which\n\namounted to hiding in the jungle for several hours three to five\n\nmiles away from the scene of the massacre -- can hardly be\n\ncharacterized as \"active and ha[ving] direct consequences for the\n\nvictims\" of the persecution, Xie, 434 F.3d at 143, especially since\n\nno one ever came down the path Castañeda's patrol was watching.\n\nInstead, Castañeda's actions are better characterized as irrelevant\n\n\"to the acts of oppression and passive in nature.\"                Id.   In a\n\nsimilar vein, Castañeda's actions simply had no \"objective effect\"\n\non the persecution because Castañeda and his men never saw anyone\n\n\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\for fired any shots.37 In other words, the massacre of the villagers\n\nduring the Operation would have occurred regardless of whether\n\nCastañeda ever reached his assigned position,38 and Castañeda did\n\nnothing to facilitate the massacre in any way because his patrol\n\n\n\n\n37\n    The dissent, citing Naujalis v. INS, 240 F.3d 642 (7th Cir.\n2001), argues that our reading of the \"objective effect\" line of\ncases is erroneous. We do not agree with the holding in Naujalis.\nFurthermore, the Seventh Circuit's opinion in Singh v. Gonzáles,\n417 F.3d 736, (7th Cir. 2005), has recently clarified the holding\nin Naujalis. In Singh, the alien was a citizen of India who worked\nfor the police department in India's Pujab. The court noted that,\nin the context of Nazi guards and the DPA (which is what Naujalis\ninvolved), \"membership in the ranks of Nazi guards is sufficient to\nconstitute assistance in prohibited persecution.\" Singh, 417 F.3d\nat 739. It then went on to state that the DPA line of cases was\nnot fully compatible with the INA in general and Singh's case in\nparticular because \"[u]nlike Nazi concentration camps, whose\ncomplete existence was premised upon the persecution of innocent\ncivilians, local Punjabi police departments served traditional,\nlegitimate law enforcement purposes and did not exclusively engage\nin the persecution of innocent [people].\"      Id.  Therefore, the\ncourt stated, in Singh's case \"a distinction must be made between\ngenuine assistance in persecution and inconsequential association\nwith persecutors.\"   Id.   The court then went on to conduct an\nanalysis similar to the one we have conducted. Id. at 739-741.\n\n     In sum, the dissent's reliance on Naujalis is misplaced\nbecause Naujalis involved a special rule applicable \"exclusively\n. . . to Nazis from the period of 1933 to 1945.\" Id. at 739. Had\nNaujalis been the member of an organization which did not\nexclusively engage in persecution -- as is the case with Castañeda\nand his membership in the Peruvian army -- the Seventh Circuit's\nanalysis would have been entirely different. Given the Seventh\nCircuit's explanation of Naujalis in Singh, along with the other\ncases that have construed the relevant provisions of the INA, as\nopposed to the DPA, we are convinced that our approach is the\ncorrect one.\n38\n   As evidenced by the facts that the massacre occurred even though\none of the blocking controls never reached its position and that no\npersons came down the path Castañeda's men were watching.\n\n                               -52-\n\fnever encountered anyone.39        Cf. Miranda Alvarado, 2006 WL 1512077,\n\nat   *10   (finding   that,    without    the    petitioner's     actions,     the\n\npersecution would not have gone forward).                   Add to these facts\n\nCastañeda's lack of awareness of what was happening in the village,\n\nand we simply do not see how his actions rise to the level of\n\nculpability    necessary      to   find   that   he    assisted   or    otherwise\n\nparticipated in the persecution of the villagers.                 We therefore\n\nfind   that   substantial      evidence      does     not   support    the   BIA's\n\ndetermination in this regard.\n\nD.   The Dissent\n\n            This court has never condoned, nor will it ever condone,\n\nthe massacre of innocent civilians by the military in the course of\n\nits war-related activities.          See United States v. Zajanckauskas,\n\n441 F.3d 32 (1st Cir. 2006).          However, we also cannot tolerate a\n\nfinding that amounts to a conclusion that someone is guilty of such\n\nconduct by remote association.            The findings of the Immigration\n\nJudge and the BIA amount to just that:              a conclusion of guilt by\n\nremote association.     These findings fly against the evidence that\n\nis relevant to a determination of whether Castañeda was credible\n\n\n39\n   We find that what might have occurred had a fleeing villager\ncome down the path to be absolutely irrelevant and speculative,\nsince Castañeda was there to intercept fleeing members of the\nShining Path, not civilians. If anything, the cases make clear\nthat we are to concern ourselves only with what a petitioner\nactually did, not what he might have done. See, e.g., Rodríguez-\nMajano, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 814-15. Castañeda credibly testified --\nand this testimony is supported by the Human Rights Commission --\nthat no one came down the path.\n\n                                      -53-\n\fand to whether he was in any way responsible for the atrocities\n\ncommitted     by   a     different       Peruvian         army   unit,    operating\n\nindependently of his command, several miles away from his location,\n\nwith nothing but mountains and jungle in between.\n\n            Because the findings below -- which we have already\n\naddressed as unsupported or unsupportable -- are clothed in the\n\npresumably     impervious       mantle    of    credibility          findings,    and\n\nconsidering the assertions in the dissent that follows, it is\n\nappropriate that we conclude by re-emphasizing certain uncontested\n\nevidence which goes both to the issue of Castañeda's credibility\n\nand to the question of his responsibility for the heinous acts\n\ncommitted beyond his control or participation.\n\n            First, it is undisputed that the patrol which committed\n\nthe massacre of the villagers was several miles away and acted\n\nindependently from Castañeda, whose assigned duty was to watch a\n\ntrail to intercept Shining Path guerrillas, not civilians.                        The\n\ndissent's phrasing of the facts, that \"army units fired and threw\n\ngrenades into the houses and killed many women and children,\" and\n\nthat Castañeda \"headed one of four army units involved in the\n\nmilitary     operation    during     which     this       massacre    occurred\"   is\n\nunfortunate because it gives the impression that the military\n\noperation    was   one   that    included,     as     a   pre-planned    goal,    the\n\npremeditated killing of civilians. In fact, there is absolutely no\n\nevidence to this effect.           This unwarranted implication in the\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\fquoted portion of the dissent is re-enforced by the phrasing that\n\nfollows:   \"His patrol was assigned to and did block a possible\n\nescape route from the village, but there is no evidence that he was\n\nin the village during the massacre or that he personally killed\n\nanyone.\" This quote omits the rather important fact that Castañeda\n\nwas several miles away from the village, that there is no evidence\n\nthat he ever entered the village before, during or after the\n\nmassacre, or that anyone, civilian or otherwise, ever went down the\n\ntrail he was guarding.\n\n           Second, as we just noted, it is undisputed that nothing\n\nhappened on Castañeda's watch.         It is undisputed that no one came\n\ndown the trail -- no Shining Path guerrillas, no civilians, no one.\n\nThus, neither Castañeda nor anyone under his command engaged in any\n\naction against innocent civilians.\n\n           Third,   there   is   not    a   scintilla   of    evidence   that\n\nCastañeda was aware, either before or during the massacre, that\n\nthese acts would be committed or were being committed by others\n\nover which he had no control and were in fact not his subordinates.\n\nThe issue regarding radio communication during the Operation is\n\nsimply another red herring, for several reasons.             First, there is\n\nno affirmative evidence of any communication between Castañeda and\n\nthe other patrols during the Operation.           Second, radio silence\n\nduring operations is not an unheard of military tactic.              In any\n\nevent, the only evidence is the assertion by the only person there,\n\n\n                                  -55-\n\fCastañeda, that there was no communication between the patrols.\n\nThe conclusions to the contrary, used by the Immigration Judge and\n\nthe BIA as a basis for their credibility conclusions, are mere\n\nspeculation unsupported by evidence, especially given Castañeda's\n\nprior testimony about communication up the chain of command.\n\nThird, the issue regarding radio communication is an irrelevant\n\ndistraction from the main issue:   Castañeda's culpability for the\n\nactions of Hurtado's rogue patrol, over which it is undisputed that\n\nCastañeda lacked control or command.\n\n          Finally, Castañeda was acquitted by a Peruvian military\n\ncourt for his involvement in the Operation.      This is the same\n\nmilitary court that found the captain in charge of the rogue\n\npatrol, Hurtado, guilty of perpetrating the massacre against the\n\ncivilians.   Notwithstanding these undisputed facts, and that such\n\ntribunals are the ones that normally deal with crimes allegedly\n\ncommitted by the military in the course of military operations, the\n\nImmigration Judge and the BIA latched on to irrelevant issues to\n\ndetract from the most central, irrefutable fact:      that the only\n\nadjudicative body to pass upon this unfortunate incident placed the\n\nblame for these actions on someone other than Castañeda.40\n\n\n\n\n40\n     Other non-adjudicative bodies, such as     the   Human   Rights\nCommission, also placed the blame elsewhere.\n\n                               -56-\n\f                                   III.\n\n           Because   we   find   that   substantial    evidence   does   not\n\nsupport the BIA's determinations that Castañeda was not credible\n\nand assisted or otherwise participated in persecution, we grant the\n\npetition for review, reverse the decision of the BIA, and remand\n\nthe case so that an Immigration Judge may consider the merits of\n\nCastañeda's asylum and withholding of removal applications.\n\n           Castañeda's    asylum   request    merits   serious,   unbiased\n\nconsideration.   As we pointed out earlier in this opinion, the\n\nShining Path have been catalogued by our government as a ruthless\n\nterrorist organization. Castañeda's unchallenged testimony is that\n\nShining Path members threatened him on numerous occasions and\n\nattempted to murder him in 1986.        Furthermore, and in keeping with\n\nits record of indiscriminate violence, see, e.g., Philip Bennett,\n\nPol Pot in Perú, New Republic, January 28, 1985, at 16, Shining\n\nPath members tried to kidnap Castañeda's daughter in 1989.               The\n\ngroup also murdered Castañeda's neighbor and military colleague in\n\nfront of the man's family in 1990.         Thereafter, Castañeda sought\n\nrefuge for himself and his family from these terrorist thugs by\n\nleaving his native country.\n\n           The BIA's decision cannot be sustained on appeal.\n\n           Reversed and remanded for actions consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n                     \"Dissenting opinion follows\"\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I respectfully dissent\n\nand do so with regret.     But the majority opinion is contrary to\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court and this court, and the errors are\n\nof exceptional importance and potentially of national significance.\n\nCf. Fed. R. App. P. 35.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          I summarize my view of the case and the reasons I am\n\ncompelled to dissent before going on to a fuller explanation.\n\n          According to an investigation by a Commission of the\n\nSenate of Perú, in August 1985, some sixty-nine innocent villagers\n\nin Llocllapampa, Perú were massacred by units of the Peruvian army\n\nin its war with Shining Path guerrillas.     The village's civilian\n\ninhabitants were herded into two homes; the army units fired and\n\nthrew grenades into the houses and killed many women and children\n\nin the slaughter.       The investigation concluded the operation\n\namounted to genocide.\n\n          Lieutenant Castañeda, petitioner here, headed one of four\n\narmy units involved in the military operation during which this\n\nmassacre occurred.      It is disputed whether he knew about the\n\nmassacre before or while it took place.   His patrol was assigned to\n\nand did block a possible escape route from the village, but there\n\nis no evidence that he was in the village during the massacre or\n\nthat he personally killed anyone.      He acknowledged that he was\n\nbriefed on the operation beforehand and that all units during the\n\n\n                                -58-\n\foperation had radios capable of radio contact, but he claimed that\n\nhe had no radio contact with the units in the village that day and\n\ndid not find out about the massacre until weeks later.\n\n              Finding himself a potential target in the wake of his\n\nrole in the operation, Castañeda came with his family to the United\n\nStates on tourist visas in 1991, overstayed, and in 1993 applied\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal.        By statute, an alien is not\n\neligible for asylum and withholding of removal if the Attorney\n\nGeneral determines that \"the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or\n\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account\n\nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup,   or    political   opinion.\"      8   U.S.C.   §   1158(b)(2)(A)(i)\n\n(emphasis added); see also id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n\n              It is undisputed that the government met its burden of\n\nmaking a prima facie case that Castañeda had \"assisted or otherwise\n\nparticipated in the persecution\" and that the burden of showing he\n\nhad not done so has shifted to Castañeda.              8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13\n\n(c)(2)(ii),     1208.16(d)(2).     It   is    also   undisputed   that   the\n\npersecution was on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the\n\nstatute.\n\n              The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), the Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\"), and the initial asylum interviewing officer each\n\nfound Castañeda had not met his burden because he was not credible.\n\nHe was found not credible based both on observations of his\n\n\n                                   -59-\n\fdemeanor and on the content of his testimony.                            The law requires\n\ncourts    to    give     great   deference      to    those    lack       of   credibility\n\ndeterminations, especially those based on direct observations of\n\nthe alien's demeanor. The majority fails to accord the appropriate\n\ndeference to the BIA and, rather than determining whether the\n\nrecord could reasonably be read to support the BIA, determines\n\nwhether the record could reasonably be read to support Castañeda.41\n\nThis   is      the   wrong   perspective,        and       having    taken      the    wrong\n\nperspective, the majority reaches the wrong conclusion in holding\n\nthat substantial evidence does not support the BIA's finding that\n\nCastañeda was not credible.\n\n               Having incorrectly applied the standard of review, the\n\nmajority       further    errs    in   refusing       to    remand       to    the    BIA   to\n\nreconsider its determinations in light of the supposed failures in\n\nits reasoning and errs in concluding for itself that Castañeda was\n\ncredible.        Supreme Court precedent and the precedent of this\n\ncircuit     require      that    the   agency    be    given        an    opportunity       to\n\n\n\n41\n   Thus, for example, even if it might be true that translation\ndifficulties could explain some of the problems with Castañeda's\ntestimony -- a point not raised by Castañeda himself -- the issues\nraised by the BIA and the IJ are such that it was entirely\nreasonable to conclude otherwise.    Moreover, those who actually\nheard Castañeda's testimony are in a much better position than this\ncourt to weigh the effects of any translation difficulties.\nSimilarly, the majority's assertions that Castañeda misunderstood\nsome questions or was interrupted by the judge might be possible\nreadings of the record, but the record certainly does not compel\nsuch conclusions, and we are in a poor position to judge such\nmatters from the transcript alone.\n\n                                         -60-\n\freconsider, particularly when the BIA did not find it necessary to\n\ncomment on all of the evidence relied upon by the IJ.         The majority\n\nerrs in holding as a matter of law that Castañeda was credible and\n\nthat he had no knowledge of the massacre.         The record does not\n\ncompel either conclusion.\n\n          This sequence of errors has led the majority into yet a\n\nfurther error, one of great significance and going well beyond the\n\nparticulars of this case.    The majority takes a one-line statement\n\nby the BIA -- that Castañeda still had not met his burden even\n\nassuming he was credible that he personally had not killed or\n\nharmed anyone -- and draws two mistaken conclusions.            First, it\n\nturns this into a statement that the BIA made a holding assuming\n\nCastañeda was credible in all of his testimony, including that he\n\nhad no knowledge of the massacre.     The BIA did not say this, and if\n\nthere is any ambiguity, the case should be remanded for the BIA to\n\nclarify. Second, the majority sees in the BIA's statement a ruling\n\nof law on the relevance of Castañeda's knowledge about the massacre\n\nto the statutory exclusion for those who assist or otherwise\n\nparticipate in persecution.       The BIA's statement means no such\n\nthing.   The   issue   of   the   legal   significance   of   Castañeda's\n\nknowledge was not raised or argued before the agency in the removal\n\nproceedings, but was rather raised sua sponte by this court, which\n\nasked for and received post-argument briefing on the issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\f           Despite the position of the Attorney General that this\n\nissue of statutory interpretation is not before this court, was not\n\nraised or exhausted before the agency, and is committed in the\n\nfirst instance to the BIA, the majority nonetheless addresses the\n\nissue   itself,   contrary   to   both   the   exhaustion   and   Chevron\n\ndoctrines.   The majority's conclusion as a matter of law that\n\nCastañeda has met his burden of proving he was not a persecutor\n\ndepends on the majority's implicitly deciding that knowledge is a\n\nrequirement under the statute (contrary to the position stated by\n\nthe Attorney General in his brief) and then on the majority's\n\napplying this newly formulated legal rule to its version of the\n\nfacts of this case.    The majority refuses to permit the agency to\n\nexamine on remand the questions both of statutory interpretation\n\nand then of application of the legal standard to the facts.           The\n\nmajority concludes that Castañeda has established that he did not\n\nassist or otherwise participate in the persecution and remands to\n\nthe agency to consider only the question of whether he should be\n\ngranted asylum.\n\n           The majority is wrong on all of these points and has\n\noverstepped the limited role assigned to the courts in reviewing\n\ndecisions of the BIA in immigration cases.        The proper outcome of\n\nthis case is a simple affirmance of the BIA's decision on the\n\ngrounds that the decision is based on substantial evidence that\n\nCastañeda has not met his burden and the record does not compel any\n\n\n                                  -62-\n\fother finding.        There is no need to reach the other issues the\n\nmajority reaches.        More than that, courts are forbidden from\n\ndenying the BIA the opportunity to interpret what the statute\n\nmeans.   Accordingly, I dissent.          I also attach to this dissent the\n\ndecision of the BIA in this case, so it may be read directly.\n\n                                         II.\n\nA.          Standard of Review\n\n            We are required to give deferential review to the BIA's\n\nfindings.      \"[A]    decision    that    an   alien    is   not   eligible   for\n\nadmission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly\n\ncontrary to law.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(C).             As to the BIA's\n\nsubsidiary factual findings, including credibility determinations,\n\nwe apply the highly deferential substantial evidence standard.\n\nDhima v. Gonzáles, 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005).                   Under this\n\nstandard, \"[t]he [BIA's] determination must stand 'unless any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary,'\" id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)), meaning we can\n\noverrule the BIA's findings only if the evidence \"points unerringly\n\nin the opposite direction.\"         Laurent v.

Facts of Record\n\n             As I believe the majority's discussion is materially\n\nincomplete, I independently recount the facts as contained in the\n\nadministrative record.42       See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A).\n\n             Castañeda joined the Peruvian military in 1978. In 1983,\n\nhe graduated from a military academy and was commissioned as a\n\nlieutenant.    In January 1985, Lieutenant Castañeda was transferred\n\nto anti-terrorist Battalion 34, stationed in Ayacucho, a province\n\nwithin the \"emergency zone\" and the historic birthplace of the\n\nShining Path.     This battalion, composed of five companies spread\n\nthroughout the region, engaged in field operations.            Castañeda was\n\nfirst assigned to be head of a twenty-man patrol in Sacchaeamba,\n\nwhich had two patrols.\n\n             After three months, Castañeda transferred to another\n\nbase,   in   Vilcashuan,   again   as   head   of   one   of   two   patrols.\n\n\n\n42\n    The majority objects to my account of the facts as unduly\nrecounting \"the actions of persons for whom Castañeda was not\nresponsible and who were without his command or authority.\" I am\nmerely recounting, however, the persecution that Castañeda is\nsupposed to have assisted or participated in. The evidence of such\npersecution was properly before the IJ and BIA. The majority also\nappears to complain that the extent of the persecution is\nirrelevant and should be ignored. There is no rule that the BIA\ncannot weigh the extent of persecution. Again, that is a decision\nfor the BIA.\n\n                                    -64-\n\fCastañeda was one of only a few officers at this base; besides\n\nhimself, there was a captain and a base head.        Castañeda was\n\nstationed there in August of 1985.\n\n          In August 1985, Castañeda was involved in a military\n\noperation, the details of which are at the center of this case.\n\nThe operation involved four patrols.     Two of the patrols, led by\n\nSub-Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado and Lieutenant Riveri Rondón, were to\n\nenter the village of Llocllapampa, in the Accomarca region, to\n\nsearch for Shining Path members.       Two other patrols, including\n\nCastañeda's, were assigned to block escape routes from the village.\n\n          The two main patrols entered the village and massacred as\n\nmany as sixty-nine civilians.    The massacre was reported by the\n\nmedia, and a formal investigation followed.      A Peruvian Senate\n\nHuman Rights Commission found that Hurtado's patrol had herded the\n\nvillage inhabitants into two houses, open fired on them, lobbed\n\ngrenades inside, and set fire to the houses.         The Commission\n\nconcluded that the operation amounted to genocide and found that\n\n\"[j]udging by the age of the people and the way they responded[,]\n\nit was clear that the people attacked and killed were defenseless.\"\n\n          The Commission noted that Castañeda's patrol was \"not\n\ninvolved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"     But it\n\nalso found that the massacre could not simply be attributed to a\n\nsingle out-of-control officer; instead it wrote that Hurtado \"is\n\nonly a piece of a larger picture and it is necessary to study\n\n\n                                -65-\n\fwhether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders.\"43          The\n\nCommission left it to the Peruvian court system \"to determine\n\n. . . the people responsible . . . and apply punishments as\n\ndictated by the law.\"\n\n          The    massacre   was   documented   in   the   U.S.   State\n\nDepartment's 1985 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Perú.\n\nThe report stated that \"an Army sub-lieutenant and three other\n\nofficers were responsible for the Accomarca massacre of some 25 to\n\n69 peasants.\"    Castañeda admitted during testimony before the IJ\n\nthat he was one of the officers referred to in the report.         The\n\nreport also said the men involved had been charged in the military\n\nand civilian court systems in Perú.\n\n          The Peruvian Supreme Court decided the military courts,\n\nrather than the civilian courts, had jurisdiction, and Castañeda,\n\nalong with Hurtado and others, was charged in a military court\n\nmartial in 1986.   Castañeda was charged with homicide and abuse of\n\nauthority.44    Castañeda appeared in a military court on at least\n\nfour occasions, represented by a civilian lawyer, and produced\n\ndocuments in his defense.    He also testified in his own defense,\n\n\n43\n    The majority notes that any such orders must have come from\nthose with a higher rank than Hurtado, rather than from Castañeda.\nThe point, however, is that the BIA could consider that if Hurtado\nwas acting on orders, rather than in the heat of the moment, it is\nmuch more likely that Castañeda would have known about the massacre\nbefore it happened.\n44\n    It is unclear whether he also was charged with first degree\nmurder.\n\n                                  -66-\n\fanswering questions from a judge and prosecutor.          Castañeda was\n\napparently acquitted of all charges at the court martial.             He\n\nreturned to duty thereafter and was eventually promoted to captain\n\nin 1991.\n\n            Castañeda's application for asylum and other relief was\n\nbased on his assertion that after the massacre, he was persecuted\n\nby the Shining Path.45      Castañeda decided to leave Perú.           He\n\nobtained tourist visas for himself and his family, resigned from\n\nthe military, and came to the United States in 1991.\n\n            In January 1993, he and his family applied for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.      The claims for relief were initially\n\ndenied by an agency hearing officer, who found, in a May 19, 1999\n\nreport explaining the denial, that Castañeda was ineligible for\n\nasylum because his testimony was \"only partially credible.\"           The\n\nreport stated that Castañeda's testimony about his duties as a\n\nmilitary officer was \"vague and evasive,\" and that Castañeda's\n\ntestimony   regarding   military   practices   was   \"inconsistent   with\n\ncountry condition information.\" Castañeda had \"denied awareness of\n\nany harm that occurred to captives,\" testified that suspected\n\nterrorists were turned over to a military intelligence unit, and\n\n\"testified not to have any knowledge of any harm that may have\n\n\n\n45\n    The IJ and BIA never reached the issue of whether Castañeda\ncould meet the standards for asylum or withholding of removal. See\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1), 1231(b)(3)(A). Because the BIA did not\nreach the issue, I do not address it either.\n\n                                   -67-\n\foccurred to such persons.\"       The report found it unlikely that a\n\nPeruvian military officer of Castañeda's era would have had \"such\n\nlimited knowledge of the treatment of suspected terrorist[s].\"\n\nCastañeda's     case   was   subsequently    referred   to    an    IJ   for\n\nadjudication.     The hearing officer's report was in the record\n\nbefore the IJ and BIA.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           The hearings before the IJ focused on whether Castañeda\n\nwas ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he\n\n\"ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the\n\npersecution\" of others on account of \"race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n\n           Under the applicable regulations, if evidence is produced\n\n\"indicat[ing]\" that an alien engaged in such behavior, the alien\n\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she did\n\nnot do so.    8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c)(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2).          The IJ\n\nfound, and Castañeda does not dispute, that the government produced\n\nevidence     indicating   that   Castañeda   \"assisted,      or    otherwise\n\nparticipated\" in the Accomarca massacre.          It is, as a result,\n\nundisputed that the burden lay with Castañeda to show that he did\n\nnot do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -68-\n\fA.        Hearing Before the IJ\n\n          Castañeda put on two types of evidence during an extended\n\nhearing before the IJ: his testimony about the events in question\n\nand a document purporting to be a judgment from a military tribunal\n\nacquitting him of certain charges.\n\n          Castañeda   testified    extensively   about   his   military\n\nexperiences both before and during August 1985.     He testified that\n\nat both bases at which he was stationed in 1985, he headed one of\n\ntwo patrols.   While one patrol was out on operations, the other\n\nstayed to protect the base.    Castañeda indicated that his patrol\n\nwent out on both combat and reconnaissance missions. The commander\n\nof the battalion was the person who determined the instructions the\n\npatrols were given.\n\n          Sometimes the patrols were coordinated; sometimes they\n\nwere independent.   Castañeda testified that when the patrols were\n\nindependent, the commander still let each patrol know where the\n\nothers were.   It was, he said, \"very important to coordinate the\n\nmovement.\"   Castañeda said his patrol would \"keep contact with the\n\nbase by radio,\" and at least sometimes would make direct radio\n\ncontact with other patrols in the area.\n\n          Castañeda testified that in August 1985, after several\n\nweeks of reconnaissance patrolling, he was ordered to go on a\n\ncombat patrol in mobilized, coordinated activity with three other\n\npatrols. His order came from the base captain, following orders of\n\n\n                                  -69-\n\fthe division command.    Castañeda indicated that he was briefed in\n\nadvance on the missions of the other three patrols involved in the\n\noperation.   He was informed that there were forty to sixty Shining\n\nPath terrorists at a training center in the village.      His patrol\n\nwas ordered to deploy itself to a place where it could block the\n\npath providing an escape route from the village.      His deployment\n\nposition was, according to Castañeda, located three to five miles\n\nfrom the village.   A second patrol was supposed to block the other\n\nexit to the village, but it never arrived at its position.    The two\n\nremaining patrols were the active patrols whose mission was to go\n\ninto the village.\n\n            Castañeda's patrol had twenty men, a radio, and a rocket\n\nlauncher.    He said it took approximately six hours to reach the\n\ndeployment position.    Once there, he testified, he and his troops\n\nhid themselves along the sides of the path.         When he was in\n\nposition, he radioed that fact back to the head of the base.      He\n\nsaid he would have been in charge of deciding whether to open fire\n\nif anyone came along.\n\n            Castañeda testified that he knew there would be an attack\n\non the village, but was not told when the two lead patrols were\n\nready to attack or when the attack began.   He says he was told, via\n\nradio contact from the base, only when the attack was over.   During\n\nthe operation, he testified, no one came down the path and his\n\n\n\n\n                                 -70-\n\fpatrol fired no shots.           Other evidence in the record suggests the\n\nattack went on for two to three hours.\n\n               Castañeda denied hearing any radio communications from\n\nthe attacking patrols during the mission.             At first, when asked if\n\nhe had been \"informed what frequencies the two attacking patrols\n\nwould     be    using,\"   he     replied,   \"That's    correct.\"46      Shortly\n\nthereafter, however, he said he did not have the frequencies of the\n\nother patrols because he had not been given them.                    When asked\n\nwhether the two attacking patrols had his patrol's radio frequency\n\nso that they could notify him of any escaping guerrillas, he said\n\nthey did not.       He maintained that each patrol could contact the\n\nbase by radio, and the two attacking patrols could communicate with\n\neach other, but the attacking patrols, by contrast, could not\n\ncommunicate with the patrols blocking the escape routes. Castañeda\n\nwas asked to reconcile this testimony about the lack of radio\n\ncontact among all the patrols, particularly in a mission where\n\nmultiple patrols were trying to coordinate an attack, with his\n\nearlier    testimony      that    communication   among   patrols     could   be\n\nimportant. He responded that the attack had been centrally planned\n\n\n\n\n46\n   The majority claims that the remainder of Castañeda's response\nmakes \"clear that Castañeda misunderstood the question.\" This is\nfar from clear.     An equally plausible interpretation of the\nlanguage quoted by the majority is that Castañeda testified that\nwhile he had the frequencies, he did not need to use them. Between\ntwo reasonable interpretations, we must defer to the one adopted by\nthe IJ and BIA.\n\n                                       -71-\n\fthat way and that he was simply ordered to exercise his independent\n\njudgment in controlling exit points.\n\n                After the attack ended, Castañeda was ordered back to\n\nbase by his base commander.                He acknowledged that there was a\n\ndebriefing.         He testified that he did not find out about the\n\nmassacre until weeks later, when he heard a report on civilian\n\nradio.     He said he later found out that Hurtado had admitted to\n\nexecuting civilians.\n\n                As to the subsequent court martial, Castañeda stated that\n\nhe   was    acquitted       of    all    charges,       and    produced       a    document\n\npurportedly showing that the Supreme Council of Military Justice\n\nhad affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him.                                   The\n\ndocument,       dated    April    4,    1989,   stated        in   relevant       part   that\n\nCastañeda was charged with homicide and abuse of authority and that\n\nthe charges were dismissed.              It gave no reason for the dismissal.\n\n                Castañeda submitted no other documentation relating to\n\nthe court martial.           He did not introduce into his immigration\n\nproceedings a transcript of the military court proceedings or the\n\ndocuments he had used in his defense.                  He also offered no evidence\n\nas to what the elements of the charged crimes were, and therefore\n\ndid little to prove the significance of the purported acquittal in\n\ndetermining       whether    he    assisted       or    otherwise     participated         in\n\npersecution.        However, the U.S. State Department's 1999 Country\n\nReport     on    Human    Rights       Practices       for    Perú   does     corroborate\n\n\n                                           -72-\n\fCastañeda's     ultimate   acquittal,         stating   that   \"all    the    other\n\ndefendants\" besides Hurtado were \"acquitted.\"\n\nB.          The IJ's Decision\n\n            The IJ heard testimony from Castañeda in four separate\n\nsessions over the course of more than a month.47                 On October 4,\n\n2004, the IJ concluded that Castañeda was ineligible for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal because he had not proven that he did not\n\n\"assist[] or otherwise participate[]\" in politically motivated\n\nkillings.     8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i); id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n\nThe IJ had three grounds for this conclusion.                First, he rejected\n\nCastañeda's argument that the one-page Peruvian document dismissing\n\nthe   charges   against    him   was   sufficient       to   carry    his   burden.\n\nSecond, he held that Castañeda was not credible and had not carried\n\nhis burden for that reason.        Third, the IJ held that even setting\n\naside his credibility determination, Castañeda's \"motivation and\n\nintent [were] irrelevant,\" given that the \"objective effect of\n\n[his] participation in the Accomarca operation would have been to\n\n. . . aid even in some small measure with the execution and murder\n\nand rape of those unarmed men, women, and children.\"\n\n            The IJ offered numerous grounds for the finding that\n\nCastañeda's testimony was not credible.             First, the IJ wrote that\n\n\n\n47\n   Castañeda also testified several times in 2001 and 2002 before\nanother IJ. After the case was reassigned, the second IJ agreed to\nre-hear Castañeda's testimony at the request of Castañeda's\ncounsel.\n\n                                       -73-\n\fhe had \"carefully observed [Castañeda's] demeanor . . . and found\n\nhim to be vague, evasive, and non-responsive during questioning by\n\nthe Government prosecutor relating to his participation in the\n\nmassacre at Accomarca and more importantly whether he was aware of\n\nthat massacre.\"   The IJ also found that Castañeda was evasive and\n\nnon-responsive when asked why he did not have documentation from\n\nhis court martial. The IJ further found that Castañeda's testimony\n\nthat he did not have the radio frequencies for the other patrols\n\nthe day of the massacre was \"wholly incredible,\" in part because he\n\nhad earlier testified that radio contact among patrols could be\n\nimportant and in part because his demeanor indicated a lack of\n\nveracity.   As to this demeanor finding, the IJ wrote that he\n\n\"observed [Castañeda's] demeanor during this part of his testimony\n\nand found him to be extremely incredible. . . . [Castañeda was]\n\nblinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate as compared with the\n\nrest of his testimony.\"   The IJ also found incredible Castañeda's\n\ntestimony that he did not find out about the massacre until weeks\n\nlater, and then only from the media, especially considering his\n\nrank and his presence at briefings and debriefings.   Finally, the\n\nIJ found incredible both Castañeda's testimony about his awareness\n\nof human rights violations in the emergency zone and his testimony\n\nabout his knowledge of Hurtado's fate.\n\n\n\n\n                               -74-\n\fC.             The BIA Decision\n\n               On appeal to the BIA, Castañeda first argued that the IJ\n\nshould have deferred to the Peruvian tribunal's dismissal of the\n\ncharges against him; he argued that the IJ's finding -- that\n\nCastañeda failed to prove he had not assisted in persecution -- was\n\n\"in direct contravention\" of the military court's judgment.\n\n               The BIA responded on several levels. First, it held that\n\nthe IJ was correct about potential flaws in Castañeda's documentary\n\nevidence: there was some doubt about whether the acquittal document\n\nwas properly authenticated, and further, other documents suggested\n\nthat the military tribunal may have been a mechanism \"to grant\n\nimpunity to the alleged persecutors.\"\n\n               Second, the BIA held as a matter of law that dismissal of\n\nthe       charges   in   the   military     tribunal    did    not   establish   that\n\nCastañeda was not a persecutor.                The government had argued that\n\n\"fail[ure] to meet the burden of proof in a criminal forum never\n\n.     .    .   proves       that    the   defendant     was    factually   innocent\n\n[and] . . . [t]he legal presumption of innocence at a criminal\n\nproceeding cannot be substituted for independent facts which could\n\nhave established [Castañeda's] burden of proof.\"                      Moreover, the\n\ngovernment had noted that \"[t]here are many possible scenarios at\n\na    criminal       trial    that   could    conclude    the   proceedings   in    an\n\nacquittal without a determination of innocence.\"                      Agreeing with\n\nthese arguments, the BIA concluded that Castañeda's \"evidence of\n\n\n                                            -75-\n\fhis dismissal is not necessarily the legal equivalent of a criminal\n\nfinding that he was innocent.\"         It was Castañeda's burden to prove\n\nhe did not assist or otherwise participate in the massacre; the\n\nmilitary court document, which did not specify the reason for\n\ndismissal of the charges or offer any details on the charges\n\nthemselves, did not establish that he had not assisted or otherwise\n\nparticipated.\n\n              In concluding that Castañeda had failed to meet his\n\nburden   of    proof,   the   BIA   held   that   \"even   if   the    respondent\n\ntestified credibly that he did not harm or execute anyone on\n\nAugust 8, 1985, there is substantial evidence to support the\n\nImmigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the\n\npersecution of others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as his\n\npatrol was charged with blocking an escape route for the villagers\n\n. . . .\"\n\n              The BIA also affirmed on the separate basis that the IJ\n\nhad not clearly erred in finding Castañeda less than credible. The\n\nBIA specifically referenced the IJ's finding that Castañeda's\n\ndemeanor during a line of significant questioning indicated a lack\n\nof veracity, and affirmed the finding that Castañeda was \"evasive\"\n\nregarding     his   court   martial.       It   also   said   that   Castañeda's\n\nargument on appeal that he did not have access to a transcript or\n\nother documents from the court martial \"does not seem plausible,\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -76-\n\fand   that    Castañeda   did   not   \"provide   any   explanation    for   not\n\nproviding [such documents].\"\n\n              The BIA also affirmed the IJ's conclusion that crucial\n\nportions of Castañeda's testimony were inconsistent and incredible\n\nand reached the same conclusion on its own review.             The BIA found\n\nthat the IJ had not erred in doubting the veracity of Castañeda's\n\ntestimony that he had not been in radio contact with the other\n\npatrols the day of the killings (and thus had not been aware of the\n\nunfolding massacre), particularly because Castañeda's own testimony\n\nestablished that patrols sometimes made contact and that \"radio\n\ncontact was important for purposes of coordination as well as\n\nefficiency and protection of the patrols.\"                  Further, the BIA\n\naffirmed the IJ's findings that Castañeda was not forthcoming about\n\nthe extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military and\n\nabout the fate of Hurtado, the patrol commander charged with\n\nprimary responsibility for the massacre.          It concluded: \"In light\n\nof obvious media attention and international documentation of the\n\nmassacre, as well as [Castañeda's] military position and subsequent\n\naccusations about his role, it was reasonable to expect him to\n\nprovide answers regarding what occurred in Perú on and after\n\nAugust   8,    particularly     since   he   failed    to   provide   adequate\n\ndocumentary evidence of his innocence.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -77-\n\f                                              IV.\n\nA.             The Adverse Credibility Determination\n\n               Substantial        evidence          supports     the     BIA's     adverse\n\ncredibility determination, which in itself is sufficient to support\n\nthe BIA's conclusion that Castañeda did not meet his burden.                              The\n\nIJ    and   BIA   based      their     findings      on    Castañeda's     demeanor       and\n\nevasiveness       and      on    the     tendency      for     his     testimony     to    be\n\ncontradictory and non-responsive.                   The majority errs in dismissing\n\nthis evidence and imposing its own view of the record.\n\n               In order to carry his burden, \"an alien must support his\n\nclaim . . . through credible testimony.\"                       Nikijuluw v. Gonzáles,\n\n427    F.3d    115,    121      (1st   Cir.    2005).        \"The    testimony       of   the\n\napplicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of\n\nproof without corroboration.\"                  8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a) (emphasis\n\nadded).       However,\n\n               [t]his does not mean that a reviewing court\n               must take every applicant's uncontradicted\n               testimony at face value, for testimony\n               sometimes is internally inconsistent or belied\n               by the prevailing circumstances. Furthermore,\n               a witness's demeanor is often a critical\n               factor in determining his veracity. And when\n               a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness\n               makes an adverse credibility determination and\n               supports it with specific findings, an\n               appellate court ordinarily should accord it\n               significant respect.\n\nAguilar-Solís         v.   INS,    168    F.3d      565,   570-71      (1st   Cir.    1999)\n\n(internal citation omitted).               In other words, the strong deference\n\nwe owe to BIA findings of fact under the substantial evidence\n\n                                            -78-\n\fstandard applies even more so to adverse credibility determinations\n\nbased on witness demeanor.        See Rodríguez Del Carmen v. Gonzáles,\n\n441 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Matters of witness credibility\n\nand demeanor are peculiarly for the factfinder,\" and credibility\n\ndeterminations supported with specific findings are treated \"'with\n\ngreat respect.'\" (quoting Laurent, 359 F.3d at 64)).\n\n            Here,   the     IJ    said    he    had    \"carefully       observed\n\n[Castañeda's] demeanor\" and had concluded that Castañeda was not\n\ntelling    the   truth    about   his    role   in    the   massacre.      More\n\nspecifically, the IJ had observed Castañeda's demeanor during his\n\ntestimony about radio contact and found him \"extremely incredible.\"\n\n            The IJ also found that Castañeda was \"extremely vague,\n\nevasive, and non-responsive\" when cross-examined by the government\n\nattorney about the massacre and the events following and about his\n\nlack of documentary evidence of the court martial.             The BIA found\n\nno error in any of these findings, and its decision was reasonable,\n\nas the following examples show.\n\n            During Castañeda's testimony, he appeared to contradict\n\nhimself, and failed to give direct answers, in response to a series\n\nof questions about whether he had had the other patrols' radio\n\nfrequencies on the day of the massacre.                 Castañeda initially\n\nindicated that he had had such frequencies, and then stated that he\n\nhad not.   At some point, the IJ stepped in to get a straight answer\n\nfrom an evasive witness:\n\n\n                                    -79-\n\f           IJ:      Sir, it still hasn't been answered though.\n                    Could you contact the other two patrols by\n                    radio, yes or no?\n\n           C:       No.    I did not on my radio.\n\n           IJ:      That's not what I asked.       Could           you\n                    contact them by radio, yes or no?\n\n           C:       No.    I could not.\n\n           Later in the cross-examination, Castañeda was asked what\n\nhad happened in the village the day of the massacre, and he\n\nreplied: \"One of the patrols . . . committed excesses.\"              He then\n\nclaimed that he did not know until his appearance before the IJ how\n\nmany villagers had been killed, and that such information was never\n\ndiscussed during his court martial.          Information about the number\n\nof   deaths,    however,   appears   to     have   been   widely   circulated\n\nfollowing the massacre, and such information was discussed in the\n\nreport of the Peruvian Human Rights Commission, which led to the\n\ncourt martial.48\n\n           Still later, Castañeda was confronted with a 1985 State\n\nDepartment report stating that \"an army sub-lieutenant and three\n\nother officers\" were responsible for the massacre.           The government\n\n\n48\n   The majority reads Castañeda's testimony here to have been that\nhe did not know the exact number because \"the exact number could\nnot be determined.\" As the majority notes, however, this remains\ntrue \"[t]o this day,\" and hence such a reading is not consistent\nwith Castañeda's assertion that he did not learn the exact number\nuntil the day of his hearing before the IJ.         In any event,\nregardless of whether the majority's reading is a plausible one, it\nis equally plausible, and reasonable on the part of the IJ and BIA,\nto read Castañeda's testimony as unduly attempting to minimize his\nknowledge of the massacre.\n\n                                     -80-\n\fattorney asked him whether the report was \"talking about you.\"\n\nAgain, the witness was evasive:\n\n           C:        They are talking about the patrol head of\n                     that commission.\n\n           IJ:       Sir, are they talking about you, yes or\n                     no?\n\n           C:        Yes.   They are talking about me.\n\n           There is also substantial record support for the finding\n\nthat Castañeda was evasive about his knowledge about Hurtado.49             In\n\nresponse   to    repeated   questions,     Castañeda    denied    having   any\n\npositive knowledge about whether Hurtado had been discharged from\n\nthe military.    Yet when confronted with a human rights report from\n\nthe U.S. State Department, he admitted to \"find[ing] out through\n\npublic media when [he] was here in the United States\" that Hurtado\n\nhad been promoted to captain.\n\n           These examples suffice to demonstrate a substantial basis\n\nin the record for the conclusion that Castañeda was evasive and\n\nnon-responsive, and for the BIA's refusal to believe his story.\n\n           Castañeda and the majority take issue with several of the\n\nsubsidiary   bases    for   the   BIA's    and   IJ's   adverse   credibility\n\ndeterminations.      Castañeda argues, for instance, that the BIA\n\n\n49\n   The majority's claim -- that the issue of Castañeda's knowledge\nabout Hurtado is a \"red herring\" -- is puzzling. As the majority\nitself notes, \"Castañeda's case is based on his disassociation from\nHurtado's actions.\"   The BIA and IJ were entirely justified in\npresuming that evasiveness as to Castañeda's later knowledge about\nHurtado's fate indicated a lack of credibility regarding his\nearlier knowledge about Hurtado's actions.\n\n                                    -81-\n\ferroneously disbelieved his testimony about lack of radio contact\n\nwith other patrols, and that it erroneously found him evasive\n\nregarding the extent of human rights violations committed by the\n\nPeruvian   military.        The   majority    agrees   and    adopts   similar\n\ncriticisms of the BIA.\n\n           As to the radio issue, the BIA found unlikely Castañeda's\n\ntestimony that on the day of the massacre, not only did he not have\n\nradio contact with the other patrols, but he did not even know the\n\nfrequency they were using.        The BIA relied in part on Castañeda's\n\nearlier testimony that he sometimes had had direct radio contact\n\nwith other patrols; the BIA said this testimony was \"inconsistent\"\n\nwith Castañeda's assertions about the day of the massacre.                In a\n\nsense, it was not \"inconsistent\" for Castañeda to deny radio\n\ncontact on the day of the massacre, since, as the majority notes,\n\nhe had said that he only sometimes had radio contact with other\n\npatrols.   But this criticism misses the BIA's point that this\n\noperation was a coordinated combat mission, out of the ordinary,\n\nand it was much more likely in such a circumstance that the two\n\nattacking patrols would have at least had the capability to contact\n\nCastañeda's   patrol   by    radio,    both   to   provide    Castañeda   with\n\ninformation on escaping guerrillas and to call in the assistance of\n\nCastañeda's patrol if needed.         If radio contact among patrols was\n\nat least sometimes used, this would have seemed              the time to make\n\ncontact possible.\n\n\n                                      -82-\n\f            As to the issue of human rights violations, Castañeda\n\ndid,   after   some      questioning,    admit    that    he    was   aware    of\n\nextrajudicial killings by the Peruvian army, and that members of\n\nthe armed forces had been responsible for disappearances, torture,\n\nand arbitrary detentions. But one could view the record as showing\n\nevasiveness.       The   BIA   could    reasonably   have      considered     that\n\nCastañeda's new-found relative candor as to human rights abuses\n\ncontrasted sharply with Castañeda's initial asylum interview, when\n\nhe was asked the same question and found both not candid and not\n\ncredible.    The BIA could have considered that Castañeda might have\n\nwanted to downplay the significance of his knowledge of a pattern\n\nof human rights abuses by the Peruvian military before the events\n\nin question.\n\n            The BIA's additional bases for its adverse credibility\n\ndetermination are also substantially supported.                 The BIA agreed\n\nwith the IJ that Castañeda's failure to provide more documentary\n\nevidence    from   his   court   martial      reflected   negatively    on    his\n\ncredibility because such evidence should have been available to\n\nhim.   See Estrada-Henao v. Gonzáles, 453 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (holding that lack of documentation is \"not automatically\n\nfatal\" but that \"where documentation would naturally be expected,\n\nits lack can count against the applicant\").               Castañeda was asked\n\nduring proceedings before the IJ whether there was any written\n\naccounting of the facts that would support his account of the day\n\n\n                                       -83-\n\fof the massacre.     He said he had submitted documents to the court\n\nmartial, but did not have them for the immigration proceeding.\n\nGiven the formal nature of the court martial and the fact that\n\nCastañeda was able to procure the dismissal-of-charges document and\n\nother documents from Perú, the BIA's conclusion that Castañeda's\n\ncredibility was weakened by his failure to produce additional\n\ndocumentation is supported.\n\n           The BIA also upheld the IJ's conclusion that given\n\nCastañeda's position as head of one patrol in the joint operation,\n\nhis   \"entire    testimony    regarding       how    he    found    out    about     [the\n\nmassacre] only from the media is wholly incredible.\"                            The IJ\n\nreasonably concluded that it was unlikely that information that two\n\npatrols had just killed over five dozen men, women, and children\n\nwould not find its way to the third patrol that participated in the\n\nsame operation, and particularly to the head of that patrol.                         The\n\npractice   of    debriefings    only    made        it    even    more    likely     that\n\nCastañeda would have learned about the atrocities engaged in by the\n\nother patrols before the media did.50\n\n           In short, the BIA's adverse credibility determination\n\nsurvives substantial evidence review, and that requires affirmance.\n\nThe   majority    sees   in    the     record       insufficient          evidence     of\n\nCastañeda's participation in the massacre, finding the evidence of\n\n\n\n50\n     Of course, such information need not                        have    been   \"openly\ndiscuss[ed]\" in order to have been shared.\n\n                                       -84-\n\fevasiveness and inconsistencies to be too ambiguous.           The majority\n\nforgets, however, that the burden was on Castañeda to prove he had\n\nnot assisted or otherwise participated, and that therefore the\n\nquestion is not whether there was sufficient evidence that he\n\nparticipated, but whether there was sufficient evidence that he did\n\nnot.    Since there is substantial evidence to support the BIA's\n\nfinding that Castañeda's credibility was questionable, and since\n\nCastañeda relied almost exclusively on his testimony for evidence,\n\nthe BIA's decision must be affirmed.\n\nB.           Significance of the Peruvian Court's Dismissal of Charges\n\n             Castañeda and the majority fault the BIA for failing to\n\naccord the proper weight to the Peruvian court's dismissal of the\n\ncourt martial charges against Castañeda.                They are mistaken,\n\nhowever, in arguing that the dismissal is itself sufficient to\n\ncarry his burden of proof, and indeed, the BIA was not mistaken in\n\naccording the bare dismissal very little weight.\n\n             Castañeda's main argument is that the BIA erred in\n\nconcluding that the Peruvian court martial was a whitewash and in\n\n\"disregard[ing]\" that court's dismissal of the charges against him.\n\nThe    BIA   did   not   disregard   the    Peruvian   judgment;   it   merely\n\nevaluated that evidence and found it not to be particularly helpful\n\nfor Castañeda.      The BIA also did not rest its conclusion as to the\n\ndismissal's limited significance on a finding that the court\n\nmartial was a fraud.       The BIA did say that the IJ had so concluded,\n\n\n                                     -85-\n\fand noted that \"there [was] evidence\" to support the conclusion.51\n\nThe BIA then gave two other reasons.   First, there was no evidence\n\nas to the grounds on which charges were dismissed, and a dismissal\n\nof criminal charges may not be the result of an acquittal on the\n\nmerits.     Second, dismissal of criminal charges on any grounds --\n\neven acquittal on the merits -- is not the same as a finding of\n\ninnocence on those particular charges. Given the divergent burdens\n\nof proof, the mere fact that a defendant has not been proven guilty\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt does not mean he is more likely innocent\n\nthan not.\n\n            The BIA's reasoning is entirely sound.     Furthermore,\n\nCastañeda was charged in the court martial with homicide and abuse\n\nof authority. The elements of those crimes are not the same as the\n\nstandards under immigration law to find an alien statutorily\n\nineligible for asylum.    A finding that an alien was acquitted on\n\nhomicide and abuse-of-authority charges does not establish that he\n\ndid not assist or otherwise participate in persecution.     The BIA\n\n\n\n51\n    For example, Lieutenant Hurtado, who led one of the combat\npatrols into the village, was acquitted of first-degree murder\ncharges and convicted only of abuse of authority. Even if the BIA\nhad rested its conclusion on the ground that the Peruvian\nproceeding was a fraud, we would owe deference under Chevron to\nsuch a conclusion about the significance of a foreign tribunal's\nproceedings.   See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424-25\n(1999) (applying Chevron deference and noting that \"judicial\ndeference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the\nimmigration context where officials 'exercise especially sensitive\npolitical   functions   that   implicate  questions   of   foreign\nrelations.'\" (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988))).\n\n                                -86-\n\fwas   justified   in   affording    only   limited    significance    to   the\n\ndismissal of charges against Castañeda.52\n\n           The    majority   improperly      faults    the   BIA     for   the\n\n\"unreasonable\" requirement of \"an actual finding of 'innocent.'\"\n\nBut this is not what the BIA required.        The BIA required Castañeda\n\nto provide a different showing -- that he did not assist or\n\notherwise participate in the persecution.        This requirement is not\n\nonly reasonable; it is mandated.            See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c)\n\n(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2).\n\nC.         The Majority's Failure to Remand\n\n           Even if the majority were correct in finding fault with\n\nthe BIA's credibility decision, the majority commits serious error\n\nin (a) not remanding to the BIA for further consideration, (b)\n\ndetermining itself that Castañeda is credible, and (c) finding that\n\nhis credible testimony means that, as a matter of law, he has met\n\nhis burden and the BIA may no longer consider the question of\n\nwhether   Castañeda      assisted     or   otherwise     participated      in\n\npersecution.      In addition, and for other reasons, the issue of\n\nstatutory interpretation implicit in the majority's holding should\n\nalso have been remanded, as discussed later.\n\n\n\n\n52\n   Castañeda also argues that the BIA erred when it deemed him a\npersecutor because his \"behavior was directed toward the defense of\nthe government, and harm which results from such behavior does not\nrise to the level of persecution.\"      As the majority correctly\nnotes, this argument fails.\n\n                                    -87-\n\f          When a reviewing court finds flaws in the reasoning of\n\nthe BIA as to the evidence of record, it is ordinarily required to\n\nremand to the agency for further investigation or explanation. The\n\n\"ordinary\" rule is that if a federal court reviewing an agency\n\naction finds that\n\n          the record before the agency does not support\n          the agency action, or . . . [that] the agency\n          has not considered all relevant factors, or\n          . . . the reviewing court simply cannot\n          evaluate the challenged agency action on the\n          basis of the record before it, the proper\n          course, except in rare circumstances, is to\n          remand   to   the   agency    for  additional\n          investigation or explanation.\n\nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985).\n\n          A court of appeals reviewing an agency decision \"'is not\n\ngenerally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter\n\nbeing reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an\n\ninquiry.'\"   INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16-17 (2002) (per curiam)\n\n(quoting Lorion, 470 U.S. at 744); see also R.I. Higher Educ.\n\nAssistance Auth. v. Secretary, U.S. Dept. of Educ., 929 F.2d 844,\n\n857 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"[A] reviewing court, having determined that\n\nan administrative agency did not consider all the relevant factors,\n\nshould ordinarily remand the matter to the agency rather than\n\ncompensating   for   the   agency's   oversight   by   launching   a\n\nfree-wheeling judicial inquiry into the merits.\"). \"When an agency\n\n. . . has provided insufficient explanation for its action, the\n\n\n\n\n                               -88-\n\freviewing court ordinarily should remand the case to the agency.\"\n\nSeavey v. Barnhart, 276 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           We have particularly applied this rule in immigration\n\ncases.    In Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482 (1st Cir. 1994), we\n\nheld, as does the majority here, that the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination was not supported by substantial evidence, because\n\nthe claimed inconsistencies were not supported by the record.     Id.\n\nat 491.      We then followed the \"usual practice and rule\" of\n\n\"remand[ing] for further consideration by the Board,\" even where\n\n\"the IJ's conclusions are not drawn from any perspectives offered\n\nby the unique vantage point of the factfinder, such as witness\n\ndemeanor, conflicting or confused testimony, etc., from which\n\ncredibility is typically assessed.\"      Id. at 491-92.   The majority\n\nviolates circuit law in failing to remand here.\n\n           Similarly, in Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), this court found that the BIA's conclusion was not supported\n\nby substantial evidence, in that the BIA had failed to address\n\nportions of the petitioner's evidence that would corroborate his\n\ntestimony.   Id. at 46-47.   The majority here points, for example,\n\nto \"a portion of the [State Department] report the government\n\nfailed to read at the hearing.\"    We held in Gailius that remand was\n\nthe appropriate remedy and that in general, remand is appropriate\n\n\"when a reviewing court cannot sustain the agency's decision\n\n\n\n\n                                  -89-\n\fbecause it has failed to offer legally sufficient reasons for its\n\ndecision.\"    Id. at 47.\n\n           The Supreme Court has stated that the \"ordinary remand\n\nrequirement\" has \"obvious importance in the immigration context.\"\n\nVentura, 537 U.S. at 16-17; see also Gonzáles v. Thomas, 126 S. Ct.\n\n1613, 1615 (2006) (per curiam).           This is because immigration\n\ndecisions often involve matters on which the BIA can bring its\n\nparticular expertise to bear. See Ventura, 537 U.S. at 17 (finding\n\nthat agency expertise on country conditions supported remand as a\n\nremedy).     Indeed, this court has held that the more an issue\n\nrelates to matters within an administrative agency's particular\n\nexpertise, the less willing a court should be to decide an issue\n\nitself.    See R.I. Higher Educ. Assistance Auth., 929 F.2d at 857\n\n(\"[T]he more imbricated a matter, the more cautious a reviewing\n\ncourt should be about attempting to resolve the issue itself,\n\nrather than remanding to the agency.\").\n\n           The ordinary rule applies with full force here, and even\n\nif in rare circumstances a reviewing court could eschew remand,\n\nthis is not such a case.      Even if the BIA's reasoning as to the\n\nfinding that Castañeda lacked credibility were flawed, the majority\n\nis not correct in finding that the evidence compels exactly the\n\nopposite     conclusion:   that   Castañeda   is   credible.   That   is\n\nespecially so because Castañeda bears the burden to show his\n\ncredibility.    The BIA did not find it necessary to comment on all\n\n\n                                   -90-\n\fof the reasons the IJ gave for finding Castañeda not credible --\n\nfor example, on the point that Castañeda was vague and evasive\n\nconcerning how he learned about the massacre.              The BIA must be\n\ngiven the opportunity to reconsider such evidence.             An appellate\n\ncourt should not, as the majority does, make a credibility finding,\n\nespecially in a case such as this one involving \"witness demeanor\"\n\nand \"conflicting or confused testimony.\"            Cf. Cordero-Trejo, 40\n\nF.3d at 491.     The majority cites no case in which an appellate\n\ncourt made its own credibility finding.\n\n           Moreover, there are other reasons to remand.             Although\n\nthe   majority   faults   the   BIA   for    allegedly   failing   to   accord\n\nappropriate deference to the judgment of the Peruvian military\n\ncourt, the majority apparently does not assert that this judgment\n\nalone satisfies Castañeda's burden.           The BIA must be allowed to\n\nreconsider its decision in light of the majority's ruling on the\n\nappropriate view of the foreign judgment.\n\n                                       V.\n\n           The majority further errs in holding that Castañeda met\n\nhis burden to show that he did not assist or otherwise participate\n\nin persecution.     The majority improperly reads into the BIA's\n\ndecision a holding it did not make, then improperly decides a novel\n\nissue of statutory interpretation, and finally improperly applies\n\nits newly formulated rule to the facts of this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -91-\n\f          The majority reads the BIA's opinion to have stated a\n\nholding assuming that Castañeda did not know about the massacre.\n\nNo such holding can be found.     The BIA's opinion addressed the\n\ndismissal of the court martial charges against Castañeda and the\n\ncorrectness of the credibility determination made by the IJ.   The\n\nonly sentence discussing an alternate holding states that in the\n\nBIA's opinion,\n\n          even if the respondent testified credibly that\n          he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8,\n          1985, there is substantial evidence to support\n          the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the\n          respondent did aid in the persecution of\n          others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as\n          his patrol was charged with blocking an escape\n          route for the villagers and people located in\n          the emergency zone.\n\n(emphasis added).   The majority finds that this lone sentence,\n\ntogether with its citation to a page in the IJ's opinion and to In\n\nre Rodríguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (BIA 1988), suffices to\n\nopen the door to the majority's conclusions: (a) that as a matter\n\nof law, a person without prior or contemporaneous knowledge of the\n\npersecution cannot have assisted or otherwise participated in the\n\npersecution within the meaning of the statutes at issue here by\n\nblocking an escape route for those persecuted, and (b) that because\n\nthe record purportedly compels the conclusion that Castañeda had no\n\nsuch knowledge in this case, Castañeda has met his burden to show\n\nthat he did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution.\n\n\n\n\n                                -92-\n\f            The majority is simply wrong in all of this.               First, the\n\nmajority is wrong to find in the BIA's opinion any holding that\n\ntakes into account the state of Castañeda's knowledge. The BIA did\n\nnot say that it was assuming all of Castañeda's testimony was\n\ncredible, only that even if Castañeda had not harmed or killed\n\nanyone on the day of the massacre, this did not establish that he\n\ndid not assist or otherwise participate in the massacre. The cited\n\nportion of the IJ's opinion merely supports this proposition by\n\nfinding Castañeda's \"motivation and intent\" largely irrelevant: the\n\nmajority agrees that this is the established rule.                     Rodríguez-\n\nMajano also supports this proposition by incidentally mentioning\n\nthat one can participate in persecution without directly harming\n\nanyone by having an \"objective effect.\"             Id. at 815.    Neither the\n\nIJ   nor   Rodríguez-Majano    considered     whether    knowledge        has   any\n\nbearing    on   a   finding   that    an    alien    assisted     or    otherwise\n\nparticipated in persecution.         The BIA did not consider this point\n\neither.\n\n            If there is any ambiguity as to what the BIA held, or\n\nquestions about the basis for the BIA's holding, the majority is\n\nrequired to remand to the BIA for further explanation.                 See Halo v.\n\nGonzáles, 419 F.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"The BIA offered no\n\nfurther explanation for its conclusions. Lacking such explanation,\n\nand given that the final agency decision does not rest on a\n\nlack-of-credibility determination, we are left with significant\n\n\n                                     -93-\n\fquestions about the justifications for the denial.         We therefore\n\nvacate the BIA's order and remand.\").        The majority is not free to\n\ndecide the case on grounds not addressed by the BIA.        See Gailius,\n\n147 F.3d at 44 (\"'[A] reviewing court . . . must judge the\n\npropriety of [administrative] action solely by the grounds invoked\n\nby the agency.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting SEC v. Chenery\n\nCorp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947))).\n\n            The majority attempts to obscure the fact that it is\n\ndeciding the issue, unaddressed by the BIA, of whether knowledge of\n\na massacre can be a requirement to a finding that an alien assisted\n\nor otherwise participated in that massacre.        The majority does so\n\nby   repeatedly   asserting   its    prior   improper   conclusion   that\n\nCastañeda did not know about the massacre, and then assuming this\n\nlack of knowledge as a background fact in its analysis of the\n\n\"objective effect\" of Castañeda's actions.\n\n            It may be that the majority is saying that even if\n\nCastañeda knew full well that the villagers would be massacred, he\n\nstill would not have assisted or otherwise participated in the\n\nmassacre.   If that is what the majority means, its holding is both\n\nirrational and flatly contrary to the \"objective effect\" line of\n\ncases that the majority cites.53 The majority cites no case holding\n\n\n53\n    The case most on point is Naujalis v. INS, 240 F.3d 642, 647\n(7th Cir. 2001), in which the Seventh Circuit found that a soldier\nwho guarded a railway station had assisted in the persecution\nengaged in by his battalion. The majority objects that Naujalis is\na case about Nazi guards and that Peruvian military guards, unlike\n\n                                    -94-\n\fthat those with lesser tasks -- such as blocking escape routes --\n\nshould not be barred as persecutors.54           To be clear, the calculus\n\nmight be different if Castañeda did not know about the atrocities,\n\nbut that issue is one for the BIA to address in the first instance.\n\n            The logic of the majority's opinion thus depends upon its\n\nreaching and resolving an issue of statutory interpretation, namely\n\nwhether    knowledge   is   a   factor    that    must   be    considered    in\n\ndetermining whether an alien \"assisted or otherwise participated\n\nin\" persecution within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)\n\nand 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).          The majority errs in deciding\n\nthis issue without a ruling on it by the BIA.\n\n            The principles in this case are clear.             \"We review de\n\nnovo an agency's construction of a statute that it administers,\n\nalthough    subject    to   established     principles        of    deference.\"\n\nGriffiths v. INS, 243 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2001).                 \"Under those\n\nprinciples of deference, if the intent of Congress is clear, it\n\nmust govern, but where the statute is silent or ambiguous on an\n\n\n\nNazi guards, can serve legitimate purposes. The statute makes no\nsuch distinction, and in any event, such a distinction has no\nbearing on the culpability of one who participates in an operation\ninvolving persecution.\n54\n    In only one of the many \"objective effect\" cases cited by the\nmajority did the court reverse a finding that the alien was a\npersecutor. That case is Hernández v. Reno, 258 F.3d 806 (8th Cir.\n2001), a case involving a man forcibly recruited to join a\nguerrilla movement and turning on whether the man's actions were\nsufficiently coerced. None of the \"objective effect\" cases cited\nby the majority involved aliens who might not have acted knowingly.\n\n                                   -95-\n\fissue,   the    question   for   the   court   is   whether   the   agency's\n\ninterpretation is based on a permissible construction of the\n\nstatute.\"      Id. (citing, inter alia, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43).\n\n\"Since agency officials acting in the immigration context 'exercise\n\nespecially sensitive political functions that implicate questions\n\nof foreign relations,' deference to administrative expertise is\n\nparticularly     appropriate.\"     Id.    (internal   quotations    omitted)\n\n(quoting Abudu, 485 U.S. at 110).\n\n            The BIA must be given the first opportunity to rule on\n\nquestions of statutory interpretation.         It is only through such a\n\nruling that the BIA can fulfill its role in \"'the formulation of\n\npolicy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or\n\nexplicitly, by Congress.'\"       Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 396\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974)).\n\nSuch a ruling is also necessary for the BIA to bring to bear its\n\nspecialized \"expertise in matters of foreign policy.\"           Id.\n\n            The BIA has not had this opportunity here.          The record\n\nshows that this knowingness issue of statutory interpretation was\n\nnot raised or argued before it, and was only the subject of\n\nsupplemental briefing in this court, after this court sua sponte\n\nraised the issue at oral argument.        As a result, because Castañeda\n\ndid not clearly present this issue to the BIA, we in fact lack the\n\nauthority to even consider it.         See Olujoke v. Gonzáles, 411 F.3d\n\n16, 23 (1st Cir. 2005).      Further, even if Castañeda had exhausted\n\n\n                                   -96-\n\fhis administrative remedies, he would have waived the argument by\n\nfailing to make it in his initial brief to this court.         See Cipes\n\nv. Mikasa, Inc., 439 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The majority cannot defend its decision to interpret the\n\nstatute itself as encompassing a knowledge requirement on the\n\nground that the role it assigns knowledge is required by the plain\n\nmeaning of the statute.    That argument is foreclosed by Fedorenko\n\nv. United States, 449 U.S. 490 (1981).              Fedorenko involved a\n\nsimilar provision, which precluded admission to the United States\n\nunder the Displaced Persons Act of aliens \"who had assisted the\n\nenemy in persecuting\" civilians.     Id. at 495.      Fedorenko, who said\n\nhe was a prisoner of war who had been forced to serve as a guard in\n\na Nazi concentration camp, argued the exclusion did not apply to\n\nhim because his service had been involuntary.          The Supreme Court\n\nheld that the statute did not include the term \"voluntary\" and the\n\nCourt was \"not at liberty to imply a condition\" into the statute.\n\nId.   at   513.    The   Court   commented   that    the   administrative\n\ninterpretation of the exclusion was that it applied whether or not\n\nthe assistance was voluntary and whether or not the alien had\n\nparticipated in the persecution himself.       Id. at 499.     The Court\n\nalso noted the need for strict compliance with all statutory\n\npreconditions to naturalization given that \"Congress alone has\n\n. . . constitutional authority\" in this area.               Id. at 506.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -97-\n\fFinally, the Court held that the federal courts lacked equitable\n\npower to vary the terms of the statute.                Id. at 516-18.\n\n           The plain text of the statutes at issue here contains no\n\n\"knowledge\" qualifier to a finding that an alien \"assisted or\n\notherwise participated\" in persecution.                Indeed, the majority does\n\nnot claim that the statute unambiguously contains a knowledge\n\nqualifier.      Rather, the majority effectively holds that knowledge\n\nis a factor which the BIA must consider.               Not only is such a factor\n\nnowhere to be found in the statutory text, but determining which\n\nfactors to consider in applying a statute is even more clearly the\n\nprovince   of    the    BIA.       See    Aguirre-Aguirre,    526   U.S.   at   424\n\n(faulting the Ninth Circuit for \"fail[ing] to accord the required\n\nlevel of deference\" to the BIA by requiring that it \"examin[e]\n\nadditional factors\").          Such factors are to be developed by the BIA\n\n\"'through a process of case-by-case adjudication'\", id. at 425\n\n(quoting INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 448-49 (1987)), and\n\ncannot be found in the statutory text.\n\n           Finally, the majority errs in making its own findings of\n\nfact and then in determining that these facts dictate a holding\n\nthat   Castañeda       did   not    assist       or   otherwise   participate   in\n\npersecution.      It is the BIA's role to \"determin[e] the facts and\n\ndecid[e] whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term.\"\n\nThomas, 126 S. Ct. at 1615.              The majority claims that\n\n           we are presented with the following set of\n           facts: (1) the uncontradicted evidence is that\n\n                                          -98-\n\f          the purpose of the Operation was directed at\n          the Shining Path guerillas in the village, not\n          civilians; (2) Castañeda and his men were\n          hidden in the jungle three to five miles from\n          the village and about thirty meters from the\n          path they were guarding; (3) during the time\n          they were there, they did not see or hear\n          anyone, nor did they fire any shots; (4) they\n          never entered the village and never directly\n          or indirectly participated in the killings of\n          the villagers, which was carried out by a\n          rogue patrol led by Hurtado in a previously\n          unplanned manner; (5) Castañeda and his men\n          lacked any control or authority over this\n          rogue patrol; and (6) they did not know what\n          occurred in the village during the Operation.\n\nThis is not true.   Neither the IJ nor the BIA found or assumed that\n\nCastañeda had established that there was no order allowing the\n\npatrols to harm civilians who were known to have harbored the\n\nShining Path, that Hurtado's patrol was a rogue patrol acting\n\nentirely on its own, or that Castañeda had no knowledge of the\n\nmassacre before or as it was happening.    The record does not compel\n\nany of these conclusions.     Even if the record compelled these\n\nconclusions, the BIA must be given the opportunity to apply the\n\nmajority's newly formulated rule to the facts.\n\n                                 VI.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the majority opinion has\n\nnot only erred, but it is at odds with the statutory mandate, the\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, and our own prior case law.   Asylum\n\nis not a right; it is a privilege.     See Fedorenko, 449 U.S. at 518\n\n(\"'An alien who seeks political rights as a member of this Nation\n\ncan rightfully obtain them only upon the terms and conditions\n\n                                -99-\n\fspecified by Congress.'\" (quoting United States v. Ginsberg, 243\n\nU.S. 472, 474-75 (1917))).    Congress has decided that privilege\n\ndoes not extend to those who assist or otherwise participate in\n\npersecution within the meaning of the statute, as reasonably\n\ninterpreted by the BIA.   I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               -100-\n\fADDENDUM\n\n\n\n\n -101-\n\f-102-\n\f-103-\n\f-104-\n\f",

After twelve months, Casta&#241;eda was transferred to another unit in Tumbes, a region in northern Per&#250; near the border with Ecuador. Casta&#241;eda testified that, during this time, the military was fighting the Shining Path. Most of this fighting, however, occurred in the Ayacucho region in the Andes, approximately 400 miles to the south of Tumbes. While at Tumbes, Casta&#241;eda was a platoon commander and his duties included training and instructing the men in his section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1985, Casta&#241;eda was transferred to Battalion 34, an anti-terrorist battalion. Battalion 34 was located in the Ayacucho region, which is the birthplace of the Shining Path, and was referred to as the \"emergency zone\" due to the Shining Path's presence in the region.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The battalion was divided into different bases. Each base was led by a captain or lieutenant. According to Casta&#241;eda, each base had around forty men. Casta&#241;eda's responsibilities increased in Battalion 34, as his duties included both training and leading troops out on patrols. Upon his arrival at Battalion 34, Casta&#241;eda was assigned to a base in Sacchaeamba, a rural mountainous area. Casta&#241;eda was the head of a twenty-man patrol, and went out on his first patrol one day after arriving at Sacchaeamba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that a major whose code name was Wolf instructed him on what areas to patrol. Wolf, who was not at Casta&#241;eda's base, would communicate the patrol area to the commander of the base by radio. The base commander would then relay that information to Casta&#241;eda. Casta&#241;eda testified that, at times, the patrol route was very specific, while at other times the patrol route was general and it was left up to Casta&#241;eda to decide the route. Casta&#241;eda also testified that his patrol sometimes operated independently of other patrols, while at other times his patrol's movements were coordinated with the movements of other patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that when he was on an independent patrol his base commander would inform him of other patrols' positions via radio in order to avoid overlapping. He also testified that he sometimes made direct radio contact with other patrols, and that it was important to know the location of other patrols in the area in order to coordinate movement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> When there were several patrols conducting a mission, Casta&#241;eda testified that each patrol leader responded to his base commander, who in turn responded to the battalion commander, who coordinated the mission with other base commanders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Casta&#241;eda, before going out on any patrol, he was briefed on the mission of the patrol by the base commander. He was given an order that explained the situation on the ground, the possible location of the enemy, what the patrol would be doing on the mission, what route to take, and what equipment to carry. If, while on patrol, one of his men was injured, Casta&#241;eda was instructed to radio the base so that the man could be evacuated. He also had flares in the event that radio communication was down. Casta&#241;eda testified that at times he had difficulty making radio contact due to interference caused by the dense terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were two types of patrols, combat and reconnaissance. Combat patrols engaged the enemy, while reconnaissance patrols gathered information. Most of the patrols were conducted at night in order to avoid detection by the Shining Path. Casta&#241;eda testified that if, while on a reconnaissance patrol, he received intelligence that the Shining Path was in the area, he would immediately radio the base commander for instructions on what action to take. He could not engage the enemy without approval from his commander unless the patrol was being attacked or was in some sort of danger. Casta&#241;eda testified that, during his time at Sacchaeamba, he went on approximately twenty-five patrols, most of them reconnaissance. He never had any direct contact with the Shining Path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in June or July of 1985, Casta&#241;eda, while still in Battalion 34, was transferred to a base in Vilcashuan, where he remained the head of a patrol. He testified that the procedures and missions were the same as they had been at the base in Sacchaeamba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda further testified that he was involved in a significant operation (the \"Operation\") in August 1985, about a month after he arrived at the base in Vilcashuan. The Operation involved four patrols. Two patrols, code-named Links 6 and Links 7, were to enter a village named Llocllapampa in the Accomarca zone<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> to search for Shining Path members. Links 7 was led by Sub-Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado (\"Hurtado\"), and Links 6 was led by Lieutenant Riveri Rond&#243;n (\"Rond&#243;n\"). Two other patrols were assigned to block escape routes from the village.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Casta&#241;eda led one of these blocking patrols, code-named Tiger. Casta&#241;eda could not remember the name of the leader of the other blocking patrol, code-named Wolf. According to Casta&#241;eda, he received his orders a few hours before his patrol left from his base commander, who received them from the command of the division located in the city of Humanaga. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was briefed on the mission of the other patrols before he left. He was told that there were between forty and sixty Shining Path guerrillas in the village. Casta&#241;eda's patrol took vehicles part of the way and went on foot the rest of the way. Casta&#241;eda and his men were armed with machine guns and a rocket launcher. They wore Peruvian military uniforms and also had masks on, both to avoid recognition by the Shining Path and to keep their faces warm. One of Casta&#241;eda's men had a radio to contact their base commander. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was near his radio operator during the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's patrol was the first to arrive at its destination. Once at the assigned location, which was three to five miles away from the village, Casta&#241;eda separated his men into three groups. They hid themselves about thirty meters from different sides of the path. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was the one who would have made the decision whether to open fire if anyone came down the path. He testified that he was in radio contact with his base commander, who relayed any information Casta&#241;eda provided back to the division headquarters. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was not informed when the other patrols were ready to attack and he did not know when the attack began. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was only able to communicate with his base; he did not have the frequencies for any of the other patrols and therefore could not hear any of their communications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Casta&#241;eda also stated that none of the other patrols had his frequency, although each of the two attacking patrols had the other's frequency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently, the Wolf blocking patrol got lost and never reached its assigned destination. Casta&#241;eda testified that the two other patrols, Links 6 and 7, entered the village and massacred civilians.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> A subsequent report by a Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission (\"Human Rights Commission\") found that up to sixty-nine civilians were killed, including many women and children. According to Casta&#241;eda, he did not find out about the massacre until nearly three weeks after the Operation, when he heard that Hurtado had admitted to executing civilians. He stated that he heard this news on conventional radio. He testified that he did not learn exactly how many civilians were killed because different reports contained different estimates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> According to Casta&#241;eda, he and his men stayed in their positions until his base commander told him the Operation was over and ordered him to return to base. Casta&#241;eda testified that he and his men never saw anyone come down the path and never fired any shots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Once back at base, he was debriefed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">News of the massacre was eventually reported by various media outlets and a formal investigation followed. Casta&#241;eda testified before a Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission on September 26, 1985. He was represented by a military lawyer at the hearing. The Human Rights Commission concluded that what occurred during the Operation amounted to genocide. It noted that the probable number of people killed in the massacre was sixty-nine, but that it was hard to determine the exact number because many of the bodies had been destroyed by explosions from grenades. It also noted that Casta&#241;eda's patrol, Tiger, was \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The Human Rights Commission found that Links 7, under Hurtado's command, was the group that carried out the massacre.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The massacre was also documented by the State Department's 1985 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Per&#250;. The 1985 State Department Report states that \"[a]n Army sub-lieutenant and three other officers were responsible for the Accomarca massacre of some 25 to 69 peasants. A separate investigation by the Senate Human Rights Commission supported these conclusions.\" Casta&#241;eda admitted that he was one of the officers referred to in the 1985 State Department Report. The 1985 State Department Report indicated that the men involved in the massacre were charged in the military and civilian systems, and that the Peruvian Supreme Court would decide final jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Human Rights Commission recommended that those involved be tried in civilian &#8212; as opposed to military &#8212; court. However, the Peruvian Supreme Court decided that the military courts had jurisdiction. Casta&#241;eda, along with Hurtado, Rond&#243;n, and the officer who led the missing Wolf patrol, was charged in a military court martial in March or April 1986. Casta&#241;eda was charged with first degree murder, homicide, and abuse of authority. In connection with the court martial, Casta&#241;eda appeared in a military court four or five times. He was represented by a civilian lawyer that he paid for. A judge presided over the proceedings. At the court martial, Casta&#241;eda testified in his own defense, answering questions from the judge and the prosecutor. He stated that he did not know if he had the right to examine other witnesses and did not remember if he was told that he had that right, but that no witnesses testified at any of the hearings. When asked by the government what evidence the prosecution presented against him, Casta&#241;eda stated that \"[t]hey didn't show me evidence regarding the patrol that I had.\" Casta&#241;eda's evidence included the presentation of an operation chart that specified the position of each patrol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda stated that he was found innocent of all charges. In support of this, he produced a document from the Supreme Council of Military Justice showing that the Appeals Division affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Casta&#241;eda provided no other evidence related to his court martial. However, the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Per&#250; indicates that Casta&#241;eda was in fact acquitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hurtado was the only officer convicted by the military tribunal. Casta&#241;eda testified that Hurtado was convicted of \"participating in the assassination of those village people.\" The government's attorney then asked \"[s]o [Hurtado] was convicted of murder?,\" to which Casta&#241;eda replied, \"[y]es.\" Casta&#241;eda also testified that Hurtado was incarcerated in a military prison, but that he did not know the length of Hurtado's sentence. When asked whether Hurtado was ever discharged from the military, Casta&#241;eda testified that he thought so, because that was the result required by Per&#250;'s military code, but he could not be sure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then introduced evidence &#8212; in the form of the State Department's 1995 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Per&#250; &#8212; that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty and had been promoted to captain. When asked if he had heard about this, Casta&#241;eda stated \"I did not know,\" and later testified that it would surprise him to know that Hurtado had been promoted after he was convicted and sentenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> At this point, the government introduced the 1999 State Department Report, which indicated that Hurtado had been convicted only for abuse of authority; had been promoted to captain at some point between the massacre and 1993, when he was finally sentenced; and had been released from prison under a general amnesty passed in 1995 by then President Alberto Fujimori and the Peruvian Congress. When asked if Hurtado had been convicted only for abuse of authority, Casta&#241;eda replied: \"Clearly, I don't know. What I manifested what I know is that the court found him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on the law, but maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, the abuse of authority.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that he was aware of atrocities committed by the Shining Path against police officers, soldiers, and civilians. He admitted that he was aware that, prior to August 1985, the Peruvian military had at times engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary detentions. When asked to explain, he stated that he had heard of officers who had detained terrorists or possible terrorists in an unjust manner, and had also heard of detained prisoners being executed. Casta&#241;eda testified that he had not heard about any civilians being detained or killed. According to Casta&#241;eda, some of these actions by the Peruvian military occurred in the emergency zone, but it \"was not the norm.\" At one point, the government presented Casta&#241;eda with a portion from the 1985 State Department Report, which stated that \"[t]otal deaths related to antiterrorist operations of the security forces are estimated by human rights groups as being in the thousands for 1980-85.\" Casta&#241;eda testified that the number sounded incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda also testified that the Peruvian military had a good reputation for investigating and prosecuting military members for human rights violations. In an attempt to rebut this testimony, the government introduced evidence that in 2004 the current Peruvian Prime Minister had called for the annulment of previous rulings by the military justice system \"that breach human rights, so that there can be in the future no further excuses or pretexts to avoid persecution.\" Casta&#241;eda denied having any knowledge of these developments, and stated that he did not know whether any annulment of prior rulings would affect his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court martial hearings concluded, Casta&#241;eda returned to duty. He experienced no professional problems as a result of the charges brought against him. In January 1991, he was promoted to the rank of captain. However, due to the publicity surrounding the massacre and the court martial, Casta&#241;eda's name and face had appeared in certain newspapers detailing the allegations against him. As a result, he and his family began to receive death threats and to experience other problems from the Shining Path. In April or May of 1986, Shining Path members set off explosives in front of the home of Casta&#241;eda's parents. Casta&#241;eda knew the Shining Path set off the explosives because they left pamphlets with the Shining Path's seal. In June of 1986, Shining Path members allegedly shot at Casta&#241;eda and set off an explosive device while he was waiting for public transportation near his home. On other occasions, the Shining Path left propaganda containing written threats at the homes of both Casta&#241;eda and his parents. Casta&#241;eda stated in an affidavit that he had been threatened on over twenty occasions. In 1989, Shining Path members allegedly attempted to kidnap one of Casta&#241;eda's daughters from school. Finally, in 1990, one of Casta&#241;eda's neighbors, who was also in the military and had been receiving threats from the Shining Path for several years, was murdered in his home and in front of his family by the Shining Path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his neighbor's murder, Casta&#241;eda decided to take his family and leave Per&#250;. He obtained tourist visas for himself and his family, retired from the military, and came to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 4, 2004, the Immigration Judge found that Casta&#241;eda was barred from applying for asylum and withholding of removal because he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of their political opinion. In support of this determination, the Immigration Judge first found that Casta&#241;eda was not credible. The Immigration Judge also found that, even if Casta&#241;eda were credible, he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of their political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the Immigration Judge on September 9, 2005. Writing its own opinion, the BIA affirmed the adverse credibility finding and stated that, even if Casta&#241;eda were credible, he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others. Casta&#241;eda has timely appealed to this court. He argues that the BIA's adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> that the BIA erred in disregarding the decision by the Supreme Council of Military Justice purporting to affirm the dismissal of charges against him, and that the BIA erred in finding that he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of their political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Credibility Determination</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The BIA's Findings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA gave five different reasons for its affirmation of the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determination: (1) that the military tribunals appeared to be fraudulent and Casta&#241;eda failed to submit documentary evidence of the proceedings beyond the document that showed his acquittal; (2) that Casta&#241;eda gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether or not he was in radio contact with the other patrols during the Operation; (3) that Casta&#241;eda's demeanor during questioning on radio communications indicated a lack of veracity; (4) that Casta&#241;eda was evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military; and (5) that Casta&#241;eda was not forthcoming about what happened to Hurtado. Having carefully reviewed these reasons, along with the record, we believe that the adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. We address each reason in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA first faulted Casta&#241;eda for not providing documentary evidence of what happened at his military court martial other than the document &#8212; which the BIA found was not properly authenticated &#8212; from the Clerk's Office of the Supreme Council of Military Justice showing that the Appeals Division had affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him. The BIA also stated that there was \"evidence that the military tribunal was a way in which to grant impunity to the alleged persecutors who took part\" in the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the document from the Clerk's Office of the Supreme Council of Military Justice is not the only evidence supporting a finding that Casta&#241;eda was acquitted. The 1999 State Department Report specifically states that, except for Hurtado, \"all the other defendants\" were acquitted of any involvement in the massacre. Given Casta&#241;eda's testimony and this documentary evidence, coupled with the lack of <i>any</i> evidence to the contrary, we conclude that it is uncontroverted that he was in fact acquitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge concluded &#8212; and the BIA agreed &#8212; that the military tribunals were a fraud on the basis of two documents: (1) the 1995 State Department Report, which stated that the military tribunal system often accorded impunity to the perpetrators of human rights abuses; and (2) an article from <i>Latin American Weekly Report,</i> dated August 31, 2004 (the \"Article\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our discussion of the military tribunals by noting that the Supreme Council of Military Justice, along with its lower tribunals, is a duly constituted judicial body in Per&#250;. This military system, which was granted jurisdiction over Casta&#241;eda's case by the Peruvian Supreme Court, acquitted Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> In general, American courts will give deference to decisions of foreign tribunals. <i>See, e.g., Finanz AG Zurich v. Banco Econ&#243;mico,</i> 192 F.3d 240, 246 (2d Cir.1999) (discussing deference to determinations made by foreign courts due to principles of international comity); <i>Casey v. Dep't of State,</i> 980 F.2d 1472, 1477 (D.C.Cir.1992) (discussing deference to a determination of a foreign court in an extradition proceeding); <i>Chiaramonte v. INS,</i> 626 F.2d 1093, 1098 (2d Cir.1980) (discussing the principle of international comity in relation to criminal convictions obtained in a foreign country); Restatement 2d, Conflict of Laws &#167; 98. In the instant case, the Immigration Judge and BIA chose not to give any weight whatsoever to Casta&#241;eda's acquittal. That determination was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the Article, it reported on a conflict between Per&#250;'s civilian and military justice systems following the Peruvian Supreme Court's ruling that the military system's jurisdiction extended only to offenses committed in the furtherance of military duties (and not to human rights violations). It also contained a quote from the Peruvian Prime Minister calling for \"the annulment of [military] rulings that breach human rights, so that there can be in the future no further excuses or pretexts to avoid prosecution.\" We note that there is absolutely no indication that the Prime Minister considered the ruling in Casta&#241;eda's case to have breached human rights. Further, the Article appears to only talk about events that occurred in the 1990s under the regime of former President Fujimori. The Article does not make any allusion to events that occurred in the 1980s. Finally, although the Peruvian Prime Minister at the time of the Article called for the annulment of certain rulings, there is no evidence whatsoever that any rulings were annulled, much less Casta&#241;eda's acquittal. In sum, there is no indication that the Article is in any way applicable to Casta&#241;eda's particular case, nor that the Peruvian Prime Minister's statements were anything more than pure rhetoric. We do not think that the Article was enough to overcome the deference ordinarily due a decision by a duly constituted foreign tribunal. In fact, it is nothing short of anomalous that undue weight is given to a magazine \"article\", yet no weight is given to a finding of a duly constituted tribunal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the 1995 State Department Report, we note that it does mention that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty after serving some jail time. However, other parts of the record indicate that in 1995, then-President Fujimori and Per&#250;'s Congress passed a law extending amnesty to military members convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995. Thus, it appears that Hurtado was released from jail because he had been granted amnesty, not because the original trial and conviction were somehow fraudulent. We certainly do not see how a grant of amnesty to Hurtado <i>several years after Casta&#241;eda left Per&#250; should affect Casta&#241;eda's original acquittal,</i> nor do we think that it should overcome the deference we usually give to the judgment of a foreign tribunal. We therefore conclude that the BIA's finding that <i>Casta&#241;eda's</i> trial was a fraud is not supported by any evidence, much less substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA found that Casta&#241;eda \"gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether and when he was in radio contact with the other patrols involved\" in the Operation. According to the BIA, Casta&#241;eda indicated that it was important to have radio contact, but later specifically testified that he was not in contact with other patrols on the day of the massacre. The BIA also rejected Casta&#241;eda's argument that the Immigration Judge had gone beyond the area of its expertise and \"ventured into the realm of Peruvian military tactics,\" because Casta&#241;eda's own testimony made it \"clear that radio contact was important for purposes of coordination as well as efficiency and protection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several problems with the BIA's reasoning. First, while Casta&#241;eda testified early on that it was important to have radio contact, his testimony indicates that he was referring to radio contact with his base, not other patrols. Casta&#241;eda testified that he only sometimes had contact with other patrols. Further, Casta&#241;eda specifically testified about the coordination of patrols for a mission:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each head of a patrol will respond to the immediate boss, the head of base. The head of base at the attack, they will inform the command of the battalion who can communicate and coordinate directly with the head of patrol and give another specific order or can get contact among heads of patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, Casta&#241;eda testified at the outset &#8212; before he was asked about whether he had any radio contact with other patrols the day of the Operation &#8212; (1) that it was important to have radio contact with his base commander, (2) that in coordinating attacks, the base commander would contact a battalion commander who coordinated the various patrols, and (3) that he only sometimes had direct contact with other patrols. We therefore see no inconsistency in Casta&#241;eda's testimony that, while he had radio contact with his base commander during the Operation, he did not have radio contact with the other patrols on the day in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also appears from the record that the Immigration Judge, and perhaps the BIA, simply found this testimony illogical. Such a finding deserves less deference than other types of credibility findings because it is based on an analysis of the testimony. <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 487. To the extent that the BIA's finding rested on this ground, we would agree with Casta&#241;eda's point that the BIA ventured outside the area of its expertise and into the realm of Peruvian military tactics. As such, we think the BIA's finding on this point is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the BIA accorded weight to the Immigration Judge's finding that during testimony about radio communication, Casta&#241;eda was \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate.\" While demeanor evidence is peculiarly within the purview of the trier of fact, we are not persuaded &#8212; given the problems we have found with the other aspects of the credibility findings &#8212; that rapid blinking alone is enough to find Casta&#241;eda not credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge's finding that Casta&#241;eda was evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations committed by the Peruvian military. From our review of the record, this finding mischaracterizes Casta&#241;eda's testimony. He was not evasive when confronted with statistics from State Department Reports. Casta&#241;eda readily admitted that he was aware of instances in which the Peruvian army had engaged in extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. He simply disagreed with the numbers. Casta&#241;eda consistently testified that abuses by the Peruvian army were not the norm and that only a minority of the military engaged in such practices. When confronted with the 1985 State Department Report indicating that \"[t]otal deaths related to antiterrorist operations of the security forces are estimated by human rights groups as being in the thousands between 1980-1985,\" Casta&#241;eda took issue with those numbers. We note that, to the extent the government offered the report as evidence that thousands of people had been killed due to abuses by the Peruvian military, Casta&#241;eda appears to have been at least correct. In a portion of the report the government failed to read at the hearing, the State Department noted that, out of these thousands of total deaths, \"[p]recise information is lacking on the number of civilian victims and their identities (terrorist or non-terrorist) as well as the identity of their assailants (terrorists, security forces, or peasant self-defense forces).\" In other words, the \"thousands\" of deaths that resulted from antiterrorist operations included deaths of terrorists, as well as civilians killed by terrorists and other peasant forces. Therefore, it is quite likely that there were not thousands of deaths related to abuses by the Peruvian military, and in that sense, Casta&#241;eda was correct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered the entire record, we do not think that substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Casta&#241;eda was evasive on the issue of human rights abuses by the military. He testified consistently throughout the hearings before the Immigration Judge, and although he disagreed at times with the government's assertions, this can hardly be considered evasive testimony. We therefore find that the BIA's finding on this issue is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth reason for the BIA's adverse credibility finding was that Casta&#241;eda allegedly was \"not forthcoming about the judgment entered against\" Hurtado. This, again, is a mischaracterization of Casta&#241;eda's testimony. There are several aspects of Casta&#241;eda's testimony on the subject of Hurtado, and we deal with each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Whether Hurtado was imprisoned</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross-examination, the government's attorney asked Casta&#241;eda what happened to Hurtado. Casta&#241;eda replied, \"[a]fter [Hurtado] admitted [to his involvement in the massacre] and the court found him guilty, he was placed in a military prison.\" This statement is borne out by the record; all of the documents indicate that Hurtado was found guilty and placed in prison for a period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Hurtado's conviction</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later on in questioning, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Sir, my question is, what was [Hurtado] found guilty of?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. He was found guilty of participating in the assassination of those village people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. So he was convicted of murder?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes. That's what I know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Was he sentenced to prison?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes. He was recluded in a military prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Do you know what his sentence was?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I do not know the amount of years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter part of Casta&#241;eda's answer is supported by the record, as the 1999 State Department Report indicates that Hurtado was not finally sentenced until 1993, two years after Casta&#241;eda left Per&#250;. It is perfectly plausible that Casta&#241;eda did not know the length of Hurtado's sentence, since Hurtado had not been sentenced when Casta&#241;eda and his family left Per&#250;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the first part of Casta&#241;eda's response, the government later asked Casta&#241;eda if Hurtado was convicted only of abuse of authority. Casta&#241;eda stated that \"[c]learly, I don't know. What I manifested what I know is that [t]he court found him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on law, but maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, the abuse of authority.\" On appeal, the government argues that Casta&#241;eda testified inconsistently about what crimes Hurtado was convicted of. This is incorrect, for two reasons. First, Casta&#241;eda testified that Hurtado was convicted of killing the villagers. He referred to the killings as \"that murder\" and an \"assassination.\" It is obvious that, in Casta&#241;eda's untrained legal mind, Hurtado murdered civilians, and this is what he was convicted of. Second, Hurtado was in fact charged with murder, and, at the time of Casta&#241;eda's acquittal, the case against Hurtado was still proceeding. The document confirming Casta&#241;eda's acquittal specifically states that the case would continue against Hurtado \"for crimes against life, body, and health, first degree murder.\" Hurtado, however, was not sentenced until 1993, and was sentenced only for abuse of authority. This again occurred after Casta&#241;eda had left Per&#250;. We see no reason to find that Casta&#241;eda was not credible as to his knowledge and participation in the Operation simply because he thought Hurtado was convicted of murder and not abuse of authority, when (1) Hurtado was originally charged with murder, (2) still faced a murder charge at the time of Casta&#241;eda's acquittal, and (3) was not sentenced until two years after Casta&#241;eda had left the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Whether Hurtado was discharged or promoted</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if Hurtado was discharged from the army, Casta&#241;eda testified that he thought so, since that was the usual military practice for an officer in such a situation, but did not know for sure. This apparently was not good enough for the government attorney, who commented that Casta&#241;eda seemed to not know many details about what happened to Hurtado given the significance the court martial had on his life. Casta&#241;eda replied</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You're right. That is a very important &#8212; in my life. What I know is that that officer acted outside the rules that are breach of the army. He was found guilty. . . . I did not try to find out what privileges he might have had and what had happened to his life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, Casta&#241;eda testified that he knew Hurtado went to prison, thought he was discharged from the army, and did not try to find out what happened to Hurtado afterwards. Instead, like many people would, he tried to resume <i>his</i> normal life. We see nothing to indicate that Casta&#241;eda was not forthcoming about Hurtado's fate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross examination, the government also introduced a 1995 State Department Report indicating that there were reports that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty and been promoted to captain. When asked about this, Casta&#241;eda testified \"I did not know that.\" When asked if it would surprise him to know that Hurtado was promoted after his conviction and sentence, Casta&#241;eda answered that it would. The record supports Casta&#241;eda's testimony. First, the 1999 State Department Report indicates that \"the Military Code states that any conviction that entails a sentence of 2 or more years' imprisonment must result in the officer's immediate discharge.\" Thus, Casta&#241;eda was correct in his testimony that the usual practice was for an officer in Hurtado's situation to be discharged. The 1999 Report also indicates that Hurtado was not released from prison until 1995 under the general amnesty, <i>four years after Casta&#241;eda had left Per&#250;.</i> It therefore is entirely consistent with Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he had no idea Hurtado had not been discharged and had in fact been released from prison and promoted, because when Casta&#241;eda left Per&#250;, Hurtado's case was still ongoing and he was in prison. Again, we find no basis for the adverse credibility finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also wish to emphasize several key pieces of evidence that supported Casta&#241;eda's story. First, as we noted above, the 1999 State Department report indicates that Casta&#241;eda was acquitted of any involvement in the massacre. Second, the report from the Human Rights Commission specifically found that Casta&#241;eda's patrol was \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\" This is an extremely important piece of evidence because it goes to the heart of the issue: the extent of Casta&#241;eda's participation in the massacre of the villagers. Further, while the Commission report mentioned Casta&#241;eda's name twice, it did so only in reference to the fact that he led one of the non-infringing patrols. The report clearly holds Hurtado to blame for the massacre. It mentions Hurtado's testimony in depth and also refers to him as \"the perpetrator\" &#8212; as opposed to \"one of the perpetrators\" &#8212; of the massacre. The 1995 and 1999 State Department Reports single out Hurtado and his patrol as the ones responsible for the massacre. For example, the 1999 State Department Report states that \"Hurtado commanded the army unit responsible for the 1985 Accomarca massacre.\" Neither Casta&#241;eda nor any of the other patrol leaders' names are ever mentioned. In our view the record, when viewed as a whole, indicates that Hurtado and his patrol were responsible for the massacre, and that Casta&#241;eda's patrol, <i>which was three to five miles distant,</i> took no part in it. After a trial by the military court, Hurtado &#8212; the man responsible &#8212; was convicted<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> and the charges against Casta&#241;eda were dismissed. The fact that Hurtado was later released due to a general declaration of amnesty by the President and Congress should not affect the legitimacy of the original trial and conviction, and it especially should not be held against Casta&#241;eda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the evidence indicates that Casta&#241;eda credibly testified that (1) he never had any contact with any villagers during the Operation, (2) he was acquitted of any involvement in the massacre by a duly constituted body of the Peruvian military, which was given jurisdiction over his case by the Peruvian Supreme Court, and (3) Hurtado, the leader of the Links 7 patrol, was the one found responsible for the massacre by a military court. This evidence, combined with the problems we have discussed related to the reasons relied upon by the BIA in making its adverse credibility finding, sound the death knell for that finding. Substantial evidence does not support a finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible regarding his involvement in the massacre, and we therefore reverse the BIA's credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The \"Ordinary Remand Rule\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent, invoking the \"ordinary remand rule\" argues that we must remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings. We reject the dissent's reasoning for several reasons which we briefly explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>INS v. Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002), a Supreme Court case invoked by the dissent, the Court reversed a judgment of the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit had reversed the BIA based on a \"changed circumstances\" argument that the government had made to an Immigration Judge, but which the BIA had never addressed. On appeal, the Supreme Court stated that, under the ordinary remand rule, \"[a] court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a <i>de novo</i> inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry. Rather, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16, 123 S.Ct. 353 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The Court then reversed, stating that the Ninth Circuit had erred by deciding the \"changed circumstances\" issue \"without giving the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in the first instance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17, 123 S.Ct. 353.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has also recently applied the ordinary remand rule in <i>Gonz&#225;les v. Thomas,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006). In <i>Thomas,</i> the Immigration Judge denied a petitioner's asylum claim without considering her alleged fear of persecution based on membership in a particular social group. The BIA then summarily affirmed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that Thomas was in fact persecuted as a member of a social group even though the BIA had not yet addressed the issue. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded to the BIA for consideration of the issue, stating that \"[t]he agency has not yet considered whether [petitioner's father-in-law's] family presents the kind of kinship ties that constitute a particular social group.\" <i>Id.,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1615.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not quarrel with the general legal proposition regarding the ordinary remand rule advanced by the dissent and found in <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Ventura,</i> we believe that the facts of this case take it outside of the purview of that rule. In both <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Ventura,</i> the court of appeals considered an issue that the BIA never addressed in the first instance. Here, by contrast, the Immigration Judge and BIA both thoroughly considered the credibility issue based on a fully developed record. In reversing the credibility determination, we are not conducting a <i>de novo</i> review of the record, but rather are reviewing the reasons set forth by the BIA in light of the record. Under the ordinary remand rule, while we could remand the case for further factfinding, we are not required to do so since the BIA has already thoroughly \"evaluat[ed] the evidence\" and brought \"its expertise to bear upon the matter.\" <i>Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 16, 123 S.Ct. 353.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that this approach is in accord with other circuits that have interpreted <i>Ventura</i> and <i>Thomas.</i> For example, the Seventh Circuit has stated that \"we do not agree that <i>Ventura</i> stands for the broad proposition that a court of appeals must remand a case for additional investigation or explanation once an error is identified.\" <i>Ghebremedhin v. Ashcroft,</i> 392 F.3d 241, 243 (7th Cir.2004). Several other circuits have adopted a similar line of reasoning. <i>See, e.g., Almaghzar v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 450 F.3d 415, 423 n. 11 (9th Cir.2006) (\"Neither <i>Ventura</i> nor <i>Thomas</i> requires us to remand an issue to the agency when the agency has already considered the issue.\"); <i>Zhao v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 404 F.3d 295, 311 (5th Cir.2005) (stating that the court was not required to remand under the ordinary remand rule because the BIA had already decided the issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also argues that our decision to reverse violates the law of our own circuit. However, the cases cited by the dissent are clearly distinguishable. For example, the dissent relies on <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34 (1st Cir.1998) and <i>Cordero-Trejo v. INS,</i> 40 F.3d 482 (1st Cir. 1994). In <i>Gailius,</i> the Immigration Judge did not address whether alleged threats had occurred as the petitioner described because it found that a reasonable person in the petitioner's situation would not fear persecution on account of such threats. We disagreed with this latter finding and stated that \"[i]f the threats are real . . . Gailius may well have had a well-founded fear.\" <i>Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 44. We remanded so that the BIA &#8212; which ignored the evidence of the threats based on reasons not having to do with credibility &#8212; could explain why it found the threats not credible. One of our main reasons for remand was that \"the IJ did not make a determination of the credibility and authenticity of Gailius' evidence of threats.\" <i>Id.</i> at 47. We have a different case here, because the IJ and BIA made specific credibility findings; those findings simply are not supported by substantial evidence. In <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> the BIA first found the petitioner not credible, then made an alternative holding that the petitioner was ineligible for asylum based on three reasons. <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 485. We found two of these reasons invalid under the INA, and the third depended on the adverse credibility finding, which we found was not supported by substantial evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 485, 488. We also found that the BIA failed to consider certain general country condition evidence offered by the petitioner. <i>Id.</i> at 485. In reversing the adverse credibility finding, we noted that \"it is difficult to ascertain from what sort of evidence the IJ drew his credibility conclusions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491. Given this fact, along with the fact that the Immigration Judge and BIA had failed to address any of the petitioner's documentary evidence, we remanded. Casta&#241;eda's case is obviously distinguishable because it is clear what evidence the Immigration Judge and BIA relied on in drawing the adverse credibility determination, and the BIA did not simply ignore all of Casta&#241;eda's documentary evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Whether Casta&#241;eda Was a Persecutor</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted above, the Immigration Judge also found that, even assuming Casta&#241;eda had testified credibly &#8212; i.e., even assuming that he and his patrol were several miles away from the village during the Operation, did not encounter a single villager, and did not know what was happening in the village or have any control over what was taking place there &#8212; he still \"assisted or otherwise participated\" in the persecution of others.

In the instant case, it is undisputed that Casta&#241;eda did not order or incite the persecution of anyone. It is also undisputed that the villagers massacred during the Operation were killed because of their political opinion, i.e., their support of or suspected involvement with the Shining Path. Therefore, the only issue is whether Casta&#241;eda \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" the persecution of the villagers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's main argument is that he could not have \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution because the massacre took place without his control and awareness, and because he had no connection to the massacre beyond being a member of the military at the time it occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> The government, following the reasoning of the BIA, argues that Casta&#241;eda's actions in blocking an escape path furthered the massacre and therefore demands a finding that he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. After careful review of the record and various cases interpreting the phrase \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" the persecution of others, we are compelled to reverse the BIA's decision in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our discussion by looking to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Fedorenko v. United States,</i> 449 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 737, 66 L.Ed.2d 686 (1981).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> In <i>Fedorenko,</i> the Court interpreted a provision of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, Pub.L. No. 80-774, 62 Stat. 1009 (\"DPA\"), which excluded from the definition of \"displaced persons\" individuals who had \"assisted the enemy in persecution of civil[ians] or had `voluntarily assisted the enemy forces . . . in their operations . . .'\" <i>Fedorenko,</i> 449 U.S. at 495, 101 S.Ct. 737 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fedorenko was admitted to the United States as a displaced person following World War II after stating in his application that he had been a farmer in Poland from 1937 until March 1942, then had been deported to Germany and forced to work in a factory until the end of the war. In reality, Fedorenko was a Russian soldier who had been captured by the German army and forced to serve as a guard at the Nazi concentration camp in Treblinka, Poland, where several hundred thousand Jewish civilians were murdered. When the falsehoods on his application were discovered, the government filed an action to have Fedorenko's citizenship revoked. At the resulting trial, Fedorenko admitted to his service at Treblinka and admitted that he knew that thousands of Jewish civilians were being murdered there, but claimed that his service as a guard was involuntary and that he did not have any personal involvement in the atrocities committed. Fedorenko also admitted that he had \"shot in the general direction of escaping inmates\" during a prison uprising, <i>id.</i> at 500, 101 S.Ct. 737, \"that the Russian armed guards significantly outnumbered the German soldiers at the camp, that he was paid a stipend and received a good service stripe from the Germans, and that he was allowed to leave the camp regularly but never tried to escape.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court found that Fedorenko had assisted in the persecution of civilians. In doing so, the Court rejected Fedorenko's argument that he did not assist in any persecution because his actions were involuntary. It noted that the DPA incorporated the definition of \"displaced person\" contained in the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization of the United Nations (\"IRO Constitution\"). <i>Id.</i> at 496 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. 737. While section 2(a) of the IRO Constitution provided that persons who \"assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations\" were excluded from the definition of \"displaced persons,\" section 2(b) of the IRO Constitution excluded only those persons who \"<i>voluntarily</i> assisted the enemy forces . . . in their operations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 496 n. 4, 101 S.Ct. 737. The Court found that \"[u]nder traditional principles of statutory construction, the deliberate omission of the word `voluntary' from &#167; 2(a) compels the conclusion that the statute made <i>all</i> those who assisted in the persecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\" <i>Id.</i> at 512, 101 S.Ct. 737 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After rejecting Fedorenko's involuntariness defense, the Court found that his actions constituted assistance in persecution. In an oft-cited footnote, the Court described a continuum of conduct along which an individual's actions should be considered in determining whether he or she assisted in persecution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, an individual who did no more than cut the hair of female inmates before they were executed cannot be found to have assisted in the persecution of civilians. On the other hand, there can be no question that a guard who was issued a uniform and armed with a rifle and a pistol, who was paid a stipend and was regularly allowed to leave the concentration camp to visit a nearby village, and who admitted to shooting at escaping inmates on orders from the commandant of the camp, fits within the statutory language about persons who assisted in the persecution of civilians. Other cases may present more difficult line-drawing problems but we need decide only this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 512 n. 34., 101 S.Ct. 737</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases involving \"more difficult line-drawing problems,\" courts have relied on <i>Fedorenko's</i> \"continuum of conduct\" footnote and BIA precedent to determine whether an alien \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution. Following <i>Fedorenko,</i> the BIA has held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The participation or assistance of an alien in persecution need not be of his own volition to bar him from relief. However, mere membership in an organization, even one which engages in persecution, is not sufficient to bar one from relief, but only if one's action or inaction furthers that persecution in some way. It is the objective effect of an alien's actions which is controlling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> 19 I. &amp; N.

INS,</i> 434 F.3d 136, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2006) (stating that the court \"focused on the nature of [the alien's] conduct as a whole\"); <i>In Re A-H,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 774, 785 (A.G.2005) (citing with approval <i>Hern&#225;ndez v. Reno,</i> 258 F.3d 806, 814 (8th Cir.2001) (stating that \"[t]he Board should have analyzed all the pertinent evidence related to [the alien's] conduct\")). Further, some degree of individual culpability is necessary in order for an alien to be held responsible for assisting or participating in persecution. <i>See Miranda Alvarado,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 918 (stating that \"determining whether a petitioner `assisted in persecution' requires a particularized evaluation of both personal involvement and purposeful assistance in order to ascertain culpability\"); <i>Higuit,</i> 433 F.3d at 421 (finding that \"there can be no dispute over Higuit's personal culpability in this case\"); <i>Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 258 F.3d at 814 (stating that a court should \"determine whether the individual should be held personally culpable for his conduct\"). Moreover, several courts have explicitly required that a petitioner's actions have direct (as opposed to tangential) consequences for the victims or further the persecution in some material way. <i>See Miranda Alvarado,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 918 (asking whether the petitioner's actions furthered the persecution or were tangential to it, and finding that petitioner was barred because, without his actions, the events leading to the persecution could not have proceeded); <i>Xie,</i> 434 F.3d at 143 (stating that the court would find assistance in persecution when the alien's conduct \"was active and had direct consequences for the victims,\" but would not find assistance in persecution where the alien's conduct was tangential and passive). Some courts have also considered the repetitive nature of the alien's actions. <i>See, e.g., Miranda Alvarado,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 919; <i>Singh,</i> 417 F.3d at 740 (in discounting petitioner's \"protestations of case-specific ignorance\" of persecutory acts, noting \"the repetition of [petitioner's] conduct over an extended period\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning now to Casta&#241;eda's particular case, we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determination that he \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution. Taking Casta&#241;eda's testimony as true, we are presented with the following set of facts: (1) the uncontradicted evidence is that the purpose of the Operation was directed at the Shining Path guerrillas in the village, <i>not</i> civilians;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> (2) Casta&#241;eda and his men were hidden in the jungle three to five miles from the village and about thirty meters from the path they were guarding; (3) during the time they were there, they did not see or hear anyone, nor did they fire any shots; (4) they never entered the village and never directly or indirectly participated in the killings of the villagers, which was carried out by a rogue patrol led by Hurtado in a previously unplanned manner; (5) Casta&#241;eda and his men lacked any control or authority over this rogue patrol; and (6) they did not know what occurred in the village during the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these facts, and considering the totality of relevant conduct, we are compelled to conclude that Casta&#241;eda did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution of the villagers. First, Casta&#241;eda's personal involvement in the murder of the villagers was non-existent. <i>Compare</i> <i>Miranda Alvarado,</i> 441 F.3d at 762 (noting that petitioner, who served as an interpreter for the Peruvian army while officer tortured suspected Shining Path member, was personally involved in the persecution because he was present and active during the interrogation); <i>Singh,</i> 417 F.3d at 740 (finding that the petitioner had assisted or otherwise participated in persecution where the petitioner \"took innocent Sikhs into custody . . . and transported them to the police station, where he knew they would be subjected to unjustified physical abuse[,]\" and \"participated in raids on the homes of innocent Sikh families\"). Second, Casta&#241;eda's conduct &#8212; which amounted to hiding in the jungle for several hours three to five miles away from the scene of the massacre &#8212; can hardly be characterized as \"active and ha[ving] direct consequences for the victims\" of the persecution, <i>Xie,</i> 434 F.3d at 143, especially since no one ever came down the path Casta&#241;eda's patrol was watching. Instead, Casta&#241;eda's actions are better characterized as irrelevant \"to the acts of oppression and passive in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> In a similar vein, Casta&#241;eda's actions simply had <i>no</i> \"objective effect\" on the persecution because Casta&#241;eda and his men never saw anyone or fired any shots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> In other words, <i>the massacre of the villagers during the Operation would have occurred regardless of whether Casta&#241;eda ever reached his assigned position,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> and Casta&#241;eda did nothing to facilitate the massacre in any way because his patrol never encountered anyone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> <i>Cf. Miranda Alvarado,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 927 (finding that, without the petitioner's actions, the persecution would not have gone forward). Add to these facts Casta&#241;eda's lack of awareness of what was happening in the village, and we simply do not see how his actions rise to the level of culpability necessary to find that he assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of the villagers. We therefore find that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determination in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Dissent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has never condoned, nor will it ever condone, the massacre of innocent civilians by the military in the course of its war-related activities. <i>See United States v. Zajanckauskas,</i> 441 F.3d 32 (1st Cir. 2006). However, we also cannot tolerate a finding that amounts to a conclusion that someone is guilty of such conduct by remote association. The findings of the Immigration Judge and the BIA amount to just that: a conclusion of guilt by remote association. These findings fly against the evidence that is relevant to a determination of whether Casta&#241;eda was credible and to whether he was in any way responsible for the atrocities committed by a different Peruvian army unit, operating independently of his command, several miles away from his location, with nothing but mountains and jungle in between.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the findings below &#8212; which we have already addressed as unsupported or unsupportable &#8212; are clothed in the presumably impervious mantle of credibility findings, and considering the assertions in the dissent that follows, it is appropriate that we conclude by re-emphasizing certain <i>uncontested</i> evidence which goes both to the issue of Casta&#241;eda's credibility and to the question of his responsibility for the heinous acts committed beyond his control or participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is <i>undisputed</i> that the patrol which committed the massacre of the villagers was several miles away and acted independently from Casta&#241;eda, whose assigned duty was to watch a trail to intercept Shining Path guerrillas, not civilians. The dissent's phrasing of the facts, that \"army units fired and threw grenades into the houses and killed many women and children,\" and that Casta&#241;eda \"headed one of four army units involved in the military operation during which this massacre occurred\" is unfortunate because it gives the impression that the military operation was one that included, as a pre-planned goal, the premeditated killing of civilians. In fact, <i>there is absolutely no evidence to this effect.</i> This unwarranted implication in the quoted portion of the dissent is re-enforced by the phrasing that follows: \"His patrol was assigned to and did block a possible escape route from the village, but there is no evidence that he was in the village during the massacre or that he personally killed anyone.\" This quote omits the rather important fact that Casta&#241;eda was several miles away from the village, that there is no evidence that he ever entered the village before, during or after the massacre, or that anyone, civilian or otherwise, ever went down the trail he was guarding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as we just noted, it is <i>undisputed</i> that nothing happened on Casta&#241;eda's watch. It is <i>undisputed</i> that no one came down the trail &#8212; no Shining Path guerrillas, no civilians, no one. Thus, neither Casta&#241;eda nor anyone under his command engaged in any action against innocent civilians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, there is <i>not a scintilla of evidence</i> that Casta&#241;eda was aware, either before or during the massacre, that these acts would be committed or were being committed by others over which he had no control and were in fact not his subordinates. The issue regarding radio communication during the Operation is simply another red herring, for several reasons. First, there is no affirmative evidence of any communication between Casta&#241;eda and the other patrols during the Operation. Second, radio silence during operations is not an unheard of military tactic. In any event, the only evidence is the assertion by the only person there, Casta&#241;eda, that there was no communication between the patrols. The conclusions to the contrary, used by the Immigration Judge and the BIA as a basis for their credibility conclusions, are mere speculation unsupported by evidence, especially given Casta&#241;eda's prior testimony about communication up the chain of command. Third, the issue regarding radio communication is an irrelevant distraction from the main issue: Casta&#241;eda's culpability for the actions of Hurtado's rogue patrol, over which it is <i>undisputed</i> that Casta&#241;eda lacked control or command.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Casta&#241;eda was acquitted by a Peruvian military court for his involvement in the Operation. This is the same military court that found the captain in charge of the rogue patrol, Hurtado, guilty of perpetrating the massacre against the civilians. Notwithstanding these undisputed facts, and that such tribunals are the ones that normally deal with crimes allegedly committed by the military in the course of military operations, the Immigration Judge and the BIA latched on to irrelevant issues to detract from the most central, irrefutable fact: that the only adjudicative body to pass upon this unfortunate incident placed the blame for these actions on someone other than Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determinations that Casta&#241;eda was not credible and assisted or otherwise participated in persecution, we grant the petition for review, reverse the decision of the BIA, and remand the case so that an Immigration Judge may consider the merits of Casta&#241;eda's asylum and withholding of removal applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's asylum request merits serious, unbiased consideration. As we pointed out earlier in this opinion, the Shining Path have been catalogued by our government as a ruthless terrorist organization. Casta&#241;eda's unchallenged testimony is that Shining Path members threatened him on numerous occasions and attempted to murder him in 1986. Furthermore, and in keeping with its record of indiscriminate violence, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Philip Bennett, <i>Pol Pot in Per&#250;,</i> New Republic, January 28, 1985, at 16, Shining Path members tried to kidnap Casta&#241;eda's daughter in 1989. The group also murdered Casta&#241;eda's neighbor and military colleague in front of the man's family in 1990. Thereafter, Casta&#241;eda sought refuge for himself and his family from these terrorist thugs by leaving his native country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's decision cannot be sustained on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded for actions consistent with this opinion.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Casta&#241;eda's wife and daughters were included in his asylum application</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The dissent claims that our discussion of the facts is \"materially incomplete\" and proceeds to submit its own version of the facts. Although it is certainly entitled to do so, we have some basic disagreements with this rendition both by reason of its content and its emphasis. With due respect, we believe that certain parts of its recitation are either irrelevant or taken out of context and clearly the subject of explanation. Perhaps a more egregious problem is presented by the inclusion of certain additional details, particularly those contained in page 66, line 11, through page 67, line 4, of the dissent, which recount the actions of persons for whom Casta&#241;eda was not responsible and who were without his command or authority, and additionally, for which Casta&#241;eda was absolved of responsibility. The inclusion of this information in the dissent's recount is thus not only unnecessary and irrelevant to a discussion of the issues before us, but also is unduly inflammatory and distracts from the proper focus of the legal issues raised by this appeal. The offending facts, although part of the decisions below, and undoubtedly an improper factor in the erroneous outcome reached, add nothing material to the appeal before us.

We think it is important to note this fact because, in our view, some of the supposed inconsistencies or evasiveness mentioned by the dissent were more likely than not simple problems in translation. For example, when asked whether he could contact other patrols by radio during a military operation on August 5, 1985, Casta&#241;eda originally replied \"No. I<i>did not</i> on my radio.\" The Immigration Judge then stated \"That's not what I asked\" and asked the question again, to which Casta&#241;eda replied \"No. I <i>could not.</i>\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> According to the State Department's 1985 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Per&#250;, the emergency zone was an area in which there was a declaration of a state of emergency and the armed forces were given full civil and military authority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The dissent states that Casta&#241;eda said it was \"`very important to coordinate the movement.' Casta&#241;eda said his patrol would `keep contact with the base by radio,' and at least sometimes would make direct radio contact with other patrols in the area.\" One possible implication of the dissent's phrasing is that Casta&#241;eda was stating that radio contact with other patrols was important to coordinate the movement. However, we wish to be clear that Casta&#241;eda was<i>not</i> testifying that radio contact with other patrols was important to coordinate movement. Rather, his statement that it was \"important to coordinate the movement\" was in response to the question \"Was it important to know the location of other[s] in your area?\" From the full context of the statement, it is clear that Casta&#241;eda was simply stating that it was important to know the location of other patrols to coordinate movement, not to have actual radio contact with them. Casta&#241;eda had already testified that he kept in radio contact with his base and that his base commander would let him know where other patrols were, although he also sometimes had direct radio contact with the other patrols.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> This zone was located within the Ayacucho region, i.e., the emergency zone</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Apparently, Llocllapampa is located between two mountains, and there were very few paths into or out of the village</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The dissent states that, when asked if he was informed what frequencies the two attack patrols were using, Casta&#241;eda replied \"That's correct.\" However, the dissent leaves out the rest of Casta&#241;eda's reply. The full quote is \"That's correct, but both patrols entered from the same place and where those patrols are directed, four patrols are directed from the same head of unit, but these orders came from the division. I was directly directed by the head of commander of base.\" From this full quote, it is clear that Casta&#241;eda misunderstood the question, and was explaining that the four patrols were directed by a division head, and that his orders during the Operation came directly from the head commander of his case. A few questions later, Casta&#241;eda explicitly clarified that he could not contact the other patrols because he did not have their frequency</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The dissent notes that, when asked what happened in the village, Casta&#241;eda originally stated that \"[o]ne of the patrols . . . committed excesses.\" The implication behind the inclusion of this fact is that Casta&#241;eda was being evasive. This is not the case. From the transcript, it appears that, after Casta&#241;eda testified about \"excesses,\" the Immigration Judge interjected to ask the interpreter what she had said. The government then asked Casta&#241;eda if he could be more specific, and Casta&#241;eda immediately replied that the patrol had executed civilians. We do not think that this sequence of events indicates any evasiveness on Casta&#241;eda's part</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The dissent argues that Casta&#241;eda's testimony shows that he was evasive regarding his knowledge of the number of civilians killed in Llocllapampa. This is incorrect. The Human Rights Commission noted that there were three different reports regarding the number of civilians killed: twenty-five, forty, and sixty-nine. It also noted that the exact number could not be determined. To this day the exact number of civilians killed is unknown. Casta&#241;eda was therefore entirely correct in stating that he never learned the exact number of people killed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> This testimony is supported by other aspects of the record, which we discuss<i>infra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The dissent makes much of the fact that Casta&#241;eda was debriefed, arguing that the debriefing means it is unlikely that he did not find out about the massacre until three weeks later, as he claimed. We have two responses. First, Casta&#241;eda stated that the \"debriefing\" simply meant that he gave a report to his base commander. He gave no indication that he met with the other patrols or discussed what the other patrols did, and there is no evidence in the record to controvert that testimony. Second, it would make sense that those who slaughtered the civilians would not tell other soldiers who were not involved. One would expect that those who participate in the murder of innocent civilians would not openly discuss what they have done with others who did not engage in such atrocities</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> As previously noted, we are concerned that the dissent's description of the murders of the villagers is inflammatory, and we therefore want to emphasize that it is undisputed that Casta&#241;eda was not involved in the killing of any civilians. He was also later absolved of responsibility by a military court, a fact which we discuss in more detail below</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent is equally inflammatory in speculating, in footnote 43, that \"if Hurtado was acting on orders, rather than in the heat of the moment, it is much more likely that Casta&#241;eda would have known about the massacre before it happened\". Such speculation loses sight of the facts of the case: there is no evidence that Hurtado was acting on orders to commit the massacre, and there is no evidence that Casta&#241;eda would have known of these hypothetical orders had they ever been given.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The dissent notes that the Human Rights Commission stated that Hurtado \"is only a piece of the larger picture and it is necessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders.\" One possible implication of this isolated fact is that Casta&#241;eda was perhaps part of the \"larger picture.\" However, taking the statement within the context of the report, it is clear that the Commission was concerned that persons with a higher military rank had ordered Hurtado to kill the civilians. In particular, elsewhere in the report the Commission refers to possible \"verbal orders\" given to Hurtado by a general named Wilfredo Mori Orzo. Nothing in the report indicates Casta&#241;eda had any orders beyond those to watch the path for any Shining Path guerrillas or that Casta&#241;eda was somehow part of the \"larger picture.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A more egregious misconstruction of the facts of the case is the dissent's statement that \"[i]t is disputed whether [Casta&#241;eda] knew about the massacre before or while it took place.\" Again, there is no evidence that the massacre was planned or that Casta&#241;eda had knowledge of these plans if they ever existed. The IJ did dispute whether Casta&#241;eda learned, via radio contact, of the massacre as it took place. However, this dispute is irrelevant. Casta&#241;eda did not have authority over Hurtado and he was located 3 to 5 miles outside of Llocllapampa. Had Casta&#241;eda learned of the massacre as it transpired, he would not have been able to either assist or stop it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> In stating that \"three officers [including Casta&#241;eda] were responsible\" for the massacres, the report was drawing from initial reports by the Peruvian military and the Human Rights Commission. It should not be taken as a definitive finding that Casta&#241;eda was responsible for the massacre, especially since it was released in February 1986 and thus does not take into account Casta&#241;eda's subsequent acquittal by the Peruvian military court system following a formal proceeding.

The Real ID Act \"alters, among other things, the standards governing credibility determinations and the need for corroboration of testimony in asylum cases.\"<i>Dhima v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 416 F.3d 92, 95 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005). However, because Casta&#241;eda's asylum application was filed well before the effective date of these provisions of the Act, the provisions are inapplicable here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The regulations dealing with asylum applications filed on or after April 1, 1997 do not explicitly contain this burden shifting provision<i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(c)(1).

Under our own justice system, defendants who are \"acquitted\" are found \"not guilty,\" they are not found \"innocent.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent argues that the BIA did not require an actual finding of innocence, but simply required Casta&#241;eda to show his innocence through court documents or otherwise. We disagree. The BIA specifically discounted Casta&#241;eda's evidence because it was not \"the legal equivalent of a <i>criminal finding</i> that he was innocent.\" (emphasis supplied). Our point is that, under our own justice system, it would have been impossible for Casta&#241;eda to provide such a finding, and it was therefore unreasonable to discount the evidence of his acquittal simply because it is not a criminal finding of innocence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> There is some indication that the Immigration Judge, and perhaps the BIA, faulted Casta&#241;eda for not providing evidence of an acquittal from the civilian court system of Per&#250;. We wish to note that, to the extent that the decision rested on these grounds, it was erroneous. The highest body of the civilian court system, the Supreme Court of Per&#250;, determined that the military system had jurisdiction over Casta&#241;eda's case. There is therefore no doubt that the case was properly before the military courts, and there is simply no reason to fault Casta&#241;eda for not providing evidence of acquittal in the civilian system</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> The dissent seizes on the both the Immigration Judge's and BIA's use of the word \"demeanor,\" noting in several places that Casta&#241;eda was found not credible based on \"observations\" of his demeanor. The implication of the dissent's emphasis on demeanor evidence is that the Immigration Judge and BIA based the adverse credibility finding on numerous problems with Casta&#241;eda's demeanor. For example, the dissent notes that the Immigration Judge stated that he had \"carefully observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor . . . and found him vague, evasive, and non-responsive.\" However, as the dissent also notes, a hearing officer who makes an adverse credibility determination must support the determination with specific findings in order to be accorded deference<i>Aguilar-Sol&#237;s v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir.1999). The <i>only</i> specific finding that the Immigration Judge made regarding Casta&#241;eda's demeanor-as opposed to the content of his testimony &#8212; was that during testimony about radio communication, Casta&#241;eda was \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate.\" We readily agree that demeanor evidence is peculiarly within the purview of the trier of fact. However, absent other evidence of a lack of credibility, we cannot affirm an adverse credibility finding based solely on a person's \"blinking\" during a portion of their testimony. Such ambiguous indicia are simply too thin to support such a conclusion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Further, the 1985 Report notes elsewhere that \"[b]eginning in 1983, some members of the security forces responded to [the Shining Path] with violence of their own, engaging in extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. Most of these violations occurred in 1983 and 1984 in the Ayacucho Emergency Zone. . . . During 1985, reports of such abuses by security forces dropped sharply. . . .\" In 1983 and 1984, Casta&#241;eda was serving in Tumbes, around 400 miles away from the emergency zone. It is therefore likely that he heard only occasional reports of abuses occurring in the emergency zone. Further, as indicated by the State Department, by the time he was transferred into the emergency zone in 1985, the number of abuses decreased sharply. This further bolsters his testimony that he only rarely heard of abuses by the military</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> We also note that Casta&#241;eda's knowledge, or lack thereof, regarding Hurtado is a red herring. Casta&#241;eda was denied asylum because of what<i>he</i> allegedly did, not because of what Hurtado did. As we previously noted, Casta&#241;eda's case is based on his disassociation from Hurtado's actions, actions over which Casta&#241;eda had no control or knowledge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The fact that there was a conviction in the case should further boost Casta&#241;eda's credibility</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> The dissent's analysis would require us to remand whenever we found an error in the BIA's factual decisions, even if the BIA had clearly decided the issue based on a fully developed record. This would transform the \"ordinary remand\" rule into an \"automatic remand\" rule, something we do not believe is required by either the Supreme Court or our own precedents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The dissent also cites<i>Seavey v. Barnhart,</i> 276 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2001). However, that case actually supports our decision to reverse. In <i>Seavy,</i> which involved an agency's denial of social security benefits, we remanded to the agency for further consideration. However, we noted that \"if the evidence and law compelled one conclusion or the other, then [we] could order an award of benefits or affirm a denial of benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 11. Here, under substantial evidence review, we may reverse the decision of the BIA only if we are <i>compelled</i> by the evidence. In deciding that the BIA's determination is not supported by substantial evidence, we are in reality stating that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. Thus, under the language of <i>Seavy,</i> we may simply reverse the agency's decision.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> The dissent argues that this portion of the BIA's opinion was not an alternate holding and that we should remand to the BIA so that it can address in the first instance whether Casta&#241;eda's actions amounted to assistance or participation in persecution. In essence, the dissent believes that the BIA did not assume the credibility of all of Casta&#241;eda's testimony and that the quoted portion of the BIA's opinion does not adequately explain the BIA's reasoning. It bases this argument in part on the BIA's statement that \"even if [Casta&#241;eda] testified credibly<i>that he did not harm or execute anyone</i> on August 8, 1985,\" (emphasis supplied), he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the dissent's characterization of the ruling below. The context of the BIA's statement, especially its citation to, and affirmation of, a portion of the Immigration Judge's decision where the Immigration Judge <i>explicitly</i> makes an alternate holding, as well as its citation to <i>In re Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> one of the BIA's seminal opinions on the issue of whether an alien assisted or participated in persecution, leaves us with no doubt the BIA was making an alternate holding. This alternate holding was that, even if Casta&#241;eda were credible, his actions constituted assistance or participation in persecution. Further, although brief, the BIA's reasoning is crystal clear: it believed that the act of blocking a path during the Operation had the objective effect of assisting in the massacre by helping to confine the villagers. Given these considerations, we are convinced that this alternate holding is ripe for review. <i>See Xu v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 424 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that \"[w]hen considering . . . the clarity of an administrative decision . . ., we are not blind to the context in which the decision is made or oblivious of the record on which it is based\"). The fact that the BIA has already decided the issue also takes this case outside of the dissent's arguments about the ordinary remand rule, which we have already addressed above.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> Casta&#241;eda also briefly argues that his actions were directed toward the defense of the government, and therefore any harm that resulted from such behavior would not amount to persecution<i>See In re Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811, 815 (BIA 1988) (stating that \"harm which may result incidentally from behavior directed at . . . the defense of [a] government against an opponent\" does not amount to persecution.). However, the massacre of the villagers during the Operation went well beyond that which was incidental to the defense of the Peruvian government. <i>See, e.g., Miranda Alvarado v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 927 (9th Cir.2006) (stating that \"torturing individuals selected for their affiliation with an opposition group is not inherent in armed conflict, any more than is `ethnic cleansing'\"). Therefore, if Casta&#241;eda assisted or otherwise participated in the massacre, he should be barred as a persecutor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn34\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34_ref\">34</a>\n        <p> This is the course taken by most of the circuit courts that have considered issues similar to the one before us today<i>See, e.g., Miranda Alvarado,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 924-25; <i>Xie v.

Some courts have taken <i>Fedorenko's</i> holding and applied it to the INA. <i>See Xie,</i> 434 F.3d at 141-42 (stating that \"we find it unlikely that the phrase `assisted in persecution' implicitly includes a voluntariness requirement\" in the INA but not the DPA and noting that, in prior cases, the court had \"deemed irrelevant [the alien's] personal motivation or intent\"); <i>Singh,</i> 417 F.3d at 740 (stating that an alien's personal motivation for his or her actions is irrelevant); <i>Bah v.

Other courts appear to be more willing to look into the alien's intent. <i>See Miranda Alvarado,</i> 449 F.3d 915, 925 (stating that a court should evaluate an alien's \"purposeful assistance\"); <i>Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 258 F.3d at 814 (faulting the BIA for not considering the alien's testimony that his actions were involuntary and motivated by fear for his own life).

We do not agree with the holding in <i>Naujalis.</i> Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit's opinion in <i>Singh v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 417 F.3d 736 (7th Cir.2005), has recently clarified the holding in <i>Naujalis.</i> In <i>Singh,</i> the alien was a citizen of India who worked for the police department in India's Pujab. The court noted that, in the context of Nazi guards and the DPA (which is what <i>Naujalis</i> involved), \"membership in the ranks of Nazi guards is sufficient to constitute assistance in prohibited persecution.\" <i>Singh,</i> 417 F.3d at 739. It then went on to state that the DPA line of cases was not fully compatible with the INA in general and Singh's case in particular because \"[u]nlike Nazi concentration camps, whose complete existence was premised upon the persecution of innocent civilians, local Punjabi police departments served traditional, legitimate law enforcement purposes and did not exclusively engage in the persecution of innocent [people].\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, the court stated, in Singh's case \"a distinction must be made between genuine assistance in persecution and inconsequential association with persecutors.\" <i>Id.</i> The court then went on to conduct an analysis similar to the one we have conducted. <i>Id.</i> at 739-741.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the dissent's reliance on <i>Naujalis</i> is misplaced because <i>Naujalis</i> involved a special rule applicable \"exclusively . . . to Nazis from the period of 1933 to 1945.\" <i>Id.</i> at 739. Had Naujalis been the member of an organization which did not exclusively engage in persecution &#8212; as is the case with Casta&#241;eda and his membership in the Peruvian army &#8212; the Seventh Circuit's analysis would have been entirely different. Given the Seventh Circuit's explanation of <i>Naujalis</i> in <i>Singh,</i> along with the other cases that have construed the relevant provisions of the INA, as opposed to the DPA, we are convinced that our approach is the correct one.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> As evidenced by the facts that the massacre occurred even though one of the blocking controls never reached its position and that no persons came down the path Casta&#241;eda's men were watching</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> We find that what might have occurred had a fleeing villager come down the path to be absolutely irrelevant and speculative, since Casta&#241;eda was there to intercept fleeing members of the Shining Path,<i>not</i> civilians.

The village's civilian inhabitants were herded into two homes; the army units fired and threw grenades into the houses and killed many women and children in the slaughter. The investigation concluded the operation amounted to genocide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lieutenant Casta&#241;eda, petitioner here, headed one of four army units involved in the military operation during which this massacre occurred. It is disputed whether he knew about the massacre before or while it took place. His patrol was assigned to and did block a possible escape route from the village, but there is no evidence that he was in the village during the massacre or that he personally killed anyone. He acknowledged that he was briefed on the operation beforehand and that all units during the operation had radios capable of radio contact, but he claimed that he had no radio contact with the units in the village that day and did not find out about the massacre until weeks later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding himself a potential target in the wake of his role in the operation, Casta&#241;eda came with his family to the United States on tourist visas in 1991, overstayed, and in 1993 applied for asylum and withholding of removal. By statute, an alien is not eligible for asylum and withholding of removal if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien ordered, incited, <i>assisted, or otherwise participated in</i> the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the government met its burden of making a prima facie case that Casta&#241;eda had \"assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution\" and that the burden of showing he had not done so has shifted to Casta&#241;eda. 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1208.13(c)(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2). It is also undisputed that the persecution was on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), and the initial asylum interviewing officer each found Casta&#241;eda had not met his burden because he was not credible. He was found not credible based both on observations of his demeanor and on the content of his testimony. The law requires courts to give great deference to those lack of credibility determinations, especially those based on direct observations of the alien's demeanor. The majority fails to accord the appropriate deference to the BIA and, rather than determining whether the record could reasonably be read to support the BIA, determines whether the record could reasonably be read to support Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> This is the wrong perspective, and having taken the wrong perspective, the majority reaches the wrong conclusion in holding that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having incorrectly applied the standard of review, the majority further errs in refusing to remand to the BIA to reconsider its determinations in light of the supposed failures in its reasoning and errs in concluding for itself that Casta&#241;eda was credible. Supreme Court precedent and the precedent of this circuit require that the agency be given an opportunity to reconsider, particularly when the BIA did not find it necessary to comment on all of the evidence relied upon by the IJ. The majority errs in holding as a matter of law that Casta&#241;eda was credible and that he had no knowledge of the massacre. The record does not compel either conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This sequence of errors has led the majority into yet a further error, one of great significance and going well beyond the particulars of this case. The majority takes a one-line statement by the BIA &#8212; that Casta&#241;eda still had not met his burden even assuming he was credible that he personally had not killed or harmed anyone &#8212; and draws two mistaken conclusions. First, it turns this into a statement that the BIA made a holding assuming Casta&#241;eda was credible in all of his testimony, including that he had no knowledge of the massacre. The BIA did not say this, and if there is any ambiguity, the case should be remanded for the BIA to clarify. Second, the majority sees in the BIA's statement a ruling of law on the relevance of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge about the massacre to the statutory exclusion for those who assist or otherwise participate in persecution. The BIA's statement means no such thing. The issue of the legal significance of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge was not raised or argued before the agency in the removal proceedings, but was rather raised sua sponte by this court, which asked for and received post-argument briefing on the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the position of the Attorney General that this issue of statutory interpretation is not before this court, was not raised or exhausted before the agency, and is committed in the first instance to the BIA, the majority nonetheless addresses the issue itself, contrary to both the exhaustion and <i>Chevron</i> doctrines. The majority's conclusion as a matter of law that Casta&#241;eda has met his burden of proving he was not a persecutor depends on the majority's implicitly deciding that knowledge is a requirement under the statute (contrary to the position stated by the Attorney General in his brief) and then on the majority's applying this newly formulated legal rule to its version of the facts of this case. The majority refuses to permit the agency to examine on remand the questions both of statutory interpretation and then of application of the legal standard to the facts. The majority concludes that Casta&#241;eda has established that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution and remands to the agency to consider only the question of whether he should be granted asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is wrong on all of these points and has overstepped the limited role assigned to the courts in reviewing decisions of the BIA in immigration cases. The proper outcome of this case is a simple affirmance of the BIA's decision on the grounds that the decision is based on substantial evidence that Casta&#241;eda has not met his burden and the record does not compel any other finding. There is no need to reach the other issues the majority reaches. More than that, courts are forbidden from denying the BIA the opportunity to interpret what the statute means. Accordingly, I dissent. I also attach to this dissent the decision of the BIA in this case, so it may be read directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are required to give deferential review to the BIA's findings. \"[A] decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(C).

In 1983, he graduated from a military academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant. In January 1985, Lieutenant Casta&#241;eda was transferred to anti-terrorist Battalion 34, stationed in Ayacucho, a province within the \"emergency zone\" and the historic birthplace of the Shining Path. This battalion, composed of five companies spread throughout the region, engaged in field operations. Casta&#241;eda was first assigned to be head of a twenty-man patrol in Sacchaeamba, which had two patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After three months, Casta&#241;eda transferred to another base, in Vilcashuan, again as head of one of two patrols. Casta&#241;eda was one of only a few officers at this base; besides himself, there was a captain and a base head. Casta&#241;eda was stationed there in August of 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1985, Casta&#241;eda was involved in a military operation, the details of which are at the center of this case. The operation involved four patrols. Two of the patrols, led by Sub-Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado and Lieutenant Riveri Rond&#243;n, were to enter the village of Llocllapampa, in the Accomarca region, to search for Shining Path members. Two other patrols, including Casta&#241;eda's, were assigned to block escape routes from the village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two main patrols entered the village and massacred as many as sixty-nine civilians. The massacre was reported by the media, and a formal investigation followed. A Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission found that Hurtado's patrol had herded the village inhabitants into two houses, open fired on them, lobbed grenades inside, and set fire to the houses. The Commission concluded that the operation amounted to genocide and found that \"[j]udging by the age of the people and the way they responded[,] it was clear that the people attacked and killed were defenseless.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission noted that Casta&#241;eda's patrol was \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\" But it also found that the massacre could not simply be attributed to a single out-of-control officer; instead it wrote that Hurtado \"is only a piece of a larger picture and it is necessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> The Commission left it to the Peruvian court system \"to determine ... the people responsible ... and apply punishments as dictated by the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The massacre was documented in the U.S. State Department's 1985 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Per&#250;. The report stated that \"an Army sub-lieutenant and three other officers were responsible for the Accomarca massacre of some 25 to 69 peasants.\" Casta&#241;eda admitted during testimony before the IJ that he was one of the officers referred to in the report. The report also said the men involved had been charged in the military and civilian court systems in Per&#250;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Peruvian Supreme Court decided the military courts, rather than the civilian courts, had jurisdiction, and Casta&#241;eda, along with Hurtado and others, was charged in a military court martial in 1986. Casta&#241;eda was charged with homicide and abuse of authority.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> Casta&#241;eda appeared in a military court on at least four occasions, represented by a civilian lawyer, and produced documents in his defense. He also testified in his own defense, answering questions from a judge and prosecutor. Casta&#241;eda was apparently acquitted of all charges at the court martial. He returned to duty thereafter and was eventually promoted to captain in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's application for asylum and other relief was based on his assertion that after the massacre, he was persecuted by the Shining Path.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a> Casta&#241;eda decided to leave Per&#250;. He obtained tourist visas for himself and his family, resigned from the military, and came to the United States in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1993, he and his family applied for asylum and withholding of removal. The claims for relief were initially denied by an agency hearing officer, who found, in a May 19, 1999 report explaining the denial, that Casta&#241;eda was ineligible for asylum because his testimony was \"only partially credible.\" The report stated that Casta&#241;eda's testimony about his duties as a military officer was \"vague and evasive,\" and that Casta&#241;eda's testimony regarding military practices was \"inconsistent with country condition information.\" Casta&#241;eda had \"denied awareness of any harm that occurred to captives,\" testified that suspected terrorists were turned over to a military intelligence unit, and \"testified not to have any knowledge of any harm that may have occurred to such persons.\" The report found it unlikely that a Peruvian military officer of Casta&#241;eda's era would have had \"such limited knowledge of the treatment of suspected terrorist[s].\" Casta&#241;eda's case was subsequently referred to an IJ for adjudication. The hearing officer's report was in the record before the IJ and BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hearings before the IJ focused on whether Casta&#241;eda was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he \"ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution\" of others on account of \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the applicable regulations, if evidence is produced \"indicat[ing]\" that an alien engaged in such behavior, the alien must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she did not do so. 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1208.13(c)(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2). The IJ found, and Casta&#241;eda does not dispute, that the government produced evidence indicating that Casta&#241;eda \"assisted, or otherwise participated\" in the Accomarca massacre. It is, as a result, undisputed that the burden lay with Casta&#241;eda to show that he did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Hearing Before the IJ</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda put on two types of evidence during an extended hearing before the IJ: his testimony about the events in question and a document purporting to be a judgment from a military tribunal acquitting him of certain charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified extensively about his military experiences both before and during August 1985. He testified that at both bases at which he was stationed in 1985, he headed one of two patrols. While one patrol was out on operations, the other stayed to protect the base. Casta&#241;eda indicated that his patrol went out on both combat and reconnaissance missions. The commander of the battalion was the person who determined the instructions the patrols were given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometimes the patrols were coordinated; sometimes they were independent. Casta&#241;eda testified that when the patrols were independent, the commander still let each patrol know where the others were. It was, he said, \"very important to coordinate the movement.\" Casta&#241;eda said his patrol would \"keep contact with the base by radio,\" and at least sometimes would make direct radio contact with other patrols in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that in August 1985, after several weeks of reconnaissance patrolling, he was ordered to go on a combat patrol in mobilized, coordinated activity with three other patrols. His order came from the base captain, following orders of the division command. Casta&#241;eda indicated that he was briefed in advance on the missions of the other three patrols involved in the operation. He was informed that there were forty to sixty Shining Path terrorists at a training center in the village. His patrol was ordered to deploy itself to a place where it could block the path providing an escape route from the village. His deployment position was, according to Casta&#241;eda, located three to five miles from the village. A second patrol was supposed to block the other exit to the village, but it never arrived at its position. The two remaining patrols were the active patrols whose mission was to go into the village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's patrol had twenty men, a radio, and a rocket launcher. He said it took approximately six hours to reach the deployment position. Once there, he testified, he and his troops hid themselves along the sides of the path. When he was in position, he radioed that fact back to the head of the base. He said he would have been in charge of deciding whether to open fire if anyone came along.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that he knew there would be an attack on the village, but was not told when the two lead patrols were ready to attack or when the attack began. He says he was told, via radio contact from the base, only when the attack was over. During the operation, he testified, no one came down the path and his patrol fired no shots. Other evidence in the record suggests the attack went on for two to three hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda denied hearing any radio communications from the attacking patrols during the mission. At first, when asked if he had been \"informed what frequencies the two attacking patrols would be using,\" he replied, \"That's correct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Shortly thereafter, however, he said he did not have the frequencies of the other patrols because he had not been given them. When asked whether the two attacking patrols had his patrol's radio frequency so that they could notify him of any escaping guerrillas, he said they did not. He maintained that each patrol could contact the base by radio, and the two attacking patrols could communicate with each other, but the attacking patrols, by contrast, could not communicate with the patrols blocking the escape routes. Casta&#241;eda was asked to reconcile this testimony about the lack of radio contact among all the patrols, particularly in a mission where multiple patrols were trying to coordinate an attack, with his earlier testimony that communication among patrols could be important. He responded that the attack had been centrally planned that way and that he was simply ordered to exercise his independent judgment in controlling exit points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the attack ended, Casta&#241;eda was ordered back to base by his base commander. He acknowledged that there was a debriefing. He testified that he did not find out about the massacre until weeks later, when he heard a report on civilian radio. He said he later found out that Hurtado had admitted to executing civilians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the subsequent court martial, Casta&#241;eda stated that he was acquitted of all charges, and produced a document purportedly showing that the Supreme Council of Military Justice had affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him. The document, dated April 4, 1989, stated in relevant part that Casta&#241;eda was charged with homicide and abuse of authority and that the charges were dismissed. It gave no reason for the dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda submitted no other documentation relating to the court martial. He did not introduce into his immigration proceedings a transcript of the military court proceedings or the documents he had used in his defense. He also offered no evidence as to what the elements of the charged crimes were, and therefore did little to prove the significance of the purported acquittal in determining whether he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. However, the U.S. State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Peru does corroborate Casta&#241;eda's ultimate acquittal, stating that \"all the other defendants\" besides Hurtado were \"acquitted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The IJ's Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ heard testimony from Casta&#241;eda in four separate sessions over the course of more than a month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> On October 4, 2004, the IJ concluded that Casta&#241;eda was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he had not proven that he did not \"assist[ ] or otherwise participate[ ]\" in politically motivated killings. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The IJ had three grounds for this conclusion. First, he rejected Casta&#241;eda's argument that the one-page Peruvian document dismissing the charges against him was sufficient to carry his burden. Second, he held that Casta&#241;eda was not credible and had not carried his burden for that reason. Third, the IJ held that even setting aside his credibility determination, Casta&#241;eda's \"motivation and intent [were] irrelevant,\" given that the \"objective effect of [his] participation in the Accomarca operation would have been to ... aid even in some small measure with the execution and murder and rape of those unarmed men, women, and children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ offered numerous grounds for the finding that Casta&#241;eda's testimony was not credible. First, the IJ wrote that he had \"carefully observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor ... and found him to be vague, evasive, and non-responsive during questioning by the Government prosecutor relating to his participation in the massacre at Accomarca and more importantly whether he was aware of that massacre.\" The IJ also found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive and non-responsive when asked why he did not have documentation from his court martial. The IJ further found that Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he did not have the radio frequencies for the other patrols the day of the massacre was \"wholly incredible,\" in part because he had earlier testified that radio contact among patrols could be important and in part because his demeanor indicated a lack of veracity. As to this demeanor finding, the IJ wrote that he \"observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor during this part of his testimony and found him to be extremely incredible.... [Casta&#241;eda was] blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate as compared with the rest of his testimony.\" The IJ also found incredible Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he did not find out about the massacre until weeks later, and then only from the media, especially considering his rank and his presence at briefings and debriefings. Finally, the IJ found incredible both Casta&#241;eda's testimony about his awareness of human rights violations in the emergency zone and his testimony about his knowledge of Hurtado's fate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The BIA Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the BIA, Casta&#241;eda first argued that the IJ should have deferred to the Peruvian tribunal's dismissal of the charges against him; he argued that the IJ's finding &#8212; that Casta&#241;eda failed to prove he had not assisted in persecution &#8212; was \"in direct contravention\" of the military court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA responded on several levels. First, it held that the IJ was correct about potential flaws in Casta&#241;eda's documentary evidence: there was some doubt about whether the acquittal document was properly authenticated, and further, other documents suggested that the military tribunal may have been a mechanism \"to grant impunity to the alleged persecutors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA held as a matter of law that dismissal of the charges in the military tribunal did not establish that Casta&#241;eda was not a persecutor. The government had argued that \"fail[ure] to meet the burden of proof in a criminal forum never ... proves that the defendant was factually innocent [and] ... [t]he legal presumption of innocence at a criminal proceeding cannot be substituted for independent facts which could have established [Casta&#241;eda's] burden of proof.\" Moreover, the government had noted that \"[t]here are many possible scenarios at a criminal trial that could conclude the proceedings in an acquittal without a determination of innocence.\" Agreeing with these arguments, the BIA concluded that Casta&#241;eda's \"evidence of his dismissal is not necessarily the legal equivalent of a criminal finding that he was innocent.\" It was Casta&#241;eda's burden to prove he did not assist or otherwise participate in the massacre; the military court document, which did not specify the reason for dismissal of the charges or offer any details on the charges themselves, did not establish that he had not assisted or otherwise participated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Casta&#241;eda had failed to meet his burden of proof, the BIA held that \"even if the respondent testified credibly that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985, there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as his patrol was charged with blocking an escape route for the villagers....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also affirmed on the separate basis that the IJ had not clearly erred in finding Casta&#241;eda less than credible. The BIA specifically referenced the IJ's finding that Casta&#241;eda's demeanor during a line of significant questioning indicated a lack of veracity, and affirmed the finding that Casta&#241;eda was \"evasive\" regarding his court martial. It also said that Casta&#241;eda's argument on appeal that he did not have access to a transcript or other documents from the court martial \"does not seem plausible,\" and that Casta&#241;eda did not \"provide any explanation for not providing [such documents].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also affirmed the IJ's conclusion that crucial portions of Casta&#241;eda's testimony were inconsistent and incredible and reached the same conclusion on its own review. The BIA found that the IJ had not erred in doubting the veracity of Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he had not been in radio contact with the other patrols the day of the killings (and thus had not been aware of the unfolding massacre), particularly because Casta&#241;eda's own testimony established that patrols sometimes made contact and that \"radio contact was important for purposes of coordination as well as efficiency and protection of the patrols.\" Further, the BIA affirmed the IJ's findings that Casta&#241;eda was not forthcoming about the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military and about the fate of Hurtado, the patrol commander charged with primary responsibility for the massacre. It concluded: \"In light of obvious media attention and international documentation of the massacre, as well as [Casta&#241;eda's] military position and subsequent accusations about his role, it was reasonable to expect him to provide answers regarding what occurred in Peru on and after August 8, particularly since he failed to provide adequate documentary evidence of his innocence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Adverse Credibility Determination</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA's adverse credibility determination, which in itself is sufficient to support the BIA's conclusion that Casta&#241;eda did not meet his burden. The IJ and BIA based their findings on Casta&#241;eda's demeanor and evasiveness and on the tendency for his testimony to be contradictory and non-responsive. The majority errs in dismissing this evidence and imposing its own view of the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to carry his burden, \"an alien must support his claim ... through credible testimony.\" <i>Nikijuluw v.

INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 570-71 (1st Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted). In other words, the strong deference we owe to BIA findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard applies even more so to adverse credibility determinations based on witness demeanor. <i>See Rodr&#237;guez Del Carmen v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 441 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Matters of witness credibility and demeanor are peculiarly for the factfinder,\" and credibility determinations supported with specific findings are treated \"`with great respect.'\" (quoting <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ said he had \"carefully observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor\" and had concluded that Casta&#241;eda was not telling the truth about his role in the massacre. More specifically, the IJ had observed Casta&#241;eda's demeanor during his testimony about radio contact and found him \"extremely incredible.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ also found that Casta&#241;eda was \"extremely vague, evasive, and non-responsive\" when cross-examined by the government attorney about the massacre and the events following and about his lack of documentary evidence of the court martial. The BIA found no error in any of these findings, and its decision was reasonable, as the following examples show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Casta&#241;eda's testimony, he appeared to contradict himself, and failed to give direct answers, in response to a series of questions about whether he had had the other patrols' radio frequencies on the day of the massacre. Casta&#241;eda initially indicated that he had had such frequencies, and then stated that he had not. At some point, the IJ stepped in to get a straight answer from an evasive witness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ: Sir, it still hasn't been answered though. Could you contact the other two patrols by radio, yes or no?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: No. I did not on my radio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ: That's not what I asked. Could you contact them by radio, yes or no?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: No. I could not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the cross-examination, Casta&#241;eda was asked what had happened in the village the day of the massacre, and he replied: \"One of the patrols ... committed excesses.\" He then claimed that he did not know until his appearance before the IJ how many villagers had been killed, and that such information was never discussed during his court martial. Information about the number of deaths, however, appears to have been widely circulated following the massacre, and such information was discussed in the report of the Peruvian Human Rights Commission, which led to the court martial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still later, Casta&#241;eda was confronted with a 1985 State Department report stating that \"an army sub-lieutenant and three other officers\" were responsible for the massacre. The government attorney asked him whether the report was \"talking about you.\" Again, the witness was evasive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: They are talking about the patrol head of that commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ: Sir, are they talking about you, yes or no?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: Yes. They are talking about me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also substantial record support for the finding that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about his knowledge about Hurtado.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> In response to repeated questions, Casta&#241;eda denied having any positive knowledge about whether Hurtado had been discharged from the military. Yet when confronted with a human rights report from the U.S. State Department, he admitted to \"find[ing] out through public media when [he] was here in the United States\" that Hurtado had been promoted to captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These examples suffice to demonstrate a substantial basis in the record for the conclusion that Casta&#241;eda was evasive and non-responsive, and for the BIA's refusal to believe his story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda and the majority take issue with several of the subsidiary bases for the BIA's and IJ's adverse credibility determinations. Casta&#241;eda argues, for instance, that the BIA erroneously disbelieved his testimony about lack of radio contact with other patrols, and that it erroneously found him evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations committed by the Peruvian military. The majority agrees and adopts similar criticisms of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the radio issue, the BIA found unlikely Casta&#241;eda's testimony that on the day of the massacre, not only did he not have radio contact with the other patrols, but he did not even know the frequency they were using. The BIA relied in part on Casta&#241;eda's earlier testimony that he sometimes had had direct radio contact with other patrols; the BIA said this testimony was \"inconsistent\" with Casta&#241;eda's assertions about the day of the massacre. In a sense, it was not \"inconsistent\" for Casta&#241;eda to deny radio contact on the day of the massacre, since, as the majority notes, he had said that he only sometimes had radio contact with other patrols. But this criticism misses the BIA's point that this operation was a coordinated combat mission, out of the ordinary, and it was much more likely in such a circumstance that the two attacking patrols would have at least had the capability to contact Casta&#241;eda's patrol by radio, both to provide Casta&#241;eda with information on escaping guerrillas and to call in the assistance of Casta&#241;eda's patrol if needed. If radio contact among patrols was at least sometimes used, this would have seemed the time to make contact possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the issue of human rights violations, Casta&#241;eda did, after some questioning, admit that he was aware of extrajudicial killings by the Peruvian army, and that members of the armed forces had been responsible for disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. But one could view the record as showing evasiveness. The BIA could reasonably have considered that Casta&#241;eda's new-found relative candor as to human rights abuses contrasted sharply with Casta&#241;eda's initial asylum interview, when he was asked the same question and found both not candid and not credible. The BIA could have considered that Casta&#241;eda might have wanted to downplay the significance of his knowledge of a pattern of human rights abuses by the Peruvian military before the events in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's additional bases for its adverse credibility determination are also substantially supported. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Casta&#241;eda's failure to provide more documentary evidence from his court martial reflected negatively on his credibility because such evidence should have been available to him. <i>See Estrada-Henao v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 453 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir.2006) (holding that lack of documentation is \"not automatically fatal\" but that \"where documentation would naturally be expected, its lack can count against the applicant\"). Casta&#241;eda was asked during proceedings before the IJ whether there was any written accounting of the facts that would support his account of the day of the massacre. He said he had submitted documents to the court martial, but did not have them for the immigration proceeding. Given the formal nature of the court martial and the fact that Casta&#241;eda was able to procure the dismissal-of-charges document and other documents from Peru, the BIA's conclusion that Casta&#241;eda's credibility was weakened by his failure to produce additional documentation is supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also upheld the IJ's conclusion that given Casta&#241;eda's position as head of one patrol in the joint operation, his \"entire testimony regarding how he found out about [the massacre] only from the media is wholly incredible.\" The IJ reasonably concluded that it was unlikely that information that two patrols had just killed over five dozen men, women, and children would not find its way to the third patrol that participated in the same operation, and particularly to the head of that patrol. The practice of debriefings only made it even more likely that Casta&#241;eda would have learned about the atrocities engaged in by the other patrols before the media did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the BIA's adverse credibility determination survives substantial evidence review, and that requires affirmance. The majority sees in the record insufficient evidence of Casta&#241;eda's participation in the massacre, finding the evidence of evasiveness and inconsistencies to be too ambiguous. The majority forgets, however, that the burden was on Casta&#241;eda to prove he had not assisted or otherwise participated, and that therefore the question is not whether there was sufficient evidence that he participated, but whether there was sufficient evidence that he did not. Since there is substantial evidence to support the BIA's finding that Casta&#241;eda's credibility was questionable, and since Casta&#241;eda relied almost exclusively on his testimony for evidence, the BIA's decision must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Significance of the Peruvian Court's Dismissal of Charges</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda and the majority fault the BIA for failing to accord the proper weight to the Peruvian court's dismissal of the court martial charges against Casta&#241;eda. They are mistaken, however, in arguing that the dismissal is itself sufficient to carry his burden of proof, and indeed, the BIA was not mistaken in according the bare dismissal very little weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's main argument is that the BIA erred in concluding that the Peruvian court martial was a whitewash and in \"disregard[ing]\" that court's dismissal of the charges against him. The BIA did not disregard the Peruvian judgment; it merely evaluated that evidence and found it not to be particularly helpful for Casta&#241;eda. The BIA also did not rest its conclusion as to the dismissal's limited significance on a finding that the court martial was a fraud. The BIA did say that the IJ had so concluded, and noted that \"there [was] evidence\" to support the conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a> The BIA then gave two other reasons. First, there was no evidence as to the grounds on which charges were dismissed, and a dismissal of criminal charges may not be the result of an acquittal on the merits. Second, dismissal of criminal charges on any grounds &#8212; even acquittal on the merits &#8212; is not the same as a finding of innocence on those particular charges. Given the divergent burdens of proof, the mere fact that a defendant has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean he is more likely innocent than not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's reasoning is entirely sound. Furthermore, Casta&#241;eda was charged in the court martial with homicide and abuse of authority. The elements of those crimes are not the same as the standards under immigration law to find an alien statutorily ineligible for asylum. A finding that an alien was acquitted on homicide and abuse-of-authority charges does not establish that he did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution. The BIA was justified in affording only limited significance to the dismissal of charges against Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority improperly faults the BIA for the \"unreasonable\" requirement of \"an actual finding of `innocent.'\" But this is not what the BIA required. The BIA required Casta&#241;eda to provide a different showing &#8212; that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution. This requirement is not only reasonable; it is mandated. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1208.13(c)(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Majority's Failure to Remand</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the majority were correct in finding fault with the BIA's credibility decision, the majority commits serious error in (a) not remanding to the BIA for further consideration, (b) determining itself that Casta&#241;eda is credible, and (c) finding that his credible testimony means that, as a matter of law, he has met his burden and the BIA may no longer consider the question of whether Casta&#241;eda assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. In addition, and for other reasons, the issue of statutory interpretation implicit in the majority's holding should also have been remanded, as discussed later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a reviewing court finds flaws in the reasoning of the BIA as to the evidence of record, it is ordinarily required to remand to the agency for further investigation or explanation.

This is because immigration decisions often involve matters on which the BIA can bring its particular expertise to bear. <i>See Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 17, 123 S.Ct. 353 (finding that agency expertise on country conditions supported remand as a remedy). Indeed, this court has held that the more an issue relates to matters within an administrative agency's particular expertise, the less willing a court should be to decide an issue itself. <i>See R.I. Higher Educ. Assistance Auth.,</i> 929 F.2d at 857 (\"[T]he more imbricated a matter, the more cautious a reviewing court should be about attempting to resolve the issue itself, rather than remanding to the agency.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinary rule applies with full force here, and even if in rare circumstances a reviewing court could eschew remand, this is not such a case. Even if the BIA's reasoning as to the finding that Casta&#241;eda lacked credibility were flawed, the majority is not correct in finding that the evidence <i>compels</i> exactly the opposite conclusion: that Casta&#241;eda is credible. That is especially so because Casta&#241;eda bears the burden to show his credibility. The BIA did not find it necessary to comment on all of the reasons the IJ gave for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible &#8212; for example, on the point that Casta&#241;eda was vague and evasive concerning how he learned about the massacre. The BIA must be given the opportunity to reconsider such evidence. An appellate court should not, as the majority does, make a credibility finding, especially in a case such as this one involving \"witness demeanor\" and \"conflicting or confused testimony.\" <i>Cf. Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 491. The majority cites no case in which an appellate court made its own credibility finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there are other reasons to remand. Although the majority faults the BIA for allegedly failing to accord appropriate deference to the judgment of the Peruvian military court, the majority apparently does not assert that this judgment alone satisfies Casta&#241;eda's burden. The BIA must be allowed to reconsider its decision in light of the majority's ruling on the appropriate view of the foreign judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority further errs in holding that Casta&#241;eda met his burden to show that he did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution. The majority improperly reads into the BIA's decision a holding it did not make, then improperly decides a novel issue of statutory interpretation, and finally improperly applies its newly formulated rule to the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority reads the BIA's opinion to have stated a holding assuming that Casta&#241;eda did not know about the massacre. No such holding can be found. The BIA's opinion addressed the dismissal of the court martial charges against Casta&#241;eda and the correctness of the credibility determination made by the IJ. The only sentence discussing an alternate holding states that in the BIA's opinion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">even if the respondent testified credibly <i>that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985,</i> there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as his patrol was charged with blocking an escape route for the villagers and people located in the emergency zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). The majority finds that this lone sentence, together with its citation to a page in the IJ's opinion and to <i>In re Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811 (BIA 1988), suffices to open the door to the majority's conclusions: (a) that as a matter of law, a person without prior or contemporaneous knowledge of the persecution cannot have assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution within the meaning of the statutes at issue here by blocking an escape route for those persecuted, and (b) that because the record purportedly compels the conclusion that Casta&#241;eda had no such knowledge in this case, Casta&#241;eda has met his burden to show that he did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is simply wrong in all of this. First, the majority is wrong to find in the BIA's opinion any holding that takes into account the state of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge. The BIA did not say that it was assuming all of Casta&#241;eda's testimony was credible, only that even if Casta&#241;eda had not harmed or killed anyone on the day of the massacre, this did not establish that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the massacre. The cited portion of the IJ's opinion merely supports this proposition by finding Casta&#241;eda's \"motivation and intent\" largely irrelevant: the majority agrees that this is the established rule. <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Majano</i> also supports this proposition by incidentally mentioning that one can participate in persecution without directly harming anyone by having an \"objective effect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 815. Neither the IJ nor <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Majano</i> considered whether knowledge has any bearing on a finding that an alien assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. The BIA did not consider this point either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is any ambiguity as to what the BIA held, or questions about the basis for the BIA's holding, the majority is required to remand to the BIA for further explanation. <i>See Halo v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 419 F.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir.2005) (\"The BIA offered no further explanation for its conclusions. Lacking such explanation, and given that the final agency decision does not rest on a lack-of-credibility determination, we are left with significant questions about the justifications for the denial. We therefore vacate the BIA's order and remand.\"). The majority is not free to decide the case on grounds not addressed by the BIA. <i>See Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 44 (\"`[A] reviewing court ... must judge the propriety of [administrative] action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting <i>SEC v. Chenery Corp.,</i> 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority attempts to obscure the fact that it is deciding the issue, unaddressed by the BIA, of whether knowledge of a massacre can be a requirement to a finding that an alien assisted or otherwise participated in that massacre. The majority does so by repeatedly asserting its prior improper conclusion that Casta&#241;eda did not know about the massacre, and then assuming this lack of knowledge as a background fact in its analysis of the \"objective effect\" of Casta&#241;eda's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that the majority is saying that even if Casta&#241;eda knew full well that the villagers would be massacred, he still would not have assisted or otherwise participated in the massacre. If that is what the majority means, its holding is both irrational and flatly contrary to the \"objective effect\" line of cases that the majority cites.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> The majority cites no case <i>holding</i> that those with lesser tasks &#8212; such as blocking escape routes &#8212; should not be barred as persecutors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a> To be clear, the calculus might be different if Casta&#241;eda did not know about the atrocities, but that issue is one for the BIA to address in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The logic of the majority's opinion thus depends upon its reaching and resolving an issue of statutory interpretation, namely whether knowledge is a factor that must be considered in determining whether an alien \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i) and 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The majority errs in deciding this issue without a ruling on it by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles in this case are clear. \"We review de novo an agency's construction of a statute that it administers, although subject to established principles of deference.\" <i>Griffiths v. INS,</i> 243 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2001). \"Under those principles of deference, if the intent of Congress is clear, it must govern, but where the statute is silent or ambiguous on an issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing, inter alia, <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778). \"Since agency officials acting in the immigration context `exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,' deference to administrative expertise is particularly appropriate.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <i>Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. at 110, 108 S.Ct. 904).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA must be given the first opportunity to rule on questions of statutory interpretation. It is only through such a ruling that the BIA can fulfill its role in \"`the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'\" <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 392, 396 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Morton v. Ruiz,</i> 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974)). Such a ruling is also necessary for the BIA to bring to bear its specialized \"expertise in matters of foreign policy.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA has not had this opportunity here. The record shows that this knowingness issue of statutory interpretation was not raised or argued before it, and was only the subject of supplemental briefing in this court, after this court sua sponte raised the issue at oral argument. As a result, because Casta&#241;eda did not clearly present this issue to the BIA, we in fact lack the authority to even consider it. <i>See Olujoke v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir.2005). Further, even if Casta&#241;eda had exhausted his administrative remedies, he would have waived the argument by failing to make it in his initial brief to this court. <i>See Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc.,</i> 439 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority cannot defend its decision to interpret the statute itself as encompassing a knowledge requirement on the ground that the role it assigns knowledge is required by the plain meaning of the statute. That argument is foreclosed by <i>Fedorenko v. United States,</i> 449 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 737, 66 L.Ed.2d 686 (1981). <i>Fedorenko</i> involved a similar provision, which precluded admission to the United States under the Displaced Persons Act of aliens \"who had assisted the enemy in persecuting\" civilians. <i>Id.</i> at 495, 101 S.Ct. 737. Fedorenko, who said he was a prisoner of war who had been forced to serve as a guard in a Nazi concentration camp, argued the exclusion did not apply to him because his service had been involuntary. The Supreme Court held that the statute did not include the term \"voluntary\" and the Court was \"not at liberty to imply a condition\" into the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 513, 101 S.Ct. 737. The Court commented that the administrative interpretation of the exclusion was that it applied whether or not the assistance was voluntary and whether or not the alien had participated in the persecution himself. <i>Id.</i> at 499, 101 S.Ct. 737. The Court also noted the need for strict compliance with all statutory preconditions to naturalization given that \"Congress alone has ... constitutional authority\" in this area. <i>Id.</i> at 506, 101 S.Ct. 737. Finally, the Court held that the federal courts lacked equitable power to vary the terms of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 516-18, 101 S.Ct. 737.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain text of the statutes at issue here contains no \"knowledge\" qualifier to a finding that an alien \"assisted or otherwise participated\" in persecution. Indeed, the majority does not claim that the statute unambiguously contains a knowledge qualifier. Rather, the majority effectively holds that knowledge is a factor which the BIA must consider. Not only is such a factor nowhere to be found in the statutory text, but determining which factors to consider in applying a statute is even more clearly the province of the BIA. <i>See Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439 (faulting the Ninth Circuit for \"fail[ing] to accord the required level of deference\" to the BIA by requiring that it \"examin[e] additional factors\"). Such factors are to be developed by the BIA \"`through a process of case-by-case adjudication'\", <i>id.</i> at 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439 (quoting <i>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 448-49, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)), and cannot be found in the statutory text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority errs in making its own findings of fact and then in determining that these facts dictate a holding that Casta&#241;eda did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution. It is the BIA's role to \"determin[e] the facts and decid[e] whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term.\" <i>Thomas,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1615. The majority claims that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">we are presented with the following set of facts: (1) the uncontradicted evidence is that the purpose of the Operation was directed at the Shining Path guerillas in the village, <i>not</i> civilians; (2) Casta&#241;eda and his men were hidden in the jungle three to five miles from the village and about thirty meters from the path they were guarding; (3) during the time they were there, they did not see or hear anyone, nor did they fire any shots; (4) they never entered the village and never directly or indirectly participated in the killings of the villagers, which was carried out by a rogue patrol led by Hurtado in a previously unplanned manner; (5) Casta&#241;eda and his men lacked any control or authority over this rogue patrol; and (6) they did not know what occurred in the village during the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not true. Neither the IJ nor the BIA found or assumed that Casta&#241;eda had established that there was no order allowing the patrols to harm civilians who were known to have harbored the Shining Path, that Hurtado's patrol was a rogue patrol acting entirely on its own, or that Casta&#241;eda had no knowledge of the massacre before or as it was happening. The record does not compel any of these conclusions. Even if the record compelled these conclusions, the BIA must be given the opportunity to apply the majority's newly formulated rule to the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the majority opinion has not only erred, but it is at odds with the statutory mandate, the decisions of the Supreme Court, and our own prior case law. Asylum is not a right; it is a privilege. <i>See Fedorenko,</i> 449 U.S. at 518, 101 S.Ct. 737 (\"`An alien who seeks political rights as a member of this Nation can rightfully obtain them only upon the terms and conditions specified by Congress.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Ginsberg,</i> 243 U.S. 472, 474-75, 37 S.Ct. 422, 61 L.Ed. 853 (1917))). Congress has decided that privilege does not extend to those who assist or otherwise participate in persecution within the meaning of the statute, as reasonably interpreted by the BIA.

Rather, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents' applications for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158, 1231(b)(3), respectively, because he found the lead respondent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> statutorily for having ordered, incited, or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. <i>See</i> sections 208(b)(2)(A)(i) and 241(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). Specifically, the immigration Judge found that the lead respondent, who was a member of the armed forces in Peru and patrol leader of one four units assigned to patrol an \"emergency zone\" in the state of Accomarca (I.J. at 7), participated in a military operation on August 8, 1985, which resulted in a massacre of innocent civilians, an event which a human rights commission has labeled as genocide (Exh. 35; I.J. at 8). In concluding its investigation, the human rights commission apparently recommended that the respondent be tried in civil court, as opposed to a military court martial (I.J. at 9; Exh. 35), and as noted by the Immigration Judge, the Department of State County Reports for 1985 (Exh. 40) detail that the respondent and other military leaders involved in the incident were charged in both civil and military courts (I.J. at 9-11). The respondent admitted that he was one of the leaders referred to in the Country Reports which indicated that the Peruvian Supreme Court was to decide final jurisdictional issue, the Immigration Judge concluded that the Supreme Court had decided that the respondent would be tried in military court because the respondent was able to produces a copy of the Peruvian Supreme Council of Military Justice's affirmance of a lower court's dismissal of murder charges against him (I.J. at 11; Exh. 24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the respondents that the immigration Judge erred in not giving deference to the foreign military court's decision dismissing the charges against him, a decision which goes against the \"principle of international comity\" (Respondents' Br. At 9-10). Furthermore, he asserts that the documentary evidence relied on by the Immigration Judge to deem the military court's dismissal as having less weight were general in nature and did not contradict the respondent's evidence (Respondents' Br. at 10-11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted by the Immigration Judge, there is some doubt about the validity of the respondent's evidence Inasmuch as it was not properly authenticated and also appeared to have been issued by the clerk's office of the Supreme Council of Military Justice and not by the Supreme Council itself (I.J. at 11-12). Furthermore, no other documents regarding the respondent's trial were submitted in order to determine the exact grounds for dismissing the respondent's military court martial and the documentary evidence of record indicates that there is evidence that the military tribunal was a way in which to grant impunity to the alleged persecutors who took part in the August 8, 1985, massacre (Exh. 41; I.J. at 3436; Tr. at 439-46; <i>see also</i> Exh. 43). As pointed out by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service); the respondent's evidence of this dismissal is not necessarily the legal equivalent of a criminal finding that he was innocent, particularly without additional evidence to indicate the court's reasoning (DHS's Br. at 4). In sum, we find no error in the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proving that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution of villagers in Accomarca based on their political opinion (I.J. at 36); even if the respondent testified credibly that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985, there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confined them, inasmuch as his patrol was charted with blocking an escape route for the villagers and people located in the emergency zone (I.J. at 36; See Tr. at 201, 351-55). <i>Matter of Rodriguez-Majano,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 811 (BIA 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent was not completely credible and affirm the denial of relief on this basis as well (I.J. at 37-43). The Immigration Judge found the respondent evasive regarding his military court martial and, as already noted, the respondent failed to provide documentary evidence such as a transcript of the hearing which would have shed greater light on his activities during the August 8, 1985 patrol (I.J. at 37-38, 40; Tr. at 411-32, 435-53, 456-73). The respondent's assertion on appeal that he may not have had access to these documents does not seem plausible nor does he provide any explanation for not providing them (Respondents' Br. at 13).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Immigration Judge relied on the fact that he respondent gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether and when he was in radio contact with the other patrol involved in the August 8 patrol, indicating early in his testimony that it was important always to have radio contact and later stating that he was not in radio contact with the patrols on the day of the massacre (I.J. at 38-41; Tr. at 314-16, 329-34, 366-75); the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent's demeanor during this portion of questioning was also indicative of a lack of veracity (I.J. at 40). The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge misconstrued his statements because he testified that radio contact between patrols was made <i>sometimes</i> (Respondents' Br. at 14; I.J. at 41). We disagree with the respondent that the Immigration Judge's determination \"ventured into the realm of Peruvian military tactics, an arena outside of his knowledge and expertise\" (Respondents' Br. at 15). Based on the respondent's own testimony, is clear that radio contact was important for purposes of coordination as well as efficiency and protection of the patrols (<i>See, e.g.,</i> Tr. at 314).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Immigration Judge found the respondent evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations by the military which has been documented by the Department of State (I.J. at 41-42) and that the respondent was not forthcoming about the judgement entered against one of his fellow commanders (I.J. at 42-43). The respondent argues that knowledge of another's fate is irrelevant and immaterial to his case (Respondents' Br. at 15); he states that the Immigration Judge misconstrued the respondent's testimony about his fellow commander's fate (Respondents' Br. at 17 (citing Tr. at 440)). While it may be true that the respondent, a patrol leader, lacked knowledge regarding the events which took place following the August 8 massacre, including whether and how many people were killed as well as the outcome of his fellow officers' court martials, we also cannot find clear error in the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent was evasive. In light of obvious media attention and international documentation of the massacre, as well as the respondent's military position and subsequent accusations about his role, it was reasonable to expect him to provide answer regarding what occurred in Peru on an after August 8, particularly since he failed to provide adequate documentary evidence of his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ORDER: The Respondents' appeal is dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge's order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions se forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the female respondents (A70 700 783, 70 700 782, and 70 701 180) are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). <i>See</i> Section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1240.26(c), (f).

Moreover, those who actually heard Casta&#241;eda's testimony are in a much better position than this court to weigh the effects of any translation difficulties. Similarly, the majority's assertions that Casta&#241;eda misunderstood some questions or was interrupted by the judge might be<i>possible</i> readings of the record, but the record certainly does not <i>compel</i> such conclusions, and we are in a poor position to judge such matters from the transcript alone.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn42\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42_ref\">42</a>\n        <p> The majority objects to my account of the facts as unduly recounting \"the actions of persons for whom Casta&#241;eda was not responsible and who were without his command or authority.\" I am merely recounting, however, the persecution that Casta&#241;eda is supposed to have assisted or participated in. The evidence of such persecution was properly before the IJ and BIA. The majority also appears to complain that the extent of the persecution is irrelevant and should be ignored.

In any event, regardless of whether the majority's reading is a plausible one, it is equally plausible, and reasonable on the part of the IJ and BIA, to read Casta&#241;eda's testimony as unduly attempting to minimize his knowledge of the massacre</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn49\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49_ref\">49</a>\n        <p> The majority's claim &#8212; that the issue of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge about Hurtado is a \"red herring\" &#8212; is puzzling. As the majority itself notes, \"Casta&#241;eda's case is based on his disassociation from Hurtado's actions.\" The BIA and IJ were entirely justified in presuming that evasiveness as to Casta&#241;eda's later knowledge about Hurtado's fate indicated a lack of credibility regarding his earlier knowledge about Hurtado's actions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn50\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50_ref\">50</a>\n        <p> Of course, such information need not have been \"openly discuss[ed]\" in order to have been shared</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn51\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51_ref\">51</a>\n        <p> For example, Lieutenant Hurtado, who led one of the combat patrols into the village, was acquitted of first-degree murder charges and convicted only of abuse of authority.

The majority objects that <i>Naujalis</i> is a case about Nazi guards and that Peruvian military guards, unlike Nazi guards, can serve legitimate purposes.

He and his family entered the United States with tourist visas at Miami, Florida, on August 19, 1991. They overstayed, and Casta&#241;eda applied for asylum in January 1993, claiming that he and his family had been persecuted by the terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (\"Shining Path\") while they were in Per&#250;.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Casta&#241;eda was interviewed at the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (\"INS\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> asylum office on May 19, 1999.

On July 7, 1999, the INS issued Notices to Appear (\"NTA\") to Casta&#241;eda and his family, charging them with removability under Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States for a time longer than permitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning February 16, 2000, Casta&#241;eda and his family appeared at twelve different hearings before two different Immigration Judges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Casta&#241;eda was the only person to testify at the hearings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We glean the following facts from his testimony and the evidence presented at the hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda joined the Peruvian military in 1979. In 1983, upon graduation from military academy, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to a motorized infantry battalion. His original duties included teaching military training, such as the use of weaponry, handling of prisoners, community service, and guarding equipment. After twelve months, Casta&#241;eda was transferred to another unit in Tumbes, a region in northern Per&#250; near the border with Ecuador. Casta&#241;eda testified that, during this time, the military was fighting the Shining Path. Most of this fighting, however, occurred in the Ayacucho region in the Andes, approximately 400 miles to the south of Tumbes. While at Tumbes, Casta&#241;eda was a platoon commander and his duties included training and instructing the men in his section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1985, Casta&#241;eda was transferred to Battalion 34, an anti-terrorist battalion. Battalion 34 was located in the Ayacucho region, which is the birthplace of the Shining Path, and was referred to as the \"emergency zone\" due to the Shining Path's presence in the region.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The battalion was divided into different bases. Each base was led by a captain or lieutenant. According to Casta&#241;eda, each base had around forty men. Casta&#241;eda's responsibilities increased in Battalion 34, as his duties included both training and leading troops out on patrols. Upon his arrival at Battalion 34, Casta&#241;eda was assigned to a base in Sacchaeamba, a rural mountainous area. Casta&#241;eda was the head of a twenty-man patrol, and went out on his first patrol one day after arriving at Sacchaeamba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that a major whose code name was Wolf instructed him on what areas to patrol. Wolf, who was not at Casta&#241;eda's base, would communicate the patrol area to the commander of the base by radio. The base commander would then relay that information to Casta&#241;eda. Casta&#241;eda testified that, at times, the patrol route was very specific, while at other times the patrol route was general and it was left up to Casta&#241;eda to decide the route. Casta&#241;eda also testified that his patrol sometimes operated independently of other patrols, while at other times his patrol's movements were coordinated with the movements of other patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that when he was on an independent patrol his base commander would inform him of other patrols' positions via radio in order to avoid overlapping. He also testified that he sometimes made direct radio contact with other patrols, and that it was important to know the location of other patrols in the area in order to coordinate movement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> When there were several patrols conducting a mission, Casta&#241;eda testified that each patrol leader responded to his base commander, who in turn responded to the battalion commander, who coordinated the mission with other base commanders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Casta&#241;eda, before going out on any patrol, he was briefed on the mission of the patrol by the base commander. He was given an order that explained the situation on the ground, the possible location of the enemy, what the patrol would be doing on the mission, what route to take, and what equipment to carry. If, while on patrol, one of his men was injured, Casta&#241;eda was instructed to radio the base so that the man could be evacuated. He also had flares in the event that radio communication was down. Casta&#241;eda testified that at times he had difficulty making radio contact due to interference caused by the dense terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were two types of patrols, combat and reconnaissance. Combat patrols engaged the enemy, while reconnaissance patrols gathered information. Most of the patrols were conducted at night in order to avoid detection by the Shining Path. Casta&#241;eda testified that if, while on a reconnaissance patrol, he received intelligence that the Shining Path was in the area, he would immediately radio the base commander for instructions on what action to take. He could not engage the enemy without approval from his commander unless the patrol was being attacked or was in some sort of danger. Casta&#241;eda testified that, during his time at Sacchaeamba, he went on approximately twenty-five patrols, most of them reconnaissance. He never had any direct contact with the Shining Path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in June or July of 1985, Casta&#241;eda, while still in Battalion 34, was transferred to a base in Vilcashuan, where he remained the head of a patrol. He testified that the procedures and missions were the same as they had been at the base in Sacchaeamba.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda further testified that he was involved in a significant operation (the \"Operation\") in August 1985, about a month after he arrived at the base in Vilcashuan. The Operation involved four patrols. Two patrols, code-named Links 6 and Links 7, were to enter a village named Llocllapampa in the Accomarca zone<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> to search for Shining Path members. Links 7 was led by Sub-Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado (\"Hurtado\"), and Links 6 was led by Lieutenant Riveri Rond&#243;n (\"Rond&#243;n\"). Two other patrols were assigned to block escape routes from the village.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Casta&#241;eda led one of these blocking patrols, code-named Tiger. Casta&#241;eda could not remember the name of the leader of the other blocking patrol, code-named Wolf. According to Casta&#241;eda, he received his orders a few hours before his patrol left from his base commander, who received them from the command of the division located in the city of Humanaga. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was briefed on the mission of the other patrols before he left. He was told that there were between forty and sixty Shining Path guerrillas in the village. Casta&#241;eda's patrol took vehicles part of the way and went on foot the rest of the way. Casta&#241;eda and his men were armed with machine guns and a rocket launcher. They wore Peruvian military uniforms and also had masks on, both to avoid recognition by the Shining Path and to keep their faces warm. One of Casta&#241;eda's men had a radio to contact their base commander. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was near his radio operator during the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's patrol was the first to arrive at its destination. Once at the assigned location, which was three to five miles away from the village, Casta&#241;eda separated his men into three groups. They hid themselves about thirty meters from different sides of the path. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was the one who would have made the decision whether to open fire if anyone came down the path. He testified that he was in radio contact with his base commander, who relayed any information Casta&#241;eda provided back to the division headquarters. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was not informed when the other patrols were ready to attack and he did not know when the attack began. Casta&#241;eda testified that he was only able to communicate with his base; he did not have the frequencies for any of the other patrols and therefore could not hear any of their communications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Casta&#241;eda also stated that none of the other patrols had his frequency, although each of the two attacking patrols had the other's frequency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently, the Wolf blocking patrol got lost and never reached its assigned destination. Casta&#241;eda testified that the two other patrols, Links 6 and 7, entered the village and massacred civilians.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> A subsequent report by a Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission (\"Human Rights Commission\") found that up to sixty-nine civilians were killed, including many women and children. According to Casta&#241;eda, he did not find out about the massacre until nearly three weeks after the Operation, when he heard that Hurtado had admitted to executing civilians. He stated that he heard this news on conventional radio. He testified that he did not learn exactly how many civilians were killed because different reports contained different estimates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> According to Casta&#241;eda, he and his men stayed in their positions until his base commander told him the Operation was over and ordered him to return to base. Casta&#241;eda testified that he and his men never saw anyone come down the path and never fired any shots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Once back at base, he was debriefed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">News of the massacre was eventually reported by various media outlets and a formal investigation followed. Casta&#241;eda testified before a Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission on September 26, 1985. He was represented by a military lawyer at the hearing. The Human Rights Commission concluded that what occurred during the Operation amounted to genocide. It noted that the probable number of people killed in the massacre was sixty-nine, but that it was hard to determine the exact number because many of the bodies had been destroyed by explosions from grenades. It also noted that Casta&#241;eda's patrol, Tiger, was \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The Human Rights Commission found that Links 7, under Hurtado's command, was the group that carried out the massacre.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The massacre was also documented by the State Department's 1985 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Per&#250;. The 1985 State Department Report states that \"[a]n Army sub-lieutenant and three other officers were responsible for the Accomarca massacre of some 25 to 69 peasants. A separate investigation by the Senate Human Rights Commission supported these conclusions.\" Casta&#241;eda admitted that he was one of the officers referred to in the 1985 State Department Report. The 1985 State Department Report indicated that the men involved in the massacre were charged in the military and civilian systems, and that the Peruvian Supreme Court would decide final jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Human Rights Commission recommended that those involved be tried in civilian &#8212; as opposed to military &#8212; court. However, the Peruvian Supreme Court decided that the military courts had jurisdiction. Casta&#241;eda, along with Hurtado, Rond&#243;n, and the officer who led the missing Wolf patrol, was charged in a military court martial in March or April 1986. Casta&#241;eda was charged with first degree murder, homicide, and abuse of authority. In connection with the court martial, Casta&#241;eda appeared in a military court four or five times. He was represented by a civilian lawyer that he paid for. A judge presided over the proceedings. At the court martial, Casta&#241;eda testified in his own defense, answering questions from the judge and the prosecutor. He stated that he did not know if he had the right to examine other witnesses and did not remember if he was told that he had that right, but that no witnesses testified at any of the hearings. When asked by the government what evidence the prosecution presented against him, Casta&#241;eda stated that \"[t]hey didn't show me evidence regarding the patrol that I had.\" Casta&#241;eda's evidence included the presentation of an operation chart that specified the position of each patrol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda stated that he was found innocent of all charges. In support of this, he produced a document from the Supreme Council of Military Justice showing that the Appeals Division affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Casta&#241;eda provided no other evidence related to his court martial. However, the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Per&#250; indicates that Casta&#241;eda was in fact acquitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hurtado was the only officer convicted by the military tribunal. Casta&#241;eda testified that Hurtado was convicted of \"participating in the assassination of those village people.\" The government's attorney then asked \"[s]o [Hurtado] was convicted of murder?,\" to which Casta&#241;eda replied, \"[y]es.\" Casta&#241;eda also testified that Hurtado was incarcerated in a military prison, but that he did not know the length of Hurtado's sentence. When asked whether Hurtado was ever discharged from the military, Casta&#241;eda testified that he thought so, because that was the result required by Per&#250;'s military code, but he could not be sure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then introduced evidence &#8212; in the form of the State Department's 1995 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Per&#250; &#8212; that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty and had been promoted to captain. When asked if he had heard about this, Casta&#241;eda stated \"I did not know,\" and later testified that it would surprise him to know that Hurtado had been promoted after he was convicted and sentenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> At this point, the government introduced the 1999 State Department Report, which indicated that Hurtado had been convicted only for abuse of authority; had been promoted to captain at some point between the massacre and 1993, when he was finally sentenced; and had been released from prison under a general amnesty passed in 1995 by then President Alberto Fujimori and the Peruvian Congress. When asked if Hurtado had been convicted only for abuse of authority, Casta&#241;eda replied: \"Clearly, I don't know. What I manifested what I know is that the court found him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on the law, but maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, the abuse of authority.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that he was aware of atrocities committed by the Shining Path against police officers, soldiers, and civilians. He admitted that he was aware that, prior to August 1985, the Peruvian military had at times engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary detentions. When asked to explain, he stated that he had heard of officers who had detained terrorists or possible terrorists in an unjust manner, and had also heard of detained prisoners being executed. Casta&#241;eda testified that he had not heard about any civilians being detained or killed. According to Casta&#241;eda, some of these actions by the Peruvian military occurred in the emergency zone, but it \"was not the norm.\" At one point, the government presented Casta&#241;eda with a portion from the 1985 State Department Report, which stated that \"[t]otal deaths related to antiterrorist operations of the security forces are estimated by human rights groups as being in the thousands for 1980-85.\" Casta&#241;eda testified that the number sounded incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda also testified that the Peruvian military had a good reputation for investigating and prosecuting military members for human rights violations. In an attempt to rebut this testimony, the government introduced evidence that in 2004 the current Peruvian Prime Minister had called for the annulment of previous rulings by the military justice system \"that breach human rights, so that there can be in the future no further excuses or pretexts to avoid persecution.\" Casta&#241;eda denied having any knowledge of these developments, and stated that he did not know whether any annulment of prior rulings would affect his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court martial hearings concluded, Casta&#241;eda returned to duty. He experienced no professional problems as a result of the charges brought against him. In January 1991, he was promoted to the rank of captain. However, due to the publicity surrounding the massacre and the court martial, Casta&#241;eda's name and face had appeared in certain newspapers detailing the allegations against him. As a result, he and his family began to receive death threats and to experience other problems from the Shining Path. In April or May of 1986, Shining Path members set off explosives in front of the home of Casta&#241;eda's parents. Casta&#241;eda knew the Shining Path set off the explosives because they left pamphlets with the Shining Path's seal. In June of 1986, Shining Path members allegedly shot at Casta&#241;eda and set off an explosive device while he was waiting for public transportation near his home. On other occasions, the Shining Path left propaganda containing written threats at the homes of both Casta&#241;eda and his parents. Casta&#241;eda stated in an affidavit that he had been threatened on over twenty occasions. In 1989, Shining Path members allegedly attempted to kidnap one of Casta&#241;eda's daughters from school. Finally, in 1990, one of Casta&#241;eda's neighbors, who was also in the military and had been receiving threats from the Shining Path for several years, was murdered in his home and in front of his family by the Shining Path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his neighbor's murder, Casta&#241;eda decided to take his family and leave Per&#250;. He obtained tourist visas for himself and his family, retired from the military, and came to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 4, 2004, the Immigration Judge found that Casta&#241;eda was barred from applying for asylum and withholding of removal because he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of their political opinion. In support of this determination, the Immigration Judge first found that Casta&#241;eda was not credible. The Immigration Judge also found that, even if Casta&#241;eda were credible, he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of their political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the Immigration Judge on September 9, 2005. Writing its own opinion, the BIA affirmed the adverse credibility finding and stated that, even if Casta&#241;eda were credible, he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others. Casta&#241;eda has timely appealed to this court. He argues that the BIA's adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> that the BIA erred in disregarding the decision by the Supreme Council of Military Justice purporting to affirm the dismissal of charges against him, and that the BIA erred in finding that he had assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of their political opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Credibility Determination</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The BIA's Findings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA gave five different reasons for its affirmation of the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determination: (1) that the military tribunals appeared to be fraudulent and Casta&#241;eda failed to submit documentary evidence of the proceedings beyond the document that showed his acquittal; (2) that Casta&#241;eda gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether or not he was in radio contact with the other patrols during the Operation; (3) that Casta&#241;eda's demeanor during questioning on radio communications indicated a lack of veracity; (4) that Casta&#241;eda was evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military; and (5) that Casta&#241;eda was not forthcoming about what happened to Hurtado. Having carefully reviewed these reasons, along with the record, we believe that the adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. We address each reason in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA first faulted Casta&#241;eda for not providing documentary evidence of what happened at his military court martial other than the document &#8212; which the BIA found was not properly authenticated &#8212; from the Clerk's Office of the Supreme Council of Military Justice showing that the Appeals Division had affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him. The BIA also stated that there was \"evidence that the military tribunal was a way in which to grant impunity to the alleged persecutors who took part\" in the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the document from the Clerk's Office of the Supreme Council of Military Justice is not the only evidence supporting a finding that Casta&#241;eda was acquitted. The 1999 State Department Report specifically states that, except for Hurtado, \"all the other defendants\" were acquitted of any involvement in the massacre. Given Casta&#241;eda's testimony and this documentary evidence, coupled with the lack of <i>any</i> evidence to the contrary, we conclude that it is uncontroverted that he was in fact acquitted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge concluded &#8212; and the BIA agreed &#8212; that the military tribunals were a fraud on the basis of two documents: (1) the 1995 State Department Report, which stated that the military tribunal system often accorded impunity to the perpetrators of human rights abuses; and (2) an article from <i>Latin American Weekly Report,</i> dated August 31, 2004 (the \"Article\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our discussion of the military tribunals by noting that the Supreme Council of Military Justice, along with its lower tribunals, is a duly constituted judicial body in Per&#250;. This military system, which was granted jurisdiction over Casta&#241;eda's case by the Peruvian Supreme Court, acquitted Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> In general, American courts will give deference to decisions of foreign tribunals. <i>See, e.g., Finanz AG Zurich v. Banco Econ&#243;mico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766225\"><a href=\"/opinion/766225/finanz-ag-zurich-v-banco-economico-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 246 (2d Cir.1999) (discussing deference to determinations made by foreign courts due to principles of international comity); <i>Casey v.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380762\"><a href=\"/opinion/380762/michele-chiaramonte-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span>, 1098 (2d Cir.1980) (discussing the principle of international comity in relation to criminal convictions obtained in a foreign country); Restatement 2d, Conflict of Laws &#167; 98. In the instant case, the Immigration Judge and BIA chose not to give any weight whatsoever to Casta&#241;eda's acquittal. That determination was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the Article, it reported on a conflict between Per&#250;'s civilian and military justice systems following the Peruvian Supreme Court's ruling that the military system's jurisdiction extended only to offenses committed in the furtherance of military duties (and not to human rights violations). It also contained a quote from the Peruvian Prime Minister calling for \"the annulment of [military] rulings that breach human rights, so that there can be in the future no further excuses or pretexts to avoid prosecution.\" We note that there is absolutely no indication that the Prime Minister considered the ruling in Casta&#241;eda's case to have breached human rights. Further, the Article appears to only talk about events that occurred in the 1990s under the regime of former President Fujimori. The Article does not make any allusion to events that occurred in the 1980s. Finally, although the Peruvian Prime Minister at the time of the Article called for the annulment of certain rulings, there is no evidence whatsoever that any rulings were annulled, much less Casta&#241;eda's acquittal. In sum, there is no indication that the Article is in any way applicable to Casta&#241;eda's particular case, nor that the Peruvian Prime Minister's statements were anything more than pure rhetoric. We do not think that the Article was enough to overcome the deference ordinarily due a decision by a duly constituted foreign tribunal. In fact, it is nothing short of anomalous that undue weight is given to a magazine \"article\", yet no weight is given to a finding of a duly constituted tribunal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the 1995 State Department Report, we note that it does mention that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty after serving some jail time. However, other parts of the record indicate that in 1995, then-President Fujimori and Per&#250;'s Congress passed a law extending amnesty to military members convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995. Thus, it appears that Hurtado was released from jail because he had been granted amnesty, not because the original trial and conviction were somehow fraudulent. We certainly do not see how a grant of amnesty to Hurtado <i>several years after Casta&#241;eda left Per&#250; should affect Casta&#241;eda's original acquittal,</i> nor do we think that it should overcome the deference we usually give to the judgment of a foreign tribunal. We therefore conclude that the BIA's finding that <i>Casta&#241;eda's</i> trial was a fraud is not supported by any evidence, much less substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA found that Casta&#241;eda \"gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether and when he was in radio contact with the other patrols involved\" in the Operation. According to the BIA, Casta&#241;eda indicated that it was important to have radio contact, but later specifically testified that he was not in contact with other patrols on the day of the massacre. The BIA also rejected Casta&#241;eda's argument that the Immigration Judge had gone beyond the area of its expertise and \"ventured into the realm of Peruvian military tactics,\" because Casta&#241;eda's own testimony made it \"clear that radio contact was important for purposes of coordination as well as efficiency and protection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several problems with the BIA's reasoning. First, while Casta&#241;eda testified early on that it was important to have radio contact, his testimony indicates that he was referring to radio contact with his base, not other patrols. Casta&#241;eda testified that he only sometimes had contact with other patrols. Further, Casta&#241;eda specifically testified about the coordination of patrols for a mission:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each head of a patrol will respond to the immediate boss, the head of base. The head of base at the attack, they will inform the command of the battalion who can communicate and coordinate directly with the head of patrol and give another specific order or can get contact among heads of patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, Casta&#241;eda testified at the outset &#8212; before he was asked about whether he had any radio contact with other patrols the day of the Operation &#8212; (1) that it was important to have radio contact with his base commander, (2) that in coordinating attacks, the base commander would contact a battalion commander who coordinated the various patrols, and (3) that he only sometimes had direct contact with other patrols. We therefore see no inconsistency in Casta&#241;eda's testimony that, while he had radio contact with his base commander during the Operation, he did not have radio contact with the other patrols on the day in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also appears from the record that the Immigration Judge, and perhaps the BIA, simply found this testimony illogical. Such a finding deserves less deference than other types of credibility findings because it is based on an analysis of the testimony. <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 487. To the extent that the BIA's finding rested on this ground, we would agree with Casta&#241;eda's point that the BIA ventured outside the area of its expertise and into the realm of Peruvian military tactics. As such, we think the BIA's finding on this point is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the BIA accorded weight to the Immigration Judge's finding that during testimony about radio communication, Casta&#241;eda was \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate.\" While demeanor evidence is peculiarly within the purview of the trier of fact, we are not persuaded &#8212; given the problems we have found with the other aspects of the credibility findings &#8212; that rapid blinking alone is enough to find Casta&#241;eda not credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge's finding that Casta&#241;eda was evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations committed by the Peruvian military. From our review of the record, this finding mischaracterizes Casta&#241;eda's testimony. He was not evasive when confronted with statistics from State Department Reports. Casta&#241;eda readily admitted that he was aware of instances in which the Peruvian army had engaged in extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. He simply disagreed with the numbers. Casta&#241;eda consistently testified that abuses by the Peruvian army were not the norm and that only a minority of the military engaged in such practices. When confronted with the 1985 State Department Report indicating that \"[t]otal deaths related to antiterrorist operations of the security forces are estimated by human rights groups as being in the thousands between 1980-1985,\" Casta&#241;eda took issue with those numbers. We note that, to the extent the government offered the report as evidence that thousands of people had been killed due to abuses by the Peruvian military, Casta&#241;eda appears to have been at least correct. In a portion of the report the government failed to read at the hearing, the State Department noted that, out of these thousands of total deaths, \"[p]recise information is lacking on the number of civilian victims and their identities (terrorist or non-terrorist) as well as the identity of their assailants (terrorists, security forces, or peasant self-defense forces).\" In other words, the \"thousands\" of deaths that resulted from antiterrorist operations included deaths of terrorists, as well as civilians killed by terrorists and other peasant forces. Therefore, it is quite likely that there were not thousands of deaths related to abuses by the Peruvian military, and in that sense, Casta&#241;eda was correct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered the entire record, we do not think that substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Casta&#241;eda was evasive on the issue of human rights abuses by the military. He testified consistently throughout the hearings before the Immigration Judge, and although he disagreed at times with the government's assertions, this can hardly be considered evasive testimony. We therefore find that the BIA's finding on this issue is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifth reason for the BIA's adverse credibility finding was that Casta&#241;eda allegedly was \"not forthcoming about the judgment entered against\" Hurtado. This, again, is a mischaracterization of Casta&#241;eda's testimony. There are several aspects of Casta&#241;eda's testimony on the subject of Hurtado, and we deal with each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Whether Hurtado was imprisoned</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross-examination, the government's attorney asked Casta&#241;eda what happened to Hurtado. Casta&#241;eda replied, \"[a]fter [Hurtado] admitted [to his involvement in the massacre] and the court found him guilty, he was placed in a military prison.\" This statement is borne out by the record; all of the documents indicate that Hurtado was found guilty and placed in prison for a period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Hurtado's conviction</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later on in questioning, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

I do not know the amount of years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latter part of Casta&#241;eda's answer is supported by the record, as the 1999 State Department Report indicates that Hurtado was not finally sentenced until 1993, two years after Casta&#241;eda left Per&#250;. It is perfectly plausible that Casta&#241;eda did not know the length of Hurtado's sentence, since Hurtado had not been sentenced when Casta&#241;eda and his family left Per&#250;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the first part of Casta&#241;eda's response, the government later asked Casta&#241;eda if Hurtado was convicted only of abuse of authority. Casta&#241;eda stated that \"[c]learly, I don't know. What I manifested what I know is that [t]he court found him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on law, but maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, the abuse of authority.\" On appeal, the government argues that Casta&#241;eda testified inconsistently about what crimes Hurtado was convicted of. This is incorrect, for two reasons. First, Casta&#241;eda testified that Hurtado was convicted of killing the villagers. He referred to the killings as \"that murder\" and an \"assassination.\" It is obvious that, in Casta&#241;eda's untrained legal mind, Hurtado murdered civilians, and this is what he was convicted of. Second, Hurtado was in fact charged with murder, and, at the time of Casta&#241;eda's acquittal, the case against Hurtado was still proceeding. The document confirming Casta&#241;eda's acquittal specifically states that the case would continue against Hurtado \"for crimes against life, body, and health, first degree murder.\" Hurtado, however, was not sentenced until 1993, and was sentenced only for abuse of authority. This again occurred after Casta&#241;eda had left Per&#250;. We see no reason to find that Casta&#241;eda was not credible as to his knowledge and participation in the Operation simply because he thought Hurtado was convicted of murder and not abuse of authority, when (1) Hurtado was originally charged with murder, (2) still faced a murder charge at the time of Casta&#241;eda's acquittal, and (3) was not sentenced until two years after Casta&#241;eda had left the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Whether Hurtado was discharged or promoted</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if Hurtado was discharged from the army, Casta&#241;eda testified that he thought so, since that was the usual military practice for an officer in such a situation, but did not know for sure. This apparently was not good enough for the government attorney, who commented that Casta&#241;eda seemed to not know many details about what happened to Hurtado given the significance the court martial had on his life. Casta&#241;eda replied</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You're right. That is a very important &#8212; in my life. What I know is that that officer acted outside the rules that are breach of the army. He was found guilty. . . . I did not try to find out what privileges he might have had and what had happened to his life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, Casta&#241;eda testified that he knew Hurtado went to prison, thought he was discharged from the army, and did not try to find out what happened to Hurtado afterwards. Instead, like many people would, he tried to resume <i>his</i> normal life. We see nothing to indicate that Casta&#241;eda was not forthcoming about Hurtado's fate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During cross examination, the government also introduced a 1995 State Department Report indicating that there were reports that Hurtado had reappeared on active duty and been promoted to captain. When asked about this, Casta&#241;eda testified \"I did not know that.\" When asked if it would surprise him to know that Hurtado was promoted after his conviction and sentence, Casta&#241;eda answered that it would. The record supports Casta&#241;eda's testimony. First, the 1999 State Department Report indicates that \"the Military Code states that any conviction that entails a sentence of 2 or more years' imprisonment must result in the officer's immediate discharge.\" Thus, Casta&#241;eda was correct in his testimony that the usual practice was for an officer in Hurtado's situation to be discharged. The 1999 Report also indicates that Hurtado was not released from prison until 1995 under the general amnesty, <i>four years after Casta&#241;eda had left Per&#250;.</i> It therefore is entirely consistent with Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he had no idea Hurtado had not been discharged and had in fact been released from prison and promoted, because when Casta&#241;eda left Per&#250;, Hurtado's case was still ongoing and he was in prison. Again, we find no basis for the adverse credibility finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also wish to emphasize several key pieces of evidence that supported Casta&#241;eda's story. First, as we noted above, the 1999 State Department report indicates that Casta&#241;eda was acquitted of any involvement in the massacre. Second, the report from the Human Rights Commission specifically found that Casta&#241;eda's patrol was \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\" This is an extremely important piece of evidence because it goes to the heart of the issue: the extent of Casta&#241;eda's participation in the massacre of the villagers. Further, while the Commission report mentioned Casta&#241;eda's name twice, it did so only in reference to the fact that he led one of the non-infringing patrols. The report clearly holds Hurtado to blame for the massacre. It mentions Hurtado's testimony in depth and also refers to him as \"the perpetrator\" &#8212; as opposed to \"one of the perpetrators\" &#8212; of the massacre. The 1995 and 1999 State Department Reports single out Hurtado and his patrol as the ones responsible for the massacre. For example, the 1999 State Department Report states that \"Hurtado commanded the army unit responsible for the 1985 Accomarca massacre.\" Neither Casta&#241;eda nor any of the other patrol leaders' names are ever mentioned. In our view the record, when viewed as a whole, indicates that Hurtado and his patrol were responsible for the massacre, and that Casta&#241;eda's patrol, <i>which was three to five miles distant,</i> took no part in it. After a trial by the military court, Hurtado &#8212; the man responsible &#8212; was convicted<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> and the charges against Casta&#241;eda were dismissed. The fact that Hurtado was later released due to a general declaration of amnesty by the President and Congress should not affect the legitimacy of the original trial and conviction, and it especially should not be held against Casta&#241;eda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the evidence indicates that Casta&#241;eda credibly testified that (1) he never had any contact with any villagers during the Operation, (2) he was acquitted of any involvement in the massacre by a duly constituted body of the Peruvian military, which was given jurisdiction over his case by the Peruvian Supreme Court, and (3) Hurtado, the leader of the Links 7 patrol, was the one found responsible for the massacre by a military court. This evidence, combined with the problems we have discussed related to the reasons relied upon by the BIA in making its adverse credibility finding, sound the death knell for that finding. Substantial evidence does not support a finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible regarding his involvement in the massacre, and we therefore reverse the BIA's credibility determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The \"Ordinary Remand Rule\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent, invoking the \"ordinary remand rule\" argues that we must remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings.

The Ninth Circuit had reversed the BIA based on a \"changed circumstances\" argument that the government had made to an Immigration Judge, but which the BIA had never addressed.

In <i>Thomas,</i> the Immigration Judge denied a petitioner's asylum claim without considering her alleged fear of persecution based on membership in a particular social group. The BIA then summarily affirmed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that Thomas was in fact persecuted as a member of a social group even though the BIA had not yet addressed the issue. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded to the BIA for consideration of the issue, stating that \"[t]he agency has not yet considered whether [petitioner's father-in-law's] family presents the kind of kinship ties that constitute a particular social group.\" <i>Id.,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1615.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not quarrel with the general legal proposition regarding the ordinary remand rule advanced by the dissent and found in <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Ventura,</i> we believe that the facts of this case take it outside of the purview of that rule. In both <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Ventura,</i> the court of appeals considered an issue that the BIA never addressed in the first instance. Here, by contrast, the Immigration Judge and BIA both thoroughly considered the credibility issue based on a fully developed record. In reversing the credibility determination, we are not conducting a <i>de novo</i> review of the record, but rather are reviewing the reasons set forth by the BIA in light of the record. Under the ordinary remand rule, while we could remand the case for further factfinding, we are not required to do so since the BIA has already thoroughly \"evaluat[ed] the evidence\" and brought \"its expertise to bear upon the matter.\" <i>Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122242\"><a href=\"/opinion/122242/ins-v-orlando-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788633\"><a href=\"/opinion/788633/ghebregziabher-ghebremedhin-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 243 (7th Cir.2004). Several other circuits have adopted a similar line of reasoning. <i>See, e.g., Almaghzar v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794582\"><a href=\"/opinion/794582/abdul-r-almaghzar-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 423 n. 11 (9th Cir.2006) (\"Neither <i>Ventura</i> nor <i>Thomas</i> requires us to remand an issue to the agency when the agency has already considered the issue.\"); <i>Zhao v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"37733\"><a href=\"/opinion/37733/zhao-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span>, 311 (5th Cir.2005) (stating that the court was not required to remand under the ordinary remand rule because the BIA had already decided the issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also argues that our decision to reverse violates the law of our own circuit. However, the cases cited by the dissent are clearly distinguishable. For example, the dissent relies on <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998) and <i>Cordero-Trejo v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195749\"><a href=\"/opinion/195749/cordero-trejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1994). In <i>Gailius,</i> the Immigration Judge did not address whether alleged threats had occurred as the petitioner described because it found that a reasonable person in the petitioner's situation would not fear persecution on account of such threats. We disagreed with this latter finding and stated that \"[i]f the threats are real . . . Gailius may well have had a well-founded fear.\" <i>Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 44. We remanded so that the BIA &#8212; which ignored the evidence of the threats based on reasons not having to do with credibility &#8212; could explain why it found the threats not credible. One of our main reasons for remand was that \"the IJ did not make a determination of the credibility and authenticity of Gailius' evidence of threats.\" <i>Id.</i> at 47. We have a different case here, because the IJ and BIA made specific credibility findings; those findings simply are not supported by substantial evidence. In <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> the BIA first found the petitioner not credible, then made an alternative holding that the petitioner was ineligible for asylum based on three reasons. <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 485. We found two of these reasons invalid under the INA, and the third depended on the adverse credibility finding, which we found was not supported by substantial evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 485, 488. We also found that the BIA failed to consider certain general country condition evidence offered by the petitioner. <i>Id.</i> at 485. In reversing the adverse credibility finding, we noted that \"it is difficult to ascertain from what sort of evidence the IJ drew his credibility conclusions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491. Given this fact, along with the fact that the Immigration Judge and BIA had failed to address any of the petitioner's documentary evidence, we remanded. Casta&#241;eda's case is obviously distinguishable because it is clear what evidence the Immigration Judge and BIA relied on in drawing the adverse credibility determination, and the BIA did not simply ignore all of Casta&#241;eda's documentary evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Whether Casta&#241;eda Was a Persecutor</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted above, the Immigration Judge also found that, even assuming Casta&#241;eda had testified credibly &#8212; i.e., even assuming that he and his patrol were several miles away from the village during the Operation, did not encounter a single villager, and did not know what was happening in the village or have any control over what was taking place there &#8212; he still \"assisted or otherwise participated\" in the persecution of others. Specifically, the Immigration Judge concluded that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the objective effect of [Casta&#241;eda's] participation in the Accomarca operation would have been to aid even in some small measure in the confinement of villagers to the combat area and therefore aid even in some small measure with the execution and murder and rape of those unarmed men, women, and children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, citing to the above portion of the Immigration Judge's opinion as well as <i>In</i> <i>re Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811 (BIA 1988), affirmed this finding, stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">we find no error in the Immigration Judge's conclusion that [Casta&#241;eda] failed to meet his burden of proving that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution of villagers in Accomarca based on their political opinion; even if [Casta&#241;eda] testified credibly that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985, there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that [Casta&#241;eda] did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as his patrol was charged with blocking an escape route for the villagers and people located in the emergency zone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien is ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal if he or she \"ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of an individual because of the individual's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). In the instant case, it is undisputed that Casta&#241;eda did not order or incite the persecution of anyone. It is also undisputed that the villagers massacred during the Operation were killed because of their political opinion, i.e., their support of or suspected involvement with the Shining Path. Therefore, the only issue is whether Casta&#241;eda \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" the persecution of the villagers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's main argument is that he could not have \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution because the massacre took place without his control and awareness, and because he had no connection to the massacre beyond being a member of the military at the time it occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> The government, following the reasoning of the BIA, argues that Casta&#241;eda's actions in blocking an escape path furthered the massacre and therefore demands a finding that he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. After careful review of the record and various cases interpreting the phrase \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" the persecution of others, we are compelled to reverse the BIA's decision in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our discussion by looking to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Fedorenko v.

In reality, Fedorenko was a Russian soldier who had been captured by the German army and forced to serve as a guard at the Nazi concentration camp in Treblinka, Poland, where several hundred thousand Jewish civilians were murdered. When the falsehoods on his application were discovered, the government filed an action to have Fedorenko's citizenship revoked. At the resulting trial, Fedorenko admitted to his service at Treblinka and admitted that he knew that thousands of Jewish civilians were being murdered there, but claimed that his service as a guard was involuntary and that he did not have any personal involvement in the atrocities committed. Fedorenko also admitted that he had \"shot in the general direction of escaping inmates\" during a prison uprising, <i>id.</i> at 500, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110381\"><a href=\"/opinion/110381/fedorenko-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While section 2(a) of the IRO Constitution provided that persons who \"assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations\" were excluded from the definition of \"displaced persons,\" section 2(b) of the IRO Constitution excluded only those persons who \"<i>voluntarily</i> assisted the enemy forces . . . in their operations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 496 n. 4, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110381\"><a href=\"/opinion/110381/fedorenko-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Taking Casta&#241;eda's testimony as true, we are presented with the following set of facts: (1) the uncontradicted evidence is that the purpose of the Operation was directed at the Shining Path guerrillas in the village, <i>not</i> civilians;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> (2) Casta&#241;eda and his men were hidden in the jungle three to five miles from the village and about thirty meters from the path they were guarding; (3) during the time they were there, they did not see or hear anyone, nor did they fire any shots; (4) they never entered the village and never directly or indirectly participated in the killings of the villagers, which was carried out by a rogue patrol led by Hurtado in a previously unplanned manner; (5) Casta&#241;eda and his men lacked any control or authority over this rogue patrol; and (6) they did not know what occurred in the village during the Operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these facts, and considering the totality of relevant conduct, we are compelled to conclude that Casta&#241;eda did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution of the villagers. First, Casta&#241;eda's personal involvement in the murder of the villagers was non-existent. <i>Compare</i> <i>Miranda Alvarado,</i> 441 F.3d at 762 (noting that petitioner, who served as an interpreter for the Peruvian army while officer tortured suspected Shining Path member, was personally involved in the persecution because he was present and active during the interrogation); <i>Singh,</i> 417 F.3d at 740 (finding that the petitioner had assisted or otherwise participated in persecution where the petitioner \"took innocent Sikhs into custody . . . and transported them to the police station, where he knew they would be subjected to unjustified physical abuse[,]\" and \"participated in raids on the homes of innocent Sikh families\"). Second, Casta&#241;eda's conduct &#8212; which amounted to hiding in the jungle for several hours three to five miles away from the scene of the massacre &#8212; can hardly be characterized as \"active and ha[ving] direct consequences for the victims\" of the persecution, <i>Xie,</i> 434 F.3d at 143, especially since no one ever came down the path Casta&#241;eda's patrol was watching. Instead, Casta&#241;eda's actions are better characterized as irrelevant \"to the acts of oppression and passive in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> In a similar vein, Casta&#241;eda's actions simply had <i>no</i> \"objective effect\" on the persecution because Casta&#241;eda and his men never saw anyone or fired any shots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> In other words, <i>the massacre of the villagers during the Operation would have occurred regardless of whether Casta&#241;eda ever reached his assigned position,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> and Casta&#241;eda did nothing to facilitate the massacre in any way because his patrol never encountered anyone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> <i>Cf. Miranda Alvarado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794525\"><a href=\"/opinion/794525/roberto-ferrer-miranda-alvarado-madeleine-janet-morales-lopez-v-alberto-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 927 (finding that, without the petitioner's actions, the persecution would not have gone forward). Add to these facts Casta&#241;eda's lack of awareness of what was happening in the village, and we simply do not see how his actions rise to the level of culpability necessary to find that he assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of the villagers. We therefore find that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determination in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Dissent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has never condoned, nor will it ever condone, the massacre of innocent civilians by the military in the course of its war-related activities. <i>See United States v. Zajanckauskas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202113\"><a href=\"/opinion/202113/united-states-v-zajanckauskas/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2006). However, we also cannot tolerate a finding that amounts to a conclusion that someone is guilty of such conduct by remote association. The findings of the Immigration Judge and the BIA amount to just that: a conclusion of guilt by remote association. These findings fly against the evidence that is relevant to a determination of whether Casta&#241;eda was credible and to whether he was in any way responsible for the atrocities committed by a different Peruvian army unit, operating independently of his command, several miles away from his location, with nothing but mountains and jungle in between.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the findings below &#8212; which we have already addressed as unsupported or unsupportable &#8212; are clothed in the presumably impervious mantle of credibility findings, and considering the assertions in the dissent that follows, it is appropriate that we conclude by re-emphasizing certain <i>uncontested</i> evidence which goes both to the issue of Casta&#241;eda's credibility and to the question of his responsibility for the heinous acts committed beyond his control or participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is <i>undisputed</i> that the patrol which committed the massacre of the villagers was several miles away and acted independently from Casta&#241;eda, whose assigned duty was to watch a trail to intercept Shining Path guerrillas, not civilians. The dissent's phrasing of the facts, that \"army units fired and threw grenades into the houses and killed many women and children,\" and that Casta&#241;eda \"headed one of four army units involved in the military operation during which this massacre occurred\" is unfortunate because it gives the impression that the military operation was one that included, as a pre-planned goal, the premeditated killing of civilians. In fact, <i>there is absolutely no evidence to this effect.</i> This unwarranted implication in the quoted portion of the dissent is re-enforced by the phrasing that follows: \"His patrol was assigned to and did block a possible escape route from the village, but there is no evidence that he was in the village during the massacre or that he personally killed anyone.\" This quote omits the rather important fact that Casta&#241;eda was several miles away from the village, that there is no evidence that he ever entered the village before, during or after the massacre, or that anyone, civilian or otherwise, ever went down the trail he was guarding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as we just noted, it is <i>undisputed</i> that nothing happened on Casta&#241;eda's watch. It is <i>undisputed</i> that no one came down the trail &#8212; no Shining Path guerrillas, no civilians, no one. Thus, neither Casta&#241;eda nor anyone under his command engaged in any action against innocent civilians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, there is <i>not a scintilla of evidence</i> that Casta&#241;eda was aware, either before or during the massacre, that these acts would be committed or were being committed by others over which he had no control and were in fact not his subordinates. The issue regarding radio communication during the Operation is simply another red herring, for several reasons. First, there is no affirmative evidence of any communication between Casta&#241;eda and the other patrols during the Operation. Second, radio silence during operations is not an unheard of military tactic. In any event, the only evidence is the assertion by the only person there, Casta&#241;eda, that there was no communication between the patrols. The conclusions to the contrary, used by the Immigration Judge and the BIA as a basis for their credibility conclusions, are mere speculation unsupported by evidence, especially given Casta&#241;eda's prior testimony about communication up the chain of command. Third, the issue regarding radio communication is an irrelevant distraction from the main issue: Casta&#241;eda's culpability for the actions of Hurtado's rogue patrol, over which it is <i>undisputed</i> that Casta&#241;eda lacked control or command.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Casta&#241;eda was acquitted by a Peruvian military court for his involvement in the Operation. This is the same military court that found the captain in charge of the rogue patrol, Hurtado, guilty of perpetrating the massacre against the civilians. Notwithstanding these undisputed facts, and that such tribunals are the ones that normally deal with crimes allegedly committed by the military in the course of military operations, the Immigration Judge and the BIA latched on to irrelevant issues to detract from the most central, irrefutable fact: that the only adjudicative body to pass upon this unfortunate incident placed the blame for these actions on someone other than Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's determinations that Casta&#241;eda was not credible and assisted or otherwise participated in persecution, we grant the petition for review, reverse the decision of the BIA, and remand the case so that an Immigration Judge may consider the merits of Casta&#241;eda's asylum and withholding of removal applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's asylum request merits serious, unbiased consideration. As we pointed out earlier in this opinion, the Shining Path have been catalogued by our government as a ruthless terrorist organization. Casta&#241;eda's unchallenged testimony is that Shining Path members threatened him on numerous occasions and attempted to murder him in 1986. Furthermore, and in keeping with its record of indiscriminate violence, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Philip Bennett, <i>Pol Pot in Per&#250;,</i> New Republic, January 28, 1985, at 16, Shining Path members tried to kidnap Casta&#241;eda's daughter in 1989. The group also murdered Casta&#241;eda's neighbor and military colleague in front of the man's family in 1990. Thereafter, Casta&#241;eda sought refuge for himself and his family from these terrorist thugs by leaving his native country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's decision cannot be sustained on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded for actions consistent with this opinion.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Casta&#241;eda's wife and daughters were included in his asylum application</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The dissent claims that our discussion of the facts is \"materially incomplete\" and proceeds to submit its own version of the facts. Although it is certainly entitled to do so, we have some basic disagreements with this rendition both by reason of its content and its emphasis. With due respect, we believe that certain parts of its recitation are either irrelevant or taken out of context and clearly the subject of explanation. Perhaps a more egregious problem is presented by the inclusion of certain additional details, particularly those contained in page 66, line 11, through page 67, line 4, of the dissent, which recount the actions of persons for whom Casta&#241;eda was not responsible and who were without his command or authority, and additionally, for which Casta&#241;eda was absolved of responsibility. The inclusion of this information in the dissent's recount is thus not only unnecessary and irrelevant to a discussion of the issues before us, but also is unduly inflammatory and distracts from the proper focus of the legal issues raised by this appeal. The offending facts, although part of the decisions below, and undoubtedly an improper factor in the erroneous outcome reached, add nothing material to the appeal before us.

His testimony was translated into English by an interpreter.

This caused problems during the testimony, as the interpreter often had to ask Casta&#241;eda to repeat his answers or the government to repeat its questions so that she could interpret them and often had to clarify or correct the original interpretations. We think it is important to note this fact because, in our view, some of the supposed inconsistencies or evasiveness mentioned by the dissent were more likely than not simple problems in translation. For example, when asked whether he could contact other patrols by radio during a military operation on August 5, 1985, Casta&#241;eda originally replied \"No. I<i>did not</i> on my radio.\" The Immigration Judge then stated \"That's not what I asked\" and asked the question again, to which Casta&#241;eda replied \"No. I <i>could not.</i>\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> According to the State Department's 1985 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Per&#250;, the emergency zone was an area in which there was a declaration of a state of emergency and the armed forces were given full civil and military authority</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The dissent states that Casta&#241;eda said it was \"`very important to coordinate the movement.' Casta&#241;eda said his patrol would `keep contact with the base by radio,' and at least sometimes would make direct radio contact with other patrols in the area.\" One possible implication of the dissent's phrasing is that Casta&#241;eda was stating that radio contact with other patrols was important to coordinate the movement. However, we wish to be clear that Casta&#241;eda was<i>not</i> testifying that radio contact with other patrols was important to coordinate movement. Rather, his statement that it was \"important to coordinate the movement\" was in response to the question \"Was it important to know the location of other[s] in your area?\" From the full context of the statement, it is clear that Casta&#241;eda was simply stating that it was important to know the location of other patrols to coordinate movement, not to have actual radio contact with them. Casta&#241;eda had already testified that he kept in radio contact with his base and that his base commander would let him know where other patrols were, although he also sometimes had direct radio contact with the other patrols.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> This zone was located within the Ayacucho region, i.e., the emergency zone</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Apparently, Llocllapampa is located between two mountains, and there were very few paths into or out of the village</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The dissent states that, when asked if he was informed what frequencies the two attack patrols were using, Casta&#241;eda replied \"That's correct.\" However, the dissent leaves out the rest of Casta&#241;eda's reply. The full quote is \"That's correct, but both patrols entered from the same place and where those patrols are directed, four patrols are directed from the same head of unit, but these orders came from the division. I was directly directed by the head of commander of base.\" From this full quote, it is clear that Casta&#241;eda misunderstood the question, and was explaining that the four patrols were directed by a division head, and that his orders during the Operation came directly from the head commander of his case. A few questions later, Casta&#241;eda explicitly clarified that he could not contact the other patrols because he did not have their frequency</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The dissent notes that, when asked what happened in the village, Casta&#241;eda originally stated that \"[o]ne of the patrols . . . committed excesses.\" The implication behind the inclusion of this fact is that Casta&#241;eda was being evasive. This is not the case. From the transcript, it appears that, after Casta&#241;eda testified about \"excesses,\" the Immigration Judge interjected to ask the interpreter what she had said. The government then asked Casta&#241;eda if he could be more specific, and Casta&#241;eda immediately replied that the patrol had executed civilians. We do not think that this sequence of events indicates any evasiveness on Casta&#241;eda's part</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The dissent argues that Casta&#241;eda's testimony shows that he was evasive regarding his knowledge of the number of civilians killed in Llocllapampa. This is incorrect. The Human Rights Commission noted that there were three different reports regarding the number of civilians killed: twenty-five, forty, and sixty-nine. It also noted that the exact number could not be determined. To this day the exact number of civilians killed is unknown. Casta&#241;eda was therefore entirely correct in stating that he never learned the exact number of people killed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> This testimony is supported by other aspects of the record, which we discuss<i>infra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The dissent makes much of the fact that Casta&#241;eda was debriefed, arguing that the debriefing means it is unlikely that he did not find out about the massacre until three weeks later, as he claimed. We have two responses. First, Casta&#241;eda stated that the \"debriefing\" simply meant that he gave a report to his base commander. He gave no indication that he met with the other patrols or discussed what the other patrols did, and there is no evidence in the record to controvert that testimony. Second, it would make sense that those who slaughtered the civilians would not tell other soldiers who were not involved. One would expect that those who participate in the murder of innocent civilians would not openly discuss what they have done with others who did not engage in such atrocities</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> As previously noted, we are concerned that the dissent's description of the murders of the villagers is inflammatory, and we therefore want to emphasize that it is undisputed that Casta&#241;eda was not involved in the killing of any civilians. He was also later absolved of responsibility by a military court, a fact which we discuss in more detail below</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent is equally inflammatory in speculating, in footnote 43, that \"if Hurtado was acting on orders, rather than in the heat of the moment, it is much more likely that Casta&#241;eda would have known about the massacre before it happened\". Such speculation loses sight of the facts of the case: there is no evidence that Hurtado was acting on orders to commit the massacre, and there is no evidence that Casta&#241;eda would have known of these hypothetical orders had they ever been given.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The dissent notes that the Human Rights Commission stated that Hurtado \"is only a piece of the larger picture and it is necessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders.\" One possible implication of this isolated fact is that Casta&#241;eda was perhaps part of the \"larger picture.\" However, taking the statement within the context of the report, it is clear that the Commission was concerned that persons with a higher military rank had ordered Hurtado to kill the civilians. In particular, elsewhere in the report the Commission refers to possible \"verbal orders\" given to Hurtado by a general named Wilfredo Mori Orzo. Nothing in the report indicates Casta&#241;eda had any orders beyond those to watch the path for any Shining Path guerrillas or that Casta&#241;eda was somehow part of the \"larger picture.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A more egregious misconstruction of the facts of the case is the dissent's statement that \"[i]t is disputed whether [Casta&#241;eda] knew about the massacre before or while it took place.\" Again, there is no evidence that the massacre was planned or that Casta&#241;eda had knowledge of these plans if they ever existed. The IJ did dispute whether Casta&#241;eda learned, via radio contact, of the massacre as it took place. However, this dispute is irrelevant. Casta&#241;eda did not have authority over Hurtado and he was located 3 to 5 miles outside of Llocllapampa. Had Casta&#241;eda learned of the massacre as it transpired, he would not have been able to either assist or stop it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> In stating that \"three officers [including Casta&#241;eda] were responsible\" for the massacres, the report was drawing from initial reports by the Peruvian military and the Human Rights Commission.

Under our own justice system, defendants who are \"acquitted\" are found \"not guilty,\" they are not found \"innocent.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent argues that the BIA did not require an actual finding of innocence, but simply required Casta&#241;eda to show his innocence through court documents or otherwise. We disagree. The BIA specifically discounted Casta&#241;eda's evidence because it was not \"the legal equivalent of a <i>criminal finding</i> that he was innocent.\" (emphasis supplied). Our point is that, under our own justice system, it would have been impossible for Casta&#241;eda to provide such a finding, and it was therefore unreasonable to discount the evidence of his acquittal simply because it is not a criminal finding of innocence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> There is some indication that the Immigration Judge, and perhaps the BIA, faulted Casta&#241;eda for not providing evidence of an acquittal from the civilian court system of Per&#250;. We wish to note that, to the extent that the decision rested on these grounds, it was erroneous. The highest body of the civilian court system, the Supreme Court of Per&#250;, determined that the military system had jurisdiction over Casta&#241;eda's case. There is therefore no doubt that the case was properly before the military courts, and there is simply no reason to fault Casta&#241;eda for not providing evidence of acquittal in the civilian system</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> The dissent seizes on the both the Immigration Judge's and BIA's use of the word \"demeanor,\" noting in several places that Casta&#241;eda was found not credible based on \"observations\" of his demeanor. The implication of the dissent's emphasis on demeanor evidence is that the Immigration Judge and BIA based the adverse credibility finding on numerous problems with Casta&#241;eda's demeanor. For example, the dissent notes that the Immigration Judge stated that he had \"carefully observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor . . . and found him vague, evasive, and non-responsive.\" However, as the dissent also notes, a hearing officer who makes an adverse credibility determination must support the determination with specific findings in order to be accorded deference<i>Aguilar-Sol&#237;s v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 570 (1st Cir.1999). The <i>only</i> specific finding that the Immigration Judge made regarding Casta&#241;eda's demeanor-as opposed to the content of his testimony &#8212; was that during testimony about radio communication, Casta&#241;eda was \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate.\" We readily agree that demeanor evidence is peculiarly within the purview of the trier of fact. However, absent other evidence of a lack of credibility, we cannot affirm an adverse credibility finding based solely on a person's \"blinking\" during a portion of their testimony. Such ambiguous indicia are simply too thin to support such a conclusion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Further, the 1985 Report notes elsewhere that \"[b]eginning in 1983, some members of the security forces responded to [the Shining Path] with violence of their own, engaging in extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. Most of these violations occurred in 1983 and 1984 in the Ayacucho Emergency Zone. . . . During 1985, reports of such abuses by security forces dropped sharply. . . .\" In 1983 and 1984, Casta&#241;eda was serving in Tumbes, around 400 miles away from the emergency zone. It is therefore likely that he heard only occasional reports of abuses occurring in the emergency zone. Further, as indicated by the State Department, by the time he was transferred into the emergency zone in 1985, the number of abuses decreased sharply. This further bolsters his testimony that he only rarely heard of abuses by the military</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> We also note that Casta&#241;eda's knowledge, or lack thereof, regarding Hurtado is a red herring. Casta&#241;eda was denied asylum because of what<i>he</i> allegedly did, not because of what Hurtado did. As we previously noted, Casta&#241;eda's case is based on his disassociation from Hurtado's actions, actions over which Casta&#241;eda had no control or knowledge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The fact that there was a conviction in the case should further boost Casta&#241;eda's credibility</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> The dissent's analysis would require us to remand whenever we found an error in the BIA's factual decisions, even if the BIA had clearly decided the issue based on a fully developed record. This would transform the \"ordinary remand\" rule into an \"automatic remand\" rule, something we do not believe is required by either the Supreme Court or our own precedents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The dissent also cites<i>Seavey v.

However, that case actually supports our decision to reverse. In <i>Seavy,</i> which involved an agency's denial of social security benefits, we remanded to the agency for further consideration. However, we noted that \"if the evidence and law compelled one conclusion or the other, then [we] could order an award of benefits or affirm a denial of benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> at 11. Here, under substantial evidence review, we may reverse the decision of the BIA only if we are <i>compelled</i> by the evidence. In deciding that the BIA's determination is not supported by substantial evidence, we are in reality stating that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. Thus, under the language of <i>Seavy,</i> we may simply reverse the agency's decision.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> The dissent argues that this portion of the BIA's opinion was not an alternate holding and that we should remand to the BIA so that it can address in the first instance whether Casta&#241;eda's actions amounted to assistance or participation in persecution. In essence, the dissent believes that the BIA did not assume the credibility of all of Casta&#241;eda's testimony and that the quoted portion of the BIA's opinion does not adequately explain the BIA's reasoning. It bases this argument in part on the BIA's statement that \"even if [Casta&#241;eda] testified credibly<i>that he did not harm or execute anyone</i> on August 8, 1985,\" (emphasis supplied), he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the dissent's characterization of the ruling below. The context of the BIA's statement, especially its citation to, and affirmation of, a portion of the Immigration Judge's decision where the Immigration Judge <i>explicitly</i> makes an alternate holding, as well as its citation to <i>In re Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> one of the BIA's seminal opinions on the issue of whether an alien assisted or participated in persecution, leaves us with no doubt the BIA was making an alternate holding. This alternate holding was that, even if Casta&#241;eda were credible, his actions constituted assistance or participation in persecution. Further, although brief, the BIA's reasoning is crystal clear: it believed that the act of blocking a path during the Operation had the objective effect of assisting in the massacre by helping to confine the villagers. Given these considerations, we are convinced that this alternate holding is ripe for review. <i>See Xu v.

The court noted that, in the context of Nazi guards and the DPA (which is what <i>Naujalis</i> involved), \"membership in the ranks of Nazi guards is sufficient to constitute assistance in prohibited persecution.\" <i>Singh,</i> 417 F.3d at 739. It then went on to state that the DPA line of cases was not fully compatible with the INA in general and Singh's case in particular because \"[u]nlike Nazi concentration camps, whose complete existence was premised upon the persecution of innocent civilians, local Punjabi police departments served traditional, legitimate law enforcement purposes and did not exclusively engage in the persecution of innocent [people].\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, the court stated, in Singh's case \"a distinction must be made between genuine assistance in persecution and inconsequential association with persecutors.\" <i>Id.</i> The court then went on to conduct an analysis similar to the one we have conducted. <i>Id.</i> at 739-741.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the dissent's reliance on <i>Naujalis</i> is misplaced because <i>Naujalis</i> involved a special rule applicable \"exclusively . . . to Nazis from the period of 1933 to 1945.\" <i>Id.</i> at 739. Had Naujalis been the member of an organization which did not exclusively engage in persecution &#8212; as is the case with Casta&#241;eda and his membership in the Peruvian army &#8212; the Seventh Circuit's analysis would have been entirely different. Given the Seventh Circuit's explanation of <i>Naujalis</i> in <i>Singh,</i> along with the other cases that have construed the relevant provisions of the INA, as opposed to the DPA, we are convinced that our approach is the correct one.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> As evidenced by the facts that the massacre occurred even though one of the blocking controls never reached its position and that no persons came down the path Casta&#241;eda's men were watching</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> We find that what might have occurred had a fleeing villager come down the path to be absolutely irrelevant and speculative, since Casta&#241;eda was there to intercept fleeing members of the Shining Path,<i>not</i> civilians.

The village's civilian inhabitants were herded into two homes; the army units fired and threw grenades into the houses and killed many women and children in the slaughter. The investigation concluded the operation amounted to genocide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lieutenant Casta&#241;eda, petitioner here, headed one of four army units involved in the military operation during which this massacre occurred. It is disputed whether he knew about the massacre before or while it took place. His patrol was assigned to and did block a possible escape route from the village, but there is no evidence that he was in the village during the massacre or that he personally killed anyone. He acknowledged that he was briefed on the operation beforehand and that all units during the operation had radios capable of radio contact, but he claimed that he had no radio contact with the units in the village that day and did not find out about the massacre until weeks later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding himself a potential target in the wake of his role in the operation, Casta&#241;eda came with his family to the United States on tourist visas in 1991, overstayed, and in 1993 applied for asylum and withholding of removal. By statute, an alien is not eligible for asylum and withholding of removal if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien ordered, incited, <i>assisted, or otherwise participated in</i> the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the government met its burden of making a prima facie case that Casta&#241;eda had \"assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution\" and that the burden of showing he had not done so has shifted to Casta&#241;eda. 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1208.13(c)(2)(ii), 1208.16(d)(2). It is also undisputed that the persecution was on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), and the initial asylum interviewing officer each found Casta&#241;eda had not met his burden because he was not credible. He was found not credible based both on observations of his demeanor and on the content of his testimony. The law requires courts to give great deference to those lack of credibility determinations, especially those based on direct observations of the alien's demeanor. The majority fails to accord the appropriate deference to the BIA and, rather than determining whether the record could reasonably be read to support the BIA, determines whether the record could reasonably be read to support Casta&#241;eda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> This is the wrong perspective, and having taken the wrong perspective, the majority reaches the wrong conclusion in holding that substantial evidence does not support the BIA's finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having incorrectly applied the standard of review, the majority further errs in refusing to remand to the BIA to reconsider its determinations in light of the supposed failures in its reasoning and errs in concluding for itself that Casta&#241;eda was credible. Supreme Court precedent and the precedent of this circuit require that the agency be given an opportunity to reconsider, particularly when the BIA did not find it necessary to comment on all of the evidence relied upon by the IJ. The majority errs in holding as a matter of law that Casta&#241;eda was credible and that he had no knowledge of the massacre. The record does not compel either conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This sequence of errors has led the majority into yet a further error, one of great significance and going well beyond the particulars of this case. The majority takes a one-line statement by the BIA &#8212; that Casta&#241;eda still had not met his burden even assuming he was credible that he personally had not killed or harmed anyone &#8212; and draws two mistaken conclusions. First, it turns this into a statement that the BIA made a holding assuming Casta&#241;eda was credible in all of his testimony, including that he had no knowledge of the massacre. The BIA did not say this, and if there is any ambiguity, the case should be remanded for the BIA to clarify. Second, the majority sees in the BIA's statement a ruling of law on the relevance of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge about the massacre to the statutory exclusion for those who assist or otherwise participate in persecution. The BIA's statement means no such thing. The issue of the legal significance of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge was not raised or argued before the agency in the removal proceedings, but was rather raised sua sponte by this court, which asked for and received post-argument briefing on the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the position of the Attorney General that this issue of statutory interpretation is not before this court, was not raised or exhausted before the agency, and is committed in the first instance to the BIA, the majority nonetheless addresses the issue itself, contrary to both the exhaustion and <i>Chevron</i> doctrines. The majority's conclusion as a matter of law that Casta&#241;eda has met his burden of proving he was not a persecutor depends on the majority's implicitly deciding that knowledge is a requirement under the statute (contrary to the position stated by the Attorney General in his brief) and then on the majority's applying this newly formulated legal rule to its version of the facts of this case. The majority refuses to permit the agency to examine on remand the questions both of statutory interpretation and then of application of the legal standard to the facts. The majority concludes that Casta&#241;eda has established that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution and remands to the agency to consider only the question of whether he should be granted asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is wrong on all of these points and has overstepped the limited role assigned to the courts in reviewing decisions of the BIA in immigration cases. The proper outcome of this case is a simple affirmance of the BIA's decision on the grounds that the decision is based on substantial evidence that Casta&#241;eda has not met his burden and the record does not compel any other finding. There is no need to reach the other issues the majority reaches. More than that, courts are forbidden from denying the BIA the opportunity to interpret what the statute means. Accordingly, I dissent. I also attach to this dissent the decision of the BIA in this case, so it may be read directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are required to give deferential review to the BIA's findings. \"[A] decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(C).

In 1983, he graduated from a military academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant. In January 1985, Lieutenant Casta&#241;eda was transferred to anti-terrorist Battalion 34, stationed in Ayacucho, a province within the \"emergency zone\" and the historic birthplace of the Shining Path. This battalion, composed of five companies spread throughout the region, engaged in field operations. Casta&#241;eda was first assigned to be head of a twenty-man patrol in Sacchaeamba, which had two patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After three months, Casta&#241;eda transferred to another base, in Vilcashuan, again as head of one of two patrols. Casta&#241;eda was one of only a few officers at this base; besides himself, there was a captain and a base head. Casta&#241;eda was stationed there in August of 1985.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1985, Casta&#241;eda was involved in a military operation, the details of which are at the center of this case. The operation involved four patrols. Two of the patrols, led by Sub-Lieutenant Telmo Hurtado and Lieutenant Riveri Rond&#243;n, were to enter the village of Llocllapampa, in the Accomarca region, to search for Shining Path members. Two other patrols, including Casta&#241;eda's, were assigned to block escape routes from the village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two main patrols entered the village and massacred as many as sixty-nine civilians. The massacre was reported by the media, and a formal investigation followed. A Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission found that Hurtado's patrol had herded the village inhabitants into two houses, open fired on them, lobbed grenades inside, and set fire to the houses. The Commission concluded that the operation amounted to genocide and found that \"[j]udging by the age of the people and the way they responded[,] it was clear that the people attacked and killed were defenseless.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission noted that Casta&#241;eda's patrol was \"not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\" But it also found that the massacre could not simply be attributed to a single out-of-control officer; instead it wrote that Hurtado \"is only a piece of a larger picture and it is necessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> The Commission left it to the Peruvian court system \"to determine ... the people responsible ... and apply punishments as dictated by the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The massacre was documented in the U.S. State Department's 1985 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Per&#250;. The report stated that \"an Army sub-lieutenant and three other officers were responsible for the Accomarca massacre of some 25 to 69 peasants.\" Casta&#241;eda admitted during testimony before the IJ that he was one of the officers referred to in the report.

He also testified in his own defense, answering questions from a judge and prosecutor. Casta&#241;eda was apparently acquitted of all charges at the court martial.

The IJ found, and Casta&#241;eda does not dispute, that the government produced evidence indicating that Casta&#241;eda \"assisted, or otherwise participated\" in the Accomarca massacre. It is, as a result, undisputed that the burden lay with Casta&#241;eda to show that he did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Hearing Before the IJ</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda put on two types of evidence during an extended hearing before the IJ: his testimony about the events in question and a document purporting to be a judgment from a military tribunal acquitting him of certain charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified extensively about his military experiences both before and during August 1985. He testified that at both bases at which he was stationed in 1985, he headed one of two patrols. While one patrol was out on operations, the other stayed to protect the base. Casta&#241;eda indicated that his patrol went out on both combat and reconnaissance missions. The commander of the battalion was the person who determined the instructions the patrols were given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometimes the patrols were coordinated; sometimes they were independent.

It was, he said, \"very important to coordinate the movement.\" Casta&#241;eda said his patrol would \"keep contact with the base by radio,\" and at least sometimes would make direct radio contact with other patrols in the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that in August 1985, after several weeks of reconnaissance patrolling, he was ordered to go on a combat patrol in mobilized, coordinated activity with three other patrols. His order came from the base captain, following orders of the division command. Casta&#241;eda indicated that he was briefed in advance on the missions of the other three patrols involved in the operation. He was informed that there were forty to sixty Shining Path terrorists at a training center in the village. His patrol was ordered to deploy itself to a place where it could block the path providing an escape route from the village. His deployment position was, according to Casta&#241;eda, located three to five miles from the village. A second patrol was supposed to block the other exit to the village, but it never arrived at its position. The two remaining patrols were the active patrols whose mission was to go into the village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's patrol had twenty men, a radio, and a rocket launcher. He said it took approximately six hours to reach the deployment position. Once there, he testified, he and his troops hid themselves along the sides of the path. When he was in position, he radioed that fact back to the head of the base. He said he would have been in charge of deciding whether to open fire if anyone came along.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda testified that he knew there would be an attack on the village, but was not told when the two lead patrols were ready to attack or when the attack began. He says he was told, via radio contact from the base, only when the attack was over. During the operation, he testified, no one came down the path and his patrol fired no shots. Other evidence in the record suggests the attack went on for two to three hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda denied hearing any radio communications from the attacking patrols during the mission. At first, when asked if he had been \"informed what frequencies the two attacking patrols would be using,\" he replied, \"That's correct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Shortly thereafter, however, he said he did not have the frequencies of the other patrols because he had not been given them. When asked whether the two attacking patrols had his patrol's radio frequency so that they could notify him of any escaping guerrillas, he said they did not. He maintained that each patrol could contact the base by radio, and the two attacking patrols could communicate with each other, but the attacking patrols, by contrast, could not communicate with the patrols blocking the escape routes. Casta&#241;eda was asked to reconcile this testimony about the lack of radio contact among all the patrols, particularly in a mission where multiple patrols were trying to coordinate an attack, with his earlier testimony that communication among patrols could be important. He responded that the attack had been centrally planned that way and that he was simply ordered to exercise his independent judgment in controlling exit points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the attack ended, Casta&#241;eda was ordered back to base by his base commander. He acknowledged that there was a debriefing. He testified that he did not find out about the massacre until weeks later, when he heard a report on civilian radio. He said he later found out that Hurtado had admitted to executing civilians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the subsequent court martial, Casta&#241;eda stated that he was acquitted of all charges, and produced a document purportedly showing that the Supreme Council of Military Justice had affirmed the dismissal of the charges against him. The document, dated April 4, 1989, stated in relevant part that Casta&#241;eda was charged with homicide and abuse of authority and that the charges were dismissed. It gave no reason for the dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda submitted no other documentation relating to the court martial. He did not introduce into his immigration proceedings a transcript of the military court proceedings or the documents he had used in his defense. He also offered no evidence as to what the elements of the charged crimes were, and therefore did little to prove the significance of the purported acquittal in determining whether he assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. However, the U.S. State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Peru does corroborate Casta&#241;eda's ultimate acquittal, stating that \"all the other defendants\" besides Hurtado were \"acquitted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The IJ's Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ heard testimony from Casta&#241;eda in four separate sessions over the course of more than a month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> On October 4, 2004, the IJ concluded that Casta&#241;eda was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he had not proven that he did not \"assist[ ] or otherwise participate[ ]\" in politically motivated killings. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The IJ had three grounds for this conclusion. First, he rejected Casta&#241;eda's argument that the one-page Peruvian document dismissing the charges against him was sufficient to carry his burden. Second, he held that Casta&#241;eda was not credible and had not carried his burden for that reason. Third, the IJ held that even setting aside his credibility determination, Casta&#241;eda's \"motivation and intent [were] irrelevant,\" given that the \"objective effect of [his] participation in the Accomarca operation would have been to ... aid even in some small measure with the execution and murder and rape of those unarmed men, women, and children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ offered numerous grounds for the finding that Casta&#241;eda's testimony was not credible. First, the IJ wrote that he had \"carefully observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor ... and found him to be vague, evasive, and non-responsive during questioning by the Government prosecutor relating to his participation in the massacre at Accomarca and more importantly whether he was aware of that massacre.\" The IJ also found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive and non-responsive when asked why he did not have documentation from his court martial. The IJ further found that Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he did not have the radio frequencies for the other patrols the day of the massacre was \"wholly incredible,\" in part because he had earlier testified that radio contact among patrols could be important and in part because his demeanor indicated a lack of veracity. As to this demeanor finding, the IJ wrote that he \"observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor during this part of his testimony and found him to be extremely incredible.... [Casta&#241;eda was] blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate as compared with the rest of his testimony.\" The IJ also found incredible Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he did not find out about the massacre until weeks later, and then only from the media, especially considering his rank and his presence at briefings and debriefings. Finally, the IJ found incredible both Casta&#241;eda's testimony about his awareness of human rights violations in the emergency zone and his testimony about his knowledge of Hurtado's fate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The BIA Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the BIA, Casta&#241;eda first argued that the IJ should have deferred to the Peruvian tribunal's dismissal of the charges against him; he argued that the IJ's finding &#8212; that Casta&#241;eda failed to prove he had not assisted in persecution &#8212; was \"in direct contravention\" of the military court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA responded on several levels. First, it held that the IJ was correct about potential flaws in Casta&#241;eda's documentary evidence: there was some doubt about whether the acquittal document was properly authenticated, and further, other documents suggested that the military tribunal may have been a mechanism \"to grant impunity to the alleged persecutors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA held as a matter of law that dismissal of the charges in the military tribunal did not establish that Casta&#241;eda was not a persecutor. The government had argued that \"fail[ure] to meet the burden of proof in a criminal forum never ... proves that the defendant was factually innocent [and] ... [t]he legal presumption of innocence at a criminal proceeding cannot be substituted for independent facts which could have established [Casta&#241;eda's] burden of proof.\" Moreover, the government had noted that \"[t]here are many possible scenarios at a criminal trial that could conclude the proceedings in an acquittal without a determination of innocence.\" Agreeing with these arguments, the BIA concluded that Casta&#241;eda's \"evidence of his dismissal is not necessarily the legal equivalent of a criminal finding that he was innocent.\" It was Casta&#241;eda's burden to prove he did not assist or otherwise participate in the massacre; the military court document, which did not specify the reason for dismissal of the charges or offer any details on the charges themselves, did not establish that he had not assisted or otherwise participated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding that Casta&#241;eda had failed to meet his burden of proof, the BIA held that \"even if the respondent testified credibly that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985, there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as his patrol was charged with blocking an escape route for the villagers....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also affirmed on the separate basis that the IJ had not clearly erred in finding Casta&#241;eda less than credible. The BIA specifically referenced the IJ's finding that Casta&#241;eda's demeanor during a line of significant questioning indicated a lack of veracity, and affirmed the finding that Casta&#241;eda was \"evasive\" regarding his court martial. It also said that Casta&#241;eda's argument on appeal that he did not have access to a transcript or other documents from the court martial \"does not seem plausible,\" and that Casta&#241;eda did not \"provide any explanation for not providing [such documents].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also affirmed the IJ's conclusion that crucial portions of Casta&#241;eda's testimony were inconsistent and incredible and reached the same conclusion on its own review. The BIA found that the IJ had not erred in doubting the veracity of Casta&#241;eda's testimony that he had not been in radio contact with the other patrols the day of the killings (and thus had not been aware of the unfolding massacre), particularly because Casta&#241;eda's own testimony established that patrols sometimes made contact and that \"radio contact was important for purposes of coordination as well as efficiency and protection of the patrols.\" Further, the BIA affirmed the IJ's findings that Casta&#241;eda was not forthcoming about the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military and about the fate of Hurtado, the patrol commander charged with primary responsibility for the massacre. It concluded: \"In light of obvious media attention and international documentation of the massacre, as well as [Casta&#241;eda's] military position and subsequent accusations about his role, it was reasonable to expect him to provide answers regarding what occurred in Peru on and after August 8, particularly since he failed to provide adequate documentary evidence of his innocence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Adverse Credibility Determination</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA's adverse credibility determination, which in itself is sufficient to support the BIA's conclusion that Casta&#241;eda did not meet his burden. The IJ and BIA based their findings on Casta&#241;eda's demeanor and evasiveness and on the tendency for his testimony to be contradictory and non-responsive. The majority errs in dismissing this evidence and imposing its own view of the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to carry his burden, \"an alien must support his claim ... through credible testimony.\" <i>Nikijuluw v.

Furthermore, a witness's demeanor is often a critical factor in determining his veracity.

In other words, the strong deference we owe to BIA findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard applies even more so to adverse credibility determinations based on witness demeanor. <i>See Rodr&#237;guez Del Carmen v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202111\"><a href=\"/opinion/202111/rodriguez-del-carmen-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2006) (\"Matters of witness credibility and demeanor are peculiarly for the factfinder,\" and credibility determinations supported with specific findings are treated \"`with great respect.'\" (quoting <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ said he had \"carefully observed [Casta&#241;eda's] demeanor\" and had concluded that Casta&#241;eda was not telling the truth about his role in the massacre. More specifically, the IJ had observed Casta&#241;eda's demeanor during his testimony about radio contact and found him \"extremely incredible.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ also found that Casta&#241;eda was \"extremely vague, evasive, and non-responsive\" when cross-examined by the government attorney about the massacre and the events following and about his lack of documentary evidence of the court martial. The BIA found no error in any of these findings, and its decision was reasonable, as the following examples show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Casta&#241;eda's testimony, he appeared to contradict himself, and failed to give direct answers, in response to a series of questions about whether he had had the other patrols' radio frequencies on the day of the massacre. Casta&#241;eda initially indicated that he had had such frequencies, and then stated that he had not. At some point, the IJ stepped in to get a straight answer from an evasive witness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ: Sir, it still hasn't been answered though.

Could you contact them by radio, yes or no?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: No. I could not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the cross-examination, Casta&#241;eda was asked what had happened in the village the day of the massacre, and he replied: \"One of the patrols ... committed excesses.\" He then claimed that he did not know until his appearance before the IJ how many villagers had been killed, and that such information was never discussed during his court martial. Information about the number of deaths, however, appears to have been widely circulated following the massacre, and such information was discussed in the report of the Peruvian Human Rights Commission, which led to the court martial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still later, Casta&#241;eda was confronted with a 1985 State Department report stating that \"an army sub-lieutenant and three other officers\" were responsible for the massacre. The government attorney asked him whether the report was \"talking about you.\" Again, the witness was evasive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: They are talking about the patrol head of that commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IJ: Sir, are they talking about you, yes or no?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C: Yes. They are talking about me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also substantial record support for the finding that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about his knowledge about Hurtado.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a> In response to repeated questions, Casta&#241;eda denied having any positive knowledge about whether Hurtado had been discharged from the military. Yet when confronted with a human rights report from the U.S. State Department, he admitted to \"find[ing] out through public media when [he] was here in the United States\" that Hurtado had been promoted to captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These examples suffice to demonstrate a substantial basis in the record for the conclusion that Casta&#241;eda was evasive and non-responsive, and for the BIA's refusal to believe his story.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda and the majority take issue with several of the subsidiary bases for the BIA's and IJ's adverse credibility determinations. Casta&#241;eda argues, for instance, that the BIA erroneously disbelieved his testimony about lack of radio contact with other patrols, and that it erroneously found him evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations committed by the Peruvian military. The majority agrees and adopts similar criticisms of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the radio issue, the BIA found unlikely Casta&#241;eda's testimony that on the day of the massacre, not only did he not have radio contact with the other patrols, but he did not even know the frequency they were using. The BIA relied in part on Casta&#241;eda's earlier testimony that he sometimes had had direct radio contact with other patrols; the BIA said this testimony was \"inconsistent\" with Casta&#241;eda's assertions about the day of the massacre. In a sense, it was not \"inconsistent\" for Casta&#241;eda to deny radio contact on the day of the massacre, since, as the majority notes, he had said that he only sometimes had radio contact with other patrols. But this criticism misses the BIA's point that this operation was a coordinated combat mission, out of the ordinary, and it was much more likely in such a circumstance that the two attacking patrols would have at least had the capability to contact Casta&#241;eda's patrol by radio, both to provide Casta&#241;eda with information on escaping guerrillas and to call in the assistance of Casta&#241;eda's patrol if needed. If radio contact among patrols was at least sometimes used, this would have seemed the time to make contact possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the issue of human rights violations, Casta&#241;eda did, after some questioning, admit that he was aware of extrajudicial killings by the Peruvian army, and that members of the armed forces had been responsible for disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions. But one could view the record as showing evasiveness. The BIA could reasonably have considered that Casta&#241;eda's new-found relative candor as to human rights abuses contrasted sharply with Casta&#241;eda's initial asylum interview, when he was asked the same question and found both not candid and not credible. The BIA could have considered that Casta&#241;eda might have wanted to downplay the significance of his knowledge of a pattern of human rights abuses by the Peruvian military before the events in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's additional bases for its adverse credibility determination are also substantially supported. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Casta&#241;eda's failure to provide more documentary evidence from his court martial reflected negatively on his credibility because such evidence should have been available to him. <i>See Estrada-Henao v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202280\"><a href=\"/opinion/202280/estrada-henao-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2006) (holding that lack of documentation is \"not automatically fatal\" but that \"where documentation would naturally be expected, its lack can count against the applicant\"). Casta&#241;eda was asked during proceedings before the IJ whether there was any written accounting of the facts that would support his account of the day of the massacre. He said he had submitted documents to the court martial, but did not have them for the immigration proceeding. Given the formal nature of the court martial and the fact that Casta&#241;eda was able to procure the dismissal-of-charges document and other documents from Peru, the BIA's conclusion that Casta&#241;eda's credibility was weakened by his failure to produce additional documentation is supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also upheld the IJ's conclusion that given Casta&#241;eda's position as head of one patrol in the joint operation, his \"entire testimony regarding how he found out about [the massacre] only from the media is wholly incredible.\" The IJ reasonably concluded that it was unlikely that information that two patrols had just killed over five dozen men, women, and children would not find its way to the third patrol that participated in the same operation, and particularly to the head of that patrol. The practice of debriefings only made it even more likely that Casta&#241;eda would have learned about the atrocities engaged in by the other patrols before the media did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the BIA's adverse credibility determination survives substantial evidence review, and that requires affirmance. The majority sees in the record insufficient evidence of Casta&#241;eda's participation in the massacre, finding the evidence of evasiveness and inconsistencies to be too ambiguous. The majority forgets, however, that the burden was on Casta&#241;eda to prove he had not assisted or otherwise participated, and that therefore the question is not whether there was sufficient evidence that he participated, but whether there was sufficient evidence that he did not. Since there is substantial evidence to support the BIA's finding that Casta&#241;eda's credibility was questionable, and since Casta&#241;eda relied almost exclusively on his testimony for evidence, the BIA's decision must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Significance of the Peruvian Court's Dismissal of Charges</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda and the majority fault the BIA for failing to accord the proper weight to the Peruvian court's dismissal of the court martial charges against Casta&#241;eda. They are mistaken, however, in arguing that the dismissal is itself sufficient to carry his burden of proof, and indeed, the BIA was not mistaken in according the bare dismissal very little weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda's main argument is that the BIA erred in concluding that the Peruvian court martial was a whitewash and in \"disregard[ing]\" that court's dismissal of the charges against him. The BIA did not disregard the Peruvian judgment; it merely evaluated that evidence and found it not to be particularly helpful for Casta&#241;eda. The BIA also did not rest its conclusion as to the dismissal's limited significance on a finding that the court martial was a fraud. The BIA did say that the IJ had so concluded, and noted that \"there [was] evidence\" to support the conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a> The BIA then gave two other reasons. First, there was no evidence as to the grounds on which charges were dismissed, and a dismissal of criminal charges may not be the result of an acquittal on the merits. Second, dismissal of criminal charges on any grounds &#8212; even acquittal on the merits &#8212; is not the same as a finding of innocence on those particular charges. Given the divergent burdens of proof, the mere fact that a defendant has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean he is more likely innocent than not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's reasoning is entirely sound. Furthermore, Casta&#241;eda was charged in the court martial with homicide and abuse of authority. The elements of those crimes are not the same as the standards under immigration law to find an alien statutorily ineligible for asylum.

This is because immigration decisions often involve matters on which the BIA can bring its particular expertise to bear. <i>See Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122242\"><a href=\"/opinion/122242/ins-v-orlando-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, this court has held that the more an issue relates to matters within an administrative agency's particular expertise, the less willing a court should be to decide an issue itself. <i>See R.I. Higher Educ.

Even if the BIA's reasoning as to the finding that Casta&#241;eda lacked credibility were flawed, the majority is not correct in finding that the evidence <i>compels</i> exactly the opposite conclusion: that Casta&#241;eda is credible. That is especially so because Casta&#241;eda bears the burden to show his credibility. The BIA did not find it necessary to comment on all of the reasons the IJ gave for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible &#8212; for example, on the point that Casta&#241;eda was vague and evasive concerning how he learned about the massacre. The BIA must be given the opportunity to reconsider such evidence. An appellate court should not, as the majority does, make a credibility finding, especially in a case such as this one involving \"witness demeanor\" and \"conflicting or confused testimony.\" <i>Cf. Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 491. The majority cites no case in which an appellate court made its own credibility finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there are other reasons to remand. Although the majority faults the BIA for allegedly failing to accord appropriate deference to the judgment of the Peruvian military court, the majority apparently does not assert that this judgment alone satisfies Casta&#241;eda's burden. The BIA must be allowed to reconsider its decision in light of the majority's ruling on the appropriate view of the foreign judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority further errs in holding that Casta&#241;eda met his burden to show that he did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution. The majority improperly reads into the BIA's decision a holding it did not make, then improperly decides a novel issue of statutory interpretation, and finally improperly applies its newly formulated rule to the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority reads the BIA's opinion to have stated a holding assuming that Casta&#241;eda did not know about the massacre. No such holding can be found. The BIA's opinion addressed the dismissal of the court martial charges against Casta&#241;eda and the correctness of the credibility determination made by the IJ. The only sentence discussing an alternate holding states that in the BIA's opinion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">even if the respondent testified credibly <i>that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985,</i> there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confine them, inasmuch as his patrol was charged with blocking an escape route for the villagers and people located in the emergency zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). The majority finds that this lone sentence, together with its citation to a page in the IJ's opinion and to <i>In re Rodr&#237;guez-Majano,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811 (BIA 1988), suffices to open the door to the majority's conclusions: (a) that as a matter of law, a person without prior or contemporaneous knowledge of the persecution cannot have assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution within the meaning of the statutes at issue here by blocking an escape route for those persecuted, and (b) that because the record purportedly compels the conclusion that Casta&#241;eda had no such knowledge in this case, Casta&#241;eda has met his burden to show that he did not assist or otherwise participate in persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority is simply wrong in all of this. First, the majority is wrong to find in the BIA's opinion any holding that takes into account the state of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge. The BIA did not say that it was assuming all of Casta&#241;eda's testimony was credible, only that even if Casta&#241;eda had not harmed or killed anyone on the day of the massacre, this did not establish that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the massacre. The cited portion of the IJ's opinion merely supports this proposition by finding Casta&#241;eda's \"motivation and intent\" largely irrelevant: the majority agrees that this is the established rule. <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Majano</i> also supports this proposition by incidentally mentioning that one can participate in persecution without directly harming anyone by having an \"objective effect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 815. Neither the IJ nor <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Majano</i> considered whether knowledge has any bearing on a finding that an alien assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. The BIA did not consider this point either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is any ambiguity as to what the BIA held, or questions about the basis for the BIA's holding, the majority is required to remand to the BIA for further explanation. <i>See Halo v.

The majority is not free to decide the case on grounds not addressed by the BIA. <i>See Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 44 (\"`[A] reviewing court ... must judge the propriety of [administrative] action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.'\" (alteration in original) (quoting <i>SEC v.

The majority does so by repeatedly asserting its prior improper conclusion that Casta&#241;eda did not know about the massacre, and then assuming this lack of knowledge as a background fact in its analysis of the \"objective effect\" of Casta&#241;eda's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be that the majority is saying that even if Casta&#241;eda knew full well that the villagers would be massacred, he still would not have assisted or otherwise participated in the massacre. If that is what the majority means, its holding is both irrational and flatly contrary to the \"objective effect\" line of cases that the majority cites.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> The majority cites no case <i>holding</i> that those with lesser tasks &#8212; such as blocking escape routes &#8212; should not be barred as persecutors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a> To be clear, the calculus might be different if Casta&#241;eda did not know about the atrocities, but that issue is one for the BIA to address in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The logic of the majority's opinion thus depends upon its reaching and resolving an issue of statutory interpretation, namely whether knowledge is a factor that must be considered in determining whether an alien \"assisted or otherwise participated in\" persecution within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i) and 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).

Not only is such a factor nowhere to be found in the statutory text, but determining which factors to consider in applying a statute is even more clearly the province of the BIA. <i>See Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Neither the IJ nor the BIA found or assumed that Casta&#241;eda had established that there was no order allowing the patrols to harm civilians who were known to have harbored the Shining Path, that Hurtado's patrol was a rogue patrol acting entirely on its own, or that Casta&#241;eda had no knowledge of the massacre before or as it was happening.

Rather, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents' applications for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158, 1231(b)(3), respectively, because he found the lead respondent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> statutorily for having ordered, incited, or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. <i>See</i> sections 208(b)(2)(A)(i) and 241(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). Specifically, the immigration Judge found that the lead respondent, who was a member of the armed forces in Peru and patrol leader of one four units assigned to patrol an \"emergency zone\" in the state of Accomarca (I.J. at 7), participated in a military operation on August 8, 1985, which resulted in a massacre of innocent civilians, an event which a human rights commission has labeled as genocide (Exh. 35; I.J. at 8). In concluding its investigation, the human rights commission apparently recommended that the respondent be tried in civil court, as opposed to a military court martial (I.J. at 9; Exh. 35), and as noted by the Immigration Judge, the Department of State County Reports for 1985 (Exh. 40) detail that the respondent and other military leaders involved in the incident were charged in both civil and military courts (I.J. at 9-11). The respondent admitted that he was one of the leaders referred to in the Country Reports which indicated that the Peruvian Supreme Court was to decide final jurisdictional issue, the Immigration Judge concluded that the Supreme Court had decided that the respondent would be tried in military court because the respondent was able to produces a copy of the Peruvian Supreme Council of Military Justice's affirmance of a lower court's dismissal of murder charges against him (I.J. at 11; Exh. 24).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the respondents that the immigration Judge erred in not giving deference to the foreign military court's decision dismissing the charges against him, a decision which goes against the \"principle of international comity\" (Respondents' Br. At 9-10). Furthermore, he asserts that the documentary evidence relied on by the Immigration Judge to deem the military court's dismissal as having less weight were general in nature and did not contradict the respondent's evidence (Respondents' Br. at 10-11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted by the Immigration Judge, there is some doubt about the validity of the respondent's evidence Inasmuch as it was not properly authenticated and also appeared to have been issued by the clerk's office of the Supreme Council of Military Justice and not by the Supreme Council itself (I.J. at 11-12). Furthermore, no other documents regarding the respondent's trial were submitted in order to determine the exact grounds for dismissing the respondent's military court martial and the documentary evidence of record indicates that there is evidence that the military tribunal was a way in which to grant impunity to the alleged persecutors who took part in the August 8, 1985, massacre (Exh. 41; I.J. at 3436; Tr. at 439-46; <i>see also</i> Exh. 43). As pointed out by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service); the respondent's evidence of this dismissal is not necessarily the legal equivalent of a criminal finding that he was innocent, particularly without additional evidence to indicate the court's reasoning (DHS's Br. at 4). In sum, we find no error in the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proving that he did not assist or otherwise participate in the persecution of villagers in Accomarca based on their political opinion (I.J. at 36); even if the respondent testified credibly that he did not harm or execute anyone on August 8, 1985, there is substantial evidence to support the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent did aid in the persecution of others by helping to confined them, inasmuch as his patrol was charted with blocking an escape route for the villagers and people located in the emergency zone (I.J. at 36; See Tr. at 201, 351-55). <i>Matter of Rodriguez-Majano,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 811 (BIA 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent was not completely credible and affirm the denial of relief on this basis as well (I.J. at 37-43). The Immigration Judge found the respondent evasive regarding his military court martial and, as already noted, the respondent failed to provide documentary evidence such as a transcript of the hearing which would have shed greater light on his activities during the August 8, 1985 patrol (I.J. at 37-38, 40; Tr. at 411-32, 435-53, 456-73). The respondent's assertion on appeal that he may not have had access to these documents does not seem plausible nor does he provide any explanation for not providing them (Respondents' Br. at 13).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Immigration Judge relied on the fact that he respondent gave inconsistent testimony regarding whether and when he was in radio contact with the other patrol involved in the August 8 patrol, indicating early in his testimony that it was important always to have radio contact and later stating that he was not in radio contact with the patrols on the day of the massacre (I.J. at 38-41; Tr. at 314-16, 329-34, 366-75); the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent's demeanor during this portion of questioning was also indicative of a lack of veracity (I.J. at 40). The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge misconstrued his statements because he testified that radio contact between patrols was made <i>sometimes</i> (Respondents' Br. at 14; I.J. at 41). We disagree with the respondent that the Immigration Judge's determination \"ventured into the realm of Peruvian military tactics, an arena outside of his knowledge and expertise\" (Respondents' Br. at 15). Based on the respondent's own testimony, is clear that radio contact was important for purposes of coordination as well as efficiency and protection of the patrols (<i>See, e.g.,</i> Tr. at 314).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Immigration Judge found the respondent evasive regarding the extent of human rights violations by the military which has been documented by the Department of State (I.J. at 41-42) and that the respondent was not forthcoming about the judgement entered against one of his fellow commanders (I.J. at 42-43). The respondent argues that knowledge of another's fate is irrelevant and immaterial to his case (Respondents' Br. at 15); he states that the Immigration Judge misconstrued the respondent's testimony about his fellow commander's fate (Respondents' Br. at 17 (citing Tr. at 440)). While it may be true that the respondent, a patrol leader, lacked knowledge regarding the events which took place following the August 8 massacre, including whether and how many people were killed as well as the outcome of his fellow officers' court martials, we also cannot find clear error in the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent was evasive. In light of obvious media attention and international documentation of the massacre, as well as the respondent's military position and subsequent accusations about his role, it was reasonable to expect him to provide answer regarding what occurred in Peru on an after August 8, particularly since he failed to provide adequate documentary evidence of his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ORDER: The Respondents' appeal is dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge's order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions se forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the female respondents (A70 700 783, 70 700 782, and 70 701 180) are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). <i>See</i> Section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1240.26(c), (f).

Moreover, those who actually heard Casta&#241;eda's testimony are in a much better position than this court to weigh the effects of any translation difficulties. Similarly, the majority's assertions that Casta&#241;eda misunderstood some questions or was interrupted by the judge might be<i>possible</i> readings of the record, but the record certainly does not <i>compel</i> such conclusions, and we are in a poor position to judge such matters from the transcript alone.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn42\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42_ref\">42</a>\n        <p> The majority objects to my account of the facts as unduly recounting \"the actions of persons for whom Casta&#241;eda was not responsible and who were without his command or authority.\" I am merely recounting, however, the persecution that Casta&#241;eda is supposed to have assisted or participated in. The evidence of such persecution was properly before the IJ and BIA. The majority also appears to complain that the extent of the persecution is irrelevant and should be ignored. There is no rule that the BIA cannot weigh the extent of persecution.

The point, however, is that the BIA could consider that if Hurtado was acting on orders, rather than in the heat of the moment, it is much more likely that Casta&#241;eda would have known about the massacre before it happened</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn44\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44_ref\">44</a>\n        <p> It is unclear whether he also was charged with first degree murder</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn45\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45_ref\">45</a>\n        <p> The IJ and BIA never reached the issue of whether Casta&#241;eda could meet the standards for asylum or withholding of removal<i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(1), 1231(b)(3)(A).

In any event, regardless of whether the majority's reading is a plausible one, it is equally plausible, and reasonable on the part of the IJ and BIA, to read Casta&#241;eda's testimony as unduly attempting to minimize his knowledge of the massacre</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn49\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49_ref\">49</a>\n        <p> The majority's claim &#8212; that the issue of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge about Hurtado is a \"red herring\" &#8212; is puzzling. As the majority itself notes, \"Casta&#241;eda's case is based on his disassociation from Hurtado's actions.\" The BIA and IJ were entirely justified in presuming that evasiveness as to Casta&#241;eda's later knowledge about Hurtado's fate indicated a lack of credibility regarding his earlier knowledge about Hurtado's actions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn50\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50_ref\">50</a>\n        <p> Of course, such information need not have been \"openly discuss[ed]\" in order to have been shared</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn51\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51_ref\">51</a>\n        <p> For example, Lieutenant Hurtado, who led one of the combat patrols into the village, was acquitted of first-degree murder charges and convicted only of abuse of authority.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772114\"><a href=\"/opinion/772114/juozas-naujalis-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service-and-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 647 (7th Cir.2001), in which the Seventh Circuit found that a soldier who guarded a railway station had assisted in the persecution engaged in by his battalion. The majority objects that <i>Naujalis</i> is a case about Nazi guards and that Peruvian military guards, unlike Nazi guards, can serve legitimate purposes. The statute makes no such distinction, and in any event, such a distinction has no bearing on the culpability of one who participates in an operation involving persecution.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn54\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54_ref\">54</a>\n        <p> In only one of the many \"objective effect\" cases cited by the majority did the court reverse a finding that the alien was a persecutor. That case is<i>Hern&#225;ndez v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774206\"><a href=\"/opinion/774206/rolando-hernandez-v-janet-reno-1-attorney-general-us-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2001), a case involving a man forcibly recruited to join a guerrilla movement and turning on whether the man's actions were sufficiently coerced. None of the \"objective effect\" cases cited by the majority involved aliens who might not have acted knowingly.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the respondents did not apply for relief under the Convention Against Torture and conceded that they could not establish that it is more likely than not the Peruvian government wound torture them or acquiesce to their torture (I.J. at 32), the Immigration Judge addressed such relief in his decision and found that the respondents had failed to meet their burdens of proof (I.J. at 31-33, 44-46)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> All reference to respondent in the singular refer to the lead respondent</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
