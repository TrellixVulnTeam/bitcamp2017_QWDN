R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2628\n\n                    JAMES E. ANDERSON, ET AL.,\n\n                     Petitioners, Appellants,\n\n                                     v.\n\n               COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE,\n\n                        Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n                 ON APPEAL FROM THE DECISION OF\n                   THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James E. Anderson and Cheryl J. Latos on brief pro se.\n     Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General, Thomas J.\nClark and Kenneth W. Rosenberg on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 5, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.   After carefully considering the briefs and\n\nrecord on appeal, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by\n\nthe Tax Court.1   Among other problems, the appellants fail to show\n\nthat the statute categorizes their income as employee income.\n\n'Proceeds' is not synonymous with 'gross proceeds'.     The amount of\n\ncompensation paid to one entitled to receive only a share of the\n\nnet proceeds from the sale of the catch depends on the size of the\n\ncatch, as required.\n\n            The appellants have not presented a coherent account of\n\ntheir interpretation of the regulation.      The amount of a share of\n\nthe catch, in their sense, must always depend on many factors other\n\nthan catch-size, e.g., the market and other conditions.\n\n            Affirmed.   1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Accordingly, we deny oral argument.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f",
