Plaintiff Equitable Life Assurance Society\n\n(“Equitable”) challenges, inter alia, the district court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendant Softex Products, Inc., P.R.\n\n(“Softex”) in a dispute over the allocation of property taxes in a\n\nlease agreement.             After   due   consideration     of       the   record,   we\n\nreverse.\n\n                  I.    Factual and Procedural Background\n\n            Beginning in November 1995, Softex leased a portion of a\n\nbuilding in an industrial park owned by Industrial Warehouses, Inc.\n\n(“Industrial”).        In the lease, Softex agreed to pay monthly rent,\n\nas well as its pro rata share (based on the square footage Softex\n\noccupied)   of    property       taxes     assessed   to   the    parcel      owned   by\n\nIndustrial.      The lease term was five years.\n\n            Softex manufactured paper products and, by virtue of its\n\nbusiness    line,      was    potentially     eligible     for    a    ninety-percent\n\nreduction in taxes under Puerto Rico law.                        Softex sought and\n\nobtained a tax exemption from the Puerto Rico Office of Industrial\n\nTax Exemption (\"OITE\") in 1996.1                 Industrial, as owner of the\n\n\n     1\n      The parties dispute the legal effect of this exemption.\nEquitable, the successor to Industrial’s interest in the lease,\nargues that the exemption applied only to real and personal\nproperty that Softex owned, and that as to the leased property,\nSoftex could only take advantage of the exemption if the owner also\nobtained a tax exemption. Neither Industrial nor Equitable ever\nobtained a tax exemption from the Commonwealth for the property\nleased by Softex.      At oral argument, counsel for Equitable\nrepresented that as a result, Equitable is liable to the\nCommonwealth for the full (i.e., unabated) amount of property taxes\nduring Softex’s tenancy, although it appears that those taxes have\n\n                                           -2-\n\fproperty leased to Softex, unsuccessfully sought a tax exemption\n\nfor the property in 1998; its application was denied with prejudice\n\nbecause Industrial had outstanding debts to the government.\n\n             In    June    1999,    Industrial     transferred      title     to   the\n\nproperty (and assigned all related leases) to Equitable, a New York\n\ncorporation, as payment on an outstanding debt.                     At that time,\n\nSoftex   ceased      contributing      towards     the    taxes    on   the    leased\n\nproperty.     When Softex’s lease expired at the end of 2000, the\n\nparties became embroiled in a dispute over the amounts due from\n\nSoftex as a holdover tenant.                Equitable initiated an eviction\n\naction against Softex in Puerto Rico superior court in March 2001,\n\nand   soon   thereafter      brought       the   underlying    diversity       action\n\nseeking overdue rent, taxes, insurance premiums, and operating\n\nexpenses.         Within   weeks,    the    parties      settled   most   of    their\n\ndifferences by a stipulation in the eviction action.                    The dispute\n\nover property taxes remained, however, and the federal action went\n\nforward on this basis.\n\n\n\n\nnot yet been paid because of administrative delays. It likewise\nappears that Softex paid some or all of its portion of the property\ntax assessments during the period that Industrial owned the\nproperty, without reduction on the basis of any purported\nexemption.\n     By contrast, Softex contends that the exemption entitled it to\nreimbursement for ninety percent of its taxes, regardless whether\nthe taxes assessed on the property occupied by Softex were actually\nreduced by the Commonwealth. Because our conclusion turns on the\nlanguage of the lease, we need not involve ourselves in this\ndispute.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            In    May     2001,    Softex      filed    counterclaims     against\n\nEquitable, seeking relocation costs, reimbursement for property\n\ntaxes    previously       paid,   and   $50,000    in     unspecified    damages.\n\nEquitable moved to dismiss the counterclaims for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief may be granted.                   See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).        Softex    opposed,     and,    after   a   somewhat    irregular\n\nprogression of filings, the district court was presented with what\n\namounted    to     cross-motions        for     summary      judgment    on   the\n\ncounterclaims.2      Equitable also moved for summary judgment on its\n\nown claims, alleging that the lease unambiguously required Softex\n\nto pay its full share of property taxes.\n\n            In a September 16, 2002 order, the district court denied\n\nEquitable’s motion for summary judgment on its claims against\n\nSoftex, concluding that the lease agreement was ambiguous as to who\n\nwas responsible for the property taxes at issue.                 Turning to the\n\nlegislative intent behind the tax exemption laws for guidance in\n\ninterpreting the contract, the court found that Softex was entitled\n\nto a tax exemption, although the OITE had not in fact granted such\n\n\n\n     2\n      Softex responded to the motion to dismiss in a filing titled\n“Opposition to Motion to Dismiss And/Or Motion for Summary Judgment\nPursuant to Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” It asked\nthe district court to consider an affidavit of a Softex officer who\nnegotiated the lease. Softex did not, however, attach a statement\nof uncontested material facts as required by Local Rule 311.12.\nEquitable responded with a request that its motion to dismiss be\ntreated as a cross-motion for summary judgment.           Equitable\nsubmitted a statement of uncontested material facts in compliance\nwith the local rules.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fan exemption to Industrial or Equitable as owners of the property.\n\n             The district court granted Equitable’s motion to dismiss\n\nthe counterclaims in part, concluding that Softex failed to state\n\nany factual predicate for its claim of $50,000 in unspecified\n\ndamages.3      The district court did not expressly award Softex\n\nrelocation costs and reimbursement for prior property taxes paid,\n\nbut appeared to do so implicitly by granting Softex’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment without explanation.      Equitable appealed.\n\n                             II.   Analysis\n\n             Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.       Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford\n\nMotor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2002).      The district court’s\n\nsummary judgment ruling is subject to plenary review.        See id.\n\nTypically, we construe the record in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmovant, resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's\n\nfavor.      See id.    But here, the district court accepted the\n\nuncontested material facts submitted by Equitable because Softex\n\nfailed to comply with Local Rule 311.12. United Parcel Serv., Inc.\n\nv. Flores-Galarza, 318 F.3d 323, 330 & n.10 (1st Cir. 2003).       We\n\nuphold that ruling, which was well within the district court’s\n\ndiscretion, see id., and consider the facts accordingly.\n\n\n\n     3\n         Softex has not appealed this ruling.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          On appeal, Equitable contends that the district court\n\nfound contract ambiguity where there was none, and therefore acted\n\nimproperly in interjecting the legislative intent underlying the\n\ntax laws into the parties' lease agreement.     Equitable further\n\nargues that Softex is not entitled to the damages sought in the\n\ncounterclaims.   We find Equitable’s arguments persuasive.\n\nA.        Property Tax Liability\n\n          Equitable contends that the lease unambiguously assigned\n\nresponsibility for taxes on the subject property to Softex.\n\nSection 4 of the lease agreement addressed the issue of taxes:\n\n          (a) In addition to the minimum rental to be\n          paid by LESSEE . . . LESSEE agrees to pay to\n          LESSOR in the manner and at the times\n          hereinafter provided an amount equal to\n          26.716%4 of all real estate taxes and\n          assessments levied or imposed upon any and all\n          of the parcel of land before described and on\n          the    building    erected   thereupon,    and\n          improvements thereto, except that the LESSEE\n          shall be under no obligation to pay any\n          income, corporation, inheritance, devolution,\n          gift or estate tax or any other tax which may\n          be charged or assessed against the LESSOR, or\n          any tax upon the sale, transfer, assignment of\n          the title or estate of the LESSOR which at any\n          time may be assessed against or become a lien\n          upon the DEMISED PREMISES, this leasehold or\n          the rent accruing therefrom. The LESSOR may\n          have received or may receive in the future,\n          tax exemptions on portion of the land and\n          building for which the LESSEE may not be\n\n\n     4\n      The figure 26.716% is derived from the percentage of the\nindustrial park property that Softex occupied. During its tenancy,\nSoftex leased additional space, bringing its share of the property\nto 43.076%.\n\n                               -6-\n\f           entitled, in which case the LESSEE will be\n           responsible for aforementioned percentage of\n           real estate taxes and assessments based on the\n           full assessed value without regard to any tax\n           credits or exemptions.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n           The first part of § 4(a) states that Softex, as lessee,\n\nis   responsible   for   its   share   of   real   estate   taxes.   This\n\nresponsibility is underscored in the next sentence, which states\n\nthat the lessee must pay its percentage of the full assessed value\n\nof the property, “without regard to any tax credits or exemptions”\n\nthat the lessor obtains or may obtain in the future.\n\n           The district court noted that, in this case, it was the\n\nlessee, not the lessor, who held an exemption, and concluded that\n\n4(a) “does not speak to [this] inverse situation.” Finding this an\n\nambiguity not addressed by the lease, the district court looked to\n\nthe tax exemption laws for guidance.        The district court concluded\n\nthat Softex should have had the benefit of a reduction in property\n\ntaxes, and therefore denied Equitable’s claim for past due property\n\ntaxes and granted Softex’s claim for reimbursement by Equitable.\n\n           We take a different view of the lease, which required\n\nSoftex to pay its share of “all real estate taxes and assessments\n\nlevied or imposed” on the property owned by Equitable.               This\n\nunqualified language governs, because nothing in the lease suggests\n\nthat the parties intended to cap Softex's tax obligation at the\n\ntax-exempt rate.    If Softex wanted its tax obligation to be pegged\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fto whether it received a discounted tax rate, it should have\n\nnegotiated such a condition in the lease.              See Martin v. Vector\n\nCo., Inc., 498 F.2d 16, 24 (1st Cir. 1974).             Because the lease is\n\nclear, we look no further than its four corners.            31 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 3471 (“If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as\n\nto the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of\n\nits stipulations shall be observed. If the words should appear\n\ncontrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the\n\nintention    shall    prevail.”);    Executive    Leasing    Corp.   v.     Banco\n\nPopular de P.R., 48 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 1995) (“[T]o consider the\n\nextrinsic evidence at all, the court must first find the relevant\n\nterms of the agreement unclear.\").\n\n            In addition to the rationale provided by the district\n\ncourt, Softex points to the absence of an integration clause in the\n\nlease, inviting us to consider extrinsic evidence purportedly\n\nshowing   that     the   parties   intended    that    Softex    would    not   be\n\nresponsible for its full share of property taxes.                See Executive\n\nLeasing, 48 F.3d at 69.            Even if we assume arguendo that the\n\nabsence of    an     integration    clause    allows   us   to   consider    such\n\nevidence, the outcome would be no different.                Having failed to\n\ncontest Equitable’s version of the facts or to present a statement\n\nof uncontested material facts in support of its own theory of the\n\ncase, Softex is bound by the facts as presented by Equitable, which\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdo not include the parol evidence on which Softex hopes to rely.5\n\n          We conclude that, by virtue of the clear and unambiguous\n\nlease terms, Softex bore liability for the specified percentages of\n\nthe property taxes ultimately imposed on the subject property, as\n\nwell as the risk that the amounts assessed by the Commonwealth\n\nwould not be reduced on the basis of a tax exemption.       We therefore\n\nreverse the district court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\nSoftex and remand with instructions that judgment be entered in\n\nfavor of Equitable on this issue.\n\nB.        Relocation Expenses\n\n          Equitable argues that the district court erroneously, and\n\nperhaps   inadvertently,   awarded    Softex   relocation    costs   and\n\nreimbursement for prior property taxes paid.      Although the record\n\nis somewhat ambiguous, it appears that after the district court\n\ndismissed Softex’s claim for $50,000 in unspecified damages on\n\nEquitable’s motion, it granted summary judgment in favor of Softex\n\n\n\n     5\n      Softex also contends that the language of the lease itself\ndemonstrates that the parties intended that Softex would have the\nbenefit of its tax exemption. As support, Softex points to the\nportion of § 4(a) that states that Softex “shall be under no\nobligation to pay any income, corporation, inheritance, devolution,\ngift or estate tax or any other tax which may be charged or\nassessed against the LESSOR” (emphasis added). Softex would have\nus conclude that this general “or any other tax” language prevails,\nrendering meaningless the preceding clause specifically assigning\nto Softex an obligation to pay a portion of the taxes on the\nproperty. Because we consider the terms of the lease together,\nrejecting interpretations that would render portions of the\ncontract meaningless, see 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3475, we find this\nargument meritless.\n\n                                -9-\n\fon the remainder of Softex’s counterclaim (i.e., relocation costs\n\nand prior property taxes paid by Softex).6   The district court did\n\nnot make any factual findings regarding the relocation costs, nor\n\ndid it draw any legal conclusions that could form a basis for\n\nimposing liability on Equitable.\n\n          Equitable argues that any costs sought by Softex would\n\nhave been incurred in vacating the property at the conclusion of\n\nthe lease, and that Softex has neither alleged nor proven any\n\nwrongdoing on Equitable’s part that would give rise to liability\n\nfor such costs.   Faced with the uncontested facts as presented by\n\nEquitable, and the dearth of documentation regarding the amount and\n\nnature of the damages sought by Softex,7 we agree with Equitable.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      We reverse the district court’s award of property taxes to\nSoftex for the reasons discussed in Section II.A., above, and\ntherefore limit our discussion of Softex’s counterclaims to the\nissue of relocation expenses.\n     7\n      Even if we did not adopt Equitable’s version of the facts,\nSoftex’s opposition to Equitable’s motion to dismiss (a putative\nmotion for summary judgment on its counterclaims) presented no\nevidence documenting its purported $33,620.61 in relocation costs.\nIts sole supporting affidavit, a statement by an officer of the\ncompany, merely stated that Softex incurred “relocation expenses .\n. . due to the bad faith perpetrated by landlord onto the tenant.”\nOn appeal, Softex asks us to take judicial notice of the fact that\nit was forced to move equipment and machinery approximately thirty\nmiles, which resulted in various fees and costs. Such matters are\nnot susceptible to judicial notice. American Foreign Ins. Assn. v.\nSeatrain Lines of P.R., Inc., 689 F.2d 295, 297 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fAccordingly, we also reverse the judgment below to the extent it\n\nawards Softex damages on its claim for relocation expenses.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand with\n\ninstructions to enter judgment for Equitable on the issue of\n\nliability and dismissal of the counterclaims asserted by Softex.\n\nThe case is remanded to determine the amount of Equitable’s damages\n\nin further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

At oral argument, counsel for Equitable\nrepresented that as a result, Equitable is liable to the\nCommonwealth for the full (i.e., unabated) amount of property taxes\nduring Softex’s tenancy, although it appears that those taxes have\n\n                                           -2-\n\fproperty leased to Softex, unsuccessfully sought a tax exemption\n\nfor the property in 1998; its application was denied with prejudice\n\nbecause Industrial had outstanding debts to the government.\n\n             In    June    1999,    Industrial     transferred      title     to   the\n\nproperty (and assigned all related leases) to Equitable, a New York\n\ncorporation, as payment on an outstanding debt.                     At that time,\n\nSoftex   ceased      contributing      towards     the    taxes    on   the    leased\n\nproperty.     When Softex’s lease expired at the end of 2000, the\n\nparties became embroiled in a dispute over the amounts due from\n\nSoftex as a holdover tenant.                Equitable initiated an eviction\n\naction against Softex in Puerto Rico superior court in March 2001,\n\nand   soon   thereafter      brought       the   underlying    diversity       action\n\nseeking overdue rent, taxes, insurance premiums, and operating\n\nexpenses.         Within   weeks,    the    parties      settled   most   of    their\n\ndifferences by a stipulation in the eviction action.                    The dispute\n\nover property taxes remained, however, and the federal action went\n\nforward on this basis.\n\n\n\n\nnot yet been paid because of administrative delays. It likewise\nappears that Softex paid some or all of its portion of the property\ntax assessments during the period that Industrial owned the\nproperty, without reduction on the basis of any purported\nexemption.\n     By contrast, Softex contends that the exemption entitled it to\nreimbursement for ninety percent of its taxes, regardless whether\nthe taxes assessed on the property occupied by Softex were actually\nreduced by the Commonwealth. Because our conclusion turns on the\nlanguage of the lease, we need not involve ourselves in this\ndispute.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            In    May     2001,    Softex      filed    counterclaims     against\n\nEquitable, seeking relocation costs, reimbursement for property\n\ntaxes    previously       paid,   and   $50,000    in     unspecified    damages.\n\nEquitable moved to dismiss the counterclaims for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief may be granted.                   See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).        Softex    opposed,     and,    after   a   somewhat    irregular\n\nprogression of filings, the district court was presented with what\n\namounted    to     cross-motions        for     summary      judgment    on   the\n\ncounterclaims.2      Equitable also moved for summary judgment on its\n\nown claims, alleging that the lease unambiguously required Softex\n\nto pay its full share of property taxes.\n\n            In a September 16, 2002 order, the district court denied\n\nEquitable’s motion for summary judgment on its claims against\n\nSoftex, concluding that the lease agreement was ambiguous as to who\n\nwas responsible for the property taxes at issue.                 Turning to the\n\nlegislative intent behind the tax exemption laws for guidance in\n\ninterpreting the contract, the court found that Softex was entitled\n\nto a tax exemption, although the OITE had not in fact granted such\n\n\n\n     2\n      Softex responded to the motion to dismiss in a filing titled\n“Opposition to Motion to Dismiss And/Or Motion for Summary Judgment\nPursuant to Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” It asked\nthe district court to consider an affidavit of a Softex officer who\nnegotiated the lease. Softex did not, however, attach a statement\nof uncontested material facts as required by Local Rule 311.12.\nEquitable responded with a request that its motion to dismiss be\ntreated as a cross-motion for summary judgment.           Equitable\nsubmitted a statement of uncontested material facts in compliance\nwith the local rules.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fan exemption to Industrial or Equitable as owners of the property.\n\n             The district court granted Equitable’s motion to dismiss\n\nthe counterclaims in part, concluding that Softex failed to state\n\nany factual predicate for its claim of $50,000 in unspecified\n\ndamages.3      The district court did not expressly award Softex\n\nrelocation costs and reimbursement for prior property taxes paid,\n\nbut appeared to do so implicitly by granting Softex’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment without explanation.      Equitable appealed.\n\n                             II.

Equitable further\n\nargues that Softex is not entitled to the damages sought in the\n\ncounterclaims.   We find Equitable’s arguments persuasive.\n\nA.        Property Tax Liability\n\n          Equitable contends that the lease unambiguously assigned\n\nresponsibility for taxes on the subject property to Softex.\n\nSection 4 of the lease agreement addressed the issue of taxes:\n\n          (a) In addition to the minimum rental to be\n          paid by LESSEE . . . LESSEE agrees to pay to\n          LESSOR in the manner and at the times\n          hereinafter provided an amount equal to\n          26.716%4 of all real estate taxes and\n          assessments levied or imposed upon any and all\n          of the parcel of land before described and on\n          the    building    erected   thereupon,    and\n          improvements thereto, except that the LESSEE\n          shall be under no obligation to pay any\n          income, corporation, inheritance, devolution,\n          gift or estate tax or any other tax which may\n          be charged or assessed against the LESSOR, or\n          any tax upon the sale, transfer, assignment of\n          the title or estate of the LESSOR which at any\n          time may be assessed against or become a lien\n          upon the DEMISED PREMISES, this leasehold or\n          the rent accruing therefrom. The LESSOR may\n          have received or may receive in the future,\n          tax exemptions on portion of the land and\n          building for which the LESSEE may not be\n\n\n     4\n      The figure 26.716% is derived from the percentage of the\nindustrial park property that Softex occupied. During its tenancy,\nSoftex leased additional space, bringing its share of the property\nto 43.076%.\n\n                               -6-\n\f           entitled, in which case the LESSEE will be\n           responsible for aforementioned percentage of\n           real estate taxes and assessments based on the\n           full assessed value without regard to any tax\n           credits or exemptions.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n           The first part of § 4(a) states that Softex, as lessee,\n\nis   responsible   for   its   share   of   real   estate   taxes.   This\n\nresponsibility is underscored in the next sentence, which states\n\nthat the lessee must pay its percentage of the full assessed value\n\nof the property, “without regard to any tax credits or exemptions”\n\nthat the lessor obtains or may obtain in the future.\n\n           The district court noted that, in this case, it was the\n\nlessee, not the lessor, who held an exemption, and concluded that\n\n4(a) “does not speak to [this] inverse situation.” Finding this an\n\nambiguity not addressed by the lease, the district court looked to\n\nthe tax exemption laws for guidance.        The district court concluded\n\nthat Softex should have had the benefit of a reduction in property\n\ntaxes, and therefore denied Equitable’s claim for past due property\n\ntaxes and granted Softex’s claim for reimbursement by Equitable.\n\n           We take a different view of the lease, which required\n\nSoftex to pay its share of “all real estate taxes and assessments\n\nlevied or imposed” on the property owned by Equitable.               This\n\nunqualified language governs, because nothing in the lease suggests\n\nthat the parties intended to cap Softex's tax obligation at the\n\ntax-exempt rate.    If Softex wanted its tax obligation to be pegged\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fto whether it received a discounted tax rate, it should have\n\nnegotiated such a condition in the lease.

If the words should appear\n\ncontrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the\n\nintention    shall    prevail.”);    Executive    Leasing    Corp.   v.

See Executive\n\nLeasing, 48 F.3d at 69.            Even if we assume arguendo that the\n\nabsence of    an     integration    clause    allows   us   to   consider    such\n\nevidence, the outcome would be no different.                Having failed to\n\ncontest Equitable’s version of the facts or to present a statement\n\nof uncontested material facts in support of its own theory of the\n\ncase, Softex is bound by the facts as presented by Equitable, which\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdo not include the parol evidence on which Softex hopes to rely.5\n\n          We conclude that, by virtue of the clear and unambiguous\n\nlease terms, Softex bore liability for the specified percentages of\n\nthe property taxes ultimately imposed on the subject property, as\n\nwell as the risk that the amounts assessed by the Commonwealth\n\nwould not be reduced on the basis of a tax exemption.       We therefore\n\nreverse the district court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\nSoftex and remand with instructions that judgment be entered in\n\nfavor of Equitable on this issue.\n\nB.        Relocation Expenses\n\n          Equitable argues that the district court erroneously, and\n\nperhaps   inadvertently,   awarded    Softex   relocation    costs   and\n\nreimbursement for prior property taxes paid.      Although the record\n\nis somewhat ambiguous, it appears that after the district court\n\ndismissed Softex’s claim for $50,000 in unspecified damages on\n\nEquitable’s motion, it granted summary judgment in favor of Softex\n\n\n\n     5\n      Softex also contends that the language of the lease itself\ndemonstrates that the parties intended that Softex would have the\nbenefit of its tax exemption. As support, Softex points to the\nportion of § 4(a) that states that Softex “shall be under no\nobligation to pay any income, corporation, inheritance, devolution,\ngift or estate tax or any other tax which may be charged or\nassessed against the LESSOR” (emphasis added). Softex would have\nus conclude that this general “or any other tax” language prevails,\nrendering meaningless the preceding clause specifically assigning\nto Softex an obligation to pay a portion of the taxes on the\nproperty. Because we consider the terms of the lease together,\nrejecting interpretations that would render portions of the\ncontract meaningless, see 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3475, we find this\nargument meritless.\n\n                                -9-\n\fon the remainder of Softex’s counterclaim (i.e., relocation costs\n\nand prior property taxes paid by Softex).6   The district court did\n\nnot make any factual findings regarding the relocation costs, nor\n\ndid it draw any legal conclusions that could form a basis for\n\nimposing liability on Equitable.\n\n          Equitable argues that any costs sought by Softex would\n\nhave been incurred in vacating the property at the conclusion of\n\nthe lease, and that Softex has neither alleged nor proven any\n\nwrongdoing on Equitable’s part that would give rise to liability\n\nfor such costs.   Faced with the uncontested facts as presented by\n\nEquitable, and the dearth of documentation regarding the amount and\n\nnature of the damages sought by Softex,7 we agree with Equitable.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      We reverse the district court’s award of property taxes to\nSoftex for the reasons discussed in Section II.A., above, and\ntherefore limit our discussion of Softex’s counterclaims to the\nissue of relocation expenses.\n     7\n      Even if we did not adopt Equitable’s version of the facts,\nSoftex’s opposition to Equitable’s motion to dismiss (a putative\nmotion for summary judgment on its counterclaims) presented no\nevidence documenting its purported $33,620.61 in relocation costs.\nIts sole supporting affidavit, a statement by an officer of the\ncompany, merely stated that Softex incurred “relocation expenses .\n. . due to the bad faith perpetrated by landlord onto the tenant.”\nOn appeal, Softex asks us to take judicial notice of the fact that\nit was forced to move equipment and machinery approximately thirty\nmiles, which resulted in various fees and costs. Such matters are\nnot susceptible to judicial notice. American Foreign Ins.
