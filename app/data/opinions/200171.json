Fletcher,   of   the   Ninth   Circuit,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            STAHL,   Senior   Circuit    Judge.    Petitioner-appellant\n\nFrederic W. Berthoff appeals from the district court's order\n\ndenying his petition for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.     Berthoff was convicted of drug conspiracy and related\n\ncharges following a jury trial.          His sentence was seven times\n\ngreater than that of the next most culpable co-conspirator, who\n\ncooperated with the government and pled guilty. The district court\n\ngranted a certificate of appealability (COA) sua sponte, asking\n\nthis Court to consider whether the disparity in sentencing violated\n\nBerthoff's right to a jury trial.        Later, it added to the COA the\n\nissue of whether Berthoff's conviction violated Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).     We hold that the court below was in\n\nerror when it issued the COA, and affirm the denial of the habeas\n\npetition.\n\n                              I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.   The Criminal Proceedings\n\n            Berthoff, the kingpin of a drug ring, was indicted on\n\nseventeen felony charges along with five associates.1       Following a\n\njury trial with co-defendants William Tibolt and Scott Holland,\n\nBerthoff was convicted of conspiring to possess marijuana and\n\nhashish with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846 (Count\n\nOne); possessing hashish with intent to distribute, id. § 841\n\n\n      1\n      The factual details of the criminal conspiracy are set forth\nin Berthoff v. United States, 140 F. Supp.2d 50, 52-53 (D. Mass.\n2001).\n\n                                   -3-\n\f(Count Two); tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1) (Count Three); money\n\nlaundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a) (Counts Seven through Fourteen);\n\nand witness tampering, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3) (Count Sixteen).\n\nThe United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nsentenced Berthoff to twenty-one years' imprisonment on Counts One\n\nand Two; three years' imprisonment on Count Three; twenty years'\n\nimprisonment on Counts Seven through Fourteen; and ten years'\n\nimprisonment on Count Sixteen, with the sentences on all counts to\n\nrun concurrently.\n\n          Thomas Cimeno, whom the district court characterized as\n\n\"the individual next to Berthoff most culpable in this conspiracy,\"\n\npleaded guilty prior to trial and cooperated with the government.\n\nBerthoff v. United States, 140 F. Supp.2d 50, 53 (D. Mass. 2001).\n\nHe received a sentence of three years' imprisonment. Albert Mello,\n\nanother \"important figure\" in the conspiracy, who also pleaded\n\nguilty and cooperated, received the same sentence.     Id. at 53.   Wes\n\nSchifone, a lesser figure who also pleaded guilty and cooperated,\n\nwas sentenced to five years' probation, the first nine months to be\n\nspent in house arrest.   Of the two co-defendants who went to trial,\n\nTibolt received an eight-year sentence, and Holland received five\n\nyears.\n\n          In   an   unpublished    decision,   this   Court   affirmed\n\nBerthoff's conviction.    United States v. Berthoff, No. 94-1719,\n\n1995 WL 703506 (1st Cir. Nov. 29, 1995).\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fB.   The Habeas Petition\n\n           In April, 1997, Berthoff timely filed a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus on the ground that he was denied effective assistance\n\nof counsel.     He contended that his counsel was required to inform\n\nhim about plea overtures that had been made by the government and\n\nabout the effect on his sentence of the likely acceptance of\n\nresponsibility credit, U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. The district court denied\n\nthe petition, and Berthoff appealed the denial.\n\n           On December 9, 1998, the district court granted a COA\n\nthat seemingly concerned the constitutionality of the disparity in\n\nsentencing between those defendants who plead guilty and those who\n\nstand   trial.       The    parties,      however,   proceeded      with   the\n\nunderstanding that the issue on appeal was Berthoff's ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim.\n\n           On    December   22,   1999,    this   Court   vacated   the    COA.\n\nBerthoff v. United States, No. 99-1276, 1999 WL 1295839 (1st Cir.\n\nDec. 22, 1999).      Acknowledging the confusion about the issue on\n\nappeal, we remanded with instructions to the district court to\n\nclarify the issue warranting a COA and, if the court decided to\n\nreissue the COA on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, to\n\nanswer five questions set forth in our opinion.             Id. at *2.      In\n\nNovember 2000, while the matter was on remand, Berthoff sought to\n\namend his § 2255 petition to add an Apprendi claim, arguing that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe   amount   of   contraband   should   have   been   presented   to   and\n\ndetermined by the jury.\n\n           On April 9, 2001, the district court issued a report in\n\nwhich it answered the Appeals Court's five questions and concluded\n\nthat there was no ineffective assistance of counsel. Berthoff, 140\n\nF. Supp.2d at 54-58.        Accordingly, it denied a COA as to that\n\nclaim.    Id. at 58.2   Next, the court denied Berthoff's motion to\n\namend his § 2255 petition to include an Apprendi claim on the\n\ngrounds that    (1)   the   court   lacked   jurisdiction   to   amend   the\n\npetition after it had rendered judgment thereon; and (2) amendment\n\nwould be futile because the Apprendi claim was time-barred. Id. at\n\n59-60.\n\n           Finally, the district court sua sponte granted a COA\n\nconcerning \"whether the conduct of the prosecutor or this Court in\n\nthis case unduly and unconstitutionally burdened Berthoff's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to trial by jury.\"        Id. at 61.    The court decried\n\nthe widespread practice of fact bargaining, which it defined as\n\n\"the knowing abandonment by the government of a material fact\n\ndeveloped by law enforcement authorities or from a witness expected\n\nto testify in order to induce a guilty plea.\"            Id. at 62 n.19.\n\nAlthough it acknowledged that there was no evidence that fact\n\nbargaining played any role in Berthoff's sentencing, the court\n\n\n      2\n      On September 25, 2001, this Court affirmed that denial in an\nunpublished per curiam opinion. Ineffective assistance of counsel\nis not an issue in the present appeal.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fnonetheless suggested that a COA was appropriate on general policy-\n\nbased grounds, maintaining that \"'substantial assistance' and fact\n\nbargaining together constitute the single greatest cause of the\n\ndisparity in sentencing that so burdens the free exercise of the\n\nSixth Amendment.\"    Id. at 67 n.30.    Citing the 700% difference\n\nbetween Cimeno's and Berthoff's sentences, inter alia, the district\n\ncourt concluded that Berthoff \"has made 'a substantial showing of\n\na denial of his constitutional right' to trial by jury such that\n\nissuance of a [COA] is appropriate.\"    Id. at 70 (quoting 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(c)(2)).\n\n           In December, 2001, Berthoff moved to amend the COA to\n\ninclude the issue of Apprendi's retroactive application to this\n\ncase.   The district court allowed the motion.\n\n                           II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Berthoff's Sixth Amendment Claim\n\n           28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1) provides, in relevant part, that\n\nan appeal may not be taken from a district court's final order in\n\na § 2255 proceeding without the issuance of a COA.   A COA may issue\n\nonly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial\n\nof a constitutional right.      Id. at § 2253(c)(2).      \"A habeas\n\npetitioner who fails to demonstrate that his claims satisfy the\n\nsubstantial showing standard may not appeal the denial of habeas\n\ncorpus at all.\"   Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 236 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nFurthermore, \"the necessity for a substantial showing extends\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\findependently     to     each    and   every   issue   raised    by   a   habeas\n\npetitioner.\"     Id.\n\n          \"Habeas review is an extraordinary remedy and will not be\n\nallowed to do service for an appeal.\"             Reed v. Farley, 512 U.S.\n\n339, 354 (1994) (internal citation omitted).              The principles of\n\nfinality, federalism, and comity inform the scope of habeas review.\n\nSanna v. Dipaolo, 265 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Brecht v.\n\nAbrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 633-35 (1993); Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.\n\n288, 308-10 (1989)).       Accordingly, a defendant's failure to raise\n\na claim in a timely manner at trial or on appeal constitutes a\n\nprocedural     default    that    bars    collateral   review,    unless    the\n\ndefendant can demonstrate cause for the failure and prejudice or\n\nactual innocence.        Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622\n\n(1998).\n\n             In this case, the COA was inappropriately issued because\n\nBerthoff procedurally defaulted his Sixth Amendment claim and\n\nfailed to make a substantial showing that his right to a jury trial\n\nwas denied.       He did not raise that issue at any stage of the\n\nproceedings below: neither at trial, nor on direct appeal from his\n\nconvictions, nor in his § 2255 petition.3              Rather, the district\n\n\n     3\n      Nor does Berthoff make a developed argument as to cause and\nprejudice or actual innocence on appeal, other than to contend that\nthe sentencing issue was too \"novel\" to be subject to the\nprocedural default doctrine.    See Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 15\n(1984). In light of this circuit's case law addressing closely\nrelated issues, notably United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135\n(1st Cir. 1998), we find this argument unpersuasive.       Finally,\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcourt issued a COA on the Sixth Amendment issue sua sponte, in the\n\nabsence of briefing or a hearing.\n\n           Moreover, the district court's discussion focused on the\n\nconstitutional    infirmities   involved      in    fact     bargaining   and\n\ninappropriately mechanistic downward departures for substantial\n\nassistance.   Berthoff, 140 F. Supp.2d at 61-67.              Yet the court\n\nconcedes   that   these   problems    are   not    present    in   Berthoff's\n\nsituation: there was no evidence of fact bargaining below, id. at\n\n67 n.30, and Berthoff and his co-defendants were thoughtfully\n\nsentenced within the Guidelines, id. at 53, 57.         We need do nothing\n\nmore than refer to the district court's own words to emphasize that\n\nthe constitutional complaints it postulates have little to do with\n\nthe facts of the present case:\n\n           [I]n an appropriate case, where the government\n           has engaged in illegal fact bargaining with\n           one defendant, I would not hesitate to hold\n           that a defendant similarly situated in all\n           material respects could take advantage of the\n           fact bargain in order freely to exercise the\n           right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth\n           Amendment.\n\n           This is not such a case. After the most\n           thorough reflection, while I fully admit that\n           were I free to do so I would reduce Berthoff's\n           sentence, I can see no principled way to reach\n           such a result and at the same time remain\n           faithful to the judicial decisions that\n\n\nBerthoff contended in his reply brief that he sufficiently\npresented the sentencing disparity issue below when he asserted\nineffective assistance of counsel, but effectively repudiated this\ncontention at oral argument, conceding that the issues were only\ntangentially related.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             properly control analysis here. The best I can\n             do is grant this certificate of appealability.\n             I respectfully urge the Court of Appeals to\n             address these intractable issues with the aid\n             of the broadest array of amici curiae . . .\n\nId. at 71 (emphasis added).        Under these circumstances, to decide\n\nwhether fact bargaining violated the Sixth Amendment not only would\n\ncontravene the procedural default doctrine but would amount to\n\nissuing an unlawful advisory opinion.                Cf. United States      v.\n\nSabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 96 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991) (Sixth Amendment\n\nrights   \"are     personal    in    nature     and    cannot     be   asserted\n\nvicariously\").4\n\n             In sum, this case simply is an inappropriate vehicle for\n\nthe district court's concerns.          We acknowledge that the district\n\ncourt raises serious and troubling issues regarding sentencing\n\ndisparity that merit careful consideration in an\n\nappropriate case; as the trial court concedes, however, this is not\n\nthat case.       Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of the\n\nconstitutional issue at this time.\n\nB.   Berthoff's Apprendi Claim\n\n          Berthoff contends that his sentence violates Apprendi\n\nbecause the jury did not make findings as to the triggering\n\nquantities     that   would   support    the   21-year    drug    trafficking\n\n\n\n     4\n      Berthoff contends that the 700% sentencing disparity alone --\nabsent fact bargaining or improper downward departures -- violates\nhis Sixth Amendment rights. As set forth supra, this argument is\nbarred by the procedural default doctrine.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fsentence.    Under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), the jury would have had\n\nto find that he was responsible for at least one hundred kilograms\n\nof   a   mixture   or   substance   containing   a   detectable   amount   of\n\nmarijuana.\n\n            The district court declined to allow Berthoff to amend\n\nhis habeas petition to include the Apprendi claim, although it\n\nlater included it in the COA.           We generally review a decision\n\ngranting or denying a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp., 298 F.3d 102, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Berthoff does not argue that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in denying his motion to amend.            In any event, we\n\nwill not consider the Apprendi claim because the district court\n\ncorrectly held that it lacked the authority to allow the amendment\n\nafter it had entered judgment on Berthoff's § 2255 petition.               \"A\n\nhabeas petitioner may not add new constitutional claims to a\n\npetition after the district court has entered judgment.\"            Ward v.\n\nWhitley, 21 F.3d 1355, 1360 (5th Cir. 1994).         Berthoff did not seek\n\nrelief from the district court's judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 60(b) or any other rule.         See Acevedo-Villalobos v. Hernandez,\n\n22 F.3d 384, 389 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Unless post-judgment relief is\n\ngranted [under Rule 59 or 60], the district court lacks power to\n\ngrant a motion to amend the complaint under Rule 15(a).\").\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f",

The Habeas Petition\n\n           In April, 1997, Berthoff timely filed a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus on the ground that he was denied effective assistance\n\nof counsel.     He contended that his counsel was required to inform\n\nhim about plea overtures that had been made by the government and\n\nabout the effect on his sentence of the likely acceptance of\n\nresponsibility credit, U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. The district court denied\n\nthe petition, and Berthoff appealed the denial.\n\n           On December 9, 1998, the district court granted a COA\n\nthat seemingly concerned the constitutionality of the disparity in\n\nsentencing between those defendants who plead guilty and those who\n\nstand   trial.       The    parties,      however,   proceeded      with   the\n\nunderstanding that the issue on appeal was Berthoff's ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim.\n\n           On    December   22,   1999,    this   Court   vacated   the    COA.\n\nBerthoff v.

Acknowledging the confusion about the issue on\n\nappeal, we remanded with instructions to the district court to\n\nclarify the issue warranting a COA and, if the court decided to\n\nreissue the COA on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, to\n\nanswer five questions set forth in our opinion.             Id. at *2.      In\n\nNovember 2000, while the matter was on remand, Berthoff sought to\n\namend his § 2255 petition to add an Apprendi claim, arguing that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe   amount   of   contraband   should   have   been   presented   to   and\n\ndetermined by the jury.\n\n           On April 9, 2001, the district court issued a report in\n\nwhich it answered the Appeals Court's five questions and concluded\n\nthat there was no ineffective assistance of counsel. Berthoff, 140\n\nF. Supp.2d at 54-58.        Accordingly, it denied a COA as to that\n\nclaim.    Id. at 58.2   Next, the court denied Berthoff's motion to\n\namend his § 2255 petition to include an Apprendi claim on the\n\ngrounds that    (1)   the   court   lacked   jurisdiction   to   amend   the\n\npetition after it had rendered judgment thereon; and (2) amendment\n\nwould be futile because the Apprendi claim was time-barred. Id. at\n\n59-60.\n\n           Finally, the district court sua sponte granted a COA\n\nconcerning \"whether the conduct of the prosecutor or this Court in\n\nthis case unduly and unconstitutionally burdened Berthoff's Sixth\n\nAmendment right to trial by jury.\"        Id. at 61.    The court decried\n\nthe widespread practice of fact bargaining, which it defined as\n\n\"the knowing abandonment by the government of a material fact\n\ndeveloped by law enforcement authorities or from a witness expected\n\nto testify in order to induce a guilty plea.\"            Id. at 62 n.19.\n\nAlthough it acknowledged that there was no evidence that fact\n\nbargaining played any role in Berthoff's sentencing, the court\n\n\n      2\n      On September 25, 2001, this Court affirmed that denial in an\nunpublished per curiam opinion. Ineffective assistance of counsel\nis not an issue in the present appeal.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fnonetheless suggested that a COA was appropriate on general policy-\n\nbased grounds, maintaining that \"'substantial assistance' and fact\n\nbargaining together constitute the single greatest cause of the\n\ndisparity in sentencing that so burdens the free exercise of the\n\nSixth Amendment.\"    Id. at 67 n.30.    Citing the 700% difference\n\nbetween Cimeno's and Berthoff's sentences, inter alia, the district\n\ncourt concluded that Berthoff \"has made 'a substantial showing of\n\na denial of his constitutional right' to trial by jury such that\n\nissuance of a [COA] is appropriate.\"    Id. at 70 (quoting 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(c)(2)).\n\n           In December, 2001, Berthoff moved to amend the COA to\n\ninclude the issue of Apprendi's retroactive application to this\n\ncase.   The district court allowed the motion.\n\n                           II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Berthoff's Sixth Amendment Claim\n\n           28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1) provides, in relevant part, that\n\nan appeal may not be taken from a district court's final order in\n\na § 2255 proceeding without the issuance of a COA.   A COA may issue\n\nonly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial\n\nof a constitutional right.

Accordingly, a defendant's failure to raise\n\na claim in a timely manner at trial or on appeal constitutes a\n\nprocedural     default    that    bars    collateral   review,    unless    the\n\ndefendant can demonstrate cause for the failure and prejudice or\n\nactual innocence.

He did not raise that issue at any stage of the\n\nproceedings below: neither at trial, nor on direct appeal from his\n\nconvictions, nor in his § 2255 petition.3              Rather, the district\n\n\n     3\n      Nor does Berthoff make a developed argument as to cause and\nprejudice or actual innocence on appeal, other than to contend that\nthe sentencing issue was too \"novel\" to be subject to the\nprocedural default doctrine.

Finally,\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcourt issued a COA on the Sixth Amendment issue sua sponte, in the\n\nabsence of briefing or a hearing.\n\n           Moreover, the district court's discussion focused on the\n\nconstitutional    infirmities   involved      in    fact     bargaining   and\n\ninappropriately mechanistic downward departures for substantial\n\nassistance.   Berthoff, 140 F. Supp.2d at 61-67.              Yet the court\n\nconcedes   that   these   problems    are   not    present    in   Berthoff's\n\nsituation: there was no evidence of fact bargaining below, id. at\n\n67 n.30, and Berthoff and his co-defendants were thoughtfully\n\nsentenced within the Guidelines, id. at 53, 57.         We need do nothing\n\nmore than refer to the district court's own words to emphasize that\n\nthe constitutional complaints it postulates have little to do with\n\nthe facts of the present case:\n\n           [I]n an appropriate case, where the government\n           has engaged in illegal fact bargaining with\n           one defendant, I would not hesitate to hold\n           that a defendant similarly situated in all\n           material respects could take advantage of the\n           fact bargain in order freely to exercise the\n           right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth\n           Amendment.\n\n           This is not such a case. After the most\n           thorough reflection, while I fully admit that\n           were I free to do so I would reduce Berthoff's\n           sentence, I can see no principled way to reach\n           such a result and at the same time remain\n           faithful to the judicial decisions that\n\n\nBerthoff contended in his reply brief that he sufficiently\npresented the sentencing disparity issue below when he asserted\nineffective assistance of counsel, but effectively repudiated this\ncontention at oral argument, conceding that the issues were only\ntangentially related.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             properly control analysis here. The best I can\n             do is grant this certificate of appealability.\n             I respectfully urge the Court of Appeals to\n             address these intractable issues with the aid\n             of the broadest array of amici curiae . . .\n\nId. at 71 (emphasis added).        Under these circumstances, to decide\n\nwhether fact bargaining violated the Sixth Amendment not only would\n\ncontravene the procedural default doctrine but would amount to\n\nissuing an unlawful advisory opinion.

We acknowledge that the district\n\ncourt raises serious and troubling issues regarding sentencing\n\ndisparity that merit careful consideration in an\n\nappropriate case; as the trial court concedes, however, this is not\n\nthat case.       Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of the\n\nconstitutional issue at this time.\n\nB.   Berthoff's Apprendi Claim\n\n          Berthoff contends that his sentence violates Apprendi\n\nbecause the jury did not make findings as to the triggering\n\nquantities     that   would   support    the   21-year    drug    trafficking\n\n\n\n     4\n      Berthoff contends that the 700% sentencing disparity alone --\nabsent fact bargaining or improper downward departures -- violates\nhis Sixth Amendment rights.

We generally review a decision\n\ngranting or denying a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Watson v.

In any event, we\n\nwill not consider the Apprendi claim because the district court\n\ncorrectly held that it lacked the authority to allow the amendment\n\nafter it had entered judgment on Berthoff's § 2255 petition.               \"A\n\nhabeas petitioner may not add new constitutional claims to a\n\npetition after the district court has entered judgment.\"            Ward v.\n\nWhitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6365\"><a href=\"/opinion/6365/ward-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1360 (5th Cir. 1994).
