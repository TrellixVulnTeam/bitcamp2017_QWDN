D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Adam A. Rowe, with whom Leo J. Dunn, III and Crowe & Dunn\nwere on brief, for appellant.\n     James B. Haddow, with whom Bradford A. Pattershall and\nPetruccelli, Martin & Haddow, LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 20, 2005\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.    In November 2004, Danielle Harlow\n\nof   Turner,   Maine,     sued   Children's   Hospital   of     Boston,\n\nMassachusetts, in the Maine Superior Court for medical malpractice\n\nduring a procedure performed at the Hospital on May 10, 1993.\n\nDanielle was six years old at the time of the procedure.            The\n\nissues addressed here would never have arisen had she filed suit in\n\nMassachusetts courts, which had jurisdiction over the Hospital,\n\nbefore the expiration of the Massachusetts three-year statute of\n\nlimitations.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 60D.   She did not file\n\nsuch a suit.\n\n          Rather, Harlow instituted proceedings in Maine after the\n\nMassachusetts statute had expired. Maine allows minors to commence\n\nan action \"within 6 years after the cause of action accrues or\n\nwithin 3 years after the minor reaches the age of majority,\n\nwhichever first occurs.\"    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 2902.    The\n\nNovember 2004 suit was timely filed under Maine law because Harlow\n\nhad filed a Notice of Claim before the six years had expired,\n\nthereby tolling the statute of limitations.     See id. § 2859.     The\n\nquestion is whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction over the\n\nHospital in Maine would comport with Maine's long-arm statute and\n\nthe Due Process Clause.\n\n          The Hospital removed the Maine case to federal court,\n\ninvoking diversity jurisdiction.        The Hospital then moved to\n\ndismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.           The court\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fgranted that motion, and Harlow appeals.                   We affirm.            In doing so,\n\nwe clarify the time frame of the evidence to which a court may look\n\nin   deciding       whether    a   defendant's         contacts    with      a     state   are\n\nsufficient to justify personal jurisdiction, both specific and\n\ngeneral.\n\n                                              I.\n\n               In   1993,     Danielle    Harlow       underwent       a    radiofrequency\n\ncardiac      ablation     procedure      at     the    Hospital    in       Boston.        The\n\nprocedure       was     performed    to       treat     Harlow's       supraventricular\n\ntachyarrhythmia, a condition secondary to Harlow's Wolff-Parkinson-\n\nWhite       syndrome.       Allegedly      as      a   result     of       the    Hospital's\n\nnegligence, Harlow suffered a stroke during the procedure.                            Harlow\n\nalleges that the stroke caused brain damage, with the result that\n\nshe suffers serious permanent injury in the form of severe left\n\nhemiparesis,1 as well as cognitive and behavioral impairments,\n\nincluding \"cognitive deficits, personality changes, attention and\n\nconcentration deficits, impulsivity, and an inability to modulate\n\nher behavior.\"\n\n               In May 1999, Harlow filed a notice of medical malpractice\n\nclaim against the Hospital and four affiliated doctors, initiating\n\n\n        1\n       Hemiparesis is \"muscular weakness or partial paralysis\nrestricted to one side of the body,\" according to Webster's Third\nNew International Dictionary 1054 (1993). Harlow says that she\nsuffers from a deformity in her left hand and from impaired gait\nand balance. In particular, according to a doctor who evaluated\nHarlow, Harlow has a \"claw hand\" on the left side and her left foot\nturns inward as she walks.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fmandatory prelitigation screening panel proceedings, as required by\n\nMaine law.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §§ 2853, 2903.                 The\n\ndefendants asserted lack of personal jurisdiction over them in\n\nMaine; the panel chair, acting on a joint motion of the parties,\n\nreferred the issue of jurisdiction to the Maine Superior Court\n\npursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 2853(5).                 In February\n\n2001, after briefing, the Superior Court granted the defendant\n\ndoctors' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, but\n\ndenied the Hospital's motion, ruling that there was personal\n\njurisdiction over the Hospital (the court did not specify whether\n\nit was relying on general or specific jurisdiction, and it cited\n\nfactors pertinent to both).\n\n            In October 2004, the screening panel unanimously decided\n\nthat the Hospital's treatment of Harlow had deviated from the\n\napplicable standard of care and had caused her injury. In November\n\n2004, Harlow filed her medical malpractice complaint in Maine\n\nSuperior Court. The Hospital removed the case to federal court and\n\nmoved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(2).      Harlow filed an objection on the merits and\n\nunder the law of the case doctrine, and the Hospital filed a reply.\n\n            In March 2005, the district court granted the Hospital's\n\nmotion to dismiss.     The court observed that to the extent the \"law\n\nof   the   case\"   doctrine   applied    at   all,   it   is   \"a    matter    of\n\ndiscretion,\" and that it was preferable to resolve the issue.                 The\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcourt,    sitting   in   diversity,    held     that   it   lacked   personal\n\njurisdiction, both specific and general, over the Hospital.\n\n            On appeal, Harlow argues that the district court erred in\n\ntwo ways: first, the law of the case doctrine precluded the\n\nHospital from relitigating the issue of personal jurisdiction, and\n\nsecond, on the merits, Harlow had established personal jurisdiction\n\nover the Hospital.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.          Law of the Case\n\n            \"[L]aw of the case is an amorphous concept.              As most\n\ncommonly defined, the doctrine posits that when a court decides\n\nupon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the\n\nsame issues in subsequent stages in the same case.            Law of the case\n\ndirects a court's discretion, it does not limit the tribunal's\n\npower.\"   Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983) (citation\n\nand footnote omitted).      \"Under law of the case doctrine, as now\n\nmost commonly understood, it is not improper for a court to depart\n\nfrom a prior holding if convinced that it is clearly erroneous and\n\nwould work a manifest injustice.\"           Id. at 618 n.8.\n\n            Whether the law of the case doctrine applies at all is a\n\nquestion of law, which we review de novo.              See Tang v. Dep't of\n\nElderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1998).                  Strictly\n\nspeaking, the law of the case doctrine -- understood as a bar to\n\nsubsequent review -- was not implicated in this case, because\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f\"[i]nterlocutory orders, including denials of motions to dismiss,\n\nremain open to trial court reconsideration, and do not constitute\n\nthe law of the case.\"       Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).        Thus, the district court was free to reconsider\n\nthe earlier interlocutory order.\n\n            We   have    sometimes   said    --    instead   of   an   outright\n\nstatement that law of the case is not applicable to interlocutory\n\norders at all -- that law of the case permits a lower court to\n\nreview prior interlocutory orders as long as that review is not an\n\nabuse of discretion.        Were the law of the case doctrine even to\n\napply, then, we would review only for abuse of discretion.                   See\n\nGeffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 2001) (reviewing\n\na district court's reconsideration of its own prior ruling on\n\nsummary judgment motion for abuse of discretion); see also In re\n\nCabletron Sys., 311 F.3d 11, 21 n.2 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"The law of\n\nthe case is a discretionary doctrine, especially as applied to\n\ninterlocutory orders such as this one. As Justice Holmes expressed\n\nit, '[T]he phrase, law of the case, as applied to the effect of\n\nprevious orders on the later action of the court rendering them in\n\nthe same case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally to\n\nrefuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their\n\npower.'\"    (citation omitted) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nMessenger   v.   Anderson,     225   U.S.   436,   444   (1912))).      As   one\n\ncommentator has said, the law of the case doctrine involves an\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f\"effusion of applications,\" some of which are more discretionary\n\nthan others.   18B Wright, Miller, & Cooper, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 4478, at 637 (2d ed. 2002).2   Regardless of phrasing,\n\nthe result here is clear.   The district court was not barred from\n\nreconsidering the prior decision; at most we review the decision to\n\nreconsider only for a particularly egregious abuse of discretion.\n\nThere was no abuse of discretion here.\n\n           The district court could have reconsidered this matter\n\neven if the prior decision had been its own, rather than the state\n\ncourt's.   See Perez-Ruiz, 25 F.3d at 42; Cabletron Sys., 311 F.3d\n\nat 21 n.2; Geffon, 249 F.3d at 38.    As the district court noted,\n\nthere had been no final decision in the state court on personal\n\njurisdiction. The state court's \"[d]enial of the Hospital's motion\n\n\n\n     2\n       For more on this \"effusion of applications,\" see Coca-Cola\nBottling Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 988 F.2d 386, 411 n.25 (3d Cir.\n1993) (noting that although standard of review might be plenary on\nquestion of whether district court applied correct law on remand\nfrom court of appeals, review is for abuse of discretion on\nquestion of whether second judge may hear reargument on an issue\nalready ruled upon by first judge); 18B Wright, Miller, & Cooper,\nsupra, § 4478, at 637 (discussing \"the 'mandate rule' that binds a\nlower court on remand to the law of the case established on\nappeal\"); id. § 4478.1, at 694 (\"[R]econsideration often is better\ndeserved, and more important, while an action wends its way toward\nthe first final judgment in the trial court. The balance that must\nbe struck between stability and reaching the right decision is\ndifferent than the balance to be struck when successive appeals are\ntaken in the same case, or when a trial court faces the mandate of\nan appellate court, or when different courts come to take part in\ndeciding a single case. Discretion is built into law-of-the-case\ndoctrine, but the measure of discretion is different in these\ndifferent settings.\").\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fto dismiss was not an appealable order.                In fact, the Hospital\n\ntried to appeal, but the Maine Law Court dismissed the appeal as\n\ninterlocutory . . . .\"         The district court put the point well:\n\n\"Although it is late in the case to re-examine the question, it\n\nwill be later still on appeal, an avenue open to the Hospital\n\nbecause    the   personal    jurisdiction     ruling    has   never    yet   been\n\nappealable.\"\n\n            One might think there could be a federalism objection to\n\na federal court's reconsidering a state court's interlocutory order\n\nentered before removal of the case.           Harlow's absolutist argument\n\nagainst allowing the Hospital to reargue the matter suggests such\n\na consideration. But the argument proves too much: federalism does\n\nnot   require     more     deferential      treatment    of    a     state-court\n\ninterlocutory order in a case removed to federal court than it\n\nwould have required had the order originated in federal court.\n\n            The Hospital, for its part, argues that the \"law of the\n\ncase\" doctrine does not apply at all in this case, because the\n\ndoctrine applies \"only to those situations in which a court is\n\nconsidering a matter that has already been the subject of a ruling\n\nby a coordinate court,\" and \"a state court is not 'coordinate' with\n\na federal court on matters of federal law.\"                    In effect, the\n\nHospital   --    without    citing   any    decisions   of    this   court   (the\n\nHospital cites only district court decisions for this proposition)\n\n-- is arguing for a per se rule that when the prior ruling on an\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fissue of federal law comes from a state court, law-of-the-case\n\nconsiderations in a removed case are never applicable. Since state\n\ncourts are also obligated to apply federal law, the premise of the\n\nargument is fatally flawed.\n\n            In any case, \"it would hardly do to reverse a correct\n\nruling . . . on the simplistic ground that it departed from the\n\n'law of the case' established by an earlier ruling,\" especially\n\nwhere \"the order challenged on appeal is subject to de novo review\n\nin any event.\"       18B Wright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, § 4478.1, at\n\n707-09.\n\nB.          Personal Jurisdiction\n\n            Harlow argues that both specific and general personal\n\njurisdiction exist over the Hospital.\n\n            The district court analyzed Harlow's claim of personal\n\njurisdiction under the prima facie standard of Boit v. Gar-Tec\n\nProducts,    Inc.,    967   F.2d   671    (1st   Cir.   1992).3   Under   that\n\n\n     3\n         In Boit, this court stated:\n\n                 The   most   commonly  used   method  of\n            determining a motion to dismiss for want of\n            personal jurisdiction is for the district\n            court to consider only whether the plaintiff\n            has proffered evidence that, if credited, is\n            enough to support findings of all facts\n            essential to personal jurisdiction. To defeat\n            a motion to dismiss when the court uses this\n            method the plaintiff must make the showing as\n            to every fact required to satisfy \"both the\n            forum's long-arm statute and the due process\n            clause of the Constitution.\"    This standard\n            for deciding a motion to dismiss is commonly\n\n                                         -9-\n\fstandard, the \"properly supported proffers of evidence\" by the\n\nplaintiff are taken as true, without the need for an evidentiary\n\nhearing.   Id. at 675; see also Jet Wine & Spirits, Inc. v. Bacardi\n\n& Co., 298 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002) (where district court applied\n\nprima facie standard as described in Boit, facts for purpose of\n\nappeal from dismissal are \"[plaintiff's] allegations so far as\n\nevidence supports them after preliminary jurisdictional discovery,\n\nsupplemented by [defendant's] uncontested allegations\").\n\n           This court reviews de novo a \"district court's decision\n\nto dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction when the court held no\n\nevidentiary hearing but instead conducted only a prima facie review\n\nof the jurisdictional facts.\"   Jet Wine & Spirits, 298 F.3d at 6-7\n\n(citing Boit, 967 F.2d at 675).\n\n           An exercise of jurisdiction must be authorized by state\n\nstatute and must comply with the Constitution.       See Noonan v.\n\nWinston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 89 (1st Cir. 1998).    The Maine long arm\n\nstatute extends \"to the fullest extent permitted by the due process\n\nclause of the United States Constitution.\"      Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n\n\n           referred to as the \"prima facie\" standard or a\n           standard requiring a \"prima facie\" showing.\n           . . .\n                 The prima facie showing of personal\n           jurisdiction must be based on evidence of\n           specific facts set forth in the record.\n\nBoit, 967 F.2d at 675 (citations and footnote omitted) (quoting\nU.S.S. Yachts, Inc. v. Ocean Yachts, Inc., 894 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.\n1990)).\n\n                                -10-\n\ftit. 14, § 704-A(1).            This leaves us with the constitutional\n\ninquiry. Two types of personal jurisdiction, general and specific,\n\nare at issue here.          See United Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers of\n\nAm. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp. (Pleasant Street I), 960 F.2d 1080,\n\n1088-89 (1st Cir. 1992) (distinguishing the two types).                       The\n\nplaintiff     need    not    prove   the     existence   of    both   types    of\n\njurisdiction; either one, standing alone, is sufficient. See Mass.\n\nSch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            The due process clause imposes several requirements on\n\nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants.\n\nFirst, the defendant must have sufficient \"minimum contacts\" with\n\nthe state.    For specific jurisdiction, the plaintiff's claim must\n\nbe related to the defendant's contacts.            For general jurisdiction,\n\nin which the cause of action may be unrelated to the defendant's\n\ncontacts,    the     defendant    must     have   continuous   and    systematic\n\ncontacts with the state.         Second, for either type of jurisdiction,\n\nthe defendant's contacts with the state must be purposeful.                   And\n\nthird, the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances.       See Cambridge Literary Props., Ltd. v. W. Goebel\n\nPorzellanfabrik G.m.b.H & Co. Kg., 295 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nNoonan, 135 F.3d at 89; Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1087-89; see\n\nalso Donatelli v. Nat'l Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459, 462-65 (1st\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fCir.   1990)   (examining   historical   development   of   personal\n\njurisdiction jurisprudence).\n\n          1. Minimum Contacts\n\n          \"The minimum contacts standard requires that a court\n\nasserting personal jurisdiction determine that the nonresident\n\ndefendant possesses sufficient contacts with the forum state so\n\nthat subjecting him, her, or it to the forum's jurisdiction does\n\nnot offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial\n\njustice.'\" Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1087 (quoting Int'l Shoe\n\nCo. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).    Plaintiffs cannot\n\ncreate jurisdiction by their unilateral activity:\n\n          The unilateral activity of those who claim\n          some relationship with a nonresident defendant\n          cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with\n          the forum State. The application of that rule\n          will vary with the quality and nature of the\n          defendant's activity, but it is essential in\n          each case that there be some act by which the\n          defendant purposefully avails itself of the\n          privilege of conducting activities within the\n          forum State, thus invoking the benefits and\n          protections of its laws.\n\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958).\n\n          a. Contacts as Alleged by Harlow\n\n          We review the facts in two different categories: first,\n\nthe evidence before and around the alleged tort, and second, the\n\nevidence after and unrelated to the alleged tort.\n\n          i. Evidence From Before and During the Period of the\n             Alleged Tort\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f                 Harlow's   pediatrician      in   Maine    was     the    person   who\n\nrecommended that Harlow be examined at the Hospital; the referral\n\nwas made in the spring of 1993.             After recommending an examination\n\nat the Hospital and before Harlow's first appointment there,\n\nHarlow's pediatrician sent Harlow's medical records from Maine to\n\nthe Hospital.        Harlow had her first appointment at the Hospital on\n\nApril 27, 1993, and she underwent the contested procedure there on\n\nMay 10, 1993.         It appears that the Hospital discharged Harlow on\n\nMay 19 or 20, 1993.            It is unclear whether Harlow visited the\n\nHospital again after being discharged. The district court believed\n\nthat there were some follow-up visits, but Harlow did not so\n\nallege.4\n\n                 At Harlow's April 27, 1993, appointment, her mother\n\nexplained to the doctor that she was concerned about the family's\n\nability to pay for the recommended procedure, and the doctor stated\n\nthat       his    office    would   take    care   of      making    the    necessary\n\narrangements.        Before Harlow underwent the procedure, the Hospital\n\nobtained authorization from the Maine Medical Assistance Program\n\n(\"Maine Medicaid\"), which approved and agreed to pay for the\n\n\n       4\n       Harlow alleged only that the Hospital \"sought and obtained\nauthorization from\" Maine Medicaid for \"follow-up care at the\nHospital.\"   From the part of the record to which she cites, it\nappears that the Hospital obtained authorization for a visit during\nApril or May 1995, but Harlow does not claim (or cite any part of\nthe record to show) that such a visit, or any other visit, in fact\noccurred. There are only two actual visits, then, that Harlow has\nalleged and provided record support for: the first appointment, and\nthe procedure itself.\n\n                                           -13-\n\fprocedure.5     Ultimately, Maine Medicaid paid over $20,000 to the\n\nHospital for Harlow's procedure and immediate follow-up care at the\n\nHospital. It appears that the Hospital, before discharging Harlow,\n\nperformed various tests, including a cerebral CT scan, an MRI, and\n\nan ultrasound study of the carotid artery, and that it administered\n\nphenobarbital treatment (for an unspecified length of time, but at\n\nleast on May 17) for left-sided simple partial seizures.\n\n            If the state of Maine had not paid for the procedure at\n\nthe Hospital, the Harlows would not have been able to afford it,\n\nand they would have sought other treatment.               After Harlow was\n\ndischarged from the Hospital, she received \"most of her follow up\n\ncare\" from Maine health care practitioners.         Harlow was discharged\n\nfrom the Hospital to the Maine Medical Center for an extensive\n\ncourse of rehabilitation.        Since then, she has been in a special\n\neducation     program   and   requires   a   one-on-one   aide   at   school.\n\nAccording to a physician who evaluated Harlow and reviewed her\n\nrecords, Harlow \"needs individual psychological counseling as well\n\nas a group social training program,\" and she will have difficulty\n\n\n\n     5\n       The district court correctly refused to consider Harlow's\ncontention that the Hospital has maintained \"for decades\" an\n\"active relationship\" with Maine Medicaid, that it had a Provider\nID Number before and after May 1993, and that under Maine law it\nwas required to regularly submit documentation to the State of\nMaine in order to keep its active Provider ID number. This was\nbecause Harlow failed to cite any record evidence to support this\ncontention. Harlow did cite record evidence to support, and the\ndistrict court did consider, the Hospital's arranging for Maine\nMedicaid to pay for Harlow's own treatment.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fliving independently, maintaining family and social relationships,\n\nand earning a living.         Harlow alleged that the cost of her future\n\ncare will be over $800,000.\n\n               Harlow alleged a number of communications between the\n\nHospital and various individuals in Maine.                  There is a letter,\n\ndated    April    30,     1993,6   from    a     Hospital   doctor    to   Harlow's\n\npediatrician, which refers to a prior phone call that the writer\n\nmade to the pediatrician, and which thanks the pediatrician for\n\nreferring Harlow to the Hospital.                   The evidence as to post-\n\nprocedure communications is sparse.               After the procedure, Hospital\n\nstaff    had    further    communications         with   Harlow's    pediatrician,\n\nanother pediatrician in Maine, Harlow's mother, and Maine Medicaid.\n\nHarlow states that the Hospital \"sent multiple correspondence to\n\n[these] individuals regarding Danielle,\" and that when a Hospital\n\ndoctor spoke with Harlow's mother on the telephone in January 1997,\n\nhe also sent correspondence, including \"various medical articles.\"\n\n               ii. Evidence From After the Alleged Tort\n\n               Much of Harlow's evidence concerned the second category:\n\nfor periods after and unrelated to the alleged malpractice on May\n\n\n\n     6\n       Harlow alleged only one pre-1993 contact: that since 1988,\nthe Hospital has sent \"relations specialists\" to meet with\npediatricians and family practitioners. The district court did not\nconsider this contention, because Harlow had not indicated \"that\nthese relations specialists ever visited or had any connection with\nMaine (or even New England).\" On appeal, Harlow has still failed\nto specify whether this outreach program ever included Maine\ndoctors in general or her pediatrician in particular.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f10, 1993.    We detail the evidence before we address whether the\n\npost-tort evidence can be considered for either the specific\n\njurisdiction analysis or the general jurisdiction analysis.\n\n            Harlow presented evidence that in 1998 and 1999, roughly\n\n100 inpatients per year were referred to the Hospital from Maine.\n\nIn 1998, the Hospital charged $2.4 million to Maine Medicaid.                 In\n\n1999, the Hospital charged $1.6 million to Maine Medicaid for\n\ninpatient services plus another $500,000 for outpatient services.\n\n            The Hospital was not incorporated in Maine and is not\n\nregistered    to     do   business    there.       Harlow       alleged     that,\n\nnevertheless, the Hospital \"actively markets and promotes its\n\nbusiness and services within Maine's borders.\"                  Her proffered\n\nevidentiary materials are largely undated and, to the extent they\n\nare dated, they post-date her May 1993 procedure.\n\n            In particular, Harlow alleged, the \"Hospital's marketing\n\ndepartment   specifically     targets   physicians      located    in     Maine.\"\n\nHarlow alleged that the Hospital has \"initiated a campaign to mail\n\nevery   single     pediatrician   located    in   the   State    of   Maine    an\n\ninformational packet.\" Harlow alleged no time frame here; her only\n\nrecord citation reveals that eighty-two copies of a \"Pediatric\n\nSpecialist Guide\" were mailed to Maine pediatricians in 2000, and\n\nthe Hospital's representative testified that he was unaware of any\n\nother referral guides being sent.           The Hospital also publishes a\n\nmonthly newsletter on pediatrics that, since 1999, has been mailed\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fto \"pediatricians who practice in Maine.\"                   The Hospital has also\n\nmailed a number of brochures to Maine pediatricians.                            Harlow did\n\nnot allege any specific dates on which brochures were mailed; at\n\nthe Hospital's deposition, the Hospital's representative testified\n\nthat some brochures were mailed on one occasion in the spring of\n\n2000 to eighty-two pediatricians in Maine, and that \"none of these\n\nitems    that   have      been    marked    as     exhibits     go   to    patients      or\n\nconsumers.\"         The   Hospital       has   advertised       in   the    Journal      of\n\nPediatrics.     The exhibit Harlow cited for this allegation does not\n\nindicate when (or, for that matter, whether) the advertisement was\n\npublished.          The   Hospital's       representative        testified         at   the\n\nHospital's July 2000 deposition that \"this advertisement is the\n\nfirst    I've   ever      heard    of\"    in   a   national     magazine,         and   the\n\nadvertisement had only been created \"around two or three weeks\n\nago.\"\n\n              The Hospital has run advertisements in the Boston Globe,\n\nwhich is \"widely circulated in Maine.\"                   Harlow alleged that this\n\nwas     \"in   the    1990's.\"        At     the     Hospital's       deposition,         the\n\nrepresentative       testified      that    he     was   only   aware      of    one    paid\n\nadvertising campaign in the Boston Globe, and it ran for a \"three-\n\nor four-week period\" in 1997.                     Harlow also alleged that the\n\nHospital has run an advertisement in a Maine newspaper \"on at least\n\none occasion\" in October 1996.             She also alleged that the Hospital\n\nhas advertised on Maine television and radio stations.                           She gives\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fno   dates,    and   the   exhibit   she   cites   is   a   webpage   that   was\n\napparently last updated in August 2002 and printed in February\n\n2005; the webpage describes then-current and planned broadcast\n\npromotions.      Harlow also pointed to other parts of the Hospital's\n\nwebsite that \"provide information for Maine physicians to refer\n\npatients to Children's Hospital, as well as driving directions from\n\nMaine to Massachusetts.\"\n\n              b. Specific Jurisdiction\n\n              i. Waiver\n\n              The Hospital initially argues that Harlow's claim of\n\nspecific jurisdiction is raised for the first time on appeal, and\n\nthat she therefore waived any specific jurisdiction argument she\n\nmight have. The Hospital overstates the record, and, in any event,\n\nits own argument on waiver is perfunctory, and so has been waived.7\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).                    The\n\ndistrict court addressed both claims.          We follow suit.\n\n              ii. Standards for Specific Jurisdiction\n\n              The evidence produced to support specific jurisdiction\n\nmust show that the cause of action either arises directly out of,\n\nor is related to, the defendant's forum-based contacts.               Pleasant\n\n\n      7\n       As the district court noted, Harlow relied on general\njurisdiction in the state court proceeding. Harlow's reply to the\nHospital's motion to dismiss in the district court does not\nexpressly argue for \"specific jurisdiction,\" but it also does not\nexpressly argue for \"general jurisdiction.\" Without using either\nof those terms, the substance of the reply plainly invokes both\nforms of personal jurisdiction.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1088-89.    The relatedness requirement is not\n\nan open door; it is closely read, and it requires a showing of a\n\nmaterial   connection.   This    court   \"steadfastly   reject[s]   the\n\nexercise of personal jurisdiction whenever the connection between\n\nthe cause of action and the defendant's forum-state contacts seems\n\nattenuated and indirect.\"   Id. at 1089 (citing Donatelli, 893 F.2d\n\nat 463).   \"Instead, the defendant's in-state conduct must form an\n\n'important, or [at least] material, element of proof' in the\n\nplaintiff's case.\" Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Marino v.\n\nHyatt Corp., 793 F.2d 427, 430 (1st Cir. 1986)).     A broad \"but-for\"\n\nargument is generally insufficient.      Because \"'but for' events can\n\nbe very remote, . . . due process demands something like a\n\n'proximate cause' nexus.\"   Cambridge Literary Props., 295 F.3d at\n\n65.   And although \"strict adherence to a proximate cause standard\n\nin all circumstances is unnecessarily restrictive,\" in most cases\n\n\"the proximate cause standard better comports with the relatedness\n\ninquiry because it so easily correlates to foreseeability, a\n\nsignificant component of the jurisdictional inquiry.\" Nowak v. Tak\n\nHow Invs., Ltd., 94 F.3d 708, 715 (1st Cir. 1996).       \"A 'but for'\n\nrequirement . . . has in itself no limiting principle; it literally\n\nembraces every event that hindsight can logically identify in the\n\ncausative chain.\" Id. In sum, although proximate causation is not\n\na per se requirement of specific jurisdiction, its presence or\n\nabsence is still important.     Id. at 715-16.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f          iii. Timing of Contacts -- Specific Jurisdiction\n\n          There is a preliminary question regarding the universe of\n\nfacts pertinent to the specific jurisdiction analysis.         Three key\n\nthemes of specific jurisdiction analysis require that the proper\n\nfocus be on those contacts leading up to and surrounding the\n\nclaimed injury which are related to the alleged malpractice. Those\n\nthree concepts are that there be fair notice to the defendant, that\n\nthe defendant must have purposefully availed itself of the forum\n\nstate, and that the forum-based activity be truly related to the\n\ncause of action.   The bulk of Harlow's post-tort evidence of the\n\nHospital's activity in Maine is simply not related at all to the\n\nalleged malpractice.\n\n          As to the time frame for evidence, we have rejected an\n\nargument from a defendant that specific jurisdiction should be\n\nmeasured by contacts after the alleged wrongdoing, where those\n\ncontacts were more limited than those at the time of the event.\n\nSee Cambridge Literary Props., 295 F.3d at 66 (\"[F]or purposes of\n\nspecific jurisdiction, contacts should be judged when the cause of\n\naction arose, regardless of a later lessening or withdrawal.\").        A\n\ndefendant cannot avoid jurisdiction by shrinking its contacts with\n\nthe forum after the tort.\n\n          This   case   presents   the    mirror-image   question.   The\n\ndistrict court understood Harlow, the plaintiff, to be asking that\n\nspecific jurisdiction be measured in part by contacts after the\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fcause of action arose, when those later contacts with the forum\n\nstate   increased.    This   presents    a   slightly   different   set   of\n\nproblems -- particularly as to fair notice to the defendant,\n\npurposeful availment, and relatedness.\n\n           These three concepts are all related, and they mean that\n\nin analyzing specific jurisdiction, contacts must generally be\n\nlimited to those before and surrounding the accrual of the cause of\n\naction. This court has noted, for instance, that \"'foreseeability'\n\nand 'purposeful availment' bear a family resemblance (the former\n\ndefining the latter to a considerable extent),\" Donatelli, 893 F.2d\n\nat 464, and that \"foreseeability is critical\" in analyzing the\n\nrelatedness requirement, Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1089.             At\n\nheart, these concepts are all designed to ensure that exercises of\n\njurisdiction comport with due process.           The Due Process Clause\n\nrequires fair warning as to where individuals' conduct will subject\n\nthem to suit, and for purposes of specific jurisdiction, \"this\n\n'fair warning' requirement is satisfied if the defendant has\n\n'purposefully directed' his activities at residents of the forum,\n\nand the litigation results from alleged injuries that 'arise out of\n\nor relate to' those activities.\"        Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,\n\n471 U.S. 462, 471-72 (1985) (citations omitted); see also Pleasant\n\nStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1088 (citing Hanson's purposeful availment\n\nrequirement);   id.    (citing   concepts       of   reasonableness       and\n\nforeseeability and requirement \"that a defendant's 'conduct and\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fconnection with the forum State [be] such that he should reasonably\n\nanticipate being haled into court there'\" (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297\n\n(1980))).      The relatedness requirement, in particular, \"ensures\n\nthat the element of causation remains in the forefront of the due\n\nprocess investigation.\"       Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26\n\nF.3d 201, 207 (1st Cir. 1994).         Because causation is central to the\n\nrelatedness inquiry, see, e.g., Nowak, 94 F.3d at 714-16; Pleasant\n\nStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1089, in most cases, contacts coming into\n\nexistence after the cause of action arose will not be relevant.\n\n            iv. Analysis\n\n            Harlow's argument in support of specific jurisdiction is\n\nthat \"[s]imply stated, but for Children's Hospital's contacts with\n\nthe State of Maine, Danielle Harlow never would have undergone the\n\nsurgical procedure that she did, and she never would have suffered\n\nher injuries.\"         Harlow points to the following facts: (1) the\n\nHospital's     staff    communicated     by   telephone   and    by   written\n\ncorrespondence with Harlow's doctor in Maine before and after the\n\nprocedure; (2) the Hospital scheduled the surgery in advance and\n\nknew that Harlow was coming from Maine; (3) Harlow's pediatrician,\n\nwho referred her to the Hospital, was a target of the Hospital's\n\n\"outreach program\"; (4) before the procedure, and during her first\n\nvisit, Harlow's mother informed the Hospital's staff that the\n\nfamily   was    of   modest   means,    and   the   Hospital    responded   by\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fcontacting    Maine      Medicaid   to   obtain    prior    approval      for   the\n\nprocedure; (5) after the procedure, the Hospital arranged for\n\nHarlow to receive inpatient rehabilitation at the Maine Medical\n\nCenter; and (6) a doctor at the Hospital communicated with Harlow's\n\nphysicians in Maine \"on repeated occasions\" and contacted the Maine\n\ngovernment to obtain approval for follow-up care.                 Harlow stresses\n\nthe Hospital's contacts with Maine Medicaid, arguing that those\n\ncontacts     were   financially      beneficial        to   the    Hospital     and\n\nconstituted purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of\n\nMaine law.\n\n           When the post-event evidence unrelated to the alleged\n\nmalpractice is excluded, Harlow has not made out an adequate case\n\nfor specific jurisdiction.          Harlow's \"but-for\" theory -- that but\n\nfor the referral from a Maine pediatrician, the harm would never\n\nhave   happened     --    is   insufficient       to    give      Maine   specific\n\njurisdiction over the Hospital.          The place of the alleged tort was\n\nnot Maine but Massachusetts.             There is no evidence that the\n\nHospital purposefully induced Harlow to leave Maine to come to\n\nMassachusetts.      There is not even any evidence that the Hospital\n\ninduced the pediatrician to refer the patient to Maine.                   That the\n\nreputation and expertise of an institution lead to referrals from\n\nout of state cannot be enough to establish specific jurisdiction.\n\n           Harlow makes much of the uncontested fact that the\n\nHospital was \"well aware that [she] was coming from Maine\" and\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fwould likely return there.      If that rationale -- an out-of-state\n\nplaintiff availing herself of services in Massachusetts -- were\n\nsufficient, then the Hospital would be subject to suit for merely\n\ntaking a patient from elsewhere.      That the consequences of medical\n\ncare remain with a patient throughout her lifetime provides even\n\nless of a basis to assert jurisdiction.          Jurisdiction cannot be\n\ncreated by and does not travel with the plaintiff patient wherever\n\nshe goes.\n\n            The nature of the activity in which the defendant is\n\nengaged   is   important.     The   Hospital   is   not   engaged   in   the\n\ninterstate sale of tangible goods, capable of doing harm elsewhere.\n\nEven if it were, \"'mere awareness' that a product may end up in the\n\nforum state does not constitute 'purposeful availment.'\" Boit, 967\n\nF.2d at 683; id. at 682-83 (discussing Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v.\n\nSuperior Court of Cal., 480 U.S. 102 (1987)).         Compare Int'l Shoe\n\nCo., 326 U.S. at 314-15, 320 (personal jurisdiction proper where\n\ndefendant's salesmen resided in state, they displayed samples and\n\nengaged in \"regular and systematic solicitation of orders in the\n\nstate,\"   \"a   substantial   volume   of   merchandise    [was]   regularly\n\nshipped by [defendant] to purchasers within the state,\" and cause\n\nof action arose out of defendant's in-state activities), with\n\nRodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 85 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(stating that even if third-party defendant had specific knowledge\n\nthat the stream of commerce would move its product into the forum\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fstate, \"this awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the\n\npurposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of minimum\n\ncontacts\" (emphasis added)).\n\n          Rather than putting goods into the \"stream of commerce,\"\n\nthe Hospital rendered medical care, a professional and highly\n\npersonal service, and it did so entirely in Massachusetts.           As the\n\nNinth Circuit has explained:\n          In the case of personal services focus must be\n          on the place where the services are rendered,\n          since this is the place of the receiver's\n          (here the patient's) need.       The need is\n          personal and the services rendered are in\n          response to the dimensions of that personal\n          need. They are directed to no place but to\n          the needy person herself. It is in the very\n          nature   of    such    services   that   their\n          consequences will be felt wherever the person\n          may choose to go.      However, the idea that\n          tortious rendition of such services is a\n          portable tort which can be deemed to have been\n          committed     wherever     the    consequences\n          foreseeably were felt is wholly inconsistent\n          with the public interest in having services of\n          this sort generally available.\n\nWright v. Yackley, 459 F.2d 287, 289-90 (9th Cir. 1972).         We reject\n\nHarlow's portable tort theory.\n\n          Harlow   also   relies   on     other   contacts,   such   as   the\n\nHospital's dealings with Maine Medicaid and a handful of personal\n\ncommunications about Harlow's treatment between the Hospital and\n\nvarious individuals in Maine.       The fact that Maine, through the\n\nMaine Medicaid program, paid for the surgery is not a great deal\n\ndifferent for specific jurisdiction purposes than if Harlow's\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fparents had written in Maine and mailed to the Hospital a check on\n\ntheir Maine bank account.      A Maine patient will presumably pay,\n\neither   through   insurance   or    otherwise,   for   services   at   the\n\nHospital.    In Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall,\n\n466 U.S. 408 (1984), the Supreme Court said that the defendant's\n\nacceptance of checks drawn on a forum-based bank was \"of negligible\n\nsignificance for purposes of determining whether [the defendant]\n\nhad sufficient contacts in [the forum].\"          Id. at 416.   The Court\n\nobserved that \"[c]ommon sense and everyday experience suggest that,\n\nabsent unusual circumstances, the bank on which a check is drawn is\n\ngenerally of little consequence to the payee and is a matter left\n\nto the discretion of the drawer.\"8           Id. at 416-17 (footnote\n\nomitted).    While the utilization of Medicaid from the patient's\n\nstate may cause extra communication and paperwork, it does not by\n\nitself rise to the level of importance necessary to establish\n\nspecific jurisdiction.\n\n            We affirm the finding of lack of specific jurisdiction.\n\n            c. General Jurisdiction\n\n            General jurisdiction may exist \"when the litigation is\n\nnot directly founded on the defendant's forum-based contacts, but\n\n\n     8\n        In Helicopteros, there was \"no indication that [the\ndefendant] ever requested that the checks be drawn on a [forum]\nbank or that there was any negotiation between [the parties] with\nrespect to the location or identity of the bank on which checks\nwould be drawn.\" 466 U.S. at 416. Here, the Hospital did arrange\nfor payment from Maine Medicaid, but this was at the plaintiff's\nrequest.\n\n                                    -26-\n\fthe defendant has nevertheless engaged in continuous and systematic\n\nactivity, unrelated to the suit, in the forum state.\"                  Pleasant\n\nStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1088 (citing Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 414-16\n\n& n.9); see also Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 416 (focusing on\n\nquestion   of    whether    defendant's     contacts    with     forum     state\n\n\"constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business\n\ncontacts   the   Court     found   to   exist   in\"    Perkins    v.     Benguet\n\nConsolidated Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437 (1952)).           \"The standard for\n\nevaluating whether . . . contacts satisfy the constitutional\n\ngeneral jurisdiction test 'is considerably more stringent' than\n\nthat applied to specific jurisdiction questions.\" Noonan, 135 F.3d\n\nat 93 (quoting Glater v. Eli Lilly & Co., 744 F.2d 213, 216 (1st\n\nCir. 1984)).\n\n           i. Timing of Contacts -- General Jurisdiction\n\n           We first resolve a preliminary matter. At oral argument,\n\nthe parties disputed which time frame of evidence was relevant in\n\ndeciding whether the Hospital's contacts with Maine are sufficient\n\nto justify general jurisdiction.        Harlow argued that for purposes\n\nof general jurisdiction, we should look at the Hospital's contacts\n\nup to the time of the filing of the complaint, well beyond the time\n\nof the alleged tort.       The Hospital relied by analogy on Cambridge\n\nLiterary Properties for the proposition that, even when general\n\njurisdiction is alleged, \"contacts should be judged when the cause\n\nof action arose.\"    295 F.3d at 66.       We disagree with the Hospital.\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fIt is settled law that unrelated contacts which occurred after the\n\ncause of action arose, but before the suit was filed, may be\n\nconsidered for purposes of the general jurisdiction inquiry.\n\n           In Noonan, we expressly rejected the argument now made by\n\nthe Hospital.     See 135 F.3d at 93 n.8 (\"The parties clash over\n\nwhich contacts should be considered in the general jurisdiction\n\nanalysis. . . . [T]hey dispute whether a foreign corporation's\n\ncontacts with the forum should be measured up to the time of the\n\nalleged tort, up to the time the complaint is filed, or at any\n\ntime.   We have considered all contacts established up to the time\n\n[the plaintiff] filed his complaint.\"). In Helicopteros, where the\n\nhelicopter crash at the center of the lawsuit had occurred in\n\nJanuary 1976, the Supreme Court considered contacts through the\n\nyear 1977.   See 466 U.S. at 410-11.       On the other hand, contacts\n\nafter the filing of the complaint are not considered.            See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd., 274 F.3d 610, 619 n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (\"[W]e consider only contacts established before the\n\ngovernment filed its complaint in December 1997 . . . .\").\n\n           The   reason   for   this   approach   stems   from   the   basic\n\ndistinction between specific and general jurisdiction.           Wright and\n\nMiller, in discussing this distinction, state:\n\n           As a practical matter, a general jurisdiction\n           inquiry is very different from a specific\n           jurisdiction inquiry. As one Court of Appeals\n           put it,\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f                Unlike the specific jurisdiction\n                analysis, which focuses on the cause\n                of action, the defendant and the\n                forum,   a   general    jurisdiction\n                inquiry is dispute blind, the sole\n                focus being on whether there are\n                continuous and systematic contacts\n                between the defendant and the forum.\n\n          Accordingly, a court should consider all of a\n          defendant's contacts with the forum state\n          prior to the filing of the lawsuit, rather\n          than just those contacts that are related to\n          the particular cause of action the plaintiff\n          asserts.\n\n4 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1067.5, at 520-\n\n21 (3d ed. 2002) (footnote omitted) (quoting Dickson Marine, Inc.\n\nv. Panalpina, Inc., 179 F.3d 331, 339 (5th Cir. 1999)); see also\n\nMetro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 569-70\n\n(2d Cir. 1996) (\"In general jurisdiction cases, district courts\n\nshould examine a defendant's contacts with the forum state over a\n\nperiod that is reasonable under the circumstances -- up to and\n\nincluding the date the suit was filed -- to assess whether they\n\nsatisfy the 'continuous and systematic' standard.\").\n\n          ii. Analysis\n\n          In support of general jurisdiction, Harlow points to the\n\nHospital's \"ongoing relationship\" with Maine Medicaid, the fact\n\nthat the Hospital derives \"substantial and consistent revenue\" from\n\nMaine,   the   Hospital's   active   marketing   and   advertising   to\n\nphysicians and the general public in Maine, and the fact that the\n\nHospital \"holds itself [out] as the regional pediatric trauma\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fcenter.\"         Harlow argues that all of this amounts to \"engag[ing] in\n\nthe    'continuous       and   systematic'    pursuit   of   general   business\n\nactivities\" in Maine.          Glater, 744 F.2d at 216 (quoting Perkins,\n\n342 U.S. at 448).9\n\n                 The Hospital, for its part, points to other facts which\n\nhave       not    been   disputed:   the     Hospital   is   organized   under\n\nMassachusetts law and has its principal place of business in\n\nBoston, Massachusetts; the Hospital does not own or use real estate\n\nor maintain branch offices or other places of business in Maine; it\n\nprovides no medical services in Maine; and it \"participates in no\n\narrangements to provide consultation, advice, services, or use of\n\nits equipment or facilities to Maine health care providers.\"\n\nAlthough it has on occasion sent mailings to 82 pediatricians in\n\nMaine and it maintains a website accessible in Maine, the Hospital\n\ndoes not actually do business through its website, and Maine\n\nresidents account for only about 100 out of 18,000 annual patient\n\nadmissions in Massachusetts. The Hospital argues that its contacts\n\nfall \"well below the levels of contacts that [have] previously\n\n[been] found insufficient to support general jurisdiction.\"                 We\n\nagree.\n\n\n\n       9\n       Harlow argues that her case is analogous to the case of\nKenerson v. Stevenson, 604 F. Supp. 792 (D. Me. 1985), which held\nthat general jurisdiction in Maine existed over a New Hampshire\nhospital that had treated a Maine resident who had arrived with\ninjuries received in New Hampshire. Whether Kenerson is correct or\nnot, the evidence here does not establish general jurisdiction.\n\n                                      -30-\n\f            As we have held in other cases, \"where 'defendant's only\n\nactivities consist of advertising and employing salesmen to solicit\n\norders, we think that fairness will not permit a state to assume\n\njurisdiction.'\" Glater, 744 F.2d at 217 (quoting Seymour v. Parke,\n\nDavis & Co., 423 F.2d 584, 586-87 (1st Cir. 1970)).         We repeat\n\nGlater's summary of Seymour, because we are facing an essentially\n\nsimilar fact pattern:\n\n            In Seymour, a manufacturer and distributor of\n            [a] drug was sued in New Hampshire for\n            injuries occurring in Massachusetts.      The\n            defendant maintained no office and engaged in\n            no manufacturing in New Hampshire; it held no\n            property there; it was not registered to do\n            business there.   Its only contacts with New\n            Hampshire consisted of advertising and the\n            activities of a half dozen salesmen, mostly\n            New Hampshire residents, who accepted orders\n            and disseminated product information to New\n            Hampshire physicians, hospitals and retail\n            pharmacies.\n\nId. at 217.\n\n            Harlow argues that a nontrivial number of the Hospital's\n\npatients come from Maine and have their treatment paid for by Maine\n\nMedicaid.    The Hospital points out that using Harlow's figures --\n\nshe alleges that Maine Medicaid pays the Hospital roughly $2\n\nmillion annually, and that the Hospital's total annual revenue is\n\nalmost $400 million -- Maine Medicaid payments account for only\n\n0.5% of the Hospital's revenues.\n\n            Treating patients from Maine in Massachusetts, even on a\n\nregular basis, is not the same as engaging in continuous and\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fsystematic   activity         in   Maine.      A     hospital   that      treats   Maine\n\nresidents    in    Massachusetts        is,    quite       simply,   in   a    different\n\nposition from a hospital that treats Maine residents in Maine, or\n\na firm that sells products to Maine residents in Maine.                        That the\n\nHospital derives revenue from treating Maine patients, sometimes in\n\nthe form of payments from Maine Medicaid, does not alter the basic\n\nfact that the Hospital is not \"engaged in continuous and systematic\n\nactivity, unrelated to the suit, in [Maine].\"                    Pleasant Street I,\n\n960 F.2d at 1088; see also Wolf v. Richmond County Hosp. Auth., 745\n\nF.2d 904, 906, 910 (4th Cir. 1984) (no general jurisdiction even\n\nthough, among other things, defendant hospital \"treats [forum-\n\nstate] residents and receives payments (either from state or local\n\ngovernmental bodies or from the residents themselves) for services\n\nrendered,\"       some   of    the    payments        included    \"medicaid/medicare\n\nreimbursements,\"        and    \"approximately         one-fifth\"     of    defendant's\n\nincome came from forum-state residents); 4 Wright & Miller, supra,\n\n§ 1067.5, at 507 (\"[T]he defendant must be engaged in longstanding\n\nbusiness    in    the   forum       state,    such    as    marketing     or   shipping\n\nproducts, or performing services or maintaining one or more offices\n\nthere; activities that are less extensive than that will not\n\nqualify for general in personam jurisdiction.\").\n\n            2. Reasonableness of Exercise of Jurisdiction\n\n            Even if the Hospital's contacts with Maine were minimally\n\nsufficient for either specific or general jurisdiction, we would\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fstill conclude that the exercise of jurisdiction here would be\n\nunreasonable. \"[E]ven where purposefully generated contacts exist,\n\ncourts must consider a panoply of other factors which bear upon the\n\nfairness of subjecting a nonresident to the authority of a foreign\n\ntribunal.\"      Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1088.             \"[G]auging\n\nfairness requires an assessment of reasonableness for, in certain\n\ncircumstances, unreasonableness can trump a minimally sufficient\n\nshowing of relatedness and purposefulness.\" Ticketmaster-New York,\n\n26 F.3d at 210.         The factors to be considered, known as the\n\n\"Gestalt factors,\" Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1088 (quoting\n\nDonatelli, 893 F.2d at 465), include:\n\n            (1) the defendant's burden of appearing, (2)\n            the forum state's interest in adjudicating the\n            dispute, (3) the plaintiff's interest in\n            obtaining convenient and effective relief, (4)\n            the judicial system's interest in obtaining\n            the   most   effective   resolution   of   the\n            controversy, and (5) the common interests of\n            all sovereigns in promoting substantive social\n            policies.\n\nId. (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477).\n\n            \"[T]he reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry\n\nevokes a sliding scale.\"         Ticketmaster-New York, 26 F.3d at 210.\n\nIn other words, \"the weaker the plaintiff's showing on the first\n\ntwo prongs (relatedness and purposeful availment), the less a\n\ndefendant    need    show   in   terms   of   unreasonableness   to   defeat\n\njurisdiction.       The reverse is equally true: an especially strong\n\n\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\fshowing of reasonableness may serve to fortify a borderline showing\n\nof relatedness and purposefulness.\"        Id.\n\n            It is true that Harlow \"has an interest in litigating\n\nconveniently in [her] home state, which in turn has an interest in\n\naffording its citizens a convenient forum.\"           Cambridge Literary\n\nProps., 295 F.3d at 66.      But even though Maine has an interest in\n\nprotecting its residents, Massachusetts has a like interest, one\n\nmade stronger by the fact that it has an interest as a sovereign in\n\na case arising from the conduct -- here, medical practice -- that\n\noccurs within its borders.          Of course, \"[t]he purpose of the\n\ninquiry is not to compare the forum's interest to that of some\n\nother jurisdiction, but to determine the extent to which the forum\n\nhas an interest,\" Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Can., 46\n\nF.3d 138, 151 (1st Cir. 1995), but here Maine has only a slight\n\ninterest.    \"Although a forum state has a significant interest in\n\nobtaining jurisdiction over a defendant who causes tortious injury\n\nwithin its borders, that interest is diminished where the injury\n\noccurred    outside   the   forum   state.\"      Nowak,   94   F.3d   at   718\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n            Further, Massachusetts law, not Maine law, would govern\n\nthis dispute.   See Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson &\n\nPoole, P.A., 290 F.3d 42, 62 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing the fact that\n\nforum state's law governs the dispute as one factor in favor of\n\nexercising personal jurisdiction there); Estate of Johnson, 2001 ME\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\f39, ¶ 6, 766 A.2d 592, 594 (Maine has adopted the \"most significant\n\ncontacts and relationships\" test for choice of law, providing that\n\n\"[i]n an action for a personal injury, the local law of the state\n\nwhere the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of\n\nthe parties, unless, with respect to the particular issue, some\n\nother state has a more significant relationship . . . to the\n\noccurrence   and    the     parties\"     (quoting      Restatement      (Second)   of\n\nConflict   of    Laws   §   146   (1969))).         As    in   Donatelli,   Maine's\n\n\"sovereignty is not threatened; apart from a generalized concern\n\nfor the rights of its own domiciliaries, the state has no real\n\ninterest in adjudicating the controversy.                  In point of fact, the\n\nopposite seems true . . . .\"             893 F.2d at 472.\n\n           Harlow argues that recognizing jurisdiction in Maine\n\nwould be fair, because her family is of limited means, whereas the\n\nHospital has annual revenues of $400 million.                  Harlow also argues:\n\n\"Whereas litigating this case in Maine will cause little, if any,\n\ninconvenience to the Children's Hospital, Danielle Harlow has no\n\nother forum for her case to be heard.\"                   The argument is exactly\n\nbackwards.      Harlow did have an obvious and readily available forum\n\nin   Massachusetts.         The   fact    that   she     missed   the    statute   of\n\nlimitations in Massachusetts does not add to her argument at all.\n\nTo hold otherwise would encourage plaintiffs to deliberately miss\n\n\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fa statute of limitations for purposes of forum manipulation.10 Such\n\na practice should be discouraged, not rewarded.\n\n          Another interest is at stake -- \"the common interest[] of\n\nall sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\" Pleasant\n\nStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1088.      This factor weighs against the\n\nreasonableness of exercising personal jurisdiction in Maine.    All\n\nsovereigns share an interest in promoting the social policy of\n\nhaving quality health care available to those who need it.   One way\n\nto promote this policy is to limit the length of time during which\n\nhealth care providers are exposed to lawsuits arising from the care\n\nthey provide.   Here, for instance, Massachusetts has set a three-\n\nyear statute of limitations for malpractice claims against its\n\nhospitals.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 60D.      Maine has a\n\nminimal interest in seeing that this limit be avoided, and the\n\ncommon interest of all sovereigns (including Maine) in seeing that\n\nthis limit be observed is strong, especially in light of the fact\n\nthat the Hospital did not purposefully conduct business in or\n\n\n     10\n        This court has addressed concerns about manipulation and\nstatutes of limitations in other contexts. Cf. Noonan, 135 F.3d at\n95 (discussing, in the context of temporal limitations on\njurisdictional discovery, the risk that \"undesirable exploitation\nof statute of limitations periods\" will occur and that \"[s]avvy\nplaintiffs who wait until the end of the limitations period to\nmaximize the chance of asserting jurisdiction will be rewarded for\ntheir dilatory tactics\"); Seymour, 423 F.2d at 585-86 (exercise of\njurisdiction unfair where \"plaintiff . . . is unconnected with the\nforum and is not 'convenienced' by being able to sue there except\nthat she has lost her right to sue in what would otherwise have\nbeen the fair and convenient state\" because of the expiration of\nthat state's statute of limitations).\n\n                               -36-\n\fspecifically direct its activities toward another state which has\n\na longer statute of limitations.\n\n          As to the disparity in resources, that has little to do\n\nwith due process limits on the extension of long-arm jurisdiction.\n\nThe law is not oblivious to financial considerations.              But even\n\nthough the defendant's burden of appearing and the plaintiff's\n\ninterest in obtaining convenient and effective relief are included\n\namong the \"Gestalt factors\" for the personal jurisdiction analysis,\n\nsee Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1088, sheer disparity in wealth\n\nis not.\n\n          The argument Harlow raises of relative convenience and\n\nburden is more appropriately dealt with under the law of forum non\n\nconveniens    or   change   of   venue.    Where   a   plaintiff   properly\n\nestablishes jurisdiction in one federal district court, she is free\n\nto argue for a transfer to another federal district court.           See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1404(a) (\"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in\n\nthe interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil\n\naction to any other district or division where it might have been\n\nbrought.\").    Even under the doctrines of forum non conveniens and\n\nchange of venue, it is not clear that sheer disparity in wealth is\n\nlegally relevant, without proof of hardship. See Iragorri v. Int'l\n\nElevator, Inc., 203 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          In the end, this case is about a patient who lives in\n\nMaine and was referred by a Maine doctor to a hospital in Boston,\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fand who underwent a medical procedure in Boston which gave rise to\n\na cause of action; she returned to Maine and the procedure was paid\n\nfor from Maine.    That cannot be enough to subject the Hospital to\n\nsuit in Maine.    The question is not whether hospitals may be held\n\nresponsible in lawsuits for their activities, but whether they may\n\nbe haled into court out of state because they accept out-of-state\n\npatients.    It would be unreasonable to conclude that they could.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            The district court's order granting the Hospital's motion\n\nto dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is affirmed.       Each\n\nside shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\f",

D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Adam A. Rowe, with whom Leo J. Dunn, III and Crowe & Dunn\nwere on brief, for appellant.\n     James B. Haddow, with whom Bradford A. Pattershall and\nPetruccelli, Martin & Haddow, LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 20, 2005\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.    In November 2004, Danielle Harlow\n\nof   Turner,   Maine,     sued   Children's   Hospital   of     Boston,\n\nMassachusetts, in the Maine Superior Court for medical malpractice\n\nduring a procedure performed at the Hospital on May 10, 1993.\n\nDanielle was six years old at the time of the procedure.            The\n\nissues addressed here would never have arisen had she filed suit in\n\nMassachusetts courts, which had jurisdiction over the Hospital,\n\nbefore the expiration of the Massachusetts three-year statute of\n\nlimitations.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 60D.   She did not file\n\nsuch a suit.\n\n          Rather, Harlow instituted proceedings in Maine after the\n\nMassachusetts statute had expired. Maine allows minors to commence\n\nan action \"within 6 years after the cause of action accrues or\n\nwithin 3 years after the minor reaches the age of majority,\n\nwhichever first occurs.\"    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 2902.    The\n\nNovember 2004 suit was timely filed under Maine law because Harlow\n\nhad filed a Notice of Claim before the six years had expired,\n\nthereby tolling the statute of limitations.     See id. § 2859.     The\n\nquestion is whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction over the\n\nHospital in Maine would comport with Maine's long-arm statute and\n\nthe Due Process Clause.\n\n          The Hospital removed the Maine case to federal court,\n\ninvoking diversity jurisdiction.        The Hospital then moved to\n\ndismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.           The court\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fgranted that motion, and Harlow appeals.                   We affirm.            In doing so,\n\nwe clarify the time frame of the evidence to which a court may look\n\nin   deciding       whether    a   defendant's         contacts    with      a     state   are\n\nsufficient to justify personal jurisdiction, both specific and\n\ngeneral.\n\n                                              I.\n\n               In   1993,     Danielle    Harlow       underwent       a    radiofrequency\n\ncardiac      ablation     procedure      at     the    Hospital    in       Boston.        The\n\nprocedure       was     performed    to       treat     Harlow's       supraventricular\n\ntachyarrhythmia, a condition secondary to Harlow's Wolff-Parkinson-\n\nWhite       syndrome.       Allegedly      as      a   result     of       the    Hospital's\n\nnegligence, Harlow suffered a stroke during the procedure.                            Harlow\n\nalleges that the stroke caused brain damage, with the result that\n\nshe suffers serious permanent injury in the form of severe left\n\nhemiparesis,1 as well as cognitive and behavioral impairments,\n\nincluding \"cognitive deficits, personality changes, attention and\n\nconcentration deficits, impulsivity, and an inability to modulate\n\nher behavior.\"\n\n               In May 1999, Harlow filed a notice of medical malpractice\n\nclaim against the Hospital and four affiliated doctors, initiating\n\n\n        1\n       Hemiparesis is \"muscular weakness or partial paralysis\nrestricted to one side of the body,\" according to Webster's Third\nNew International Dictionary 1054 (1993). Harlow says that she\nsuffers from a deformity in her left hand and from impaired gait\nand balance. In particular, according to a doctor who evaluated\nHarlow, Harlow has a \"claw hand\" on the left side and her left foot\nturns inward as she walks.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fmandatory prelitigation screening panel proceedings, as required by\n\nMaine law.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §§ 2853, 2903.                 The\n\ndefendants asserted lack of personal jurisdiction over them in\n\nMaine; the panel chair, acting on a joint motion of the parties,\n\nreferred the issue of jurisdiction to the Maine Superior Court\n\npursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 2853(5).                 In February\n\n2001, after briefing, the Superior Court granted the defendant\n\ndoctors' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, but\n\ndenied the Hospital's motion, ruling that there was personal\n\njurisdiction over the Hospital (the court did not specify whether\n\nit was relying on general or specific jurisdiction, and it cited\n\nfactors pertinent to both).\n\n            In October 2004, the screening panel unanimously decided\n\nthat the Hospital's treatment of Harlow had deviated from the\n\napplicable standard of care and had caused her injury. In November\n\n2004, Harlow filed her medical malpractice complaint in Maine\n\nSuperior Court. The Hospital removed the case to federal court and\n\nmoved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(2).      Harlow filed an objection on the merits and\n\nunder the law of the case doctrine, and the Hospital filed a reply.\n\n            In March 2005, the district court granted the Hospital's\n\nmotion to dismiss.     The court observed that to the extent the \"law\n\nof   the   case\"   doctrine   applied    at   all,   it   is   \"a    matter    of\n\ndiscretion,\" and that it was preferable to resolve the issue.                 The\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcourt,    sitting   in   diversity,    held     that   it   lacked   personal\n\njurisdiction, both specific and general, over the Hospital.\n\n            On appeal, Harlow argues that the district court erred in\n\ntwo ways: first, the law of the case doctrine precluded the\n\nHospital from relitigating the issue of personal jurisdiction, and\n\nsecond, on the merits, Harlow had established personal jurisdiction\n\nover the Hospital.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.

In fact, the Hospital\n\ntried to appeal, but the Maine Law Court dismissed the appeal as\n\ninterlocutory . . . .\"         The district court put the point well:\n\n\"Although it is late in the case to re-examine the question, it\n\nwill be later still on appeal, an avenue open to the Hospital\n\nbecause    the   personal    jurisdiction     ruling    has   never    yet   been\n\nappealable.\"\n\n            One might think there could be a federalism objection to\n\na federal court's reconsidering a state court's interlocutory order\n\nentered before removal of the case.           Harlow's absolutist argument\n\nagainst allowing the Hospital to reargue the matter suggests such\n\na consideration. But the argument proves too much: federalism does\n\nnot   require     more     deferential      treatment    of    a     state-court\n\ninterlocutory order in a case removed to federal court than it\n\nwould have required had the order originated in federal court.\n\n            The Hospital, for its part, argues that the \"law of the\n\ncase\" doctrine does not apply at all in this case, because the\n\ndoctrine applies \"only to those situations in which a court is\n\nconsidering a matter that has already been the subject of a ruling\n\nby a coordinate court,\" and \"a state court is not 'coordinate' with\n\na federal court on matters of federal law.\"                    In effect, the\n\nHospital   --    without    citing   any    decisions   of    this   court   (the\n\nHospital cites only district court decisions for this proposition)\n\n-- is arguing for a per se rule that when the prior ruling on an\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fissue of federal law comes from a state court, law-of-the-case\n\nconsiderations in a removed case are never applicable. Since state\n\ncourts are also obligated to apply federal law, the premise of the\n\nargument is fatally flawed.\n\n            In any case, \"it would hardly do to reverse a correct\n\nruling . . . on the simplistic ground that it departed from the\n\n'law of the case' established by an earlier ruling,\" especially\n\nwhere \"the order challenged on appeal is subject to de novo review\n\nin any event.\"       18B Wright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, § 4478.1, at\n\n707-09.\n\nB.

Contacts as Alleged by Harlow\n\n          We review the facts in two different categories: first,\n\nthe evidence before and around the alleged tort, and second, the\n\nevidence after and unrelated to the alleged tort.\n\n          i. Evidence From Before and During the Period of the\n             Alleged Tort\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f                 Harlow's   pediatrician      in   Maine    was     the    person   who\n\nrecommended that Harlow be examined at the Hospital; the referral\n\nwas made in the spring of 1993.             After recommending an examination\n\nat the Hospital and before Harlow's first appointment there,\n\nHarlow's pediatrician sent Harlow's medical records from Maine to\n\nthe Hospital.        Harlow had her first appointment at the Hospital on\n\nApril 27, 1993, and she underwent the contested procedure there on\n\nMay 10, 1993.         It appears that the Hospital discharged Harlow on\n\nMay 19 or 20, 1993.            It is unclear whether Harlow visited the\n\nHospital again after being discharged. The district court believed\n\nthat there were some follow-up visits, but Harlow did not so\n\nallege.4\n\n                 At Harlow's April 27, 1993, appointment, her mother\n\nexplained to the doctor that she was concerned about the family's\n\nability to pay for the recommended procedure, and the doctor stated\n\nthat       his    office    would   take    care   of      making    the    necessary\n\narrangements.        Before Harlow underwent the procedure, the Hospital\n\nobtained authorization from the Maine Medical Assistance Program\n\n(\"Maine Medicaid\"), which approved and agreed to pay for the\n\n\n       4\n       Harlow alleged only that the Hospital \"sought and obtained\nauthorization from\" Maine Medicaid for \"follow-up care at the\nHospital.\"   From the part of the record to which she cites, it\nappears that the Hospital obtained authorization for a visit during\nApril or May 1995, but Harlow does not claim (or cite any part of\nthe record to show) that such a visit, or any other visit, in fact\noccurred. There are only two actual visits, then, that Harlow has\nalleged and provided record support for: the first appointment, and\nthe procedure itself.\n\n                                           -13-\n\fprocedure.5     Ultimately, Maine Medicaid paid over $20,000 to the\n\nHospital for Harlow's procedure and immediate follow-up care at the\n\nHospital. It appears that the Hospital, before discharging Harlow,\n\nperformed various tests, including a cerebral CT scan, an MRI, and\n\nan ultrasound study of the carotid artery, and that it administered\n\nphenobarbital treatment (for an unspecified length of time, but at\n\nleast on May 17) for left-sided simple partial seizures.\n\n            If the state of Maine had not paid for the procedure at\n\nthe Hospital, the Harlows would not have been able to afford it,\n\nand they would have sought other treatment.               After Harlow was\n\ndischarged from the Hospital, she received \"most of her follow up\n\ncare\" from Maine health care practitioners.         Harlow was discharged\n\nfrom the Hospital to the Maine Medical Center for an extensive\n\ncourse of rehabilitation.        Since then, she has been in a special\n\neducation     program   and   requires   a   one-on-one   aide   at   school.\n\nAccording to a physician who evaluated Harlow and reviewed her\n\nrecords, Harlow \"needs individual psychological counseling as well\n\nas a group social training program,\" and she will have difficulty\n\n\n\n     5\n       The district court correctly refused to consider Harlow's\ncontention that the Hospital has maintained \"for decades\" an\n\"active relationship\" with Maine Medicaid, that it had a Provider\nID Number before and after May 1993, and that under Maine law it\nwas required to regularly submit documentation to the State of\nMaine in order to keep its active Provider ID number. This was\nbecause Harlow failed to cite any record evidence to support this\ncontention. Harlow did cite record evidence to support, and the\ndistrict court did consider, the Hospital's arranging for Maine\nMedicaid to pay for Harlow's own treatment.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fliving independently, maintaining family and social relationships,\n\nand earning a living.         Harlow alleged that the cost of her future\n\ncare will be over $800,000.\n\n               Harlow alleged a number of communications between the\n\nHospital and various individuals in Maine.                  There is a letter,\n\ndated    April    30,     1993,6   from    a     Hospital   doctor    to   Harlow's\n\npediatrician, which refers to a prior phone call that the writer\n\nmade to the pediatrician, and which thanks the pediatrician for\n\nreferring Harlow to the Hospital.                   The evidence as to post-\n\nprocedure communications is sparse.               After the procedure, Hospital\n\nstaff    had    further    communications         with   Harlow's    pediatrician,\n\nanother pediatrician in Maine, Harlow's mother, and Maine Medicaid.\n\nHarlow states that the Hospital \"sent multiple correspondence to\n\n[these] individuals regarding Danielle,\" and that when a Hospital\n\ndoctor spoke with Harlow's mother on the telephone in January 1997,\n\nhe also sent correspondence, including \"various medical articles.\"\n\n               ii. Evidence From After the Alleged Tort\n\n               Much of Harlow's evidence concerned the second category:\n\nfor periods after and unrelated to the alleged malpractice on May\n\n\n\n     6\n       Harlow alleged only one pre-1993 contact: that since 1988,\nthe Hospital has sent \"relations specialists\" to meet with\npediatricians and family practitioners. The district court did not\nconsider this contention, because Harlow had not indicated \"that\nthese relations specialists ever visited or had any connection with\nMaine (or even New England).\" On appeal, Harlow has still failed\nto specify whether this outreach program ever included Maine\ndoctors in general or her pediatrician in particular.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f10, 1993.    We detail the evidence before we address whether the\n\npost-tort evidence can be considered for either the specific\n\njurisdiction analysis or the general jurisdiction analysis.\n\n            Harlow presented evidence that in 1998 and 1999, roughly\n\n100 inpatients per year were referred to the Hospital from Maine.\n\nIn 1998, the Hospital charged $2.4 million to Maine Medicaid.                 In\n\n1999, the Hospital charged $1.6 million to Maine Medicaid for\n\ninpatient services plus another $500,000 for outpatient services.\n\n            The Hospital was not incorporated in Maine and is not\n\nregistered    to     do   business    there.       Harlow       alleged     that,\n\nnevertheless, the Hospital \"actively markets and promotes its\n\nbusiness and services within Maine's borders.\"                  Her proffered\n\nevidentiary materials are largely undated and, to the extent they\n\nare dated, they post-date her May 1993 procedure.\n\n            In particular, Harlow alleged, the \"Hospital's marketing\n\ndepartment   specifically     targets   physicians      located    in     Maine.\"\n\nHarlow alleged that the Hospital has \"initiated a campaign to mail\n\nevery   single     pediatrician   located    in   the   State    of   Maine    an\n\ninformational packet.\" Harlow alleged no time frame here; her only\n\nrecord citation reveals that eighty-two copies of a \"Pediatric\n\nSpecialist Guide\" were mailed to Maine pediatricians in 2000, and\n\nthe Hospital's representative testified that he was unaware of any\n\nother referral guides being sent.           The Hospital also publishes a\n\nmonthly newsletter on pediatrics that, since 1999, has been mailed\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fto \"pediatricians who practice in Maine.\"                   The Hospital has also\n\nmailed a number of brochures to Maine pediatricians.                            Harlow did\n\nnot allege any specific dates on which brochures were mailed; at\n\nthe Hospital's deposition, the Hospital's representative testified\n\nthat some brochures were mailed on one occasion in the spring of\n\n2000 to eighty-two pediatricians in Maine, and that \"none of these\n\nitems    that   have      been    marked    as     exhibits     go   to    patients      or\n\nconsumers.\"         The   Hospital       has   advertised       in   the    Journal      of\n\nPediatrics.     The exhibit Harlow cited for this allegation does not\n\nindicate when (or, for that matter, whether) the advertisement was\n\npublished.          The   Hospital's       representative        testified         at   the\n\nHospital's July 2000 deposition that \"this advertisement is the\n\nfirst    I've   ever      heard    of\"    in   a   national     magazine,         and   the\n\nadvertisement had only been created \"around two or three weeks\n\nago.\"\n\n              The Hospital has run advertisements in the Boston Globe,\n\nwhich is \"widely circulated in Maine.\"                   Harlow alleged that this\n\nwas     \"in   the    1990's.\"        At     the     Hospital's       deposition,         the\n\nrepresentative       testified      that    he     was   only   aware      of    one    paid\n\nadvertising campaign in the Boston Globe, and it ran for a \"three-\n\nor four-week period\" in 1997.                     Harlow also alleged that the\n\nHospital has run an advertisement in a Maine newspaper \"on at least\n\none occasion\" in October 1996.             She also alleged that the Hospital\n\nhas advertised on Maine television and radio stations.                           She gives\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fno   dates,    and   the   exhibit   she   cites   is   a   webpage   that   was\n\napparently last updated in August 2002 and printed in February\n\n2005; the webpage describes then-current and planned broadcast\n\npromotions.      Harlow also pointed to other parts of the Hospital's\n\nwebsite that \"provide information for Maine physicians to refer\n\npatients to Children's Hospital, as well as driving directions from\n\nMaine to Massachusetts.\"\n\n              b. Specific Jurisdiction\n\n              i. Waiver\n\n              The Hospital initially argues that Harlow's claim of\n\nspecific jurisdiction is raised for the first time on appeal, and\n\nthat she therefore waived any specific jurisdiction argument she\n\nmight have. The Hospital overstates the record, and, in any event,\n\nits own argument on waiver is perfunctory, and so has been waived.7\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).                    The\n\ndistrict court addressed both claims.          We follow suit.\n\n              ii. Standards for Specific Jurisdiction\n\n              The evidence produced to support specific jurisdiction\n\nmust show that the cause of action either arises directly out of,\n\nor is related to, the defendant's forum-based contacts.               Pleasant\n\n\n      7\n       As the district court noted, Harlow relied on general\njurisdiction in the state court proceeding. Harlow's reply to the\nHospital's motion to dismiss in the district court does not\nexpressly argue for \"specific jurisdiction,\" but it also does not\nexpressly argue for \"general jurisdiction.\" Without using either\nof those terms, the substance of the reply plainly invokes both\nforms of personal jurisdiction.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1088-89.    The relatedness requirement is not\n\nan open door; it is closely read, and it requires a showing of a\n\nmaterial   connection.   This    court   \"steadfastly   reject[s]   the\n\nexercise of personal jurisdiction whenever the connection between\n\nthe cause of action and the defendant's forum-state contacts seems\n\nattenuated and indirect.\"   Id. at 1089 (citing Donatelli, 893 F.2d\n\nat 463).   \"Instead, the defendant's in-state conduct must form an\n\n'important, or [at least] material, element of proof' in the\n\nplaintiff's case.\" Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Marino v.\n\nHyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471761\"><a href=\"/opinion/471761/mary-marino-and-thomas-marino-v-hyatt-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (1st Cir. 1986)).     A broad \"but-for\"\n\nargument is generally insufficient.      Because \"'but for' events can\n\nbe very remote, . . . due process demands something like a\n\n'proximate cause' nexus.\"   Cambridge Literary Props., 295 F.3d at\n\n65.   And although \"strict adherence to a proximate cause standard\n\nin all circumstances is unnecessarily restrictive,\" in most cases\n\n\"the proximate cause standard better comports with the relatedness\n\ninquiry because it so easily correlates to foreseeability, a\n\nsignificant component of the jurisdictional inquiry.\" Nowak v.

In sum, although proximate causation is not\n\na per se requirement of specific jurisdiction, its presence or\n\nabsence is still important.     Id. at 715-16.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f          iii. Timing of Contacts -- Specific Jurisdiction\n\n          There is a preliminary question regarding the universe of\n\nfacts pertinent to the specific jurisdiction analysis.         Three key\n\nthemes of specific jurisdiction analysis require that the proper\n\nfocus be on those contacts leading up to and surrounding the\n\nclaimed injury which are related to the alleged malpractice. Those\n\nthree concepts are that there be fair notice to the defendant, that\n\nthe defendant must have purposefully availed itself of the forum\n\nstate, and that the forum-based activity be truly related to the\n\ncause of action.   The bulk of Harlow's post-tort evidence of the\n\nHospital's activity in Maine is simply not related at all to the\n\nalleged malpractice.\n\n          As to the time frame for evidence, we have rejected an\n\nargument from a defendant that specific jurisdiction should be\n\nmeasured by contacts after the alleged wrongdoing, where those\n\ncontacts were more limited than those at the time of the event.\n\nSee Cambridge Literary Props., 295 F.3d at 66 (\"[F]or purposes of\n\nspecific jurisdiction, contacts should be judged when the cause of\n\naction arose, regardless of a later lessening or withdrawal.\").        A\n\ndefendant cannot avoid jurisdiction by shrinking its contacts with\n\nthe forum after the tort.\n\n          This   case   presents   the    mirror-image   question.   The\n\ndistrict court understood Harlow, the plaintiff, to be asking that\n\nspecific jurisdiction be measured in part by contacts after the\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fcause of action arose, when those later contacts with the forum\n\nstate   increased.    This   presents    a   slightly   different   set   of\n\nproblems -- particularly as to fair notice to the defendant,\n\npurposeful availment, and relatedness.\n\n           These three concepts are all related, and they mean that\n\nin analyzing specific jurisdiction, contacts must generally be\n\nlimited to those before and surrounding the accrual of the cause of\n\naction. This court has noted, for instance, that \"'foreseeability'\n\nand 'purposeful availment' bear a family resemblance (the former\n\ndefining the latter to a considerable extent),\" Donatelli, 893 F.2d\n\nat 464, and that \"foreseeability is critical\" in analyzing the\n\nrelatedness requirement, Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1089.             At\n\nheart, these concepts are all designed to ensure that exercises of\n\njurisdiction comport with due process.           The Due Process Clause\n\nrequires fair warning as to where individuals' conduct will subject\n\nthem to suit, and for purposes of specific jurisdiction, \"this\n\n'fair warning' requirement is satisfied if the defendant has\n\n'purposefully directed' his activities at residents of the forum,\n\nand the litigation results from alleged injuries that 'arise out of\n\nor relate to' those activities.\"        Burger King Corp. v.

Because causation is central to the\n\nrelatedness inquiry, see, e.g., Nowak, 94 F.3d at 714-16; Pleasant\n\nStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1089, in most cases, contacts coming into\n\nexistence after the cause of action arose will not be relevant.\n\n            iv. Analysis\n\n            Harlow's argument in support of specific jurisdiction is\n\nthat \"[s]imply stated, but for Children's Hospital's contacts with\n\nthe State of Maine, Danielle Harlow never would have undergone the\n\nsurgical procedure that she did, and she never would have suffered\n\nher injuries.\"         Harlow points to the following facts: (1) the\n\nHospital's     staff    communicated     by   telephone   and    by   written\n\ncorrespondence with Harlow's doctor in Maine before and after the\n\nprocedure; (2) the Hospital scheduled the surgery in advance and\n\nknew that Harlow was coming from Maine; (3) Harlow's pediatrician,\n\nwho referred her to the Hospital, was a target of the Hospital's\n\n\"outreach program\"; (4) before the procedure, and during her first\n\nvisit, Harlow's mother informed the Hospital's staff that the\n\nfamily   was    of   modest   means,    and   the   Hospital    responded   by\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fcontacting    Maine      Medicaid   to   obtain    prior    approval      for   the\n\nprocedure; (5) after the procedure, the Hospital arranged for\n\nHarlow to receive inpatient rehabilitation at the Maine Medical\n\nCenter; and (6) a doctor at the Hospital communicated with Harlow's\n\nphysicians in Maine \"on repeated occasions\" and contacted the Maine\n\ngovernment to obtain approval for follow-up care.                 Harlow stresses\n\nthe Hospital's contacts with Maine Medicaid, arguing that those\n\ncontacts     were   financially      beneficial        to   the    Hospital     and\n\nconstituted purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of\n\nMaine law.\n\n           When the post-event evidence unrelated to the alleged\n\nmalpractice is excluded, Harlow has not made out an adequate case\n\nfor specific jurisdiction.          Harlow's \"but-for\" theory -- that but\n\nfor the referral from a Maine pediatrician, the harm would never\n\nhave   happened     --    is   insufficient       to    give      Maine   specific\n\njurisdiction over the Hospital.          The place of the alleged tort was\n\nnot Maine but Massachusetts.             There is no evidence that the\n\nHospital purposefully induced Harlow to leave Maine to come to\n\nMassachusetts.      There is not even any evidence that the Hospital\n\ninduced the pediatrician to refer the patient to Maine.                   That the\n\nreputation and expertise of an institution lead to referrals from\n\nout of state cannot be enough to establish specific jurisdiction.\n\n           Harlow makes much of the uncontested fact that the\n\nHospital was \"well aware that [she] was coming from Maine\" and\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fwould likely return there.      If that rationale -- an out-of-state\n\nplaintiff availing herself of services in Massachusetts -- were\n\nsufficient, then the Hospital would be subject to suit for merely\n\ntaking a patient from elsewhere.      That the consequences of medical\n\ncare remain with a patient throughout her lifetime provides even\n\nless of a basis to assert jurisdiction.          Jurisdiction cannot be\n\ncreated by and does not travel with the plaintiff patient wherever\n\nshe goes.\n\n            The nature of the activity in which the defendant is\n\nengaged   is   important.     The   Hospital   is   not   engaged   in   the\n\ninterstate sale of tangible goods, capable of doing harm elsewhere.\n\nEven if it were, \"'mere awareness' that a product may end up in the\n\nforum state does not constitute 'purposeful availment.'\" Boit, 967\n\nF.2d at 683; id. at 682-83 (discussing Asahi Metal Indus.

Timing of Contacts -- General Jurisdiction\n\n           We first resolve a preliminary matter. At oral argument,\n\nthe parties disputed which time frame of evidence was relevant in\n\ndeciding whether the Hospital's contacts with Maine are sufficient\n\nto justify general jurisdiction.        Harlow argued that for purposes\n\nof general jurisdiction, we should look at the Hospital's contacts\n\nup to the time of the filing of the complaint, well beyond the time\n\nof the alleged tort.       The Hospital relied by analogy on Cambridge\n\nLiterary Properties for the proposition that, even when general\n\njurisdiction is alleged, \"contacts should be judged when the cause\n\nof action arose.\"    295 F.3d at 66.       We disagree with the Hospital.\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fIt is settled law that unrelated contacts which occurred after the\n\ncause of action arose, but before the suit was filed, may be\n\nconsidered for purposes of the general jurisdiction inquiry.\n\n           In Noonan, we expressly rejected the argument now made by\n\nthe Hospital.     See 135 F.3d at 93 n.8 (\"The parties clash over\n\nwhich contacts should be considered in the general jurisdiction\n\nanalysis. . . . [T]hey dispute whether a foreign corporation's\n\ncontacts with the forum should be measured up to the time of the\n\nalleged tort, up to the time the complaint is filed, or at any\n\ntime.

In Helicopteros, where the\n\nhelicopter crash at the center of the lawsuit had occurred in\n\nJanuary 1976, the Supreme Court considered contacts through the\n\nyear 1977.   See 466 U.S. at 410-11.       On the other hand, contacts\n\nafter the filing of the complaint are not considered.            See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Swiss Am.

Wright and\n\nMiller, in discussing this distinction, state:\n\n           As a practical matter, a general jurisdiction\n           inquiry is very different from a specific\n           jurisdiction inquiry.

We repeat\n\nGlater's summary of Seymour, because we are facing an essentially\n\nsimilar fact pattern:\n\n            In Seymour, a manufacturer and distributor of\n            [a] drug was sued in New Hampshire for\n            injuries occurring in Massachusetts.      The\n            defendant maintained no office and engaged in\n            no manufacturing in New Hampshire; it held no\n            property there; it was not registered to do\n            business there.   Its only contacts with New\n            Hampshire consisted of advertising and the\n            activities of a half dozen salesmen, mostly\n            New Hampshire residents, who accepted orders\n            and disseminated product information to New\n            Hampshire physicians, hospitals and retail\n            pharmacies.\n\nId. at 217.\n\n            Harlow argues that a nontrivial number of the Hospital's\n\npatients come from Maine and have their treatment paid for by Maine\n\nMedicaid.    The Hospital points out that using Harlow's figures --\n\nshe alleges that Maine Medicaid pays the Hospital roughly $2\n\nmillion annually, and that the Hospital's total annual revenue is\n\nalmost $400 million -- Maine Medicaid payments account for only\n\n0.5% of the Hospital's revenues.\n\n            Treating patients from Maine in Massachusetts, even on a\n\nregular basis, is not the same as engaging in continuous and\n\n\n                                -31-\n\fsystematic   activity         in   Maine.      A     hospital   that      treats   Maine\n\nresidents    in    Massachusetts        is,    quite       simply,   in   a    different\n\nposition from a hospital that treats Maine residents in Maine, or\n\na firm that sells products to Maine residents in Maine.

As    in   Donatelli,   Maine's\n\n\"sovereignty is not threatened; apart from a generalized concern\n\nfor the rights of its own domiciliaries, the state has no real\n\ninterest in adjudicating the controversy.

Harlow also argues:\n\n\"Whereas litigating this case in Maine will cause little, if any,\n\ninconvenience to the Children's Hospital, Danielle Harlow has no\n\nother forum for her case to be heard.\"                   The argument is exactly\n\nbackwards.      Harlow did have an obvious and readily available forum\n\nin   Massachusetts.         The   fact    that   she     missed   the    statute   of\n\nlimitations in Massachusetts does not add to her argument at all.\n\nTo hold otherwise would encourage plaintiffs to deliberately miss\n\n\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fa statute of limitations for purposes of forum manipulation.10 Such\n\na practice should be discouraged, not rewarded.\n\n          Another interest is at stake -- \"the common interest[] of\n\nall sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.\" Pleasant\n\nStreet I, 960 F.2d at 1088.      This factor weighs against the\n\nreasonableness of exercising personal jurisdiction in Maine.    All\n\nsovereigns share an interest in promoting the social policy of\n\nhaving quality health care available to those who need it.   One way\n\nto promote this policy is to limit the length of time during which\n\nhealth care providers are exposed to lawsuits arising from the care\n\nthey provide.   Here, for instance, Massachusetts has set a three-\n\nyear statute of limitations for malpractice claims against its\n\nhospitals.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 60D.      Maine has a\n\nminimal interest in seeing that this limit be avoided, and the\n\ncommon interest of all sovereigns (including Maine) in seeing that\n\nthis limit be observed is strong, especially in light of the fact\n\nthat the Hospital did not purposefully conduct business in or\n\n\n     10\n        This court has addressed concerns about manipulation and\nstatutes of limitations in other contexts. Cf. Noonan, 135 F.3d at\n95 (discussing, in the context of temporal limitations on\njurisdictional discovery, the risk that \"undesirable exploitation\nof statute of limitations periods\" will occur and that \"[s]avvy\nplaintiffs who wait until the end of the limitations period to\nmaximize the chance of asserting jurisdiction will be rewarded for\ntheir dilatory tactics\"); Seymour, 423 F.2d at 585-86 (exercise of\njurisdiction unfair where \"plaintiff . . . is unconnected with the\nforum and is not 'convenienced' by being able to sue there except\nthat she has lost her right to sue in what would otherwise have\nbeen the fair and convenient state\" because of the expiration of\nthat state's statute of limitations).\n\n                               -36-\n\fspecifically direct its activities toward another state which has\n\na longer statute of limitations.\n\n          As to the disparity in resources, that has little to do\n\nwith due process limits on the extension of long-arm jurisdiction.\n\nThe law is not oblivious to financial considerations.              But even\n\nthough the defendant's burden of appearing and the plaintiff's\n\ninterest in obtaining convenient and effective relief are included\n\namong the \"Gestalt factors\" for the personal jurisdiction analysis,\n\nsee Pleasant Street I, 960 F.2d at 1088, sheer disparity in wealth\n\nis not.\n\n          The argument Harlow raises of relative convenience and\n\nburden is more appropriately dealt with under the law of forum non\n\nconveniens    or   change   of   venue.    Where   a   plaintiff   properly\n\nestablishes jurisdiction in one federal district court, she is free\n\nto argue for a transfer to another federal district court.           See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1404(a) (\"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in\n\nthe interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil\n\naction to any other district or division where it might have been\n\nbrought.\").    Even under the doctrines of forum non conveniens and\n\nchange of venue, it is not clear that sheer disparity in wealth is\n\nlegally relevant, without proof of hardship. See Iragorri v. Int'l\n\nElevator, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198798\"><a href=\"/opinion/198798/iragorri-v-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          In the end, this case is about a patient who lives in\n\nMaine and was referred by a Maine doctor to a hospital in Boston,\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fand who underwent a medical procedure in Boston which gave rise to\n\na cause of action; she returned to Maine and the procedure was paid\n\nfor from Maine.    That cannot be enough to subject the Hospital to\n\nsuit in Maine.    The question is not whether hospitals may be held\n\nresponsible in lawsuits for their activities, but whether they may\n\nbe haled into court out of state because they accept out-of-state\n\npatients.    It would be unreasonable to conclude that they could.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            The district court's order granting the Hospital's motion\n\nto dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is affirmed.
