Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Alan M. Spiro with whom Edwards & Angell, LLP was on brief,\nfor Appellee.\n     Isaac H. Peres for Appellants.\n\n\n                          August 11, 2005\n\f            LYNCH,   Circuit   Judge.   A    series   of   complicated\n\nlitigations worldwide has several claimants seeking a sum of over\n\n$1.6 billion from Christopher Patrick Heron and his associated\n\nentities.     Our issue can be stripped to its essence without\n\nrecounting the details of the drama.\n\n            The district court denied a motion to intervene as of\n\nright brought by Liner and other claimants in a lawsuit which had\n\nbeen brought in Massachusetts federal court against Heron (and\n\nothers) by another claimant, Ewers.         The reason given for the\n\npurported intervention was that if Ewers received the funds he\n\nwould pocket them and disappear, to the claimants' detriment.      All\n\nof the claimants purport to have an interest in any money recovered\n\nfrom Heron (as does Ewers).    One of the claimants, Liner, admitted\n\nhe had at one point given Ewers a power of attorney to seek the\n\nfunds on Liner's behalf, and Ewers argues that under a Compensation\n\nAgreement with Liner, Liner agreed to split 50/50 any recovery that\n\nEwers made from Heron on Liner's behalf.       But Liner has said he\n\nlater cancelled these agreements when Ewers proved to be sneaky and\n\nuntrustworthy.   Ewers has equally unattractive things to say about\n\nLiner.   As for the other claimants, they allege that Ewers entered\n\ninto an agreement with Alexander Pladott, their representative, to\n\ndistribute any money recovered from Heron amongst all of the\n\nclaimants.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            The claimants attempted to intervene, some seven months\n\nafter Ewers had initiated the Massachusetts lawsuit.                      At that\n\npoint, the defendant Heron had defaulted, but no final judgment had\n\nyet entered.\n\n            The district court held a hearing on the motion to\n\nintervene, and ascertained the claimants' interest in the case.\n\nThe court was also told that there were two separate lawsuits\n\npending in Texas, one testing the relative rights between Ewers and\n\nLiner under their agreements and the other testing the relative\n\nrights of Ewers and the other claimants, as represented by Pladott,\n\nto whatever money Ewers recovered from Heron.\n\n            Cutting to the chase, the court asked why, if Liner was\n\n\"concerned that Ewers is going to somehow dissipate these assets,\n\n. . . we can't deal with that . . . by making an order that says\n\nthat    there   needs   to   be   prior    approval    of   the   court   of   any\n\ndisbursements of anything that is recovered.\"               To this eminently\n\npractical suggestion, the claimants responded in essence that they\n\nhad a right to intervene under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) and that\n\nthey were concerned that given what they described as Ewers'\n\npropensity to lie, he would secrete any money recovered. The court\n\nnoted    that   the   Massachusetts       suit   was   virtually   over.       The\n\nclaimants' response was that it would not do any harm to let them\n\nintervene.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            Ewers, in turn, agreed to the proposed order, and said\n\nthat the claimants were really trying to take over and free ride in\n\nthe litigation, which he had fully funded.           He also said that the\n\nclaimants'    motion   was    interfering    with   his   effort    to   get   a\n\njudgment.     Ewers finally argued that the motion to intervene was\n\nnot timely and that allowing intervention would prejudice him.\n\n            The court, noting that it seemed to be in the interests\n\nof the claimants and Ewers to actually collect a judgment as soon\n\nas possible, and then to let the question of appropriate shares be\n\ndecided in Texas, denied the motion to intervene.            It also entered\n\nthis order:\n\n            Counsel shall submit a form of default\n            judgment against all existing defendants that\n            shall include a clause prohibiting plaintiff\n            from disbursing any funds collected without\n            notice to the proposed intervenors and\n            approv[al] by the court.\n\n            That default judgment was never entered.               The parties\n\ntell us this is because the claimants took this appeal.             The appeal\n\nis without merit.\n\n            The   legal      standards     are   familiar.      Denials        of\n\nintervention of right are subject to interlocutory appeal.               Rhode\n\nIsland v. United States EPA, 378 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 2004).              Our\n\nreview of denial of intervention is only for abuse of discretion,\n\nwith closer review when the intervention is of right.              Int'l Paper\n\nCo. v. Town of Jay, 887 F.2d 338, 344 (1st Cir. 1989); see also\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fMaine v. Dir., United States Fish & Wildlife Serv., 262 F.3d 13, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            One way to show such an abuse of discretion is to show\n\nthat the district court ignored the four pertinent legal criteria\n\nthat one must meet in order to intervene under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n24(a)(2):\n\n            (1) the party must claim an interest in the\n            property; (2) disposition of the case without\n            intervention, would, as a practical matter,\n            impair or impede the party's ability to\n            protect that interest;       (3) the party's\n            interest is inadequately represented by the\n            existing parties;    and (4) the motion for\n            intervention is timely made.\n\nUnited States v. 116 Emerson St., 942 F.2d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).   The transcript\n\nof the hearing on the motion to intervene shows the district court\n\nadhered to the criteria.\n\n            Another way to show abuse of discretion is to show the\n\ncourt was just wrong -- it committed clear error in the facts it\n\nfound or was entirely unreasonable in its judgment about applying\n\nthe four criteria to the facts.    This doctrine gives the claimants\n\nno assistance here.\n\n            The motion to intervene was inherently weak on all four\n\ngrounds.    Nonetheless, the district court fashioned an admirable\n\norder protecting the claimants should there be mischief, thus\n\nefficiently accomplishing much of what the claimants sought.     An\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\feminently wise order is not an abuse of discretion.   The district\n\ncourt order denying intervention is affirmed.\n\n          Costs are allowed to Ewers.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

Our review of denial of intervention is only for abuse of discretion, with closer review when the intervention is of right. <i>Int'l Paper Co. v. Town of Jay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530533\"><a href=\"/opinion/530533/international-paper-company-v-the-inhabitants-of-the-town-of-jay-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 344 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also State v.

The transcript of the hearing on the motion to intervene shows the district court adhered to the criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another way to show abuse of discretion is to show the court was just wrong &#8212; it committed clear error in the facts it found or was entirely unreasonable in its judgment about applying the four criteria to the facts. This doctrine gives the claimants no assistance here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to intervene was inherently weak on all four grounds. Nonetheless, the district court fashioned an admirable order protecting the claimants should there be mischief, thus efficiently accomplishing much of what the claimants sought. An eminently wise order is not an abuse of discretion. The district court order denying intervention is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs are allowed to Ewers.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
